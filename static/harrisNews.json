All other culture war nonsense played a role, sure, but in the end, Trump upended the usual campaign dynamics by winning voters making less than $50,000, while former Vice President Kamala Harris won voters making more than $100,000. \n\nThe Democratic Party is now the party of the educated elite, while the Republican Party has become the party of the lower socioeconomic strata. \n\nEven though Trump won white voters handily by 57-42, Harris won college-educated white voters by 53-45, according to 2024 exit polls. Trump also won non-college white voters by 66-32. Overall, Harris won college-educated voters by 56-42 and lost non-college voters by 56-43. \n\nIn other words, Trump voters don’t buy Teslas. So how is this terrible politics for Trump? \n\nTens of millions of Americans voted for Trump because they believed his repeated promises that “Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again.” \n\nInstead, Trump spent Day 1 renaming the Gulf of Mexico and Mount Denali in Alaska, starting nonsensical trade wars with Canada and Mexico, aligning himself with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, firing tens of thousands of government workers, slashing popular government programs—many of which directly benefit his own base—and otherwise doing everything but lower prices. \n\nAnd while he’s certainly full of excuses, none of them are, “Sorry, I got distracted. Let me get back to working on lowering prices.” \n\nIn fact, Trump is full steam ahead on his trade wars and deportation plans, which will only increase prices … by a lot. So now the stock market is tanking and Social Security is at risk.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is hosting Tesla infomercials at the White House to promote Musk’s Tesla vehicles—several of which cost more than $100,000.\n\nEven Trump’s beloved Fox News couldn’t ignore the horrendous optics of this stunt. \n\nTrump said he would buy an $80,000 red Tesla Model S for White House staff, since he doesn’t drive. But how will they charge the car? Trump is literally removing charging stations from all government buildings—just another example of how Trump’s hatred for EVs is in direct conflict with his need to please Musk. \n\nAt the end of the day, Trump doesn’t give a damn about his supporters, much less the broader American people. Of course, no one should be surprised, considering he said on the campaign trail, “I don’t care about you. I just want your vote.”","summary":"President Donald Trump’s ridiculous car salesman schtick at the White House Tuesday made a mockery of the Executive Office.

Yes, that Rahm. And, yes, for that office — the presidency,’ wrote Politico’s senior political columnist Jonathan Martin. \n\nThe first contest of the 2028 Democratic presidential primary is likely almost three years away. \n\nBut the idea of the former Obama official and congressman throwing his name in the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination was not met with open arms online as Democrats are still licking their wounds from the brutal 2024 presidential election.\n\n‘No,’ wrote podcaster Jane Coaston in a post on X responding to the report.\n\n‘Rahm Emanuel is running in 2028. If he’s the candidate I’m leaving the party. I’m not interested in a boring club membership,’ wrote researcher Matt Stoller. \n\n‘Eric Adams, Andrew Cuomo, Rahm Emanuel – they are in the corruption wing of the Dem party,’ posted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez former chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti, who is now running to unseat former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \n\n‘The lesson from Trump cannot be that Dems could win if only they were more corrupt. To make the case against Trump, we must get rid of the corruption in our party, not give more power,’ Chakrabarti wrote.\n\n‘The generation of leaders that got us into this mess will not be the ones to get us out of it,’ wrote Amanda Litman, president of Run for Something which recruits young progressives to run for office. \n\n‘What if the path to Democratic Party renewal was always just to bring back the biggest a**holes, like Rahm and Andrew Cuomo?’ wrote pollster Patrick Ruffini.\n\n‘Rahm Emanuel was a NAFTA architect, cheerleader of the Iraq War, proponent of Wall St dereg that created the financial crisis & mayor whose administration covered up the murder of a teenager. Him being a presidential contender is a perfect commentary on today’s Democratic Party,’ wrote David Sirota, a former senior adviser to Bernie Sanders.\n\nTalk about the 2028 presidential race has been well underway ever since the 2024 election with a number of Democrats being floated as potential contenders.\n\nIf Emanuel were to jump in the race, he could be part of a crowded field as multiple prominent Democrats including governors and lawmakers could launch campaigns. \n\nRecent polling shows former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to President Trump just over four months ago, leads the current pack of possible candidates as she continues to hold greater name recognition nationally.\n\nHarris has not signaled what her future plans are but there has been speculation that she will run for governor of California next year. \n\nHarris reportedly has given herself until the end of the summer to decide whether she will run for governor. \n\nThe move could take her out of the running for a 2028 bid. But even if she were to forgo running for president, the field could still be packed.\n\nWhile the report that Emanuel is gearing up for a presidential bid was met with backlash, there are few Democrats who know more about getting things done in the White House.\n\nThe 65-year-old served as Obama’s chief of staff from January 2009 until October 2010, helping the administration navigate the great recession and passage of the Affordable Care Act. \n\nBefore that, he served three terms in the House. From the Obama administration he went on serve two terms as mayor of Chicago. \n\nBut his tenure there could come back to haunt him in a Democratic presidential primary after he clashed with the powerful Chicago teachers union that went on strike during his first term.\n\nHe also faced harsh criticism for how he handled the killing of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer in 2014.\n\nEmanuel first said he would but then opted not to run for a third term as mayor in 2019 amid low approval ratings.\n\nPresident Biden nominated him to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Japan where he served until just before the start of the Trump administration in January.\n\nNow, he’s back stateside and has been spotted all over the place with a speech before the Economic Club of Chicago, appearances on CNN and writing columns for the Washington Post.\n\nBut in discussing his plans with Politico, Emanuel remained coy. \n\n‘I’ve only been back two months, I have no idea what I’m doing,’ he told Martin.\n\n‘I’m not done with public service and I’m hoping public service is not done with me,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA report that former President Obama&#8217;s former White House Chief of Staff&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Obama&#8217;s preferred candidate faces severe criticism after considering a run against Kamala Harris in the 2028 presidential election first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/obamas-preferred-candidate-faces-severe-criticism-after-considering-a-run-against-kamala-harris-in-the-2028-presidential-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Obama-favorite-gets-brutal-backlash-after-floating.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:47:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":299572388,"title":"Potential Medicaid Cuts Spark Fight Between City Council, Mayor","text":"Potential federal cuts to Medicaid have sparked heated debate between a city council and mayor in Wisconsin, a key battleground state narrowly won by President Donald Trump in November.The Wausau City Council officially voted Tuesday to overturn Mayor Doug Diny's veto that would halt the city from issuing a formal resolution against potential cuts to Medicaid.Why It MattersMore than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care coverage, including many children, pregnant mothers, those with disabilities and seniors with limited income.The current approved Republican budget from the House of Representatives would slash $880 billion from federal health and energy programs from 2025 to 2034. This has sparked concerns that Medicaid would experience the brunt of the budget cuts.What To KnowWausau's City Council overturned Mayor Doug Diny's veto of the city's resolution, expressing their opposition to possible federal cuts to Medicaid.The overturn passed in a 9-0 vote despite Diny's claims that the council should \"stick to city business.\"The city council's position is that Medicaid cuts would be city business, as roughly 25 percent of the population relies on Wisconsin's Medicaid program, BadgerCare.Diny, however, has said the City Council is acting \"at the behest of the Democratic Party,\" in recent statements.Wisconsin flipped Republican in the 2024 presidential election as Trump defeated former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris by just over 29,000 votes.Newsweek reached out to the city council and Diny for comment via email.What People Are SayingWausau Alder Victoria Tierney said, as reported by the Wausau Pilot and Review: \"We're not just talking about people who have access to Medicare. We're talking about people who cannot get health care coverage any other way because their disabilities do not allow them to work. That is people within our city too, which, again, would put a strain on all of our medical services.\"Alder Lou Larson said: \"There is a threat [to Medicaid]. If there wasn't a threat, this wouldn't be here. People thought that Roe v. Wade wouldn't be overturned either. And look where that is today.\"Kevin Thompson, finance expert and founder of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: \"What we're seeing in Wausau is becoming more common across multiple states and at the federal level. As people begin to realize that campaign promises around \"not touching entitlements\" may have been more about winning votes than actual policy, concerns are growing.That said, I haven't seen any specific data showing cuts to any entitlement programs yet, so the jury is still out.\"Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: \"The situation in Wausau is similar to other city and state governments that are growing concerned over proposed cuts to Medicaid and the effect it will have on their populations. Significant cuts could prove disastrous, particularly for governments that have trigger laws that could cause state Medicaid funding to drop off partially or entirely if Federal support drops below a certain level.As a result, some city and state government entities are taking strong stances as an early preventative step to ensure their residents know they're working to maintain these benefits. Whether or not these stances will have any influence on the final budget remains to be seen.\"What Happens NextIf Republicans do reach the nearly $900 billion in cuts from federal health and energy programs, it's likely that some of the programs like Medicaid would come under scrutiny, Thompson said.\"We're already seeing discussions around block grants and work requirements for able-bodied recipients, which could indicate the direction things are headed,\" Thompson said.\"It's tough to say for sure. But if Medicaid does get cut, it could present serious challenges for Republicans in future elections. The question is whether they're willing to take that political risk. Any significant change could shape the future of politics, particularly in battleground states where healthcare is a critical issue.\"","summary":"The current approved Republican budget from the House of Representatives calls to slash $880 billion from federal health and energy programs from 2025 to 2034.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/medicaid-cuts-spark-fight-between-city-council-mayor-2043882","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2606049/budget-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 22:53:46","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":299566688,"title":"List of Celebrities Who Left the US Because of Donald Trump, Politics","text":"Several celebrities have left the United States and moved to different countries, citing President Donald Trump and the current political climate for their departure.Why It MattersBefore the 2016 presidential election, multiple celebrities, including singer Cher and actor Bryan Cranston, criticized Trump and said they would leave the U.S. if he won. While many remained in the U.S., some celebrities did actually move.At least five celebrities who moved outside of the U.S. have expressed concerns about Trump's second term or the government's handling of political issues.Rosie O'DonnellActor Rosie O'Donnell revealed that she moved to Ireland in a TikTok she posted on Tuesday.O'Donnell moved with her 12-year-old child on January 15, five days before Trump's presidential inauguration.\"When, you know, it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there, in America, that's when we will consider coming back,\" O'Donnell said. \"It's been heartbreaking to see what's happening politically and hard for me personally as well.

However, the couple was \"very disillusioned\" with Trump's win and wanted \"to get the hell out.\"DeGeneres voiced her support of Trump's election rival, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, on Instagram in August 2024.DeGeneres put one of her final properties in the U.S. on the market on Tuesday, according to Realtor.com.Minnie DriverActor Minnie Driver returned to London after living in Los Angeles for 27 years, The Times reported in July 2024. The outlet asked Driver if she would return to the U.S. if Trump won a second presidential term.\"If I lived in a red [Republican] state, no, I couldn't,\" she said. \"But living in California, you are somewhat insulated. But do you want to go and live in a bubble? Do you run away from the fire or do you go back and help?\"She criticized the state of U.S. politics, which she described as millions of people \"who really quite like a bit of a racist attitude and non-existent immigration policies and dismantling the environmental agencies.

Josh Shapiro, who was once considered a potential running mate for former Vice President Kamala Harris. In fact, he was such a strong candidate that many saw his inability to secure the nomination as suspicious.\n\nThe legacy media has been all too happy to present Shapiro as a reasonable Democrat who bucks the far Left and gets things done. However, his actual record—and inability to oppose the Left’s radicalism—reveal the truth.\n\nEven in a relatively flattering profile of Shapiro in the Free Press, Sean Patrick Cooper concluded that while Shapiro could make a Bill Clinton-like triangulation to appeal to moderates and pull his party out of its self-created mess, he’s largely been unable to break with the left-wing powers that be.\n\n“The Democratic Party desperately needs a reckoning. It needs someone of stature who will say out loud how profoundly the party has gone astray,” Cooper wrote. “The problem is that Shapiro is unwilling to assume that role.”\n\nCooper also faulted Shapiro for failing to condemn the Left’s antisemitism.\n\nThe problem with Shapiro goes beyond even his inability to publicly stand up to the Left. While the Pennsylvania governor doesn’t use the typical language of the Left on, say, policing, he has generally maintained even its most extreme policy positions.\n\nTake, for instance, transgender men playing in women’s sports. The issue isn’t controversial or “divided,” at least among American voters. The American people are against it by most measures at a nearly 80%-to-20% margin. \n\nThere’s a reason California Gov. Gavin Newsom, another Democrat attempting to make a mostly bogus pivot to the “center,” recently said on his podcast that having men in women’s sports might not be fair.\n\nOf course, Newsom hasn’t made any proposals to change the laws in his state, which is among the most extreme on the transgender issue. Shapiro doesn’t appear to be budging, either.\n\nShapiro has been all for having men in women’s sports. In 2021, when he was attorney general, Shapiro lashed out against a proposed law to keep women’s sports free of biological men. He called the law “cruel” and said that it was “designed to discriminate against transgender youth who just want to play sports like their peers.”\n\nHe also said he’d veto the bill, which tried to keep men out of women’s sports.\n\nAs an aside, I think what’s cruel is allowing a man to spike a volleyball into a woman’s face, leaving her permanently crippled in the name of “tolerance.”\n\nWhen asked Wednesday to comment after school districts and parents sued Pennsylvania to prevent boys from competing in girls’ sports, Shapiro said that Pennsylvania would be “a place that would be warm and welcoming to all.”\n\nHe framed the issue as protecting children.\n\n“I understand that there are those who want to score cheap political points by bullying a trans kid,” Shapiro said.\n\nShapiro’s office told The Daily Signal that the governor’s comment was “very specifically in response to the lawsuit in question,” which took aim at the state’s laws on gender identity.\n\nShapiro has gone even further on the transgender issue in the past.\n\nAccording to an August report in the Daily Caller, Shapiro “collaborated with transgender activists to target professionals who help children resolve gender distress without life-altering medical treatments.”\n\nOn a handful of “bipartisan” issues like school choice, Shapiro has been all talk but little action. In fact, he’s actively torpedoed school choice efforts in Pennsylvania.\n\nFrom my colleague, Tyler O’Neil, who wrote about Shapiro’s record when his name was being floated for VP:\n\nWhile campaigning for governor in 2022, Shapiro pledged to support school choice, supporting the Lifeline scholarship, which would directly fund students, empowering parents to choose the best schools for their kids.\n\nYet when the House of Representatives passed a bill including Lifeline scholarships, Shapiro threatened to veto the very proposal he had campaigned on.\n\nShapiro has used his social media to boost his profile with cringy TikTok-style videos—all the rage among Democrats—and to mock pro-life constituents.\n\nThe pattern is clear, and it applies on the macro scale, too.\n\nAs the Left’s hold on national power crumbles, its political machinery largely remains in place. President Joe Biden ran in 2020 on returning to “normalcy” but ended up governing like a woke radical.\n\nIt seems unlikely a younger, more mentally competent version of that kind of Democrat—who has a history of giving the DNC whatever it wants—will behave much differently.\n\nNothing has really changed other than, at best, rhetoric.\n\nThis article has been updated to include a comment from the office of Gov. Josh Shapiro.","summary":"The cultural&#160;“vibe shift” to the Right&#160;is real, but the Left continues to have a firm grip on the Democrat Party. As many Democrat wannabe influencers...

CBS News published a story headlined, \"She advanced DEI at her university. Her son-in-law, Vice President JD Vance, wants to end it nationwide,\" that put a spotlight on Lakshmi Chilukuri, the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College, who is also Vance’s mother-in-law and the mother of second lady Usha Vance. \"Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity,\" CBS News reporters Graham Kates and Daniel Klaidman wrote.

If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance added. \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. NEW STUDY REVEALS 'STAGGERING' SCOPE OF HOW MUCH DEI WAS INFUSED INTO GOVERNMENT UNDER BIDEN Vance also told CBS that he chooses to focus on Chilukuri’s \"kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\" The CBS News piece went on to say that the \"Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding,\" and noted that Vance \"has been vocal about combatting DEI.\" Indeed, the Trump administration has made it a top priority to rid DEI from the federal bureaucracy and the president has signed multiple executive orders aimed at addressing what it argues is a practice that does more harm than good by ignoring meritocracy. CBS also admitted its own parent company has ditched DEI initiatives since Trump took office.

Its four parts divide 24 chapters into roughly chronological eras.\n\nThe book opens with the Spanish conquistadors, the Gold Rush, statehood, the era of railroad barons and the early battles over land and water. Its second half includes the rise of Los Angeles and Hollywood, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during WWII and the post-war boom. It ends with chapters that cover the ’60s under governors Pat Brown and Ronald Reagan and later crises of racial strife, environmental disaster, and rampant growth.\n\nIt’s a remarkable journey through the people, places and events that shaped California, and it underscores the premise of his original pitch: California has kept its place in the popular imagination more consistently than almost anywhere else.\n\n“There’s been this fascination with California even before it was known as California,” says Hiltzik, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and columnist for the Los Angeles Times and author of seven other non-fiction books. “The conquistadors were looking for gold and the passage (to Asia), for the straits of Anián and beyond, as they called it.\n\n“The quest for riches – for wealth – motivated a lot of interest in California in that era,” he says. “And then the fact that it always seemed to be a place apart. A place with great natural beauty, natural wealth.\n\n“It seemed to fascinate outsiders, really, from the 1500s or 1600s right on to the present day.”\n\nThe Gold Rush and the completion of the transcontinental railroad, natural beauties such as Yosemite, the rise of the Hollywood dream factories, fruitful agricultural bounties, and the inventive entrepreneurship that led to the birth of Silicon Valley all get their moments in the pages of “Golden State.”\n\n“There were different aspects of California that attracted people from outside of different eras,” Hiltzik says. “But there was always something, and I think there always will be.”\n\nIn an interview edited for clarity and length, Hiltzik touched on a variety of topics including the vivid historic personages he encountered in his research, the ways in which California has influenced the nation in ways both positive and negative, and what he thinks about the state’s ability to keep its role in the world’s imagination going forward.\n\nQ: Let’s start with how you decided to do a book on the history of California – not a particularly small topic.\n\nA: Three of my previous books were California-oriented. I’m thinking of Xerox PARC and the beginning of Silicon Valley. My book about Hoover Dam. The dam is on the border between Nevada and Arizona, but it was very much a California (project). And then I wrote about Ernest Lawrence and his remaking of physics at Berkeley.\n\nQ: Starting with that base of knowledge, how did you go about researching the histories that were not part of those books? And where did you go to find it?\n\nA: UC Irvine was sort of my research home for several of my books, because as a resident of Orange County, or resident of California, I could pay for the rights to take books out. And the library at UCI is so good it was rare that I would go looking for something and couldn’t find it. I have friends at the Huntington Library and they were a big help. The Bancroft (Library at University of California, Berkeley) I knew well because Ernest Lawrence’s papers are there.\n\nThen, you know, Kevin Starr‘s books and Carey McWilliams’ books were sort of guideposts to me. As I came to decide on the episodes and the characters I wanted to delve into, I could go to them and use them as sort of tip sheets. I would spend more time with the bibliographies than sometimes the text itself.\n\nSo one thing leads to another. I’d start with some archival research and I would find mentions of other things and seek them out. Every book has its own challenges and problems to solve, and in this one, the challenge was being able to fit everything I wanted to write about in the space that the publishers limited me to. I gave them more than they contracted for, but happily almost everything stayed in.\n\nQ: I loved reading the voices of real people quoted from letters, diaries and contemporaneous newspaper accounts. What’s it like to be deep in the history and hear those voices from 100, 150, 175 years or more ago?\n\nA: It brought me into, as you glean, sort of a personal relationship with some of these characters. Some were really entertaining. Some were just instructive. You could get a feel for the conflicts that they were living through within their lives.\n\nI had access through archival books and secondary sources that would reprint primary sources. There’s a really great book that was sort of a compendium of primary materials from the Spanish era, the conquistador era, the Mexican era.\n\nThere were any number of memoirs. John Fremont [a U.S. Army officer, explorer, and one of California’s first U.S. senators after statehood] wrote a memoir, and though it’s not always the most trustworthy, his voice is very strong.\n\nMany of those who were in conflict with him wrote their own memoirs as counterpoints to how he had described his role in basically achieving, as he put it, the independence of California. Then some other figures who thought they were the masters of bringing California independence wrote their own memoirs to say, “No, it was me. It wasn’t Fremont.”\n\nI should say, too, that [early California historian Hubert Howe] Bancroft himself, his history of California runs to seven volumes. There’s been sort of a revisionist view of Bancroft, but he basically notated everything that he used, and that was a great source. In Bancroft, his view of California was relevant in terms of how the state’s history was viewed at the time that he was writing.\n\nSo yeah, it was great fun. What you want when you’re taking on a project that’s going to take three or four years is for it to get richer as you get deeper into it. And that was the case with this one.\n\nQ: Are there examples of people who surprised you as you dug into the history?\n\nA: The voices of the participants in the Bear Flag Revolt [in which American immigrants overthrew the Mexican government in Sonoma, a precursor to the U.S annexation of California] were fascinating. So many of them went on to make their way in newly independent California between the Bear Flag Revolt and statehood.\n\n[James] Marshall, who discovered gold [at John Sutter’s mill in Coloma, triggering the Gold Rush] and Sutter wrote accounts of discovery. Sutter went on to write about the consequences for him of the discovery of gold. For him, it was not all happy. General [William Tecumseh] Sherman, who was head of the militia for a while in California, wrote a memoir, and that’s very vivid.\n\nIt may be that the most striking material I found, which when I talk about it still tends to surprise listeners and readers, was the testimony that was given to a congressional committee that came out here to work out how to relocate and incarcerate the Japanese population in 1942. The attorney general at that time delivered testimony to the committee that was incredibly vivid and really vile in ways. And that was Earl Warren [the future liberal chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court].\n\nQ: After the Gold Rush and the railroad, people started coming to California from all over the world and never really stopped.\n\nA: It’s so big, and it’s got so much weight in terms of politics and culture and economics that its grasp on the attention of outsiders never has seemed to end. I quote Joan Didion saying that those who came to California were not the complacent people. They were those who were looking for something new. They were looking for adventure or they were looking for a way to remake their life, remake their identity.\n\nIt was apart from the rest of the county. There it is on the edge, the western edge of America. So it attracted people from the Orient and attracted people from the interior and the East. It always has seemed to have something.\n\nQ: We’ve talked about how California has had this grasp on the popular imagination. As the state turns 175 this year, do you think it will continue to hold that place in the country and world in the future?\n\nA: You know, it’s hard to imagine another state having it. I think I have a line in the prologue that California is one of the few places on earth that’s both a geographic location and a state of mind. And California’s role as a state of mind evolves over the decades, over the centuries.\n\nIn fact, when I talk about my initial idea being we’re going to look at what California has taught the nation and the world, sometimes some of what California has taught the outside world isn’t always what we want the outside world to know. We are seen as a beacon of progressive politics now, and we were seen as a beacon of progressive politics in the first decade of the 20th century, but interspersed in there California was a beacon of other things. Of conservatism, of racism.\n\nWill California values continue to be progressive values? Well, they are for now. We don’t know what the future holds, but we’ve given the country Hiram Johnson [an early 20th century progressive governor] and Jerry Brown and Kamala Harris. But also Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. The Reagan and Nixon years, they basically built their careers on the attraction that California had, but their values were very different from the way we think of California values today.\n\nSo I don’t think it will lose its role as an attraction. But what attracts people may be very different as we evolve.\n\nQ: The current Trump administration seems hostile to California for its progressive values, with threats to withhold federal aid to help rebuild after this year’s wildfires.\n\nA: Well, California values are diametrically opposed to the values of Trump and the values of, let’s say, red states. I make the point in the book that red state politicians love to run against California and sort of treat it as the epitome of leftist politics.\n\nAt this point, California is determined to protect women’s reproductive health rights, gender rights, LGBTQ rights. And it’s the tendency of conservative politicians and Trump to portray California as un-American or non-American.\n\nThe point I make is that one out of every eight Americans lives in California. So in a very real sense, this is America. Other issues that bubble up around the country come to California one way or another and California solutions, because it’s such a big state, become national solutions.","summary":"The meticulously research book presents an unvarnished look at the good times and bad days in the Golden State which celebrates 175 years of statehood this year.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/12/in-golden-state-michael-hiltzik-examines-californias-history-and-influence/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LDN-L-BOOK-HILTZIK-0309-20-1.jpg?w=1024&h=579","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 21:14:33","author":"Peter Larsen","authors":["Peter Larsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.657},{"id":299548832,"title":"Washington Post columnist of 41 years quits in tantrum after new boss spiked op-ed complaining about Jeff Bezos","text":"A veteran Washington Post columnist has quit the newspaper after 41 years because bosses wouldn't let her publish a piece slamming owner Jeff Bezos - and she's taken the story elsewhere. \n\nIn a scorched earth essay for rival outlet The New Yorker, Ruth Marcus explained why she quit. \n\nShe'd wanted to publish a long-winded piece complaining about how Bezos was interfering with editorial process. \n\nNew boss Will Lewis wouldn't let her - so she handed in her resignation. \n\nThe New Yorker published the op-ed along with her essay, in which she says her complaints were 'meek' to the point of embarrassing.\n\n'I thought that it was important to put my reasons for disagreement on the record,' Marcus said.\n\nShe then complained about journalistic freedoms being 'dangerously eroded' under Bezos and Lewis.\n\n'I love the Post.

Even during his prior presidency and in his capacity as a private individual, Trump used to employ the stock market as a measure of criticism for others, as per Independent. He had also warned that if former vice president Kamala Harris became the president, the United States would experience another crash like the Great Depression, the Independent reported. Trump claimed during his campaign in August, “We are going to have a crash and we’re going to have a crash like a 1929 crash if she gets in,” the Independent quoted. In a 2012 social media X post, Trump had claimed that, “If the Dow drops 1,000 points in two days the President should be impeached immediately!” as quoted by the Independent. While this post had been deleted, he had been critical of the stock market in various other posts.Taking Credit for Stock Market RalliesThroughout his first term, Trump constantly bragged about the highs of the stock market, as per the report. In a 2017 post, he wrote, “Highest stock market EVER,’’ as quoted by Independent. Trump also claimed in 2018 that, “The Stock Market just reached an All-Time High during my Administration for the 102nd Time a presidential record by far for less than two years,” as quoted in the report.Trump also took credit for stock rallies, stating that the stock market would have been in trouble if his political rivals had won, as per the report. In 2019, he posted that, “Trump stock market rally is far outpacing past US presidents,” as quoted by Independent.Trump's Changing ToneHowever, the US president's attitude toward the stock market appeared to flip entirely in a matter of weeks after his second term started. While even on the eve of his inauguration, he attributed the increase in stocks to the “Trump effect,” the Independent reported.Even during an investor conference on February 19, Trump had claimed, “The stock market is going to be great,” as quoted by the Independent.But his stance changed when Trump indicated he would not be backing down with his aggressive trade tariffs, according to the report. He claimed, “What I have to do is build a strong country,” as quoted by the report. Trump also declared that, “You can’t really watch the stock market,” as quoted by the Independent.FAQsWhat did Trump say about Kamala Harris during his campaign?

Much hard work is still to be done. Russia must be won over. Although Trump has seen encouraging signals from Moscow, he said on Wednesday that “a positive message means nothing.”\n\nReal progress requires not vapors but solid compromise from President Vladimir Putin of a type he has not yet even suggested, even while he is pocketing Trump’s preconcessions about keeping territory conquered in three years of Russia’s imperial war of aggression. (It should be noted that in allowing this, Trump is following former President Barack Obama, who let Russia annex Crimea in 2014). \n\nTo force the Kremlin to agree to what Ukraine can also accept, to bridge that gap, Trump will have to show he is willing to turn the screws of economic sanctions so tight on Putin that acquiescence is more attractive to him than continued recalcitrance. Trump has the cards, but will he play them?\n\nWhat is unclear and interesting is the question of what made Ukraine agree, as it has unofficially, to give up more of its land permanently in exchange for peace. Several irreducible facts played a part. Ukraine is weaker than Russia, millions of its people have been killed, injured, kidnapped, or displaced, its cities and infrastructure lie in partial ruins, and it can’t fight without foreign armaments and money. All this confirms what Trump shockingly said in his Oval Office confrontation two weeks ago, that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky does not “have the cards.”\n\nBut was it just the facts on the ground that switched Zelensky from trying to dictate the terms of U.S. involvement in the war to a more pliant stance? Or was it partly the public brutality to which Trump and Vice President JD Vance subjected him? Their stunning accusation that he started the war, that he was ungrateful, disrespectful, and needed to change his attitude always seemed to be a show of contempt and indifference to soften him up, to make him submit. So, too, did Trump’s decision to cut off aid and military intelligence, which were presented from the outset as temporary punishment contingent on Ukraine’s behavior.\n\nThe usual suspects reflexively accused Trump of being a Russian stooge, a would-be strongman who sucks up to tyrants, etc. But perhaps it took brutal public comments to push Ukraine to where it needs to be on negotiations.\n\nTrump’s public brutality undermines the international prestige of, and respect for, America as a beacon of democracy and principle. That is an absolute and undeniable loss. But it is nevertheless also arguably an effective way of proceeding amid new international realities that Trump is not creating, as his critics imply, but recognizing and adapting to. \n\nIs there any chance that Ukraine and Russia would now be heading for peace negotiations if Kamala Harris or Joe Biden were in the Oval Office paying continued lip service to an old order that they failed to recognize has ended?\n\nAs with Ukraine, so also with Trump’s decision to charge into trade war. His rhetoric on tariffs — imposing, suspending, and escalating them in varied order and without pausing for breath — make it impossible to know what administration policy is from one moment to the next. It is different today than yesterday and will be different again tomorrow.\n\nWorking out policy used to be done behind closed doors, but not anymore. After musing publicly, on Sunday TV about whether he will impose higher tariffs or will lower them, and about whether there will be a recession, Trump doubled down on the uncertainty he has created by talking to reporters on Air Force One. He talked of hating to make predictions and of a period of “transition.” This spooked investors and businesses, and crushed stock prices as soon as markets opened on Monday. \n\nSimilar confusion covers Washington. Sometimes Trump’s trade war is supposedly a negotiating tool, but sometimes he presents it as a long-term source of revenue, even a replacement for the income tax. On Air Force One, he told reporters, “We are going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.” That doesn’t sound like a temporary negotiating position.\n\nIf public threats, tariffs that last a day and then disappear, and the confusion and contempt for allies sown by Trump, eventually produce better terms of trade, it will be arguable that what we are seeing now was always clever stuff at the White House.\n\nBut even if one gives the benefit of considerable doubt to Trump in this matter, it is surely a worrying wager. It bets the certainties of current financial harm, economic anxiety, and weakened international trust against the possibility of future improvement in terms of trade.\n\nSaying the quiet part out loud raises the stakes. That is what Trump does. Unlike everyone else, his tolerance of uncertainty and risk is apparently limitless.","summary":"President Donald Trump says the quiet part out loud.

Josh Shapiro by the private nonprofit watchdog group Government Accountability and Oversight, and shared wth The Daily Signal. \n\nThe documents offer a potential glimpse for what’s ahead as Democrat-run states prepare to clash with the federal government. The organization laying out the strategy is run by a host of former staffers for Democrat governors and liberal organizations including NARAL Pro-Choice America, Demos, and Common Cause. \n\nThe “Firewall for Freedom – Template Gubernatorial Executive Order” directs that “no state agency, employee, or agent may comply with a request for information or assistance if they have reason to believe the request is in furtherance of any investigation, arrest, prosecution, or other sanction of conduct initiated by federal authorities or out-of-state authorities.” \n\nThis includes no assistance to federal officials regarding “health care services … lawful under state law;” and no assistance to the federal government to “identify or apprehend a person in order to subject them to civil immigration detention, removal, or deportation proceedings,” or “to prosecute a person or persons for offenses related to immigration status.”\n\nWhile the descriptions for “health care services” aren’t explicit, elsewhere in the documents, the group references abortion and “gender affirming care,” a phrase used to describe surgical sex operations.\n\n“What leaps out is not just the sheer number of consultants being provided by donors for governors willing to serve the donors’ resistance agenda, but the functions they are serving: drafting executive orders, talking points, and white papers to assist in resistance advocacy … up to and including deploying the National Guard,” Chris Horner, a lawyer for Government Accountability and Oversight, told The Daily Signal.\n\nIn a Dec. 12 email to the staffs of governors’ offices, Emma Clough, special assistant to Governors Action Alliance CEO Julia Spiegel, wrote: “Please join for a briefing on executive actions governors can take to protect sensitive data and prepare for potential National Guard deployments.”\n\nThe model executive order on the National Guard says, “No assistance to deployments over objection of the office of the governor.” The draft order says state employees “shall provide no time, money, facilities, property, equipment, personnel, or other resources for purposes of: assistance to any National Guard unit of another state that is deployed to this state, if the Office of the Governor of [this state] has objected to such deployment.” \n\nA Dec. 3 email from Spiegel to governors’ offices offers staff assistance, including a former Democrat Senate aide who “has offered white glove service to support staffing efforts at the state level (gov offices and agencies).” The guidance further says that American Civil Liberties Union national support staff would be available to help. \n\nIt’s not clear yet if any Democrat governors have enacted executive actions based on the template. \n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis are the co-chairs of Governors Safeguarding Democracy. \n\nNeither has signed such an executive order, though Pritzker has supported Illinois’ litigation against Trump’s immigration policies and said Trump administration officials “are threatening people. We’re just standing up for people who live in our state and in our city.” \n\nPolis, meanwhile, has reportedly backed elements of Trump’s plans to deport illegal immigrants. Neither the office of Pritzker nor Polis responded to inquiries for this story. \n\nWashington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed an executive order to create a rapid response team coordinating state agencies to respond to Trump’s enforcement of immigration law. However, the order doesn’t mirror the Governors Action Alliance template executive order. Ferguson’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. \n\nShapiro’s office, which provided the documents to Government Accountability and Oversight, also did not respond to an inquiry for this story. \n\nNeither Spiegel, the CEO of Governors Action Alliance, nor Allegra Chapman, the managing director of Governors Safeguarding Democracy, responded to inquiries from The Daily Signal for this story. A spokesperson for the group also did not respond. \n\nSpiegel is a former legal counsel for Calfornia Gov. Gavin Newsom. Chapman is a former assistant attorney general under then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Emily Kirby, the the Governors Action Alliance director for legal strategy and policy, is a former general counsel for North Carolina’s Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper. The alliance’s director of external affairs, Kristin Ford, previously worked for then-Calfornia Attorney General Kamala Harris, as a deputy communications director.\n\nIn a Jan. 19 email to Democrat governors’ offices one day before Trump was sworn in, Chapman promoted a briefing that included personnel from at least two organizations that have consistently sued the new Trump administration. \n\nThe briefing was titled, “What Governors Need to Know, with Norm Eisen.” Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, is the founder of the State Democracy Defenders Fund and said his group planned more than 100 lawsuits against Trump this year.\n\nAmong the “suggested talking points” Chapman listed for governors included pragmatic sentiment, such as: “Our immigration system is deeply broken. … The last thing we need is another four years of chaos and bad judgment under President Trump.” \n\nOther points were more partisan, such as: “Trump Republican immigration extremism is targeting trusted members of our communities. … This chaos is tearing families apart.”\n\nThe Governors Action Alliance is a project of the Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a left-leaning advocacy group that has given grants to liberal groups advocating for gun control and stronger environmental regulations, according to the Capital Research Center, a think tank that monitors nonprofits. The Governors Action Alliance received $500,000 last year from liberal billionaire Pierre Omidyar’s group, the Democracy Fund. The Governors Action Alliance seven-member advisory board is mostly Democrat, but does include two anti-Trump former Republican governors—Arne Carlson of Minnesota and William Weld of Massachusetts.

Biden took office when large parts of the American economy were demobilized by Covid restrictions, while other sectors and the government continued generating income for consumers who, in Covid days, had no convenient way to spend it all.\n\nTo that unique situation, Biden responded in line with traditional Democrats’ “tendentious history.” For them, it’s always 1933. The economy has stalled because consumer demand has failed, and the solution is to stimulate demand with large injections of government cash and the creation of government jobs.\n\nActually, that’s not what Franklin Roosevelt did. His first New Deal (1933-35) tried to freeze the economy in place by propping up prices and wages, and only after that became impracticable did his Second New Deal (1935-37) seek to redistribute income. But that resulted in “the Roosevelt recession” (1937-38), and the economy was revived when Roosevelt, convinced that Hitler was a menace, increased military and defense spending.\n\nBiden didn’t follow that course—he cut rather than increased defense spending—nor did he copy the 1963-64 Kennedy-Johnson tax cut, which produced the gush of revenues that, for a while, simultaneously financed the Great Society and the Vietnam War.\n\nInstead, Biden flooded with cash an already cash-flooded economy, despite the warnings of top Democratic economists Larry Summers and Jason Furman. The sharp resulting inflation was just “transitory,” Biden apologists insisted, and indeed the rate of inflation slackened. But prices never went back down, and voters remembered in 2024.\n\nDonald Trump’s “tendentious history” is all about ”a beautiful word” — tariffs. Make consumers pay more for goods from abroad, the theory goes, and factories and jobs will spring up in America.\n\nTariff boosters claim Alexander Hamilton as their progenitor, but he instituted low tariffs primarily because, with eighteenth-century technology and imports arriving only in a few ports, they were the easiest taxes for a small federal government to collect. From his time, except during the Civil War, tariffs and alcohol taxes mostly paid for the federal government until the passage of the income tax and Prohibition in the 1910s.\n\nTrump likes to cite William McKinley, who, as House Ways and Means chairman, sponsored a tariff bill in 1890. But as president from 1897 to 1901, McKinley recognized that American industry was no longer an infant in need of protection: The United States was the leading steel and soon would be the leading auto producer. Just before his assassination by an anarchist, he was about to propose reciprocal tariff-cutting agreements with other nations.\n\nLater Republican presidents regretted that tariff bills had become political pork, much like some of the stuff DOGE is now targeting. After the Smoot-Hawley tariff (1930) helped usher in the Depression, a Democratic Congress voted to let the president, actually, Secretary of State Cordell Hull, set tariff rates. This policy had bipartisan support after World War II and helped produce the postwar and 1980s and 1990s booms.\n\nThis week, Trump’s tariffophilia has been directed not against China or Europe but against Mexico and Canada, despite the USMCA he negotiated in 2018 to replace the 1994 NAFTA. He suddenly imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel and raised that to 50% after Ontario Premier Doug Ford placed a 25% increase on sales of electricity to New York, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n\nFord and Trump backed down, but not before stock market prices had fallen sharply and Wall Street and political reporters started speculating that Trump tariffs and uncertainty about them, coupled with indications of weak job growth, could push the U.S. economy into recession. Free market economists joined Summers in arguing that tariffs, by imposing costs on consumers, dampen and sometimes stifle economic growth.\n\nTrump admitted, “There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant has called tariffs “a one-time price disturbance.” This sounds no more reassuring than Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s 2021 assurance that Biden-sparked inflation was “transitory.”\n\nMarkets hate uncertainty. Trump’s repeated threats, hour-by-hour changes in policy, and repeated insults that Canada should become the 51st state have done the opposite of setting the stable policy framework that investors seek. He risks catastrophic disruption of relations with Canada, with whom our relations, except long-standing arguments over softwood lumber and dairy, have been excellent and our economies intertwined.\n\nTRUMP’S TARIFF THEORY OF THE CASE\n\nThis is especially the case for Detroit-based auto manufacturers, whose supply chains span Michigan, Ontario, Ohio, and Indiana. Canada is currently paying 20 States all the $6.4 billion cost for the construction of the Gordie Howe Bridge over the Detroit River, over which one-fifth of its foreign trade passes. Non-tendentious history tells us that the auto companies and the United Auto Workers pushed for the 1965 U.S.-Canada Auto Parts Agreement, the ancestor of NAFTA and USMCA.\n\nThe non-tendentious lesson from that history is that heedlessly cutting off and restoring the flow of trade between the U.S. and Canada is an act of economic vandalism and that a “little disturbance,” like “transitory” inflation, could turn out to be political malpractice.","summary":"Will the second Trump administration come undone by an economic policy based on what the British military historian Lawrence Freedman, describing Vladimir Putin&#8216;s rationale for invading Ukraine, calls “tendentious history”?

PRICE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession and brushed aside the stock market sell-off, going so far as to say, “You can’t really watch the stock market.” That’s a new message from a leader who has frequently pointed to the market’s ups and downs as a reflection of himself and his activities, even when he was not in power.\n\nOver the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed.\n\nA look at some of Trump’s observations on the stock market over the last year:\n\n“THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET BECAUSE MY POLLS AGAINST BIDEN ARE SO GOOD THAT INVESTORS ARE PROJECTING THAT I WILL WIN, AND THAT WILL DRIVE THE MARKET UP — EVERYTHING ELSE IS TERRIBLE (WATCH THE MIDDLE EAST!), AND RECORD SETTING INFLATION HAS ALREADY TAKEN ITS TOLL. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”\n\n“High Interest Rates and Inflation are choking our great middle class, and ALL, our Economy is bad, and our Stock Market is rising only because Polls are strongly indicating that we will WIN the Presidential Election of 2024.”\n\n“The stock market is, in a sense, crashing.

Brookings Institution analysis found that a few sectors are most at risk from these tariffs, such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy industries, according to the Washington Post.Job Losses Threaten Key American SectorsThe most affected regions are likely to be the Midwest, where tariff retaliation hits food production, and the South, where the manufacturing industry may take the hit, the Washington Post reported. Even areas such as southern West Virginia, with high levels of mining employment, are more likely to be affected due to the trade war, the Washington Post reported.A large number of the workers impacted by these tariffs reside in states that voted for US president Donald Trump. Approximately 3 million individuals, who voted for Trump, work in sectors directly hit by retaliatory tariffs, compared to around 2 million workers, who voted for former vice president Kamala Harris.Robert Maxim, a Brookings Metro fellow who contributed to the analysis, claimed, “There’s definitely a bias towards Republican-voting areas,” adding that, “I don’t think that’s a coincidence. China and Canada know what they’re doing,” as quoted by Washington Post.The Political Impact of TariffsChina's and Canada's tariffs are aimed to target not only the American economy but also send a political signal, as per the report. China imposed a 15% tax on US agricultural products such as soybeans, meat, and grains, directly affecting 1.3 million American labourers, Washington Post reported. Last month, China set levies on US coal and liquefied natural gas, agricultural equipment, and crude oil, which employ 600,000 Americans workers, as per the report.While, Canada's retaliatory tariffs include imposing a 25% duty on products from both the manufacturing and agricultural industries, potentially impacting 4.8 million US workers, Washington Post reported. Rural Communities Bear the Brunt The Brookings analysis revealed the disproportionate effect that these tariffs have on rural populations, where mining and agriculture are significant employers, according to the report. For example, Sargent County in North Dakota has over 60% of its workforce working in sectors at risk from these tariffs, Washington Post reported. The analysis found that these industries employed 7.5% of staff in nonmetropolitan areas, compared with 3.2% of staff in metropolitan areas, as per the Washington Post.The report also found that the farming industry will be the most impacted due to the trade war. The counter-tariffs imposed by China and Canada will reduce the ability to sell crops abroad, while a 10% US tariff on Canadian fertilizer will increase the cost of production, the Washington Post reported.FAQsHow many American jobs are at risk?More than 5 million American jobs are at risk because of the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Canada, the Washington Post reported.Are there certain states more affected by the tariffs?Yes, states that voted for President Donald Trump are more likely to have workers in industries impacted by retaliatory tariffs. About 3 million people in Trump-voting counties are at risk.","summary":"The US-initiated trade war could impact over 5 million American jobs due to retaliatory tariffs from China and Canada. Key sectors at risk include agriculture, manufacturing, and energy industries, affecting regions like the Midwest and South. Rural areas suffer disproportionately, especially in mining and agriculture.

Schulz, whose interview with Trump during the campaign was one of many pivotal podcast interviews for the president, told Charlamagne on \"The Breakfast Club\" Monday that the challenge facing Democrats right now is finding their equivalent rallying cry, like \"build the wall,\" that taps into Americans’ economic concerns. \"If they make it a class issue, they win this election pretty easily, come the next election, but they're afraid to do that because a lot of them are in the pockets of the billionaire class and the corporations, so they make it about identity politics,\" he said. Schulz further argued that many Democrats that go to Ivy League universities \"pretend to give a f--- about you guys. They don’t actually give a f--- about you guys, but they get patted on the back for pretending to do it.\" In the wake of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to President Donald Trump, the Democratic Party remains in flux over not only how to criticize the new president, but the course of their own party.

POLLSTER WARNS DEMOCRATS' 'AMATEURISH' ANTI-TRUMP ANTICS ARE 'TANKING' WITH AMERICANS Charlamagne recalled Newsom’s recent interview, saying the blue state governor proved his point about this by speaking in politically moderate terms with TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk. \"He wants it so bad, bro. That motherf---er is thirsty,\" Schulz joked. \"Exactly,\" Charlamagne agreed, \"But you see how quick he is to distance himself from trans athletes and stuff like that, so now it's like, ‘Oh so you never cared, you never gave a f---. It was just all about politics for you.\" Charlamagne went on to suggest that Democrats have still failed to find their footing since Trump’s victory. \"I don't think Democrats are going to win so easily in 2028. I think that America – I think that because the Democrats are in such disarray – America will say ‘You know what? Just give me a sensible Republican, just give me a traditional conservative. Give me a Nikki Haley, just somebody who is a regular conservative, I can deal with that. I think that’s what’s gonna happen.\" DEM SENATOR SAYS IT'S NO ‘SECRET TO ANYONE’ THAT TRUMP HAS PARTY ON ITS HEELS \"That could definitely happen,\" Schulz responded, saying the Democrats need a \"radical and disruptive\" change as a party, but their very style gets in the way. \"There just has to be something like radical and disruptive on the Democrat side,\" he said. \"And I think that they’re all concerned… They’re playing this like prevent defense and they’re really concerned about like ostracizing a group, like, ‘If I say this, will women be upset? If I say this, will Black people be upset? If I say this, will trans be upset?’ And it’s actually like a harder position to be in to be a Democrat. You’re the party of progress. You have to push s--- forward.\" By contrast, Republicans, Schulz said, operate in a much easier position. \"Conservatives are actually trying to pull s--- back. It's a way easier position to be in to be like, ‘Alright, we went too far forward.’ But I think what Democrats need to do is just start listening to everyday working-class people,\" he said. \"I think Democrats are too stuck in the Ivy League. There’s too much like pretentious finger-wagging. That’s not what everyday Americans are, and you need to get the working class back immediately.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The current status of the Democratic Party, Schulz said, is \"super rich, nepo-babies telling poor people how they should think and who they should vote for.

According to the company's website, it produces materials for the automotive, agriculture and medical industries among others.\n\nThe news release said that following the tour, Vance and Loeffler will talk about U.S. manufacturing and how it is faring under President Donald Trump less than two months into his second term in office, citing an \"industrial resurgence,\" in the country.\n\nManufacturing employment was up slightly in February compared to January, when Trump took office, by about 10,000 jobs, or less than one-tenth of a percentage point nationally, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, the major stock market indices have been rocked in recent days by Trump's proposed tariffs on imported goods, including those from Canada, Mexico and China, the nation's largest trading partners, raising fears of a recession.\n\nNo other information, including what time the tour and speech were to take place and whether there would be any public access to the event was immediately provided.\n\nIt is Vance's first official visit to Michigan since the Nov. 5 election. During the campaign season, he spent a total of 12 days visiting Michigan, according to Free Press records. Trump has not yet visited Michigan since taking office for his second term.\n\nIn coming to Bay City, Vance is also visiting a congressional district, the Michigan 8th, which is considered a swing district. U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Bay City, won the district for the first time in November, even as Trump and Vance won in the district as well.\n\nHe also comes to an area where questions have been raised by some about Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's delay in calling a special election to elect a state senator to replace McDonald Rivet. Democrats currently hold a one seat majority in the chamber.\n\nTrump and Vance, who previously served as a Republican U.S. senator from Ohio, won Michigan in last year's election, defeating Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz by a margin of about 1.4 percentage points. In doing so, they became just the third Republican ticket to win Michigan since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won the state; Trump won the state by about two-tenths of a percentage point in 2016 as well.\n\n Contact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Vance will visit a plastic manufacturing plant Friday, March 14, White House officials said.\n\nVance and Kelly Loeffler, the administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration, will tour Vantage Plastics in Bay County’s Bangor Township, near Bay City, officials said.\n\nFollowing the tour, the vice president and Loeffler “will deliver remarks highlighting America’s industrial resurgence,” according to a statement released by the vice president’s office.\n\nNo additional details about the visit were available.\n\nOfficials with Standish-based Vantage Plastics announced an investment of nearly $31 million to create 93 jobs in its Bangor Township facility in July 2023.\n\nVantage Plastics is a custom thermoformer with full in-house design, prototyping, and tool build capabilities serving customers in the automotive and consumer goods industries, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corp.\n\nThe company employs about 300 people in Michigan.\n\nThe visit would place Vance in Bay County, which favored the Republican ticket in the 2024 presidential election. In November 2024, 34,792 Bay County residents voted for Republican Donald Trump and his vice president while 25,767 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris, county records stated.\n\nTrump also won voters’ favor across the state.\n\nVance’s visit would mark the former Ohio senator’s first return to Michigan since a busy fall election campaign season, when the Trump and Harris campaigns visited the state about 80 times in 2024. Vance last visited Michigan during a campaign event at the FIM Capitol Theatre in Flint on the day before Election Day.\n\nSince the new Trump administration came to power in January, Vance has toured other corners of the nation, advocating for the Republican president’s policies.\n\nLast week, Vance visited Eagle Pass, Texas, where he promoted the administration’s immigration policies.\n\nVance also has attracted protestors from citizens opposing Trump policies. \n\nIn a social media post, Vance said last weekend he and his family confronted protesters at his East Walnut Hills home in Ohio.

Wemple declined to comment.\n\nExplaining why she decided to write her column that “respectfully” dissented with the billionaire owner’s new opinion direction, Marcus pointed out that she had already “spoken out forcefully against” Bezos’s decision to kill the editorial board’s endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, which inevitably led to hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions.\n\n“Censoring columnists was way worse. Having written then, how could I stay silent and live with myself now? Still, I hesitated,” she noted. “Since Trump’s Inauguration, I had been writing at a furious pace, assailing his blizzard of executive orders, his assaults on the rule of law, his dismantling of the Justice Department, which I had covered as a young reporter. Was speaking out on Bezos important enough to risk losing the platform that the Post provided?”\n\nShe added that she gave her editors “a way to get to yes” in approving the column, insisting that it was “meek to the point of embarrassing” as she did not mention Bezos’ “post-election efforts to cozy up to Trump. Still, she felt it was important for her to put her “reasons for disagreement on the record,” arguing that running it “would enhance the Post’s credibility, not undermine it.”\n\nAfter submitting the column to her editor, she stated, “silence ensued” for more than two days as it was reviewed by management. In the end, she was informed that Lewis had said no to the piece. “Pause here for a moment: I know of no other episode at The Washington Post, and I have checked with longtime employees at the paper, when a publisher has ordered a column killed,” Marcus asserted.\n\nAccording to Marcus, she asked editor Mary Duenwald — who handed down the verdict from Lewis — if she could discuss the matter with the publisher directly. “I asked to speak with Lewis,” she wrote. “He declined to see me, instructing an editor to inform me that there was no reason to meet, because his decision was final.”\n\nMarcus concluded: “I wish we could return to the newspaper of a not so distant past. But that is not to be, and here is the unavoidable truth: The Washington Post I joined, the one I came to love, is not The Washington Post I left.”\n\nAs for the nixed Post column itself, which Marcus provided to The New Yorker, she conceded that while it’s Bezos’s prerogative to shape the opinion coverage. At the same time, she wrote that “narrowing the range of acceptable opinions is an unwise course, one that disserves and underestimates our readers.”\n\nNoting that the Post broadened its “conservative offerings” to include the point of view of Trump voters after his first election win, Marcus felt that the readers benefited from that “diversity” of opinion.\n\n“How does the new focus on ‘personal liberties and free markets’ fit into this? What ‘viewpoints opposing those pillars’ consist of is a mystery. Compliance is in the eye of the beholder, whomever that might turn out to be,” she stated in the rejected piece. “We have been assured by our interim managers that decision-making will proceed unchanged as we await a new opinion editor to implement the Bezos vision. But that is merely a postponement of sentence, unless we are to believe that it means no change at all, which does not seem to be Bezos’s intent.”\n\nWhile pondering what opinions would or wouldn’t pass the smell test of Bezos’s mandate, Marcus suggested that Bezos was handcuffing the paper’s writers with his narrow policy. On top of that, she contended that the Amazon founder was leaving an opening for critics to accuse him of advancing his own interests.\n\n“It was one thing when the owner chose to dispense with Presidential endorsements. The editorial page, consisting of unsigned editorials, reflects the views of the owner. Signed opinions express the views of their creator,” she stated. “My job is supposed to be to tell you what I think, not what Jeff Bezos thinks I should think.\n\nMarcus added: “And now comes the dicey part, because the Bezos missive does not arrive in a vacuum but in the context of the owner’s repeated overtures to Trump. Whatever his internal motivations, it is asking a lot of readers not to suspect that Bezos’s personal business interests play no role here.”\n\nMeanwhile, amid Bezos’s increasingly friendly relationship with the media-bashing president, the Blue Origin owner’s opinion mandate has not only been pilloried by journalists but has also resulted in at least another 75,000 canceled subscriptions from infuriated readers. Still, it would appear that the White House and MAGA world are impressed.\n\nOstensibly talking about the Post recently overhauling its newsroom structure to “broaden the outlet's coverage and reach a wider audience,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt made a point of commending the paper at the top of her press briefing on Tuesday.\n\n“It appears that the mainstream media, including The Post, is finally learning that having disdain for more than half of the country who supports this president does not help you sell newspapers,” she said. “It’s not a very good business model.”","summary":"Ruth Marcus also claimed that another column by the Post’s media critic that criticized Jeff Bezos’ opinion edict was also killed","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ruth-marcus-jeff-bezos-rejected-column-b2713762.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/14/17/Blue_Origin_Layoffs_51945.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 14:36:08","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.53},{"id":299433216,"title":"Everything Donald Trump said about stock market and refuses blame for US economy crash","text":"Donald Trump held up stock market booms as a measure of his success during his first term but with Americans coming to terms with the growing prospect of a recession the US President has refused to take blame for economic collapse.\n\n Global stock markets went into freefall after Mr Trump endeavoured to push on with crippling tariffs against US allies. Wall Street analysts panicked after the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of the largest companies in the US, fell 1.2 per cent this session, following a drop of 2.7 per cent on Monday. \n\nThe crash is being directly linked to Mr Trump's imposing tariffs against America's closest allies, such as Canada, the European Union and the UK. His global trade war sees 25 per cent tariffs being slapped on aluminium and steel amid erecting other crippling import taxes on a series of other goods. \n\nHis methods have been called into question by financial analysts, while some of America' s wealthiest companies, such as Tesla, continue to see their value being wiped out. But the president has held firm to his tariff commitment, claiming they will be used to address trade imbalances between the US and its closest partners. \n\nDuring his first term Mr Trump spoke bullishly of the stock market, which saw considerable booms. But as the same market stalls under his second watch the Republican leader has downplayed his interest in Wall Street fluctuations. \n\nHere is everything Mr Trump has said about the stock market in recent years. \n\nTruth Social post on January 29, 2024\n\n\"This is the Trump stock market because my polls against [then president Joe] Biden are so good that investors are projecting that I will win, and that will drive the market up - everything else is terrible (watch the Middle East), and record setting inflation has already taken its toll.

When I win the election, we will immediately begin a brand new Trump economic boom. It’ll be a boom. We’re going to turn this country around so fast. Many people say that they only reason the stock market is up is because people think I am going to win.\"\n\nAt a Mar-a-Lago gala in Florida on November 14, 2024, following the election\n\n\"We had three or four of the highest - I guess, almost every single day, we set new records in the stock market. We set new records economically.\"\n\nSpeaking at an investment conference in Florida on February 19\n\n\"I think the stock market is going to be great. In other words, we will rapidly grow our economy by dramatically shrinking the federal government.\"\n\nSpeaking to joint session of Congress on March 4\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it’s happening and it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.\"\n\nMarch 9 interview with Fox News following stock market uncertainty\n\nWhen asked if he was expecting a recession, Mr Trump said: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.\" He continued: \"It takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.\"\n\nMarch 9 response to journalists on Air Force One\n\nAfter his hesitation to rule out a recession, Mr Trump was pressed again on the question. He said: \"I tell you what, of course you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: We’re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we’re going to become so rich you’re not going to know where to spend all that money. I’m telling you, you just watch.\"\n\nMarch 11 answers to White House reporters\n\nMr Trump was once again quizzed about the stock market tumble on Tuesday. \"Markets are going to go up and they’re going to go down. We have to rebuild our country,\" he said. \n\nHe continued: \"Biden gave us a horrible economy. He gave us horrible inflation. And I think the market was going to go very, very bad.

Brown wrote in a post on X that he appreciated Shaheen's service, and said, \"Now it’s time for New Hampshire to have someone in the delegation who fights for our priorities and stands with, not against, the Trump agenda.\" It's the third Democratic Senate retirement in a potentially competitive midterm race so far this election cycle. Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan announced in January that he would not run again, opening up the race in one of the most tightly divided states in the country, which President Donald Trump carried in 2024. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota is also retiring in 2026, and while her state has not been as close as Michigan in recent years, there have been a number of close statewide races there in recent years, including in 2024, when Trump lost by just over 4 percentage points. Republicans currently enjoy a 53-47 edge in the Senate, meaning that Democrats would have to net four seats to win the majority in 2026, since the GOP controls the tie-breaking vice presidency. Former Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is also retiring in 2026, though his seat in deep-red Kentucky is highly unlikely to be competitive. New Hampshire's entire congressional delegation is controlled by Democrats, but the state has a history of electing members of both parties, and the presidential race was close there in 2024. Former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by 3 percentage points. Also in 2024, Republican Kelly Ayotte won the state's governorship, beating Democratic former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig by 9percentage points. Ayotte is also the most recent Republican to represent the state in the Senate, though she lost her re-election race in 2016 to now-Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte is the second consecutive Republican governor elected by Granite State voters, as she succeeded former GOP Gov. Chris Sununu. Sununu was recruited to run for Senate last year but declined Republican entreaties. Republicans expressed confidence that they could flip the open Senate seat, with National Republican Senatorial Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., saying in a statement that the state “has a proud tradition of electing common-sense Republicans—and will do so again in 2026!” Democrats, though, believe the state’s historical trends are on their side. “No Republican has won a Senate race in over a decade in New Hampshire, and that trend will continue in 2026. This is exactly the kind of state where the building midterm backlash against Republicans will hit their candidates especially hard,” said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman David Bergstein.","summary":"Sen.

President Donald Trump is using his power to give Americans more freedom. That’s a massive difference.\n\nDesperate to find an effective attack against Trump, some Democrats are recycling an old one. They claim he’s an authoritarian. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., invited laid-off federal workers to attend Trump’s recent speech to Congress. She said she was standing “shoulder to shoulder with people in defiance to a dictator.” That type of defiance led Democrats to callously withhold applause from a 13-year-old brain-cancer survivor simply because Trump introduced him. Shameful.\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams recently called Trump a “petty tyrant.”\n\nThe Associated Press claimed that Trump “has embarked on a dizzying teardown of the federal government and attacks on long-standing institutions in an attempt to increase his own authority.”\n\nThese accusations aren’t new. Former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris frequently labeled Trump a threat to democracy. Last year, historian Jon Meacham called Trump a “tyrant” who would cause the downfall of the American Republic.\n\nTrump has fed into this. After he attacked congestion pricing in Manhattan, the White House posted a picture of him wearing a crown. Trump said, “Long live the king.” While that was obviously not a serious claim to monarchical authority, it sent the propaganda press into a tizzy.\n\nMany Americans believe the worst about Trump as 41% of Americans say Trump is a dictator, according to a February YouGov poll.\n\nThose people aren’t just wrong–they have it backwards. Trump is doing the one thing dictators never do–reduce their own power.\n\nIt’d help to define some terms. Merriam-Webster says a dictator is “one holding complete autocratic control.” An autocracy is a “government in which one person possesses unlimited power.” Tyrant has a similar meaning–“an absolute ruler unrestrained by law or constitution.”\n\nTherefore, by definition, you can’t be a dictator while increasing freedom and shrinking the size and scope of government. It’s a contradiction.\n\nThat’s what Trump is doing. He rolled back Biden’s target for electric vehicle sales. He’s unshackled the energy industry. He wants to undo Biden administration restrictions on dishwashers, shower heads and light bulbs. He’s ordered agencies to eliminate 10 previous regulations for every new one they put in place. He’s increasing freedom.\n\nHe’s also pushing for a significant tax cut. Dictators aren’t known for wanting to let you keep more of your own money.\n\nHe’s laid off tens of thousands of federal workers. Another 75,000 federal workers took buyouts. The Department of Government Efficiency is attempting to reduce federal spending by more than $100 billion. He’s shrinking the government he runs.\n\nThe Trump administration is even gearing up to eliminate the Department of Education. In early March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon laid out “our department’s final mission.” ?She wants “to send education back to the states and empower all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.”\n\nIndoctrinating a nation’s children is a powerful tool for any would-be dictator. Communist dictators wanted kids’ primary loyalty to be to the government. They sought to drive a wedge between children and their parents. Trump wants to give parents more control of their children’s education.\n\nNow, Trump is governing aggressively. The executive orders have been fast and furious. He’s closed the border. He’s clearing out the deep state. He’s rooting out diversity, equity, and inclusion in the government. He’s recognized that men are not women.\n\nBut an elected official changing government policy isn’t tyranny. That’s the point of having an election. It’d be tyrannical if an unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy could stop a democratically elected president from running the executive branch as he sees fit. Just look at the obstacles Trump faced in his first term.\n\nTrump is one of the most successful men in the world, but he’s a complete failure at being a dictator.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Here's a timeline of how we got here","text":"Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into a trade war abroad — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.\n\nSince taking office less than two months ago, Trump has rolled out hefty import taxes on goods coming from America's three biggest trading partners — Mexico, Canada and China — and promises that more targets are on the horizon.\n\nTrump is no stranger to tariffs. He also launched a trade war during his first term in office, but has more sweeping plans now. Economists stress there could greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide this time — and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill.\n\nThere's also been a sense of whiplash from Trump's back-and-forth tariff threats and responding retaliation, including recently-postponed levies for some goods from Canada and Mexico that followed a 30-day pause for the auto industry. The uncertainty has roiled financial markets, lowered consumer confidence, and enveloped many businesses with questions that could delay hiring and investment.\n\nHere's a timeline of how we got here:\n\nTrump's first term\n\nTrump launches a trade war during his first term in office — taking particular aim at China.\n\nThe two countries exchange a series of tit-for-tat levies affecting hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods. The dispute centers around U.S. allegations that China deploys underhanded tactics — including stealing trade secrets and pressuring U.S. companies to hand over sensitive technology — in an effort to supplant the U.S. in advanced fields such as quantum computing and automated cars.\n\nTrump puts tariffs on most Chinese goods. Meanwhile, Beijing responds with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products ranging from fruit, soybeans and wine to aircraft, automotive and chemical imports.\n\nSeparately, Trump slaps tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines. And in 2018, he imposes taxes of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum imports on national security grounds, escalating tensions with other trading partners. He also uses the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.\n\nTariffs under Biden\n\nPresident Joe Biden largely preserves most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, but his administration claims to take a more targeted approach.\n\nIn October 2022, he issues sweeping new restrictions on selling semiconductors and chipmaking equipment to China. These curbs will be expanded in October 2023 and December 2024 — when China responds with a ban of U.S. exports for various high-tech materials like gallium and germanium.\n\nBiden also hikes tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment in May 2024. And in July, he imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum shipped from Mexico but made elsewhere in an attempt to stop China from circumventing import taxes.\n\n2024 campaign trail promises\n\nBiden's 2024 tariff moves come in the middle of a heated presidential campaign — with both Biden and Trump taking jabs at each other in attempts to show who's tougher on China.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump says that he plans to impose tariffs of at least 60% on all Chinese imports if he wins a second term. He also floats the idea of a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the U.S. imports while threatening to impose even bigger levies for specific countries or manufacturers that take their business outside the U.S.\n\nWhile the Biden-Harris administration uses tariffs to target China, both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — who becomes the Democratic nominee after Biden drops out of the race — maintain that Trump’s promise of more broad tariffs worldwide would be a mistake. Harris labels Trump's call for tariffs as a “national sales tax” — with her campaign later saying that a 20% tariff applied across the board would raise expenses for a typical family by almost $4,000 annually.\n\nNovember 2024\n\nTrump wins the U.S. presidential election. He continues to promise steep tariff hikes in the coming weeks and months leading up to his first day back in office.\n\nTrump is sworn in. In his inaugural address, he again promises to “tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\" And he reiterates plans to create an agency called the External Revenue Service, which has yet to be established.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports.\n\nTrump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petro’s rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.\n\nIn response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.\n\nTrump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China — 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency — ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking. The levies on Canada and Mexico threaten to blow up Trump’s own USMCA trade deal, which allowed many products to cross North American borders duty free.\n\nThe action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.\n\nTrump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, with both trading partners taking steps to appease Trump's concerns about border security and drug trafficking.\n\nTrump's new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including sweeping new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.\n\nChina's 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10.\n\nFebruary 10\n\nTrump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs to 25% from 10% set to go into effect March 12.\n\nFebruary 13\n\nTrump announces a plan for “reciprocal” tariffs — promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports “for purposes of fairness.” Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.\n\nBeyond China, Canada and Mexico, he indicates that additional countries, such as India, won’t be spared from higher tariffs. And in the following weeks, Trump suggests that European countries could face a 25% levy as part of these efforts.\n\nFebruary 25\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.\n\nTrump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S.\n\nTrump’s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.\n\nAll three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.\n\nChina, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\nTrump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the “Big 3” automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.\n\nIn a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month. But he still plans to impose “reciprocal” tariffs starting on April 2.\n\nTrump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs — and the Mexican president said in a post on X that she and Trump “had an excellent and respectful call in which we agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results.”\n\nTrump’s actions also thawed relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty over the trade war remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government said it had suspended its second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).\n\nChina retaliates against Trump’s tariffs by imposing additional 15% taxes on key American farm products, including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef. The escalating trade tensions push stocks lower on Monday as investors worry about the pain Trump’s trade wars risk inflicting on the American economy.\n\nThe Chinese tariffs were a response to Trump’s decision to double the levy on Chinese imports to 20% on March 4. China’s Commerce Ministry had earlier said that goods already in transit would be exempt from the retaliatory tariffs until April 12.\n\nThe European Union takes retaliatory trade action with new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products, responding within hours to the Trump administration’s increase in tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%.\n\nThe EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during President Donald Trump’s first term.","summary":"Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into a trade war abroad &mdash; all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.\n\nSince taking office less than two months ago, Trump has rolled out hefty import taxes on goods coming from A...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/538114/Trump-has-begun-another-trade-war-Here-s-a-timeline-of-how-we-got-here","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/3/2e4f962428f50038929f420d9d7deb58b8c328a26b9656f7bf07a455ff6e3632_p4159438.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 13:40:00","author":"The Canadian Press,Wyatte Grantham","authors":["The Canadian Press","Wyatte Grantham"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.043},{"id":299412636,"title":"Should Arizona’s leading Democrats unite or prepare for conflict?

Katie Hobbs headed to the Mexican border with a conciliatory message.\n\n“Border security was a core issue of the Trump campaign,” she said. “I look forward to having conversations with the incoming president about Arizona’s needs.”\n\nBack in Phoenix, Attorney General Kris Mayes was plotting a legal strategy that has led so far to five lawsuits against the Trump administration, on average one every 10 days since she took office.\n\nBoth Hobbs and Mayes are Democrats who will seek reelection next year in a state that went for Trump. But they have adopted sharply different approaches to handling Trump’s return to the White House: Restrained and collaborative for Hobbs; hardened and embattled for Mayes.\n\nThe strategies encapsulate the debate consuming Democrats around the country trying to find a path back to power. In winning over working class voters, Trump scrambled political allegiances and left Democrats struggling to piece together a viable coalition.\n\nArizona’s two top elected officials are making different bets about what voters will be looking for next year. Hobbs and Mayes both narrowly won their offices in 2022. Mayes’ 280-vote victory was the closest in state history, and Hobbs won by less than 1 percentage point.\n\n“I don’t think you can yield to authoritarian, anti-democratic behavior when it’s in the White House and when our country is in as much danger as it is right now,” Mayes said in a recent interview. “Our country has never been in this much peril since the Civil War.”\n\nHobbs declined an interview request. Her team issued a memo last week saying Arizona voters would see she “is serious about putting partisan politics aside to get things done.”\n\n“They see her work with the Trump Administration and Republican Legislature when they share common goals, and they see her stand up to far-right proposals when they are out of touch with Arizona,” wrote Nicole DeMont, the governor’s chief political strategist.\n\nThe disparate approaches owe somewhat to their differing roles. As governor, Hobbs has to work with a Trump-friendly Republican legislature and may need to cajole the White House for federal assistance during Trump’s presidency. As attorney general, Mayes has the prerogative to fight in court.\n\nMayes is also prosecuting Trump aides and allies involved in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.\n\nThe dynamic is much the same in Michigan, another battleground state Trump won narrowly, where Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is aggressively confronting the Trump administration both legally and rhetorically, while Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been more restrained.\n\nMayes and Nessel, both serving as the chief law enforcement officers of battleground states, have started a podcast together, “Pantsuits and Lawsuits.”\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been at times solicitous of Trump and Republicans as he pleads for disaster aid to recover from wildfires as Attorney General Rob Bonta sues.\n\nTo be clear, neither Hobbs nor Mayes could be mistaken for a Trump supporter. But their differing approaches began even before the election, when Mayes routinely appeared with Democrat Kamala Harris and her surrogates when they visited Arizona, while Hobbs kept her distance.\n\nMayes first sued Trump the day after he took office, when she joined a coalition of Democratic attorneys general suing to block an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.\n\nSince then, she’s joined lawsuits challenging a blanket federal funding freeze, National Institutes of Health funding cuts, Elon Musk’s role atop the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and DOGE’s access to sensitive financial records at the U.S. Treasury.\n\nShe held a town hall meeting in Phoenix last week with the Democratic attorneys general from Minnesota, New Mexico Oregon, drawing hundreds of people concerned about Musk’s dismantling of the federal workforce.\n\n“I would just like to see more accountability,” said Tatiana Johnson, a 24-year-old community organizer from Phoenix, who went to Mayes’ town hall. She’s skeptical that Mayes’ lawsuits will restrain Trump, but it matters to her to see someone fighting.\n\n“It may not make a difference in the grand scheme of things of Trump actually listening to those, but it does make a difference to me,” Johnson said.\n\nHobbs, meanwhile, has been largely holding her fire, sometimes frustrating Democratic voters hungry for leaders to take on Trump.\n\nArizonans want strong leaders “who will stand up to a bully and who will protect our Constitution and their rights,” Mayes said. Voters repeatedly elected legendary Republican Sen. John McCain by wide margins, not because they always agreed with him but because “they knew he was fighting for them.”\n\n“That’s what I’m betting on,” she said. “And we’ll find out in 2026 whether I’m right or wrong.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

Economic signs are mixed, but his willy-nilly tariffs have markets worried,” reads a recent headline.\n\nFrom the op-ed:\n\nRecession fears are roiling markets, as tech stocks and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply again on Monday. Stock prices have been richly valued for some time, and this may be merely a market correction. But there are also signs of a slowing economy that should have the Trump Administration on alert. \n\nMr. Trump didn’t help the mood with his cagey response to a question by Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in a Sunday interview about whether he expects a recession this year. “I hate to predict things like that,” he replied. “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” \n\nThe U.S. stock market fell further Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s latest escalation in his trade war, briefly pulling Wall Street 10% below its record set last month. And like it’s been for most of the past few weeks, the market’s slide on Tuesday was erratic and dizzying.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.8%, but only after careening between a modest gain and a tumble of 1.5%. The main measure of Wall Street’s health finished 9.3% below its all-time high after flirting with the 10% threshold that professional investors call a “correction.”\n\nOther indexes likewise swung sharply through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite ended up slipping 0.2%.\n\nSuch head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what’s been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants.\n\nTrump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession and brushed aside the stock market sell-off, going so far as to say, “You can’t really watch the stock market.” That’s a new message from a leader who has frequently pointed to the market’s ups and downs as a reflection of himself and his activities, even when he was not in power. \n\nOver the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"“Will There Be a Trump Recession?\"","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/03/rupert-murdochs-newspaper-goes-to-war-with-trump-on-his-willy-nilly-economy.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/XIXDD6ABEVBTDIS4SYAHEW244E.jpg?auth=0c5ffe6ff8e0dd3688f3dbf2f38a179731a1e4d3ebc1dd7411a771c6e51a0a70&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 13:18:14","author":"Matt Arco","authors":["Matt Arco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":299413096,"title":"Find common ground or dig in for battle?

Her team issued a memo last week saying Arizona voters would see she “is serious about putting partisan politics aside to get things done.”\n\n“They see her work with the Trump Administration and Republican Legislature when they share common goals, and they see her stand up to far-right proposals when they are out of touch with Arizona,” wrote Nicole DeMont, the governor’s chief political strategist.\n\nThe disparate approaches owe somewhat to their differing roles. As governor, Hobbs has to work with a Trump-friendly Republican legislature and may need to cajole the White House for federal assistance during Trump’s presidency. As attorney general, Mayes has the prerogative to fight in court.\n\nMayes is also prosecuting Trump aides and allies involved in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.\n\nThe dynamic is much the same in Michigan, another battleground state Trump won narrowly, where Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is aggressively confronting the Trump administration both legally and rhetorically, while Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been more restrained.\n\nMayes and Nessel, both serving as the chief law enforcement officers of battleground states, have started a podcast together, “Pantsuits and Lawsuits.”\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been at times solicitous of Trump and Republicans as he pleads for disaster aid to recover from wildfires as Attorney General Rob Bonta sues.\n\nTo be clear, neither Hobbs nor Mayes could be mistaken for a Trump supporter. But their differing approaches began even before the election, when Mayes routinely appeared with Democrat Kamala Harris and her surrogates when they visited Arizona, while Hobbs kept her distance.\n\nMayes first sued Trump the day after he took office, when she joined a coalition of Democratic attorneys general suing to block an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.\n\nSince then, she’s joined lawsuits challenging a blanket federal funding freeze, National Institutes of Health funding cuts, Elon Musk’s role atop the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and DOGE’s access to sensitive financial records at the U.S. Treasury.\n\nShe held a town hall meeting in Phoenix last week with the Democratic attorneys general from Minnesota, New Mexico Oregon, drawing hundreds of people concerned about Musk’s dismantling of the federal workforce.\n\n“I would just like to see more accountability,” said Tatiana Johnson, a 24-year-old community organizer from Phoenix, who went to Mayes’ town hall. She’s skeptical that Mayes’ lawsuits will restrain Trump, but it matters to her to see someone fighting.\n\n“It may not make a difference in the grand scheme of things of Trump actually listening to those, but it does make a difference to me,” Johnson said.\n\nHobbs, meanwhile, has been largely holding her fire, sometimes frustrating Democratic voters hungry for leaders to take on Trump.\n\nArizonans want strong leaders “who will stand up to a bully and who will protect our Constitution and their rights,” Mayes said. Voters repeatedly elected legendary Republican Sen. John McCain by wide margins, not because they always agreed with him but because “they knew he was fighting for them.”\n\n“That’s what I’m betting on,” she said. “And we’ll find out in 2026 whether I’m right or wrong.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ women in the workforce and state government coverage receives financial support from Pivotal Ventures.

And do they disapprove of his job performance more than at any time in his first term?\n\nYes, and yes.\n\nThat’s according to a new CNN/SSRS poll that shows 56% of people disapprove of his handling of the economy, while 44% said they approve.\n\nTrump’s overall job approval is 54% disapprove and 45% approval, per the poll.\n\nThe U.S. stock market fell further Tuesday following President Donald Trump’s latest escalation in his trade war, briefly pulling Wall Street 10% below its record set last month. And like it’s been for most of the past few weeks, the market’s slide on Tuesday was erratic and dizzying.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.8%, but only after careening between a modest gain and a tumble of 1.5%. The main measure of Wall Street’s health finished 9.3% below its all-time high after flirting with the 10% threshold that professional investors call a “correction.”\n\nOther indexes likewise swung sharply through the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 478 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite ended up slipping 0.2%.\n\nSuch head-spinning moves are becoming routine in what’s been a scary ride for investors as Trump tries to remake the country and world through tariffs and other policies. Stocks have been heaving mostly lower on uncertainty about how much pain Trump is willing for the economy to endure in order to get what he wants.\n\nTrump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession and brushed aside the stock market sell-off, going so far as to say, “You can’t really watch the stock market.” That’s a new message from a leader who has frequently pointed to the market’s ups and downs as a reflection of himself and his activities, even when he was not in power. \n\nOver the last year, while President Joe Biden was in office, Trump took credit for stock market rallies as a vote of confidence in his electoral prospects. When the market dipped, he blamed Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. And he predicted that if Democrats won the 2024 presidential election, the stock market would have crashed.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Trump in recent days has dismissed fears of a recession.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/03/massive-maga-polling-shift-americans-sour-on-trump-on-this-major-issue.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/MPV5VRVHFZCEBBDBJNSZW7EHZE.jpg?auth=b48cfece22fe2e1899034e1ba7ef0aea26fd47ecf5f4e36e7a32458e5e522186&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 12:58:19","author":"Matt Arco","authors":["Matt Arco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.008},{"id":299397520,"title":"Eagles fans react after team U-turns on visiting Trump in the White House to celebrate Super Bowl win","text":"Eagles fans react after team U-turns on visiting Trump in the White House to celebrate Super Bowl win\n\nREAD MORE: Philadelphia Eagles have NOT rejected White House invite \n\nPODCAST: Trump’s tariff whiplash, Trudeau’s tears, and Hunter Biden’s ‘sugar brother’ – on the latest episode of Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 12:24 GMT, 12 March 2025 | Updated: 12:39 GMT, 12 March 2025\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will celebrate a Super Bowl victory at the White House for the first time on April 28, but not everyone is happy about it.\n\n'Completely disappointed in the Philadelphia Eagles for tainting their absolutely historic win by accepting the orange felon's invitation to visit the White House,' musician Ricky Davila wrote on X, echoing a sentiment felt by many liberals. 'Way to sell your souls to the devil cowards.'\n\nThe 'orange felon' being referred to by Davila is obviously President Donald Trump, who previously disinvited the Eagles from the customary Super Bowl-champion White House visit in 2018. Philadelphia was coming off its first Super Bowl victory, but when Trump learned several players planned on skipping the event, he cancelled it altogether.\n\nNow, with only four players from that 2018 roster currently on these Super Bowl-champion Eagles, the team will be visiting Trump's White House next month.\n\nThere had been some mystery over whether the team would accept an invite, and if the White House had even extended an invitation, but Trump's press secretary Karoline Levitt finally cleared that up on Tuesday.\n\n'I know there was a lot of fake news about an invitation that wasn't sent or was sent, we want to correct the record: we sent an invitation, they enthusiastically accepted, and you will see them here on April 28,' said Levitt.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley holds the Vince Lombardi Trophy during celebrations after the Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 in Super Bowl LIX\n\nNot everyone is happy to see the Eagles agreeing to visit Donald Trump's White House\n\nMichael Jordan sends fans wild as he is spotted out for dinner with superstar NFL quarterback\n\nLevitt is possibly referring to a February report in the Rupert Murdoch-owned US Sun, which cited an anonymous source claiming the team planned to skip the tradition White House cameo.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats reacted to the erroneous news in the days and weeks that followed, culminating with conservative political commentator Megyn Kelly telling the Eagles to 'GO F YOURSELVES' online.\n\nNow, though, with the Eagles accepting Trump's invitation, it's liberals who are reacting angrily on social media.\n\n'If the @Eagles actually go to the White House the whole team will look like the biggest bunch of genuine losers,' one user wrote. 'Nothing to really ruin your image more than shaking hands with a fascist who is going to drag us into WWIII.'\n\n'I'm really disappointed in the @Eagles for agreeing to go to the White House. It's their choice, I'm still a fan. Just a disappointed one.'\n\n'It was better when they weren't,' another added.\n\nTo be clear, many conservatives expressed relief and, in some cases, joy, over the decision.\n\n'Good!' one fan wrote before referencing the reigning Stanley Cup champions. 'Hopefully, it is another great meeting, like it was with the Florida Panthers.'\n\n'Good,' another agreed. 'I was concerned about that. If I'd supported @Eagles and they dissed him, I'd feel betrayed beyond belief. I'd never root for them again.'\n\n'I'm so glad,' a fan with the X handle, 'MAGA Axim,' wrote on X. 'I take back everything I was thinking about them.'\n\nMany Trump supporters were excited to see that the Eagles would be visiting the White House\n\nThe President attended the Eagles' victory over the Chiefs in New Orleans but left the game early to fly back to his home in Palm Beach, Florida at an estimated cost of somewhere between $8million and $20 million taxpayer dollars.\n\nCuriously, Trump has not yet congratulated the Eagles despite previously toasting the Kansas City Chiefs for their latest Super Bowl berth. He's also praised Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, the latter of whom 'liked' a pair of Trump-related social media posts during the campaign.\n\n'I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social network ahead of his electoral victory over Kamala Harris in November.\n\nThe Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, also has a history of supporting conservative causes.\n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, on the other hand, has a record of supporting left-leaning politicians, such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, although he previously donated to Republicans George W. Bush and Arlen Specter as well.\n\nDonald TrumpRepublicansWhite House\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nEagles fans react after team U-turns on visiting Trump in the White House to celebrate Super Bowl win\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Philadelphia Eagles will celebrate a Super Bowl victory at the White House for the first time on April 28, but not everyone is happy about it.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14490281/Super-Bowl-champion-Philadelphia-Eagles-Donald-Trump-White-House.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/12/96108081-0-image-a-12_1741782227677.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/09/8752167184606411041/1024x576_MP4_8752167184606411041.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-12 12:39:26","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":299388266,"title":"Newsom tacks right to oppose transgender athletes in women’s sports","text":"So what game is Gavin Newsom playing?\n\nEver since Democrats lost the White House to Donald Trump four months ago, California’s governor has been retooling his political image, shifting from advocating left-leaning policies, such as single-payer health care, to supporting quasi-conservative causes, such as suppressing street crime and cleaning up homeless encampments.\n\nNewsom’s slow drift to the right became a jolt last week when, on the first segment of his new podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” he declared opposition to transgender women competing in women’s sports.\n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,” he told Charlie Kirk, a right-wing provocateur and Newsom’s first podcast guest. “It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair. I’m not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.”\n\nNewsom cited his two daughters, his wife’s background as a college athlete and his own baseball career at Santa Clara University as shaping his position, saying “I revere sports. And so the issue of fairness is completely legit.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Newsom’s startling statement drew fire from advocates for LGBTQ rights who had long counted the governor as a supporter, dating from 2004 when, as mayor of San Francisco, he defied state law to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n“We are profoundly disappointed and angered by Governor Newsom’s comments about transgender youth and their ability to participate in sports,” Tony Hoang, executive director of Equality California, said in a statement. “Transgender kids — like all kids — deserve the chance to play sports alongside their teammates and learn important values like leadership, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Transgender young people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.”\n\nDespite the outrage of Hoang and other advocates, Newsom’s newly voiced position places him in the national political mainstream. In January a New York Times/ Ipsos poll found that almost 80% of Americans oppose allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports and that included more than two-thirds of Democrats.\n\nSomething else Newsom said on the topic was a sharp dig at Kamala Harris, his sometime ally and sometime rival, for failing to counter a Donald Trump commercial that showed Harris endorsing sex-change operations for transgender prison inmates.\n\nThe ad has been widely hailed as the Trump campaign’s most effective assault on Harris, and Newsom termed it “a great ad” that Harris’ campaign neglected to answer.\n\nDuring his political career in California, which has spanned half of his life, Newsom has often said and done things that attract national media attention, beginning with his decree supporting gay marriage as mayor. His remarks on transgender sports were only the latest of such zingers.\n\nIf he really believes that transgender women should be banned from women’s sports, he would publicly support the recently introduced legislation to repeal a 2013 law that allows such participation. If he doesn’t back his words with action, we’ll know it’s just a political ploy.\n\nSo what’s Newsom’s end game?\n\nNational political media assume that Newsom will finish the remaining 22 months of his governorship and then launch, officially or otherwise, a campaign for president. Trump apparently cannot run for another term in 2028, although he may try to circumvent the Constitution’s two-term limit. And at the moment, the Democrats don’t have any other standout potential candidates.\n\nTherefore if Newsom does intend to pursue the presidency in 2028, or otherwise remain in the political spotlight, aligning himself with popular sentiment on such a hot-button issue is a smart tactical move.\n\nLikewise, creating a personal podcast and inviting such obvious foils as Charlie Kirk would be a way to maintain national media exposure, the prerequisite for anyone who seeks the White House.\n\nDan Walters is a CalMatters columnist.","summary":"Aligning himself with popular sentiment on such a hot-button issue is a smart tactical move.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/12/newsom-tacks-right-to-oppose-transgender-athletes-in-womens-sports/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/LDN-L-NEWSOM-RECOVERY-0227-10-SR.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 12:24:13","author":"Dan Walters","authors":["Dan Walters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":299392536,"title":"“SZA Criticizes Shannon Sharpe for Posing ‘Inappropriate’ Question About Her BBL to Coco Jones on ‘Club Shay Shay'”","text":"Popular singer SZA recently blasted Shannon Sharpe on Instagram for asking a “tacky” question about her Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) to Coco Jones during an episode of his podcast “Club Shay Shay.”\n\nOn March 11, internet users noticed SZA finally responded to Shannon Sharpe’s mention of the “Snooze” singer’s decision to get her body done during an intimate conversation with Jones.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSharpe’s podcast, “Club Shay Shay,” has seen incredible success since its launch in 2020. In addition to Jones, who recently released a new single, “Taste,” Sharpe has chatted with athletes, actors, comedians, and political figures, such as Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris.\n\nSharpe touches on many topics with his guests during their conversations. While chatting with Jones about fading trends, the NFL star asked the 27-year-old to share her thoughts about BBLs, specifically SZAs.\n\nJones gave a classy response, leaving SZA out of it, which many viewers praised her for online. SZA also acknowledged the young adult’s professionalism in a comment; however, she wasn’t fond of Sharpe’s question to begin with.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nOnce SZA heard Sharpe’s question about her body to Jones, she wasted no time letting the world know how she felt about it.\n\nIn one comment, the “Kill Bill” singer laughed and wondered why “would this be a question for Coco.”\n\n“Poor baby, she handled it well now, Shay Shay,” she continued.\n\nHowever, she didn’t end there. The Grammy winner posted another comment and blasted Sharpe for asking an “incredibly tacky” question.\n\n“I wanted to come [on your show] too,” she continued. “Dah, well.”\n\nFans reacted to her bold statement on Instagram, with many praising her for responding to Sharpe instead of being passive-aggressive.\n\n“CLOCK IT, BABY,” one user wrote. “I’m glad you said [something] DIRECTLY.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAlthough SZA was caught off guard by Sharpe’s question about her body, the singer has been open about getting the popular cosmetic surgery done during an interview with British Vogue.\n\n“I’m so mad I did that sh-t,” she said before explaining she “gained all this weight” because she couldn’t work out while recovering. “It was just so stupid.”\n\nSZA, however, revealed that she was moving on and leaving her regret in the rearview, adding, “Who gives a f-ck?”\n\n“You got a BBL, you realize you didn’t need the sh-t. It doesn’t matter. I’ll do a whole bunch more sh-t just like it if I want to before I’m f-cking dead because this body is temporary. It just wasn’t super necessary,” she said.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSZA isn’t the only public figure pointing out an issue they have with Sharpe and his podcast. In early March 2025, popular comedian Mike Epps slammed the Super Bowl winner for using the pain of his Black guests as “clickbait” for his show.\n\nEpps, who was involved in a brief feud with the podcaster in 2024, called him out during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club” and suggested Sharpe “bring some white men on here and grill ’em.”\n\n“You can’t just grill Black people; that sh-t ain’t right,” he continued.\n\nHe added, “Get some of your NFL players that you know was f-cked up and get them on the show.”\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDuring the 2024 NBA All-Star weekend, Sharpe uploaded a photo of the two men to social media, seemingly confirming that their beef, which began over a lie Epps told about Sharpe inviting him on his podcast, had reached its end.\n\n“We both realize this situation could’ve been, should’ve been handled differently. I apologize [to my] fam, friends, loved [ones], and my fans,” the “First Take” analyst wrote.\n\nFollowing his feud with Epps, Sharpe had another interaction that kept his name in the headlines.\n\nThe athlete accidentally live streamed himself having sex with someone on Instagram in September 2024, and the father of three acknowledged the situation during an emergency episode of “Nightcap.”\n\n“Obviously, I am embarrassed,” the 56-year-old said. “[I’m] someone that is extremely, extremely private and to have one of your most intimate details, the audio heard for the entire world to hear, I’m embarrassed for a number of reasons.”\n\nHe finished by explaining that although he was in private, he always strives to maintain “a level” of professionalism. “And I’m very disappointed in myself,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPopular singer SZA recently blasted Shannon Sharpe on Instagram for asking a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;SZA Criticizes Shannon Sharpe for Posing &#8216;Inappropriate&#8217; Question About Her BBL to Coco Jones on &#8216;Club Shay Shay&#039;&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/sza-criticizes-shannon-sharpe-for-posing-inappropriate-question-about-her-bbl-to-coco-jones-on-club-shay-shay/","image":"https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/2025/03/11173856/sza-shannon-sharpe-comment.jpg?","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 12:20:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":299393274,"title":"Hours after Trump promises to buy a Tesla, reports of Elon Musk’s plans to donate $100M to MAGA super PACs emerge","text":"Hours after Donald Trump announced that he was planning to purchase a Tesla, reports emerged that Elon Musk was considering a $100 million donation to a super PAC associated with the president. \n\nFederal filings show that the MAGA megadonor-turned-White House advisor spent more than $290 million supporting the president and his Republican allies during the 2024 election cycle. Musk gave over a quarter of a billion dollars through his super political action committee, America PAC. \n\nIn an unprecedented move for a “special government employee,” who has been tasked with leading the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to shrink the federal government through his Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has signaled in recent days his plans to donate the eight-figure sum to an entity controlled by the president, three sources told the New York Times. \n\nA source later told Axios that Musk had spoken with the White House about his donation plans. \n\nAccording to The Times, both Musk and Trump associates have indicated that the world’s richest man wants to make donations to America PAC and an outside entity. \n\nThe two organizations in question are the super PAC Make America Great Again Inc. and the nonprofit Securing America Greatness. Former Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich reportedly heads both groups. \n\nThe groups have raised around $500 million to help expand the GOP majorities in the 2026 midterm elections and to lobby congressional Republicans to support Trump's agenda.\n\nMusk previously touted plans for his America PAC to “keep grinding” in the 2026 midterms.\n\nThe precise split of the DOGE leader’s money is also not yet known, with nonprofit groups typically not required to disclose their donors. \n\nThe news donation broke after the president vowed in the early hours of Tuesday to purchase a “brand new Tesla” while taking a swipe at “radical left lunatics” staging protests against the electric vehicle company, attempting to punish Musk and his “baby”. \n\nLater Tuesday, Trump transformed the White House's south lawn into a Tesla exhibit, showcasing five vehicles before he decided to purchase a deep red Tesla Model S, with a price tag starting just shy of $80,000. \n\nTrump told reporters that Musk, who boasts a $320 billion net worth, had been treated “very unfairly” and that “he can’t be penalized for being a patriot.” Trump also labeled those vandalizing Teslas as “domestic terrorists.” \n\nThe Tesla promotion came after the EV company’s share prices plunged by 15 percent on Monday, returning to their lowest levels since Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris in November and their worst day since 2020. It made it the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500.\n\n“Tesla Takedown” protests have erupted across the U.S. with showrooms being besieged and charging sites vandalized, illustrating growing unease over Musk’s influence over the president and the efforts of his cost-cutting task force.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for more information.","summary":"Trump says that the world’s richest man is being treated ‘very unfairly’ amid Tesla’s sales and share price slump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/musk-donations-trump-tesla-maga-pac-b2713624.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/12/11/28/Trump-3cbgbimv.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/s4bY4C1t-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-12 12:08:10","author":"James Liddell","authors":["James Liddell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":299561876,"title":"Jill Biden Breaks Silence On Her Iconic Picture with Donald Trump—Here’s What She Said!","text":"Back in December 2024, when Donald Trump had emerged victorious over Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next American President, what made headlines beside this news was a picture of Jill Biden and Trump apparently sharing a nice moment of conversation. \n\nTrump had shared that picture as a campaign for his own brand of perfumes, which are named “Fight, Fight, Fight”. Trump uploaded his and Jill’s picture with the caption, “A Fragrance Your Enemies Can’t Resist.”\n\nThis happened at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and Trump further stated in his post, “Here are my new Trump Perfumes & Colognes! I call them Fight, Fight, Fight, because they represent us WINNING. Great Christmas gifts for the family.”\n\nThis whole act was slammed on social media with users calling the post “tacky” and “gross”. However, after a month or so, Jill Biden came forward with what actually happened. She said in an interview with The Washington Post that Trump said to her, “I had a good meeting with your husband in the Oval Office.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nTo which she replied, “Yes, because you’re both talkers.” Having a conversation essentially meant she had to lean a little toward Trump and that is what that picture got clicked. Trump then went ahead with using it for his own benefit, without bothering to take permission from the other person present in the picture.\n\nJill and Joe Biden both have often faced criticism and harsh questions regarding their polite behavior with Trump, who has evidently crossed multiple lines with them. Jill’s answer to such questions have been simple, as she said in the same Washington Post interview, “Joe and I respect our institutions, our traditions. And it’s very important to me that they continue and we. What would be the point of nastiness?”\n\nHer response made sense when looked at from the perspective of a decent couple who like to keep things courteous even with different political opinions. However, the Trumps clearly don’t share the same value as besides Donald Trump getting unnecessarily personal during his campaigns, Melania Trump has also appeared rather hostile toward the Bidens.\n\nBack in 2024, Jill Biden had reportedly invited Melania over at The White House, which she refused to accept. Melania considers that the Bidens have treated her husband rather poorly and therefore she refuses to maintain a cordial relationship with them.\n\nHowever, what Trump did with that picture of his and Jill clearly states the opposite. Keeping aside various political jabs, the Bidens have not publicly tarnished the image of the other family members of Trump, something that Donald Trump did. Melania’s actions in this light therefore seems to be coming from a pure bias towards her husband.\n\nIt is also rumored that Melania is apparently upset with the Bidens because of a raid that happened at the Mar-a-Lago residence and that was also another reason behind her deciding the offer presented by Jill Biden to visit The White House.","summary":"Jill Biden had cleared the air around her infamous picture with Donald Trump, shot at the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/jill-bidens-breaks-silence-on-her-iconic-picture-with-donald-trump-heres-what-she-said","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Donald-Trump-had-used-Jill-Bidens-picture-for-his-perfume-brands-promotion.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 11:58:57","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":299561870,"title":"Kamala Harris & Doug Emhoff’s First Date Almost Didn’t Happen—Here’s Why!","text":"Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff’s unusual romance had a rather low-key start. The duo first met on a blind date in 2013, which is quite remarkable. This was 5 years after Emhoff’s divorce from Kerstin Mackin, the movie producer.\n\nHowever, it was quite clear from the beginning that the pair were just perfect with each other. Doug Emhoff even recalled their first date during his Democratic National Convention speech in 2024.\n\nIf their meet-cute was not unconventional enough, Emhoff managed to get Kamala Harris’ phone number from a client who helped him set up with Harris. She was then serving as the attorney general of California.\n\n“I got Kamala’s voicemail, and I just started rambling. I remember trying to grab the words from the air and just put them back in my mouth, and after what seemed like far too many minutes, I hung up,” Emhoff jokingly reflected during his DNC speech (via USA Today). “Kamala saved that voicemail … and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.”\n\nDoug Emhoff wasn’t gonna exit the stage without rousing the crowd to cheer on his wife, Kamala Harris, once more. She ate it up, too. 🤣🥰 pic.twitter.com/exInSxmi50\n— flywithkamala.bsky.social (@flywithkamala) October 30, 2024\n\nKamala Harris even recalls the initial voicemail in the 2019 memoir “The Truths We Hold.” Harris wrote that even though Emhoff’s message was a bit “long and a little rambling,” she could feel that Doug was a good person. She even thought that she wanted to know him better. But, this was not the outcome Emhoff was expecting from Kamala.\n\n“[He] was pretty sure that he had ruined his chances,” Harris wrote. “The way he tells it, he thought his voicemail had been disastrous and that he’d likely never hear from me again.” Harris, however, had different plans.\n\nDoug Emhoff’s snafu did not bother Harris because she saw something in him. As Kamala Harris commented on “CBS Sunday Morning” in 2021, she actually found his message very endearing. “It was adorable,” Harris said with a smile. “I mean, the thing about Doug is that he is exactly who he is. He’s just fully authentic and clear about the things he cares about. And it’s family, it’s his work … and me.”\n\nKamala Harris even admitted that the friend who set them up with each other said not to Google Doug, but she did that anyway. However, she liked whatever she found. Eventually, Harris called Doug back, and their chemistry kicked off instantly. Harris wrote in her memoir “The Truths We Hold” that their conversation seemed easy and smooth, which led to a nice dinner date. Harris and Emhoff got along really well, and they wanted to take their relationship seriously.\n\nSo about that time @KamalaHarris googled me before our first date. pic.twitter.com/3qzUpjWgyl\n— Doug Emhoff (@DouglasEmhoff) August 15, 2024\n\n“The morning after our first date, Doug emailed me with a list of his available dates for the next couple of months,” Harris recalled in her memoir, adding that Emhoff wrote in the email, “‘I’m too old to play games or hide the ball … I really like you, and I want to see if we can make this work.'” Their relationship took off from there, and Harris soon met Emhoff’s kids, Cole and Ella. Since then, they have been a contented and happy family.","summary":"Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff did not just meet, they had a modern love story","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/kamala-harris-doug-emhoffs-first-date-almost-didnt-happen-heres-why","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kamala-Harris-Was-Asked-NOT-to-Google-Doug-Emhoff-After-Their-Unconventional-First-Meeting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 11:40:04","author":"Shrobana Rakshit","authors":["Shrobana Rakshit"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.069},{"id":299372526,"title":"Rosie O’Donnell Moves to Ireland, Vows Not to Return Until ‘Equal Rights’ Are Restored","text":"Rosie O’Donnell has officially relocated to Ireland, citing Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election as the reason for her departure.\n\nRosie O’Donnell Leaves U.S. Over Political Climate\n\nIn a TikTok video on Tuesday, the comedian confirmed she left America on Jan. 15, just days before Trump was sworn in as president.\n\n“I’m here in Ireland, and it’s been pretty wonderful.

Harris was seen in her comfy clothes, hair tied in a bun as she opened a bag of Doritos in a bowl. “Oscar watch prep party,” Doug wrote on X.\n\nOscars watch party prep. pic.twitter.com/vOU3D1jubQ\n— Doug Emhoff (@DouglasEmhoff) March 2, 2025\n\nAbout a week later, Harris has expressed her love for Doritos again, but this time, it’s in the middle of an AI conference. The former VP attended the HumanX conference at the Fontainebleau Las Vegas on Sunday. She tried to make a point about DoorDash and affordable housing by somehow connecting it to her favorite snack. \n\nDuring the on-stage conversation with Nuno Sebastiao, CEO of data science company Feedzai, she told about ordering food on DoorDash while watching Oscars at the comfort of her home. \n\nKamala Harris said, “We did DoorDash ’cause I wanted Doritos. And the red carpet part was about to start and nobody wanted to leave to go to the grocery store. So it was DoorDash … So I was willing to give up whatever might be the tracking of Kamala Harris’ particular fondness for nacho cheese Doritos for the sake of getting a big bag of Doritos as I watched the Oscars.”\n\n“And that’s right. But here’s the thing: At what point do we also uplift and highlight the consumer’s right to also expect — and you can debate with me if it should be a right — I think it should,” she continued.\n\nTrying to explain the benefit of technology and AI with the help of a snack, the failed 2024 Democratic presidential candidate said, “To expect that the innovation would also be weighted in terms of solving their everyday problems, which are beyond my craving for Doritos, but about whatever — and I know the work is happening — around, you know, scientific discoveries, for example, to cure longstanding diseases.”\n\nSuddenly changing the subject from technology to affordable housing, she said, “But I’m going to throw out another one. I would love it if there would be an investment of resources in solving the affordable housing issue in America. Like, help me with that. Help me with that.”\n\nThe former VP’s statement has now left people cracking up. Sharing the clip from the conference, an X user wrote, “75 million people voted for this person. Never forget that.” Conservative pundit Matt Walsh replied, “Imagine if we had to endure four years of Doritos anecdotes.”\n\nImagine if we had to endure four years of Doritos anecdotes https://t.co/FPYCTlVHMT\n— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) March 11, 2025\n\nSomeone tweeted, “How drunk was she at this?” A similar tweet reads, “Kamala Harris tries to explain what scientific innovation looks like and it sounds like the dumbest thing imaginable. She’s three glasses of wine deep.”\n\n“I would do pay per view to watch her have to explain advanced mathematics and physics.

Things started to shift for James during the most recent U.S presidential election.\n\n“I was so certain that Kamala [Harris] was going to win, I couldn't even fathom them electing Donald Trump again.

Trump, the reality showman and business tycoon who has become US president twice. One particular group that have become prominent are the aggrieved and estranged. Former employees who were given their marching orders after brief spells in Trump’s administration have made a career in podcasting and punditry about the man whose bilious orbit they seemingly cannot escape. A common theme to their recent criticism is that of his mental health. Trump, we are told, is unhinged.\n\nThe aggrieved, war-loving John Bolton, who had spells in the administration of George W. Bush and a brief one as Trump’s national security advisor, has been particularly noisy in pushing the mental illness hypothesis. When asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins whether Trump’s claim that Russia’s Vladimir Putin was not a dictator could be seen as a negotiating ploy, Bolton would have none of it. “I think it’s an indication his mind is full of mush, and he says whatever comes into it. He believes Vladimir Putin is his friend, and you know, you don’t call your friends [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy] a dictator.”\n\nBolton also falls for the old, almost laughable mistake when trying to understand Trump: that facts necessarily matter in that world. When Trump met the current Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lieutenant General Dan Caine, in Iraq during his first term, the president offered a rather different account to that of Bolton’s. The former claimed that Caine had told him that the campaign against Daesh/ISIS could be “finished in one week”, that he sported a Make America Great Again hat, and claimed he would “kill” for the president.\n\nAccompanying Trump on that visit, Bolton was adamant: “There was no chance that Trump had a conversation with General Caine that bore any resemblance to what he’s described. I never saw Caine wear a MAGA hat.”\n\nIn a contest between who to trust, Bolton or Trump, Bolton might just prevail.\n\nAnother former employee who has reiterated similar points about Trump’s mental decline is Anthony Scaramucci, who spent a mere 11 days in the first Trump administration as communications director before being sacked. After being a firm loyalist, the born again commentator and financier known as the Mooch could claim confidently to Vanity Fair in 2019 that Trump was “crazy, everything about him is terrible.”\n\nOPINION: Beyond Western hegemony: A call for Middle Eastern media autonomy\n\nHaving failed in spectacular fashion, along with fellow pundits, to read the premonitory signs of a Trump victory over Kamala Harris, he has returned to the theme of the mad man, or at least the ill man. Some of these views were expressed just prior to a visit to the White House by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. In the Off Air… with Jane and Fi podcast, Scaramucci took it as given that, “Trump’s obviously got something wrong with him. I would say to Keir Starmer the guy is unwell and he’s surrounded by willing sycophants that want to pretend he’s not unwell.” One did not need to be “a rocket scientist to know that something’s wrong.”\n\nWhile it did not come from one of the estranged or aggrieved, the most telling remark about Trump’s health was offered by Democratic political consultant and strategist James Carville. In a video posted online, Carville felt speculatively adventurous after the turbulent 28 February meeting between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart, President Zelenskyy. “I want to seek the possibility that maybe I had a point considerably earlier than this when I pointed out on this very channel that Trump had red splotches on his hand which I was told by a number of medical professionals that when you see that condition the first thing you suspect is syphilis.” There you have it. Analysis can end, here and now.\n\nMany of these criticisms stem from dross from the first Trump administration, when opinion pieces questioning the man’s faculties and sanity became a feature.\n\nOften, they were slipshod and lazy, seduced by the Trump canard. Trump derangement syndrome is, after all, a hard thing to shake. His effect on US politics and its analysis has been so profound as to turn critics and commentators into replicates of his dislike of factual analysis. Just as book reviewers, as Cyril Connolly remarked, are bound to have their critical faculties blunted by the poor quality of books available for review, Trump as both subject and method has cut through the undergrowth of sensible discourse. The illness hypothesis is yet another example of this.\n\nEmbracing such a proposition avoids the more fundamental point about Trump: that he does know more than you think about what he wants and how he wants to achieve it. He is most certainly a disturbed human being, infantilised, insecure and prone to hazes of narcissism, but he can hardly be dismissed as a person without certain cerebral functions.\n\nWith a vengeful conviction lacking in his first iteration, he is shaping aspects of US government that are both remarkable and disconcerting. On the international stage, he has finally stripped bare the cant pursued by the liberal and neoconservative internationalists who insist on a policing role for Washington in the name of “rules”. For them, the messianic role of the United States will guard the world against such nasties as rule-bending autocrats. The MAGA philosophy has its dangers and problems, but the mental illness of its chief proponent is not one of them.\n\nOPINION: UK recognised Hamas’s right to armed resistance 32 years ago, British documents reveal\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.","summary":"The critics are utterly beside themselves in trying to understand the bruising twists and turns of Donald J.

They use them a lot in the news now. Everybody’s talking this, they’re saying this, the end of — what is the big one now, it’s constitutional something or other.”\n\n“The reason the Democrats have a hard time prosecuting this case and making Americans care as much as they should have is because there’s a version, a slighter, less damaging, less threatening to the Constitution version of all of it that the Democrats know,” countered Maher.\n\n“Everything is a slippery slope. Trump’s a king! Yeah, they all try to act like kings to a degree.
