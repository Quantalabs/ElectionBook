On Monday, they took on the red carpet.\n\nReigning WNBA champions Jonquel Jones, Sabrina Ionescu and Breanna Stewart joined Liberty co-owner Clara Wu Tsai at the Met Gala, adding to the spectacle celebrating “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” on the Upper East Side.\n\nThe Liberty party all donned coordinating black-and-white outfits by designer Sergio Hudson and stylist Courtney Mays and prepped for the event at The Surrey hotel.\n\nJones, Ionescu and Stewart all sported power suits — a signature of Hudson’s design — while Tsai wore a strapless black mermaid crepe gown with her own Liberty-colored jewelry along with a Tyler Ellis clutch and Saint Laurent shoes.\n\nJones, the reigning Finals MVP, wore a crocodile-print leather jacket with black crepe bootcut trousers. She accessorized with a Hublot watch, Jennifer Behr hair accessories, Magnanni Shoes and Saidian Vintage Jewels.\n\nIonescu was decked out in a white crop top, long black skirt and a black tailcoat tuxedo jacket lined in white. She also had on Stephen Russell jewels, a Sondra Roberts bag and Jimmy Choo shoes.\n\nStewart, who added a third WNBA championship to her resume last fall, wore a custom ivory tuxedo paired with an AP watch, Saint Laurent boots, Spinelli Kilcolin earrings and rings, Edward Avedis brooches and a Monrowe hat.\n\nAll three still looked like champions as they near the start of their quest to defend their title.\n\n“Basketball taught me how to be comfortable in my skin. Fashion lets me tell that story in a different language — one that speaks to legacy, to detail, to presence,” Stewart said in a statement via the Liberty. “Wearing Sergio Hudson tonight felt like honoring craft and culture at the same time, and recognizing the deeper history this year’s theme invites us to reflect on. And honestly, that’s what we do on the court too. We show up with intention, carry history forward, and make it our own.” \n\n“It’s an honor to represent our team, women’s basketball, and our fans at the Met Gala — in the city where we made history,” Jones added. “This is a powerful moment and I’m so proud to be wearing Sergio Hudson on the carpet — a visionary Black designer and a powerful force in the fashion industry who has created a unique look that represents me and my style. I’ve stepped into so many spaces I never could have even imagined as a kid, and the Met Gala is no exception. I am so fortunate to be living my truth in a design that simultaneously makes me feel confident and creatively pushes boundaries. Tonight I’ll stand alongside my fellow champions — Clara, Stewie, and Sab — and show the world that women athletes both belong in and dominate these cultural spaces.” \n\nHudson previously dressed Michelle Obama and vice president Kamala Harris for Inauguration Day in 2021.\n\nThe Liberty start the festivities again at Barclays Center in their first preseason game on May 9 against the Sun.\n\nThe regular season kicks off in less than two weeks on Saturday, May 17 and they will host the Aces, who the Liberty lost to in the 2023 WNBA Finals.","summary":"The Liberty took on the Canyon of Heroes in October after winning their first franchise title.

Don’t be surprised if former Vogue editor-at-large André Leon Talley’s ghost haunts the party and trips a few people on the steps.\n\nAnna Wintour may have turned herself into the Met’s eternal gatekeeper—her name now permanently etched on the Costume Institute—but the event’s legacy is looking more cursed than curated. While it’s raised millions for the museum, it’s also raised micro-bladed eyebrows for the company it has kept.\n\n(I attended once, to support Oprah who was co-chairing. When I went to the loo the bathroom was full of models who having done the obligatory red carpet were plotting their escape from their advertiser overlords. I was home by 10.15pm. It ended surprisingly early for a New York gala.)\n\nLet’s rewind two years when Sean “Diddy” Combs paused on the Met steps to launch his so-called couture collection. Today, Combs doesn’t have much choice about what to wear. He’s held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn charged with sex trafficking and racketeering, which he denies. Jury selection for his trial started today as his lawyers scrambled to find a potential juror who hasn’t seen the hotel surveillance video—released by CNN—that shows Combs violently attacking his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, another former Met Gala attendee, also can’t make it to this year’s event. Like Combs, she’s in prison having been found guilty of sex trafficking a minor. Her 2003 all-denim ensemble is gathering dust along with her reputation. \n\nHarvey Weinstein won’t be attending this year either which is good news for the potted plants. And former fashion maven Kanye West‘s invitation probably got lost in the mail now that he’s now selling $20 t-shirts with swastikas. Still, Wintour must be worried that this cringe-artist might crash the party like he did at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles in February. West wore an all-black outfit while his “wife” Bianca Censori wore her birthday suit. \n\nLesser creep Charlie Rose was a fixture at the gala until he wasn’t. Same for Bruce Weber and Mario Testino—photographers once worshipped by the glossy elite, now sidelined after each were the subject of multiple MeToo allegations. (Weber settled with his accusers; Testino denied wrongdoing.)\n\nLast week Riccardo Tisci, the former creative head of both Givenchy and Burberry, was accused of sexual assault and drugging a man. He denies it. Alexander Wang, another darling of the Vogue circle, called similar allegations of abuse “baseless.“ That’s the thing about the Met Gala: it gives air cover to those with the right stylist and the right connections.\n\nEven the most powerful now seem wary. LeBron James, who once found himself awkwardly gracing the cover of Vogue with a wide-eyed Giselle Bündchen in a spread many deemed racially tone-deaf, suddenly bowed out of this year’s festivities, citing, of all things, a knee injury, despite being its honorary co-chair. Meanwhile, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk opted out entirely—perhaps realizing that they shouldn’t attend an event when its hostess has publicly banned their boss Donald Trump from attending. \n\nTo be fair, the gala remains a fundraising juggernaut, netting tens of millions for the Met Museum and its Anna Wintour Costume Center. But in the process, it has made fools of many in their breathless quest to be the most clicked-on person in the room. \n\nThis year’s crowd has its share of bona fide celebrities: Diana Ross, Demi Moore, Anne Hathaway and Miley Cyrus for starters. But they rubbed shoulders with an influx of twenty-something social media stars paid for showing off their borrowed diamonds. This group seems less interested in honoring art and fashion history and more obsessed with snagging a viral moment. One influencer stood on the Met steps live-streaming for six hours. Another collapsed in what turned out to be a calculated faint.\n\nThis isn’t fashion. It’s performance art with a publicist. And the devil is still wearing Prada.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/GettyOnce the crown jewel of fashion’s social calendar, the Met Gala has officially devolved into a pageant of Pick Me energy—an orgy of try-hard looks and desperate influencer posing, now dominated by the TikTok generation’s endless thirst for attention.\n\nThis year’s theme, “Black Dandy,” was chosen with all the subtlety of a Balenciaga combat boot at a point when DEI was still in fashion and it looked as though then-Vice President Kamala Harris might win.\n\nBut the irony is thicker than Kim Kardashian’s lip liner: a celebration of Black male tailoring, from a Vogue editor who spent decades rarely supporting Black designers and rarely featuring Black talent on the cover of her magazine.

Miller.\n\nIt will be the first time the event is entirely dedicated to designers of color, and specifically focuses on the way black men have used fashion as a tool to challenge stereotypes, and command respect.\n\nBut on her show Monday, Kelly slammed Wintour for picking the controversial theme, saying she was just trying to turn everyone's attention away from 'being America's biggest snob.' \n\n'Anna Wintour's so white and her partner who's like organizing this whole thing with her, also a white guy, decided that - they realized that they would take a hit if they were to plan this, so they brought in - it very much feels like black tokenism to me - a focus group of black fashion elites, allegedly, and also just well-known black people like Angel Reese, of the WNBA, to like give them the imprint of approval,' she said.\n\n'And some of these folks had, like, meetings at the Apollo Theater, the New York Times wants us to know, they went to the Apollo Theater to plan out tonight's Met Gala... as they tried to pay homage to black fashion,' Kelly continued.\n\nThe host of the Megyn Kelly Show then went on to suggest that Wintour chose the theme after receiving years of bad press coverage for 'how disgustingly excessive and over the top this showing of wealth is, where the plates go for over $70,000 a ticket.'\n\nKelly then claimed that she has personally witnessed crude acts inside the bathrooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, which she said is 'making a mockery of this place that is supposed to house some of our greatest works.'\n\n'So now they've decided to try to get over this reputation of Anna Wintour being America's biggest snob, and this thing being the most over-the-top, elitist, evil event by pandering to blacks,' the former Fox News host concluded. \n\nAlong with Wintour, co-chairs, including Lewis Hamilton, ASAP Rocky, Colman Domingo and Pharrell Williams and honorary chair LeBron James will be running the event.\n\nIt has already received some backlash as Wintour -who controls every aspect of the guest list, ultimately deciding who is 'in' and who is 'out' - decided to snub anyone associated with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe president has been disinvited from the star-studded event since 2017, even though he and the First Lady regularly attended the gala in the past - and Trump even proposed to her in April 2004 on their way over there.\n\nFirst Buddy Elon Musk as well as Trump allies Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg have also reportedly been denied a seat at the gala, according to the New York Times.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that other more liberal political figures, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be in attendance. \n\nThere is even a rumor circulating that former Vice President Kamala Harris might make an appearance as well, an unidentified source told the Times. \n\nYet Wintour has claimed that the show 'was never about politics - not in conception, not now.'\n\nInstead, she said it is really about 'self-determination, beauty, creativity and holding up a lens to history.'\n\nStill, Wintour claimed that this year's theme has a 'heightened meaning in 2025' because it is 'recognizing and taking seriously the contributions of black designers and the black community in fashion.'\n\nCultural critic Louis Piscano also said: 'This feels way bigger than just fashion.' \n\n'Putting black style front and center sends a real message,' he stated, adding: 'It’s important that we don’t sit this one out.' \n\nPiscano said he's 'already bracing for the conservative backlash' the event will get, but that is 'why it’s especially important that people show up.","summary":"Megyn Kelly slammed Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour for what she described as 'hyper-pandering' and 'black tokenism' with this year's Met Gala theme.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14681013/Megyn-Kelly-Anna-Wintour-Met-Gala.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/05/23/98060283-0-image-m-1_1746483282159.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 23:32:01","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":318190890,"title":"Conservatives mock Dem rhetoric about 'oligarchy' as NYC living room pic of Alex Soros and Abedin goes viral","text":"Conservatives skewered an online photo of liberal megadonor Alex Soros and former Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

No one gets a free pass, not even the vice president.\"Harris has been granted a special exemption to bring her guards inside the gala itself, a permission denied for stars like Beyonce, Kim Kardashian or Taylor Swift. Their staffers need to wait outside.\n\nThe insider explained: \"(Organizers) don’t want entourages, they want elegance. Having a swarm of agents inside the exhibit space ruins the fantasy.\"\n\nLittle is yet known about her actual plans, including, most importantly, what Harris is planning to wear to the gala. However, just her looming presence – and security footprint – is already a hot topic.\n\n\"It’s one thing to allow Secret Service,\" another source told Shuter. \"But if she tries to bring the full detail into the cocktail hour? Forget it.\"Rumors that the former second couple are getting ready to meet the Met were only fueled by their big date night Sunday at swanky Manhattan hotspot The Polo Bar.\n\nThe venue is extremely popular with celebrities and known as one of the toughest reservations to get in New York. Seats at the Ralph Lauren-owned bar are released roughly a month in advance, and the dress code is strict.\n\nIt's not known when exactly Harris made her reservation, but she rolled up to the club flanked by several Secret Service agents who stood by as they dined for about two hours. Many more agents were waiting outside to secure the entrance.\n\nFellow diners and witnesses dished there were at least 25 Secret Service bodyguards plus NYPD officers, and a motorcade of four bulletproof cars and three additional SUVs – all for Harris.Gala organizers had already beefed up security around the event, but not for just Harris. RadarOnline.com reported the heightened security at the Metropolitan Museum of Art comes amid growing concerns that Kanye West could attempt to crash the event – despite not being invited.\n\nA Met Gala insider revealed: \"Anna is not messing around. There's a full protocol in place if Kanye is spotted anywhere near the carpet.\"\n\nThe alarm bells started ringing after the rapper-turned-provocateur posted a disturbing sketch online of a KKK-inspired ensemble he claimed he'd wear to the event.\n\nThe offensive design featured a pointed hood and bare chest – triggering widespread backlash and major concern among Met Gala organizers.\n\nA high-level fashion security expert said: \"It's not just about the outfit – it's about the chaos he brings.

Telnaes accused them of having lucrative government contracts and working to eliminate regulations. Amazon also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund.\n\nWhen she quit the newspaper earlier this year, Telnaes that she'd never before had a sketch killed because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. She called that a game-changer and dangerous for a free press.\n\n“As an editorial cartoonist, my job is to hold powerful people and institutions accountable,” Telnaes wrote on the online platform Substack in early January. “For the first time, my editor prevented me from doing that critical job. So I have decided to leave the Post. I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it will be dismissed because I’m just a cartoonist. But I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say ‘Democracy dies in darkness.’”\n\nDavid Shipley, the newspaper’s editorial page editor at the time, said in a statement after Telnaes quit that he decided to nix the cartoon because the paper had just published a column on the same topic. Shipley then resigned in late February after Bezos, in a major shift, directed that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market.\n\nThe fallout continued in March when a longtime columnist, Ruth Marcus, quit after she said the newspaper’s management decided not to run her commentary critical of Bezos’ policy. \n\nThe Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years, Its internal strife largely began last June when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists have since left for other jobs.\n\nBezos’ decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate — after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris — led to an exodus of subscribers.","summary":"A longtime editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post who quit in protest after editors killed her sketch of the newspaper’s owner and other media executives bowing before President Donald Trump, has won the Pulitzer Prize for illustrated reporting and commentary","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trump-new-york-maralago-b2745318.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/05/23/Pulitzer_Prizes_Commentary_63934.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 22:05:26","author":"Lisa Baumann","authors":["Lisa Baumann"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":318169718,"title":"Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nTrump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs\n\nTrump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n\"We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations\"\n\n(Image credit: Eric Thayer / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US \n\nWhat happened\nChina vowed this week it would \"never kneel down\" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks\" and \"Covid-like shortages for consumers.\" That slowdown, Slok said, would result in \"significant\" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate \"substantial\" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. \"Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst,\" China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video.\n\nA report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a \"hostile and political act.\" The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and \"was never approved.\" Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and \"solved the problem very quickly,\" praising him as a \"good guy\" who \"did the right thing.\"\nTrump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a \"short term\" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately \"slaughter\" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" he said. \"Everything's going to be just fine.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. \"It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them.\" Amazon should have stuck with its \"brilliant tariff idea,\" saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but \"instead of owning its policy,\" the White House \"bullied Amazon to keep quiet.\" What is Trump afraid of?\n\nWhat the columnists said\nSmall businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've \"been stunned into paralysis\" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then \"disappeared overnight,\" and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer.\nConsumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But \"boatloads of pain\" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs \"might steal Christmas,\" said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production \"has ground to a halt,\" and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months.\nTrump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic \"golden age.\" Instead, his \"chaotic\" tariffs are \"shaking the foundations\" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden \"overhang.\" But \"every American\" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\"We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations,\" said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, \"until it didn't.\" Right now, \"the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis,\" the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, \"the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus.\"\n\nTrump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly \"inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment.\" Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is \"more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war.\" And the Chinese have \"tools at hand to hit America's economy where it hurts, including the withholding of critical minerals and key inputs to America's industrial value chains.\" In short, \"Beijing believes time is on its side,\" so if there's going to be a retreat in the trade war, \"it will need to come from Trump.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nA newly created gasoline giant in the Americas could change the industry landscape\n\nThe Explainer\nSunoco and Parkland are two of the biggest fuel suppliers in the US and Canada, respectively\n\nHarvard stares down Trump's tax threat as other Ivies take note\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nHigher ed is on high alert as the nation's premier university prepares to take on the fight of its life\n\nWhat to know about Real IDs, America's new identification cards\n\nThe Explainer\nPeople without a Real ID cannot board a commercial flight as of May 7, 2025\n\nYou might also like\n\nHarvard stares down Trump's tax threat as other schools take note\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nHigher ed is on high alert as the nation's premier university prepares to take on the fight of its life\n\nTrump is not sure he must follow the Constitution\n\nWhen asked about due process for migrants in a TV interview, President Trump said he didn't know whether he had to uphold the Fifth Amendment\n\nTrump's first 100 days: the reshaping of America\n\nTalking Point\nThe second Trump White House is 'less a new administration', and more a 'vengeful monarchy'\n\nTrump moves to gut PBS and NPR in latest salvo against the media\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nThe president's executive order targeting two of the nation's largest public broadcasters comes as the White House seeks to radically reframe how Americans get their news\n\nTrump judge bars deportations under 1798 law\n\nA Trump appointee has ruled that the president's use of a wartime act for deportations is illegal\n\nTrump ousts Waltz as NSA, taps him for UN role\n\nPresident Donald Trump removed Mike Waltz as national security adviser and nominated him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nHow could Trump ending a VA mortgage program leave veterans on the streets?\n\nToday's Big Question\nVets could face foreclosure as a result of the White House's actions\n\nKamala Harris steps back on center stage\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nIn her first major speech since Donald Trump took office, the former presidential candidate took solid aim at this administration as speculation grows about her future\n\nView More ▸\n\nContact Future's experts\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nThe Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The first one came late Friday evening when he posted an AI image of himself as the Pope after he had previously joked that he would like to replace the late Pope Francis.\n\nThen on Sunday, Trump threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on foreign films, supposedly to save the American film industry and address an unexpected “security threat.” \n\n“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda,” Trump said on Truth Social. \n\nLastly, late in the evening, Trump entertained the idea of re-opening Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island off the coast of San Francisco, which closed in 1963 – largely because it was too expensive to operate, according to the Bureau of Prisons. \n\n“When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be,” he said on Truth Social. Alcatraz is now a national park managed by the National Park Service and would likely be preserved by the National Historic Preservation Act. \n\nIt later emerged that a local TV station in Florida, where Trump was at the time, had broadcast the Clint Eastwood movie Escape From Alcatraz, shortly before the president’s statement about the famous prison.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough, the official White House X account commemorated May 4th, Star Wars Day, with an image of Trump with a lightsaber, though, tellingly with a red blade, the color of the villainous Sith lords.\n\nThis came the same weekend that Trump had a largely disastrous interview with Meet The Press’s Kristen Welker, wherein he said he did not know if he had to uphold the US Constitution as his administration conducts its mass deportation strategy. \n\nIn the same interview, Trump repeated his threat to annex Greenland through military force. He also brushed off fears about a recession ignited by his trade war with China. \n\n“Anything can happen. But I think we're going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country. I think we're going have the greatest economic boom in history,” he said. \n\nThis came despite the fact that many economic indicators show warning signs of a recession. Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed that 58.9 percent of Texas business executives said that the tariffs would have a negative effect on business. \n\nBy contrast, only 5.5 percent of them said that in response to tariffs, they would relocate their business to the United States, compared to 54.7 percent who said they would pass the cost onto consumers. \n\nAll of this comes as Trump’s approval rating has taken a significant nosedive amid his global trade war. A CNN/SSRS poll showed he had a 41 percent approval rating after his first 100 days, while a poll from The Washington Post and ABC News showed he had a 39 percent approval rating. \n\nOverall, Trump has the worst showing for a president after the first 100 days at least since the end of the Second World War. \n\nFor his part, Vice President JD Vance defended the president during an interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier amid the negative numbers.\n\n“I’m a firm believer that in the modern era, 2025, opinion pollsters don’t know how to capture most Americans,” Vance said on Fox, saying that many pollsters showed that Kamala Harris, Vance’s predecessor in the job, would beat Trump in November. \n\nTrump has taken it a step further, even saying that pollsters should “be investigated for election fraud.” \n\n“They are Negative Criminals who apologize to their subscribers and readers after I WIN ELECTIONS BIG, much bigger than their polls showed I would win, loose a lot of credibility, and then go on cheating and lying for the next cycle, only worse,” he said. \n\nIt is true that many pollsters missed Trump’s strength during election years. But polls during election years and general approval ratings are quite different.\n\nIn fact, with Trump off the ballot, Republicans might find themselves in a worse spot in the 2026 midterms. On Monday, Georgia’s popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced that he would not run against Democratic incumbent Senator Jon Ossoff, likely knowing the environment would be tough should Kemp want to eventually run for president in the future. \n\nTrump’s increasingly erratic behavior and posts are not a distraction. As anyone who has covered him knows, they are often the point. But at a certain moment, they show that Trump sees fewer options to win over persuadable voters and will instead seek to appeal to his most faithful.","summary":"Between posting about Star Wars, suggesting reopening Alcatraz and imposing tariffs on movies, the president is looking increasingly desperate, writes Eric Garcia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-truth-social-tariffs-approva-b2745128.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/05/6/29/President-Trump-Returns-To-The-White-House-After-Weekend-In-Florida-862sit11.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HBtywPGh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-05 21:14:55","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":318191342,"title":"Whitmer celebrates Selfridge, says she'll work with Trump on common ground priorities - Detroit Free Press","text":"Gov. Gretchen Whitmer spoke with members of the Macomb County Chamber, Connect Macomb at luncheon in Shelby Township.Whitmer celebrates new fighter jets promised to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, talks roads, compromise across political aisle.\n\nHigh off the news that Selfridge Air National Guard Base will receive 21 new fighter jets, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told Macomb County's elected officials and community and business leaders that she is committed to working with President Donald Trump's administration \"on any priority we can find common ground on.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to pretend that that's always going to be possible. I know that's the case. But Michiganders elected both of us — twice, just two years apart. And I know from looking at this room that you all expect us to get things done,\" she told the hundreds who attended the 2025 Governor's Luncheon on May 5 presented by the Macomb County Chamber and Connect Macomb in Shelby Township.\n\nWhitmer, a Democrat, told the crowd that even though she \"took some heat\" for taking a meeting recently with the Republican Trump to discuss the future of Selfridge, she said she was grateful to people in the county — mentioning Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller, a Republican and former U.S. representative — who lent their voices to the effort, adding to the county's legacy of supporting defense.\n\nWhitmer was at the Harrison Township base April 29 and greeted Trump, who was celebrating the first 100 days of his second term in the county with a campaign-style rally in Warren. Before heading to the city just north of Detroit, he announced the base would receive 21 F-15EX fighter jets.\n\nFor nearly a decade, base leaders and officials in both parties at all levels of government have advocated for new fighter jets at the more-than-century-old military airfield to secure the base and its related jobs. County Executive Mark Hackel introduced Whitmer at the chamber event while wearing a red Selfridge jersey.\n\nWhitmer said there is \"a lot of uncertainty for a lot of different reasons. But for us to be able to say we know what the future of Selfridge is, is a big, BFD.\" The win protects 30,000 jobs across Michigan; 5,000 military families and hundreds of millions in economics for the state, according to her office.\n\nAfter her speech, Whitmer told reporters that during the Oval Office visit, where she was caught in a photo briefly hiding behind file folders in front of her face: \"I needed to be there to make the case for Selfridge. That's why I was there. I was there for people in northern Michigan, who we don't yet have a federal declaration, but I'm continuing to try to get the Trump administration to give us federal dollars for the recovery from the ice storm in northern Michigan.\"\n\nShe said she can mark Selfridge off her list, but is waiting to hear about the federal dollars, saying \"we got an extension, but we've not heard on the substance of a FEMA claim.\"\n\nWhitmer said she's got a list of things the state needs from the federal government. She worked hard for Trump's Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in the last election \"and yet, as soon as the election's over, I can't sacrifice the Michigan agenda. I've got a duty to continue to work with whomever is there and I will do that. So, we have the threat of Asian carp in our Great Lakes. We've got emergency funding for northern Michigan that we're trying to get done. There is economic development opportunities for the state (and) federal partnership is absolutely essential. So, there are a lot of things that are on my list and I'm going to continue to try to work on with the Trump administration.\"\n\nWhitmer also told reporters she believes Michigan lawmakers can get the budget and a road funding plan done \"posthaste,\" ideally by the end of June.\n\nRegarding ongoing road work on Interstate 696, she said: \"I know it's a pain right now, but we're repaving it to last for the long run. So, I'm sorry and you're welcome.\"\n\nDuring a question after her less than 15-minute speech, Whitmer said she recognizes the need for a stronger mass transit system throughout southeast Michigan, in particular, saying: \"And that's something Lansing's not going to be the one to tell you what it should look like, you've got to be the ones. But we need to be there to support and that's what my goal is. I hope that by the time I'm done, we have a real great plan for transit in southeast Michigan in particular.\"\n\nIn a post-speech scrum with reporters, Whitmer, when asked about efforts to bring back moviemaking incentives to the state, said: \"I think the possibility of major cuts from the federal government and Medicaid, the potential of rural hospitals not surviving Medicaid slashing that is going to happen at the federal government, will make it a lot harder to justify any additional spending with the Legislature. I'm just being very pragmatic about that. I'm hopeful that Congress does not slash Medicaid.\"\n\nShe said 40% of the state budget \"would be devastated.\"\n\n\"We can't afford to offset 40% of our budget,\" she said. \"That will mean hospitals will close in Michigan if all of that comes to fruition. There are hospitals that have 70% of their patients are Medicaid. ... They could not survive that. That is a very real possibility.\"\n\nContact Christina Hall: chall@freepress.com.

What started a row over this was the huge entourage of policemen who were on security duty for the former VP and the former second husband. Apart from 25 secret Service agents, there were NYPD officers either flanking the couple or waiting outside where four bulletproof cars and three additional SUVs were stationed. \"Secret Service is fine; NYPD, no. NYPD needs to protect the people, we don't have enough of them,\" Republican NYC mayoral candidate Curtis Silwa said to DailyMail.com. \"She's going to a bar to enjoy herself, and she's got an army of security paid for by us, not her.\" As a former vice president, Harris and her family are entitled to federally funded protection for about six months after leaving office. Silwa said the Secret Service was doing its job, but the heavy police presence should have been paid by the couple for their night out. \"It's unbelievable... there were probably more security officers between the feds and the NYPD than there were patrons inside,\" Silwa said. The Polo Bar is known for its exorbitant prices and also for its exclusivity. The jaunt which was opened 10 years ago as part of Ralph Lauren's foray into hospitality is a favorite among the celebrities. Bookings are generally made over the phone, a month before. Kamala Harris's costly appearance came just ahead of Met Gala which she may attend. Her expensive outing came amid speculations over hernext political step, which she soft-launched in her searing attack on President Donald Trump at a recent speaking event. \"President Trump and his administration and their allies are counting on the notion that fear can be contagious,\" Harris said in her first major speech after her election defeat -- on the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America. \"What they are overlooking is that fear is not the only thing that's contagious, courage is contagious,\" she said.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-spotted-at-nyc-hotspot-with-husband-doug-emhoff-row-over-nypd-officers-waiting-outside/articleshow/120910359.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-120910363/120910363.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 20:59:03","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":318168756,"title":"Trump ordering '100% tariff' on all movies produced abroad","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump is ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being \"devastated\" by a trend of U.S. filmmakers and studios working abroad.\n\nThe announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe.\n\n\"I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump's missive, saying \"We're on it.\"\n\nNo details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented.\n\nTrump's post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the U.S. president's combative trade policies with 145 percent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of U.S. films it imported.\n\n\"The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death. Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,\" Trump wrote Sunday.\n\n\"Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated,\" he added, claiming that production being drawn to other countries was a \"National Security threat.\"\n\nThe implications for the movie industry -- or how exactly the tariffs would be enacted -- were not immediately clear.\n\nThere was also no mention in Trump's post of whether television series, an increasingly popular and profitable sector of production for the screen, would be affected.\n\nHollywood is a major sector of the United States' economy, generating more than 2.3 million jobs and $279 billion in sales in 2022, according to the latest data from the Motion Picture Association.\n\nBut in the wake of the Hollywood strikes and the COVID pandemic impacts -- which changed how Americans consumed movies, opting to watch at home instead of in theaters -- the industry is still struggling to regain its momentum, industry insiders say.\n\nAccording to a January report by production tracking service ProdPro, the United States is a top filming hub with $14.5 billion in production spend -- though that amount is a 26 percent drop compared to two years earlier.\n\nHowever, a survey of studio executives revealed that their top five preferred production locations for 2025 and 2026 were all outside of the United States, due to competitive tax incentive schemes on offer.\n\nFirst was Toronto, followed by Britain, Vancouver, Central Europe and then Australia. California came in at sixth place.\n\nAhead of his inauguration in January, Trump appointed longstanding supporters Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as special envoys to Hollywood.\n\nHe said they would make the entertainment industry \"STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nTrump and the Republicans have traditionally received scant support from the entertainment industry, and a galaxy of stars from Taylor Swift to George Clooney backed Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump is ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being &quot;devastated&quot; by a trend of U.S. filmmakers and…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/trump-says-ordering-%27100-tariff%27-on-all-movies-produced-abroad","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/e1/a1/d76b9fc65e87d4e76dfe548e56d91355cd2c/eba400fe2c0c308d5ba757e27ed2e4e8b5e47621/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 20:55:14","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.103},{"id":318166566,"title":"Does Tommy Tuberville know what he's doing?","text":"The biographer Robert Caro says that power reveals. Power lets you do what you want. And your desires show who you are.\n\n After four years in the U.S. Senate, we have few doubts about what Tommy Tuberville wants.\n\n A man sent to Washington to represent Alabama spends a lot of time on television talking about President Donald Trump or his enemies. Alabama is a peripheral concern. In some cases, Tuberville takes positions that are demonstrably bad for the people here.\n\n When he’s not ignoring Alabamians, he’s embarrassing them. Tuberville in 2022 made an overtly racist assertion that Black Americans are criminals at a rally in Nevada. He also took a very long time to acknowledge that white nationalists are racists.\n\n And Tuberville appears to despise transgender people. He attacked a Space Camp employee — a private citizen — because that person was transgender. He thinks, falsely, that men somehow got into the women’s boxing events at the 2024 Olympics.\n\n Tuberville blocked military promotions for almost a year because the Biden administration wanted to help enlisted women access health care. He compared Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator and California attorney general, to a “crazy ex-girlfriend.” When U.S. Sen. Katie Britt — his Republican colleague; an experienced politico and a former leader of Alabama’s largest business group — bombed her State of the Union response last year, Tuberville said she had been “picked as a housewife.”\n\n Also, he forgot that triangles exist.\n\n And all of that is before we get to questions about whether Tuberville actually lives in Alabama; possible conflicts of interest in his stock trading and questions about one of his charities.\n\n This is the guy who’s going to clear the gubernatorial field?\n\n He might. Tuberville appears to be edging into next year’s race for governor. And Republicans seem ready to give way to him. Even the suggestion that Tuberville could run led Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate to give up plans to run for the office.\n\n The senator would, of course, be a strong candidate. Tuberville has name recognition and a record that appeals to hard core Republican primary voters.\n\n As a sitting senator, he should raise money easily. Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, another possible gubernatorial candidate, had $1.3 million in his campaign account in January compared to Tuberville’s $628,000 in March. But Ainsworth will need to spend all that and more to reach Tuberville’s levels of notoriety.\n\n There’s no doubt the senator could be our next governor.\n\n But why does Tuberville want to be governor?\n\n “If you’re the CEO of a state then you can help more in a certain amount of time,” Tuberville told Alabama Daily News in March.\n\n The Legislature, not the governor, holds the power in Alabama. The governor can do little more than make suggestions to lawmakers and sign the bills sent to her desk. If she vetoes a bill during the session, the Legislature can override her with a majority vote. She has a more effective pocket veto near the end of a session, but lawmakers can work around it.\n\n If you want to be a successful chief executive in Alabama, you must know the boundaries of the office. Occasionally you get a George Wallace with enough loyalty from voters to bend legislators to his will.\n\n More often, Alabama governors must work outside the Legislature to appear strong. This means doing things that don’t directly involve the Legislature. Like immediate response to natural disasters. Or recruiting companies to the state.\n\n Bob Riley did both to project decisiveness even as a Democratic-controlled Legislature controlled the purse strings. So does Kay Ivey, who understands where she has leverage and where she doesn’t.\n\n Robert Bentley also used that combination. But he wasted it in pointless confrontations with legislators, overestimating his power and showing the weakness of the office.\n\n Let’s hope a Gov. Tuberville does not end his career the way Bentley did. There will be plenty of ideological overlap between Tuberville and a (likely) Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\n But Tuberville’s habit of running his mouth and alienating people without forethought doesn’t bode well. In the inevitable moments when the governor clashes with lawmakers, the chief executive needs to know what the office can and can’t do. And try to get a good result and escape the fray with as much dignity as possible.\n\n One can’t assume a man who speaks like an uncle’s Facebook post has that subtle touch. If Trump gets his way on the economy and disaster aid, Tuberville will have fewer avenues to show leadership. And if a Gov. Tuberville talks to lawmakers like Sen. Tuberville treats his constituents, he will quickly learn who holds the cards.\n\n But really, he shouldn’t be sitting at the table. Power has revealed Tuberville to be shallow, spiteful and more interested in attention than the state he represents. He treats most Alabamians with contempt and views his job as an annex to a television career.\n\n And if Alabama voters, knowing all that, elevate him to another political office, what does that reveal about us?\n\nAlabama Reflector is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

He’s part of a grassroots organization that will try primarying Democrats out of office in the coming congressional elections. He’s also the vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The DNC does many things, but unseating its own people isn’t one of them.\n\nBut I think this conflict is beside the point. What David Hogg brings is something that few others bring to the party, which is an unwavering demand for competition. If the DNC is a trust, Hogg is a trust-buster. \n\nThat’s such a big problem that DNC chairman Ken Martin is now proposing a rule change that would force Hogg to quit the DNC or quit Leaders We Deserve, the group that has pledged $20 million to challenging \"out-of-touch, ineffective\" Democratic incumbents.\n\nIt’s a microcosm of larger issues that Stephen Robinson has been writing about. He publishes a newsletter called The Play Typer Guy. In this interview, we talked about Hogg, the debate over “oligarchy,” coalition-building and how the Democrats, if they win the House next year, are going to be “expected to draw some form of political blood.”\n\nJS: David Hogg wants to primary incumbent Democrats. He's also vice chair of the DNC. An apparent conflict. But the point is that he's generating energy inside the party. Given your critique of the Democrats, that would probably be a good thing in your view, right?\n\nSR: The DNC should arguably exist to provide accountability for Democrats, not simply protect the weakest and sometimes outright antagonist members. I think back to Kyrsten Sinema, and how she took an immediately hostile approach to the party. She was building a brand as a \"maverick\" while distancing herself from the party. \n\nThat's only possible in a scenario where the party accepts this treatment. Worse, in Sinema's case, no matter how bad she got, the party never took a position against her. Even when she was no longer a Democrat, the party was hesitant to support [now US Senator] Ruben Gallego over her. She had to literally drop out. That just seems sadly passive-aggressive. Democrats need to change the system.\n\nJS: So even if it's correct to say that Hogg is conflicted, he's still bringing competition to the internal functioning of a party that is very much not interested in competition. Is that fair?\n\nSR: Yes, as I mentioned in my own piece, safe districts need competition the most, because otherwise, there is no actual \"election.\" They can stay in office forever without ever engaging with the voters or adapting to new conditions, which is even more critical today.\n\nJS: Where do you stand on the debate over using the word \"oligarchy\"? Some say normal people get it. Others say it's too academic. \n\nSR: I'm writing something about this as well! A point I make is that Trump frequently called Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Democrats \"Marxists,\" which is hardly a third-grade reading level concept.\n\nI recall [US Senator] Marco Rubio back in 2021 saying, “‘social justice’ and ‘wokeness’ are just nice names for cultural Marxism, which teaches our children to hate our American history and sow division.” Notice what Rubio does: He acknowledges that “social justice” and “wokeness” sound like good things! So he directly associates it with something bad. He then clearly defines cultural Marxism on his terms. Three years later, your Fox News-watching grandmother who never attended college was reflexively calling Harris a “Marxist.”\n\nElissa Slotkin definitely stepped on a rake when she said that people didn't understand what “oligarchy” means. In a reality where people are \"doing their own research\" about diseases on Google, it's obviously not wise to suggest that the average voter doesn't understand a concept that you do. I think it's fine and reasonable to say that a term is silly and even offensive, like Ruben Gallego has remarked about \"Latinx.\" But it's never a good idea to suggest that voters are idiots.\n\nJS: A concern I have heard from Black liberals is that the oligarchy angle writes their interests and history out of the story. Think Bernie Sanders, who says the Democrats should ditch \"identity politics\" in favor of attacking billionaires. What do you think?\n\nSR: I think Black liberals aren't a monolith. The danger is that the most vocal Black liberals within the Democratic Party are – like myself! – college-educated mainstream middle-aged and older liberals who have reliably voted Democratic for decades. The party's obvious problem is with younger voters of all ages, but specifically Black and Latino men.\n\nI don't think \"identity politics\" is a winning issue. I think mainstream Democrats perhaps wrongly elevated it in 2016 to distinguish themselves from Sanders' more class-based appeals. That was a mistake. And I'm not even sure how the \"oligarchy angle\" writes out the interests and history of Black people, considering that rich people screwing over the poor is the backbone of slavery and segregation.\n\nBut viewing minority interests as different from working-class people regardless of race is perhaps another mistake. I don't see why you wouldn't want the angle that impacts the greatest number of people. Black voters are 12 percent of the electorate. Voters without a college degree are the majority of the electorate. Elon Musk screwing the poor and working class, regardless of race, is a unifying issue. I disagree with any liberal who argues for dividing a potential winning coalition.\n\nJS: There are stirrings of impeachment. Some say the last two backfired and made Trump stronger. I'm guessing you have an opinion about that.\n\nSR: That argument reflects a core weakness within the Democratic Party. Speaking from my arts background, it's like saying 20 years ago that previous attempts at making Marvel-related movies had failed. Why bother trying again? Execution is everything. Democrats didn't necessarily have a strategy for holding Republicans accountable for supporting Trump. They didn't strike while the iron was truly hot during the second impeachment in deference to Republicans and let him rebuild while in exile -- an issue directly linked to [former US Attorney General] Merrick Garland's delay in prosecuting Trump.\n\nThe past is somewhat irrelevant, also, because if Democrats regain the House in 2026, it won't be like 2018. They will be expected to draw some form of political blood.\n\nNOW READ: A new low even for MAGA – but they're about to go lower","summary":"Political activist David Hogg is facing a pretty clear conflict of interest.

As such, the Trump administration has targeted Harvard in its assault on collegiate infrastructure. But the university has positioned itself to fight back, both in the courts, where it is suing the administration over frozen federal funds, and in the court of public opinion. President Donald Trump's effort to revoke the school's tax-exempt status has \"no legal basis,\" a university spokesperson said, and could have \"grave consequences for the future of higher education.\"\n\nA loss of 'excellence and access'\nTrump's online invectives and Harvard's equally staunch response belie the fact that it is \"not immediately clear\" whether the IRS is moving forward with revoking the school's tax-exempt status, said The New York Times. Not only does such revocation \"typically occur only after a lengthy process,\" but presidents are legally barred from \"directing the IRS to conduct tax investigations\" to begin with. The government agency will \"not allow itself to be weaponized,\" said former IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, who served under Trump and President Joe Biden, in a statement to Bloomberg. Absent some \"appropriate examination\" of Harvard's finances and tax status, the IRS \"does not and should not conduct a 'fishing expedition' designed to hopefully uncover a relevant issue.\"\nShould Trump succeed in revoking Harvard's tax-exempt status, however, the trickle-down effect could be significant for the school's finances and its broader ability to function. Harvard would \"lose excellence and access,\" said Wellesley College economist Phillip Levine to CBS News. It would no longer have the \"ability to enroll the very brightest lower and middle-income students,\" since the school's ability to offer financial aid would be affected. Harvard's $50 billion endowment affords the school \"less protection\" than \"such a stacked bank account might suggest,\" thanks to \"legal restrictions, donor intent and other red tape,\" Axios said.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

The eight schools that comprise the elite core of American academia are, to Trump, a \"club that has never really accepted him.\"\nGiven that Trump is targeting not just Harvard, but huge swaths of academia, the \"only strategy with a prayer of succeeding\" is for schools of all stripes to \"come together, making it crystal-clear that they won't give in to assaults on academic freedom,\" said University of California, Berkeley, Professor David Kirp at The Guardian. That some 200 schools signed a American Association of Colleges and Universities statement decrying the White House's actions is a \"great start,\" but a \"NATO for higher education\" compact between colleges — one in which schools share financial, legal, and professional resources — \"might just convince the bully in the White House to back off.\"\n\nExplore More\n\nDonald Trump\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nRafi Schwartz has worked as a politics writer at The Week since 2022, where he covers elections, Congress and the White House.

According to the piece, firebrand Texan Jasmine Crockett let it rip with the f-word, but so, too, did a handful of her Democratic colleagues. Last week The Hill followed up with a story about Democratic hopefuls embracing the F-bomb on the campaign trail. The strategy is to show Democrats’ deep anger and to give them an aura of authenticity to help them reconnect with working class voters. Will it work? What do the polls tell us?\n\nCursing is hardly new in politics. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are no stranger to what we used to call bad language. When Joe Biden whispered to President Obama that the Obamacare signing was a “big f---ing deal,” most people shrugged.\n\nIn 1980, Gallup asked whether Americans would object strongly to some presidential behaviors, including using tranquilizers occasionally (36% did), seeing a psychiatrist (30%), wearing jeans occasionally in the Oval Office (21%) and having a cocktail before dinner each night (14%). A third said they would object strongly if a president used profane language in private (italics mine). LBJ’s and Richard Nixon’s fondness for expletives was not widely known until tapes from their tenures came out, and the press generally didn’t write about private behavior.\n\nPollsters have paid little sustained attention to people’s attitudes about profanity so no trend data exist. But there are patterns. In 1993, Princeton Survey Research Associates asked whether certain rules of behavior guided them and their families, 64% said the rule “not to curse or use profanity” applied to their family, while nearly three in ten said it did not. When asked about other people, only 15% said nearly everyone or most people followed this rule, while 28% said about half did, 46% some, and 8% none. We generally think our own behaviors are more admirable than those of others.\n\nWhen asked by Public Agenda about their own behavior in 2002, 12% said they often cursed, 25% did so occasionally, 43% rarely, and 19% never. And in an AP/NORC poll from 2016, 47% said they never used the F-word or used it few times a year. Twenty-three percent said they used it several times a day or once a day.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Monday, May 5th\n\nDelete Any Texts On Your Phone That Include These Messages\n\nMicrosoft Confirms You Cannot Cancel New Windows PC Update\n\nPolls taken over the years reveal another pattern: social norms may change, but a substantial number of Americans don’t like to hear profanity. In a 1995 ABC News question, 72% said it would bother them to hear an adult regularly curse or use swear words in conversation, while a quarter said it would not. In 2010, 35% told CBS News pollsters that they were bothered a lot of when people use swear words or curse in conversation, 24% bothered some, 15% a little, and 23% were not bothered at all.\n\nIn a 2022 HarrisX/Deseret News poll, there were huge age gaps, with 26% of 18-34 year olds compared to 68% of those 65 and older saying cursing bothered them a lot or some. In a 2024 Pew poll, 38% said cursing out loud in public was never acceptable, 27% rarely, 23% sometimes, and 9% usually or always so. Once again, young people were less concerned than older ones. An NBC News/Wall Street poll from 2017 revealed that 65% said greater acceptance of bad language and poor behavior in public life bothered them a great deal.\n\nIn a mid-April Pew poll, 84% of Democrats said it was extremely (59%) or very (25%) important for Democratic elected officials to push hard against Trump’s policies when they disagree with them. In another question, however, just 26% said they were doing an excellent or good job at this, while 46% described their efforts as fair and 27% as poor. So while there is appetite for pushback, the deliberate use of profanity won’t be welcome. If cursing is calculated, can it really be convincing? We shall see.\n\n Check out my website.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Cursing is hardly new in politics.

Many Democrats have been in and out of the spotlight as the party looks for effective counters to President Trump and his second administration. But two disparate figures, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have seen their national profiles rise by delivering messages that excite a demoralized and fractured party. The governor, a 60-year-old heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, and the congresswoman, the 35-year-old with working-class roots, both won their first elections in 2018. Both have urged mass resistance and accused their party of not fighting more. Each has stood out enough to draw sharp retorts from Trump loyalists. But as messengers, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez could not be more different. And their arguments, despite some overlap, are distinct enough to raise familiar questions for Democrats: Should they make their challenges to Trump about threats to democracy and national stability, as Pritzker has done, or portray him as a corrupt billionaire exacerbating an uneven economy, as Ocasio-Cortez does? And beyond the message itself, what qualities should the best messenger have? What links them, said one prominent Democrat, is “assertiveness.” “People want Trump and Trumpism to be met with equal passion and force,” said National Urban League President Marc Morial, a former New Orleans mayor deeply connected in Democratic politics. On that front, he added, Pritzker and Ocasio-Cortez “are both effective national figures — but in very different ways.” Pritzker was born at the bridge of the baby boomers and Generation X into a sprawling family now entrenched in Democratic politics. Like Trump, he inherited great wealth, but he lambastes the president as a poser on working-class issues. He chaired Illinois’ Human Rights Commission before running for governor. In office, he has signed an Illinois minimum-wage increase and is an ally of unions. His family’s hotels are unionized, making them regular options for official Democratic Party events. When Democratic President Biden exited the 2024 campaign, Pritzker was floated as a replacement. He made no visible moves, quickly backed Vice President Kamala Harris and acted as the de facto host of her nominating convention in his home state. “Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity,” Pritzker said in Chicago. Since Harris’ defeat, Pritzker has behaved like a future candidate. One of the nation’s highest-profile Jewish politicians, he fired up liberals by comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich. “If you think I’m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” the governor said in his joint budget and State of the State address on Feb. 19. “All I’m saying is, when the five-alarm fire starts to burn, every good person better be ready to man a post with a bucket of water if you want to stop it from raging out of control.” Addressing party faithful in the traditional early nominating state of New Hampshire, Pritzker bemoaned “do-nothing” Democrats, called for party honchos to set aside “decades of stale decorum” and urged voters into the streets. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now,” he said. Democrats, he added, “must castigate [Republicans] on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box.” It was enough for senior Trump aide Stephen Miller to accuse Pritzker of inciting violence. Pritzker wasted no time returning the volley, calling it “terrible hypocrisy” for Trump allies to complain given the Capitol siege on Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's pardons of the rioters. Ocasio-Cortez is a millennial progressive who earned degrees in international relations and economics and worked as a waiter and bartender before entering politics. With support from the progressive Working Families Party, she ousted a top House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in a 2018 primary. Like Trump, she leverages millions of social media followers. Also like Trump, she is an economic populist. But she comes from the left wing of U.S. politics and without the anti-immigration and cultural conservatism of Trump’s right wing or the alliances with billionaire business and tech elites. She has recently headlined the “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a two-time presidential candidate. The tour has drawn tens of thousands of people across the country, notably including reliably Republican states, often with overflow crowds outside many stops. Ocasio-Cortez’s next political move seems less certain than Pritzker’s. She is seen as a potential primary challenger to Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader from New York, and she only recently became old enough to be constitutionally eligible for the presidency. But she appears poised to inherit the mantle of the 83-year-old Sanders' movement. She freely criticizes Trump. But she leans more heavily into broader economic and social critiques that she’s made since her first House bid and that Sanders has offered for decades. “For years we have known that our political system has slowly but surely become dominated by big money and billionaires, and time after time we have seen how our government and laws are more responsive to corporations and lobbyists than everyday people and voters,” she said in Folsom, Calif. She advocated for “living wages … stable housing … guaranteed healthcare,” and blasted “the agenda of dark money to keep our wages low and to loot our public goods like Social Security and Medicare.” She also played up her roots: “From the waitress who is now speaking to you today, I can tell you: Impossible is nothing.” Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker are allied against a common opponent, Trump, and not each other. Advisors to Ocasio-Cortez and Pritzker did not respond to questions. Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, argues Pritzker could be more attractive as a “traitor to his class” in the tradition of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. An East Coast patrician, Roosevelt authored the New Deal’s federal expansion to combat the Great Depression of the 1930s. “How powerful would it be if a billionaire was the one helping to lead the charge against corrupt billionaires and corrupt billionaire corporations that are trying to crack the Constitution and loot the American people?” Green said, adding that “continued silence” on “billionaire issues” should disqualify Pritzker. “We have to be speaking to the shake-up-the-system vibe that people want to see.” Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, which typically backs centrist Democrats, countered that Pritzker could bring a “more stable” version of Trump’s argument that his wealth and success is an asset. Trump’s biggest liability, Bennett said, is “chaos” that negatively affects people’s lives. “People are very mad at Elon Musk, but not because he’s rich,” Bennett said of the Tesla chief executive who is leading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. “They’re mad at him because he’s vandalizing our government and doing it in a destructive way.” A relative of the governor, Rachel Pritzker, chairs Third Way’s board of trustees. Ocasio-Cortez is often criticized by more moderate Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who has also positioned herself as a thought leader in the party. Slotkin recently suggested the word “oligarchy” didn't resonate with working-class voters. It was an implicit rebuke of the Ocasio-Cortez-Sanders’ tour. Shortly after Slotkin's comments about oligarchy, Ocasio-Cortez posted on X: “Plenty of politicians on both sides of the aisle feel threatened by rising class consciousness.” Bennett said Democrats who emerge as party leaders, including the 2028 nominee, will be those who offer solutions for voters' frustration “over their needs not being met.” It's a notion that Green insisted is indistinguishable from criticizing the billionaire class, along with the tax and labor policies that drive wealth and income gaps in the United States. Whatever direction Democrats choose, Bennett said, Ocasio-Cortez has secured her place as a national voice. “She's very good at what she does. She’s formidable,” he said. “And anybody on the center-left who denies that is just kidding themselves.” Barrow writes for the Associated Press.","summary":"Democrats are looking for the right message and messengers to lead the opposition to President Trump in his second term.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-05/pritzker-and-ocasio-cortez-a-billionaire-and-a-former-bartender-emerge-as-trump-resistance-leaders","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c24e745/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2578x1353+0+321/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2F33%2Fa50c6332b281b37d6ea0f50eb920%2F8ee1371730394d1ebee9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 18:43:02","author":"Bill Barrow","authors":["Bill Barrow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.092},{"id":318131584,"title":"Social Worker Dragged Out of Her Seat at GOP Town Hall in New York","text":"Representative Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, faced backlash from constituents during a town hall over the weekend which saw police forcibly remove a social worker from the meeting.Why It MattersRepublicans across the country have been booed and heckled during recent town hall events following President Donald Trump's return to office, as polls suggest Americans oppose some of his key action taken so far, including mass firings of federal workers, new tariffs and some of his immigration policies.Lawler represents a competitive Congressional district comprised of New York City's northern suburbs that Democrats are targeting in next year's midterm elections. It's likely to be one of the most hotly contested races next year as it's one of three districts that elected a Republican Congressman while also backing Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.What to KnowLawler, a centrist who has been floated as a potential gubernatorial candidate, faced heckling from the audience during the town hall event in Somers on Sunday. At one point, a constituent named Emily Feiner, who has worked as a social worker, was carried out of the town hall by officers.The incident was captured on video by other attendees. The video was posted to social media and viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The moments that led to her removal, however, were not recorded.The video showed that as Feiner was carried out of the town hall, other attendees shouted, \"Let her stay!\"Lawler's office responded to the incident in a statement to Newsweek.\"The attendee was asked to leave after repeatedly engaging in abusive and combative behavior with staff, and disrupting nearby attendees. She was escorted from the auditorium when she continually refused to comply with New York State Troopers,\" Ciro Riccardi, Lawler's communications director, said.Feiner addressed the incident in a post to social media platform BlueSky.\"I was certainly no threat,\" she wrote. \"I asked by congressperson what his red line was to finally, vocally oppose the lawless administration and he didn't answer the question, so I called out for him to answer it and he had me removed.\"Lawler's staff required people to RSVP to the event and required that attendees live in the district, not record at the event and refrain from shouting or standing, the Associated Press reported.What People Are SayingFormer State Representative Yuh-Line Niou wrote on X: \"This is my friend @EmilyFeiner.....she is a social worker and a very active community member in the area. She should be allowed to speak and attend her representative's town hall. @lawler4ny what gives!?\"Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"The Radical Left Democrats are paying a fortune to have people infiltrate the Town Halls of Republican Congressmen/women and Senators. These Great Patriot Politicians should not treat them nicely. Have them immediately ejected from the room—They are disruptors and troublemakers. You must allow your audience to know what you are up against, or else they will think they are Republicans, and that there is dissension in the Party.\"What Happens NextThe effects of President Trump's policies will continue to be felt over the coming months and years. But how Americans respond to the GOP during the midterms is yet to be seen. Lawler is expected to face a competitive race against a Democrat next fall. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as \"Leans Republican,\" meaning it is \"considered competitive\" but the GOP \"has an advantage.\"","summary":"Representative Mike Lawler is among the GOP lawmakers facing backlash during town hall events.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/constituent-removed-mike-lawler-town-hall-new-york-2068138","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2638758/constituent-removed-mike-lawler-town-hall.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 18:25:11","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":318149032,"title":"The DNC’s notorious reputation for cutting off its nose to spite its face","text":"In the days leading up to the 2025 Presidential Inauguration, Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago in an effort to pay homage to President-elect Donald Trump.

Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\n\"Our constituents are asking us to acknowledge that this is a crisis. So, I am going to stand here until I no longer can,” the Senator from New Jersey said as he began his marathon protest speech.\n\nOn April 1st, having spoken for over 25 hours, the black Senator, who would have never been afforded the opportunity to serve in the Senate had men like Thurmond gotten their way, broke the floor speech record.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont teamed up with America’s Evita – New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – taking their “non-partisan” socialist, not quite Peronist (though just as internally conflicted) show of resistance on the road.\n\nAround the same time, DNC Vice Chair David Hogg, who rose to fame in the aftermath of the tragic Parkland High School Shooting, vowed that his Leaders We Deserve PAC would dump $20 million into primary campaigns for younger candidates against “older Democrats.” The PAC endorses candidates for state House seats who are 30 years old and younger as well as candidates who are 35 years old and younger for federal races. The group spent $12 million in the 2024 general election cycle.\n\nJames Carville wasn’t impressed with Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, or Hogg.\n\nOn his \"Politics War Room\" podcast, \"The Ragin' Cajun\" said Democrats have candidates who are \"staggeringly more talented\" than Sanders or AOC. Later in his tirade, Carville argued that Democrats don't need a \"sterling message,\" asserting that his characterization of the Republican Party will \"manifest itself\" in the economy, tax cuts, and healthcare.\n\nIn a comment on NewsNation, Carville referred to Hogg as a \"contemptible little twerp.”\n\nHogg responded on CNN a short time later.\n\n\"Carville believes in a politics of being timid, of hiding. I believe in fighting,\" Hogg said during an interview with Jake Tapper. \"We can't simply just hide, as Carville repeatedly promotes, not to mention the fact that, frankly, he has not won an election since before I was born. I think it's time for some new voices in our party.\"\n\nTop brass in the DNC have been calling for Hogg to step aside, citing a conflict of interest with the organization’s policies. Democratic voters are torn. Some applaud Hogg, citing the DNC’s notorious reputation for cutting off its nose to spite its face. Others have reservations about Hogg’s PAC and his wildly progressive platform that calls for, among other things, defunding the police.\n\nOne thing is certain: Democrats need to get their act together – and fast.\n\nInfighting takes precious time away from strategizing. Thus far, the only strategy Democrats seem to agree on is: “Vote blue because we’re not aligned with Donald Trump.” However, that strategy failed to secure an election victory for their anointed candidate Kamala Harris. Though Trump 2.0 has been a veritable dumpster fire, it is imperative that Democrats offer something tangibly different or face certain demise in the midterms.\n\nJ.

What it does is require voters to produce documentary evidence that they are citizens when they register to vote. The legislation does not even affect citizens who are already registered.\n\nDocuments deemed acceptable to prove citizenship include birth certificates, U.S. passports, and new Real ID driver’s licenses. What Clinton and her fellow Democrats are claiming is that because women often take their husbands’ last names when they get married, their birth certificates may not match their current legal names. But birth certificates are just one of the acceptable documents. More importantly, both men and women are already required to provide the same documents that the SAVE Act requires when they fill out an I-9 form to prove they are a citizen for employment.\n\nNotice how none of the Democratic messaging on the SAVE Act is designed to help married women get the documents they need to register to vote or to get a job. Nope. Their only intention is to rile up single women with fake stories about how oppressive marriage, the patriarchy, and the Republican Party are.\n\nAnd this is not an isolated incident.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, a Democratic group called Vote Common Good, which bills itself as “the alternative to MAGA Trumpism,” spent millions of dollars on an ad narrated by Julia Roberts insinuating that abusive husbands across the country were intimidating their wives into voting for the Republican Party. “In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know,” Roberts said in the ad as a married woman experiences a brief moment of freedom in a polling booth before being forced to return to her marriage prison.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that the polling we have on the issue shows husbands are more likely to say they felt pressure from their spouses to vote a certain way than the other way around, the overall message of the ad is that marriage is an oppressive patriarchal institution.\n\nAnd the Democratic Party’s attack on men isn’t new. In 2014, the Democrats based their entire midterm campaign on a fictional rape epidemic that was allegedly victimizing women on college campuses across the country. Then-President Barack Obama started the hysteria himself with a White House speech and the creation of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.\n\nNo one is denying that sexual assault happens on college campuses, but there had been no evidence of a surge. Democrats manufactured a crisis to rile up young single women. The result was new Title IX regulations that mandated kangaroo courts on campuses nationwide in which men could be expelled and have their reputations destroyed by a single complaint from a woman that could be made without any accompanying evidence. Defendants were not allowed to question their accusers or even know who they were. When it comes to illegal immigrants from El Salvador, the Democratic Party is all about due process. But when it’s Johnny from Iowa, due process is completely abandoned in the name of female empowerment.\n\nAnd then there are the constant hyperbolic fundraising emails. For decades, women’s inboxes have been constantly barraged with messages such as “Women’s Rights Under ATTACK,” “GOP’s Abortion Bans Are HERE,” and “Devastating Setback for Women’s Rights!” Apparently, these messages work, at least in a financial sense, for the Democratic Party. Data show that scare-tactic emails have higher clickthrough rates than more sedate ones, which is why Democrats rely on them so much.\n\nIt also doesn’t help when leaders such as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) undercut Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with statements encouraging Schumer’s male colleagues to “listen to the women, for the people.” Such a message might be appropriate on abortion and child care, but when the issue is something that affects everyone, if Democratic senators filibuster a spending bill so the government shuts down, what special insight are women supposed to have? Or is the message that men just shut up and do what women tell them?\n\nBy turning every issue into a case of female oppression, Democrats have pushed women to the left and men out of the party altogether.\n\n“The purpose of a system is what it does,” goes the saying most often attributed to British cyberneticist Stafford Beer. And lately, it appears that the purpose of the Democratic Party is less about electing Democrats, which it failed spectacularly at in 2024, and more about driving young women further to the left and away from men and marriage.\n\nAs Democrats have ramped up their attacks on men, young women have moved steadily leftward. As recently as 2007, young men and women were not that far apart politically. According to Gallup, just 28% of young women aged 18 to 29 considered themselves “liberal” as recently as 2007, compared to 25% of young men the same age. That’s just a 3-point gap. Now, however, 40% of women aged 18 to 29 consider themselves liberal compared to an unchanged 25% of young men.\n\nAnd as women have moved to the left, they have become more partisan about who they date.\n\nA 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of single Democrats would not consider dating a Republican, while just 47% of Republicans said they wouldn’t date a Democrat. And according to the Survey Center on American Life, no demographic is more likely to say they have ended a friendship over politics than liberal women. A third of liberal women admit to having ended an existing friendship due to politics, compared to just 10% of conservatives.\n\nDemocrats have even managed to convince women that marriage makes people unhappy. As recently as 1988, 54% of Democrats believed married people were happier than single people. Today, just 21% do. Democrats simply no longer believe that marriage is a valuable institution. Asked in 2023 if they agreed with the statement that “marriage improves partnerships by strengthening the commitment to one another,” more than two-thirds of Republicans said “yes” compared to just 30% of Democrats. Democrats are also far more likely to agree with the statement that “marriage is an outdated institution” and are far less likely to say they hope their children get married someday.\n\nConsidering their disdain for men and their negative view of marriage, it is not surprising that Democrats are now far less likely to be married than Republicans. According to Gallup, as recently as 1980, Republicans and Democrats between the ages of 30 and 50 were equally likely to be married. Today, while more than two-thirds of Republicans in the age bracket are married, less than half of Democrats are.\n\nUnfortunately for single Democratic women, married people are happier than single people. According to the 2022 General Social Survey, 40% of married women with children consider themselves “very happy,” compared to 27% of unmarried women with children. Taking a longer look at women’s lives over time, Harvard researchers tracked 11,830 American female nurses over 25 years and found that those women who got married were healthier, happier, and lived longer than those women who remained single.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s antipathy toward marriage might stem from the fact that the institution has become an existential threat to the party. The simple reality is that research has demonstrated that women are more likely to become conservative and vote Republican after they get married. They are even more likely to become Republicans after they start having children. Considering that college-educated single women are far more likely to vote, volunteer, and donate to political parties than men, this means every time a single woman gets married, the Democratic Party is in danger of losing not just a voter but a committed donor and activist as well.\n\nDemocrats know they have a man problem. But they have no clue how to address it, and when they try, they only make it worse. Just look at former first lady Michelle Obama’s speech for then-Vice President Kamala Harris that was directed at men last October. \n\n“Look, I don’t expect any man to fully grasp how vulnerable this makes us feel,” Obama said. “So let me take a minute to help folks, especially the men in our lives, get a better sense of what could happen.”\n\n“Please do not put our lives in the hands of politicians, mostly men, who have no clue or do not care about what we as women are going through,” Obama continued. “The only people who have standing to make these decisions are women.”\n\nAt no point in her speech did Obama recognize that American women today are the healthiest, wealthiest, and best-educated not only in U.S. history but in world history. There was no acknowledgement that women now make up 60% of college students and 66% of college graduates. Instead, she only made women out to be victims of male oppression.\n\nThere was also no acknowledgement that men are more likely to be unemployed, more likely to die on the job, more likely to be in jail, and more likely to commit suicide than women. There was no empathy for men or the problems they face, only a demand that they blindly vote for the Democratic Party because they simply were too clueless to understand how difficult women’s lives are.\n\nDemocrats don’t necessarily need men to win elections again. Thanks to the continued decline of marriage, single women are one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. And as mentioned before, single women, especially college-educated single women, are far more likely to vote, volunteer, and donate than men are. There is a path for Democrats to succeed by pushing women further and further away from men.\n\nBut if Democrats want to become a party that attracts both sexes again, it is going to have to stop turning every issue into an example of women’s oppression and start taking the difficulties that men face seriously.","summary":"The post itself didn’t even describe what the bill did.

The CBS newsmagazine is embroiled in a legal battle with the president over its October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump claims was deceptively edited to help her presidential campaign. The lawsuit is an obstacle to CBS News parent Paramount Global's proposed $8 billion sale to Skydance Media. But since the suit was filed last fall, \"60 Minutes\" has remained dogged in its coverage of the Trump administration's policies. This past Sunday was no different as correspondent Scott Pelley reported on how Trump is using executive orders to target law firms that he accuses of “weaponizing” the justice system against him. The orders threatened to bar attorneys from courthouses and federal agencies and cancel government contracts held by the law firms and their clients. Several law firms agreed to provide free legal services for initiatives backed by the president to avoid the order. \"Targeted firms say what the president signed amounted to a corporate death penalty,\" Pelley said in the report. Marc Elias, a lawyer who successfully fought one of Trump's court challenges of the 2020 election results, told Pelley the White House's actions are akin to \"the way in which a mob boss intimidates people in the neighborhood that he is seeking to either exact protection money from or engage in other nefarious conduct.\" Pelley also spoke with attorney Brenna Frey, who resigned in protest from her former firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom after it cut a deal with Trump to escape the order. \"I think the message it sends to the country is, power is what matters,\" Frey said. \"If you have power, you can exercise that power however you want. And if that's true, why have a legal system at all? Why have law firms or lawyers at all?\" Trump did not post a reaction to the Sunday segment on Truth Social, where in recent weeks he has delivered missives blasting \"60 Minutes\" coverage of his administration's handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, cuts to the federal government and the president's desire to annex Greenland. Trump had an otherwise busy night on Truth, presenting plans to put a 100% tariff on films made overseas and reopening Alcatraz prison to \"house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.\" Trump has encouraged his Federal Communications Chief Brendan Carr to punish CBS and its corporate parent over his long-running beef with \"60 Minutes.\" The issue has also ratcheted up the pressure on controlling shareholder Shari Redstone, who has pushed for a settlement to facilitate Paramount’s sale to the family headed by billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison. Redstone’s apparent willingness to appease Trump has sparked sharp protests within the company. Early this year, the president doubled the amount of damages he was seeking in the \"60 Minutes\" lawsuit to $20 billion. His legal filing attempted to steer the case away from 1st Amendment issues and instead claim “60 Minutes” was a fraudulent product that harmed viewers in Texas. Paramount’s board, during an April 18 meeting, agreed on parameters for a possible settlement with Trump, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to comment. Bill Owens recently resigned as executive producer of “60 Minutes,” citing increased corporate pressure over coverage. Pelley told “60 Minutes” viewers about Owens’ resignation, noting that journalists had been facing increased corporate oversight because of Paramount’s desire to win the Trump administration’s approval of the Skydance deal.","summary":"The newsmagazine continues to do tough coverage of the White House while Paramount Global considers a settlement to clear a path for its sale to Skydance.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-05-05/president-trumps-cbs-60-minutes-anger-paramount-shari-redstone-skydance","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72030be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F47%2Ff1%2F9af8a0df46da9f5e632de7ae3bd8%2Fmarc-elias-intv-2-bug","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 17:38:38","author":"Meg James,Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Meg James","Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":318104814,"title":"Zohran Mamdani will fight for ordinary NYers like Ella Emhoff and Rashida Tlaib","text":"Zohran “Man of the People” Mamdani continues to win the hearts of . . . other nepo babies and Jew-haters.\n\nElla Emhoff, (briefly) famous as Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter, recently came out in support of the Queens leftist’s mayoral run. \n\nAn insanely rich nepo baby LA transplant with a political powerhouse stepmom and a superlawyer dad, Emhoff scored an elite modeling contract very clearly based on her family connections and now hawks armpit-hair oil on Instagram while holding down a fake job as a fashion designer.\n\nIf there’s one person who gets the problems, hopes and dreams of the people who make Gotham the greatest city in the world, it’s definitely her.

That matters because lawsuits have been a check on the president's power.\"\n\nHe was, however, able to get comment from Marc Elias, a former Perkins Cole partner and longtime rival of Trump, who compared the president's executive orders to a mob boss intimidating people in a neighborhood.\n\n\"The fact is that these law firms are being told, 'If you don't play ball with us, maybe somethin' really bad will happen to you,'\" Elias said.\n\nElias has previously challenged Trump in 2020, when he defeated the 78-year-old businessman's efforts to contest the election results in court.\n\nHe went on to call Trump the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system.\n\n\"And so when Donald Trump says that I am unethical or that I am undermining his vision of America, I say, 'Boy I must be doin' something right,'\" Elias said.The segment comes as CBS battles a $20billion lawsuit filed by Trump, claiming it deceptively edited an interview last fall with his election opponent Kamala Harris. \n\nParamount, the parent company of CBS, also needs Trump's approval to merge with Skydance Media.\n\nWhen Trump took office for his second term, his Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, announced CBS would be investigated over the interview. Trump has demanded a retraction and even suggested the networks' broadcast license be revoked.\n\nCompany executives are reportedly in mediation to settle the lawsuit, a prospect that has been bitterly opposed by 60 Minutes staffers.\n\nLast month, the show's executive producer and leader, Bill Owens, suddenly quit his job in light of the network's response to the licensing threats, saying he is no longer able to produce the show he wants.At the end of last week's episode, Pelley addressed Owens' decision, saying it was \"hard\" on the staff. He then took a shot at the corporate executives and their dedication to fair and balanced reporting.\n\n\"Our parent company Paramount is trying to complete a merger,\" Pelley explained.\n\n\"Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.\"\n\nPelley added: \"No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.\"\n\nThe FCC has been reviewing a request from Skydance Productions to purchase, \"strengthen and revitalize\" CBS – and sources said that means sweeping changes in the news division.\n\nAn insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com: \"The place has been in freefall for years, and if the sale goes through, there's no way the new owners will settle for status quo.\"","summary":"'60 Minutes' aired a scathing report on President Trump's efforts to target law firms that have been critical of him","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/60-minutes-cbs-news-trump-20billion-lawsuit-kamala-harris-interview/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/2KwFe0MJL/0x0/60-minutes-scott-pelley-donald-trump-1-1746459506335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 16:42:14","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":318118022,"title":"Is Trump trying to force Fox News to replace its top media host with a MAGA sycophant?","text":"Over the course of his first few months back in the White House, Donald Trump has made no secret of his irritation with Fox News personalities and other key cogs of Rupert Murdoch’s conservative media empire that he believes aren’t showing him the proper amount of loyalty and obsequiousness.\n\nWith the president’s poll numbers cratering amid a spate of self-imposed crises and accusations of authoritarianism, Trump has increasingly lashed out at Murdoch world for allowing some form of criticism against him to seep through Fox and News Corp’s pages and airwaves.\n\nAnd in one specific case this week, it appears that the president is urging one Fox News host to “retire” so he can be replaced with a more servile and sycophantic commentator who recently wrote a book about how Trump had the “greatest comeback ever.” Notably, that same MAGA pundit has been pushed by Trump confidant Sean Hannity to take over the network’s weekly media show for years now.\n\nHaving already called for Fox News’ pollster to be “investigated for election fraud” over its latest survey, Trump spent much of his Sunday – whenever he wasn’t calling for foreign films to be tariffed or posting AI images of himself as a Sith – blasting Murdoch media figures for not fully having his back.\n\nNamely, he fumed at “total loser” Karl Rove – a frequent target of the president – for criticizing the administration’s policies and slamming Trump for portraying himself as the pope. Additionally, on his Air Force One trip back to Washington on Sunday night, he browbeat a Wall Street Journal reporter, telling her she worked for a “rotten newspaper” that’s “truly gone to hell.” (The president has been incensed in recent months over the Murdoch-owned paper’s editorial board, which has been highly critical of his economic policies and chaotic first 100 days in office.)\n\nAt the same time, he also took to Truth Social to bash Fox News media host Howard Kurtz, claiming that the MediaBuzz anchor had done an insufficient job of coming to the president’s defense during a segment about the ouster of national security advisor Mike Waltz.\n\n“It is time for Howie Kurtz to retire!” Trump blared on Sunday night. “Every Woke Anchor in the Business, people that no one watched from CNN, MSDNC, and others, are plastered all over his show, with all really negative and fake statements, and then I am weakly “defended” by Howie and his group (although Ben Domenech has been strong!). The case Howie makes for me is so pathetic that it would be a lot better if he didn’t say anything. Anyway, that’s the way it is!”\n\nNotably, though, the post that preceded the president’s takedown of Kurtz featured Trump highly praising a Fox News media critic who has largely been seen as the heir apparent of the MediaBuzz chair once the 71-year-old Kurtz decides to hang it up – or is forced to do so.\n\n“Joe Concha has written an incredible new book, ‘THE GREATEST COMEBACK EVER: Inside Trump’s Big Beautiful Campaign.’ Joe has been studying our Movement from the very beginning and understands, far better than the many other so-called ‘experts,’ the Iconic Moments that contributed to our truly Historic Election,” the president wrote on Truth Social. “We broke through the Fake News, which is getting worse by the hour, and exposed the TRUTH of the many challenges our Nation is facing — and WON BIG. THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”\n\nThe juxtaposition of the two Fox News analysts is likely no accident.\n\nFor years now, Hannity – a close friend of the president’s who has been described as the White House shadow chief of staff – has made it clear within the halls of Fox News that he would like to see Concha take over the reins of the network’s Sunday media show.\n\n“So the ‘inside scoop’ is that Sean Hannity has long wanted Joe Concha to host Fox’s show about media, which is currently hosted by Howard Kurtz,” the Washington Post’s Jeremy Barr reported in late 2021.\n\nIndeed, several Fox News insiders told me at the time that the Fox News primetime star had been championing Concha – a right-wing media columnist who has now written multiple pro-Trump books – to supplant Kurtz behind the scenes, which is why he finally began making those pleas on air.\n\n“I think he’d have a great TV show here on Fox on media,” Hannity said while introducing Concha for an October 2021 segment, prompting the two to debate what the name of the show should be.\n\n“I think Joe Concha: Setting the Record Straight. How’s that?” Hannity proposed. After Concha said the title was a “bit chunky,” Hannity quipped: “OK, if you keep this up, I’m going to stop advocating for the show.” \n\nA Fox News source told The Independent on Monday that “Hannity still wants Concha to replace Howie,” though they hadn’t heard anything about the Fox News star coordinating with the president on his social media posts.\n\nSince coming over to Fox News in 2013 after hosting CNN’s Reliable Sources for 15 years, much of Kurtz’s coverage has centered on what he sees as an intrinsic liberal bias in the media, especially when it comes to covering Trump. In fact, Kurtz wrote a book during Trump’s first term titled Media Madness, arguing throughout that the mainstream press was unfairly treating the president.\n\nAt the same time, as he’s largely criticized the media for its negative coverage of the president, Kurtz has gone to great lengths to suggest that he is not an overt supporter of Trump and is merely analyzing how the press reports on Trump and his political movement. He’s also seen himself on the receiving end of MAGA backlash whenever he has pushed back on Trump’s narratives.\n\nDuring the final weeks of the 2024 presidential campaign, for instance, Kurtz scored a wide-ranging interview with Trump that featured the Fox News host repeatedly inserting a number of fact checks – something that infamously gets under the president’s skin. \n\nBesides correcting the record on Trump’s comments about the January 6 attack and the 60 Minutes interview of Kamala Harris, Kurtz also contrasted Trump’s campaign with that of the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n“After our interview, Donald Trump flew to Pennsylvania, Arnold Palmer’s hotel, where he discussed the golfer’s size of his manhood, dismissed Kamala Harris with a curse word, and asked the old Reagan question, ‘Are you better off now than you were four years ago?’” Kurtz noted. “The vice president was in Atlanta, where she made the case for abortion rights, said Trump lacked compassion, and was joined by the family of a Georgia woman who died and didn’t receive proper medical care due to abortion restrictions.”\n\nFox News and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"The president praised Fox News media critic Joe Concha — whom Sean Hannity has long advocated to get his own show — while simultaneously urging MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz to ‘retire’ for not defending him strongly enough, writes Justin Baragona","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fox-news-howard-kurtz-b2745106.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/05/14/23/Screenshot-Capture-2025-05-05-09-39-51.png?trim=0,142,0,140&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9y2avTSb-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-05 16:39:43","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":318119104,"title":"Here Are All the Big-Wigs Snubbing This Year’s Met Gala","text":"Throw some of the country’s most elite celebrities in a room for a night and there’s bound to be drama.

He’s the wealthiest man in France and fifth wealthiest in the world, and some say he’s been buddy-buddy with the president in an effort to avoid the tariff fallout. \n\nEven resident fashionista Sarah Jessica Parker is skipping this year’s event but felt compelled to put out a statement explaining why she would not be in attendance.\n\n“I have to work, but there’s gonna be so much to see and I look forward to seeing what everybody does. And I can’t wait to see how they interpret the theme and the sort of homework they did for the assignment,” she said.\n\nBut some surprise guests might be in attendance—rumors are rapidly circulating that Kamala Harris herself will make an appearance. \n\nWhen the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute announced the fashion show, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” Harris was still in the running. She was the first Black woman to ever top a major-party ticket, and the Institute pledged to diverse cultures and Black excellence. \n\nToday, the world looks a little different. President Donald Trump has waged a war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, including programming related to race. \n\nCultural institutions have borne the brunt of his attacks. In February, Trump seized control of the Kennedy Center to make it less “woke.” In March, he signed an executive order against “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” at the Smithsonian museums and vowed to withhold funds that “divide Americans by race.” \n\nAnna Wintour, the architect behind the annual fête, has long raised funds for the Democratic Party and swore in 2017 that she would forevermore prohibit Trump from attending. \n\nThe show is completely devoted to designers of color and the Black diaspora, and the iconic costumes and bizarre manifestations of the theme will wow, shock, and mystify those tuning into the Monday night production. In the past, the party has been seen as tone-deaf and elitist, but this year’s jamboree provides an opportunity for the famed to prove their allyship. \n\nAlong with Wintour, the gala’s co-chairs are ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, Pharrell Williams, and honorary chair LeBron James. \n\nInstagram chief executive Adam Mosseri will be there, despite Zuckerberg’s absence, and Chief Executive of Louis Vuitton Pietro Beccari will show—regardless of his boss Arnault’s presence. Michael Bloomberg will also attend.\n\nIronically, Wintour has claimed that the “show was never about politics, not in conception, not now.” \n\nBut she acknowledged still that “the MET recognizing and taking seriously the contributions of Black designers and the Black community in fashion has a heightened meaning in 2025.”","summary":"Theo Wargo / Theo Wargo/Getty Images for Huffington PostThrow some of the country’s most elite celebrities in a room for a night and there’s bound to be drama.

Those lucky enough to get through were asked very specific questions, and often still denied.\n\nOther ways to get a table include using a service offered by high-end credit cards and hotel concierge, knowing someone who works there, or simply buying it off another customer.\n\nSome diners claimed they managed to get last-minute reservations after a cancelation.\n\nThe Polo Club is polarizing among those who managed to get in, with many saying the food is wildly overpriced and the bar overall not worth the extreme effort.\n\nCocktails will set you back $24 to $55 each, martinis are $35 to $38, and even a bottle of beer is $16. \n\nBar snacks range from $18 for pigs in blankets to $140 for caviar and potatoes.\n\nDinner meals include a $35 burger, a 16oz New York stripe steak for $78, soups for $21, and $16 for a side of mashed potatoes.\n\nThe cheapest bottle of wine is a 2022 rose from Puglia in Italy for $75, and the most expensive costs more than a car.","summary":"Former vice president Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff were spotted at The Polo Bar in Midtown Manhattan on Sunday night ahead of a rumored appearance at the Met Gala.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14679903/Kamala-Harris-Doug-Emhoff-Polo-Bar-New-York-City.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/05/16/98048377-0-image-a-12_1746460190673.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 16:21:01","author":"Editor,Nic White","authors":["Editor","Nic White"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.209},{"id":318114936,"title":"Family, Freedom, And Beyoncé’s National Anthem","text":"Beyoncé is no stranger to the national anthem.\n\nShe’s performed it for presidents, at a Super Bowl press conference, and before massive sporting events. And typically, it is performed faithfully, just one of music’s most iconic voices singing a song every American knows deeply, even if our relationship with said song shifts in a mercurial fashion depending on the context. \n\nAnd on her “Cowboy Carter Tour”, which kicked off at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium last week, Beyoncé is once again delivering “The Star Spangled Banner,” but not quite in a manner she’s done before. It’s performed relatively early in the set, with Bey serving stunning vocals, yet the whole presentation is unsettling. There’s Hendrix guitars in the background, strobing reds and blues on the LED screens, and an overall unease. She doesn’t even finish the anthem, returning back to her Beatles’ cover of “Blackbird” while messaging is presented behind her: “Never Ask Permission For Something That Already Belongs To Her.”\n\nThe moment has, typically, led to some truly worm-brained criticism, that somehow Beyoncé was supporting the current administration or political climate by singing the patriotic number. But that reading ignores literally everything else about the concert and what we know about Beyoncé as a person. Within a few minutes of this moment, Beyoncé would be performing “Freedom,” a song that she notably provided to the Kamala Harris campaign for an ad. Sure, one option in the current world is to distance ourselves from all political signifiers, but Beyoncé’s interests right now are more rooted in the Black contributions to culture and history that get pushed into the shadows and stolen. If you actually think she’s out on stage celebrating the USA, it’s seriously time to log off.\n\nWhat followed over the next nearly three hours of music was a performance that underscored her multi-act vision of this chapter of her career, that shines a light on Black contributions in genres where it’s often minimized. We’ve seen it in dance with Renaissance, and now in country with Cowboy Carter, an album that finally netted her a long-deserved Album Of The Year Grammy. And there’s plenty of evidence to suggest one more act is coming.\n\nFor the second performance of the tour last Thursday, Beyoncé laid out a few possibilities for how this Cowboy Carter run might unfold. The setlist changed notably from the kickoff, with some portions shuffled and a section added that served as a greatest hits medley, with “Single Ladies,” “Irreplaceable,” and “If I Were A Boy” all making their first concert appearances since the 2010s. Future performances will tell whether this move will remain in subsequent concerts, whether the songs will shift, or whether this was just a special move for a special night. But while these massive tunes might not hold the political weight of her recent music, it felt like a necessary juxtaposition, that Beyoncé still connected to her own pop-star roots, even if her vision is now set beyond the charts and more to an all-encompassing creative legacy. Both can exist in the same place without detracting from the other. To borrow from Whitman, Beyoncé contains multitudes.\n\nAnd while the entire concert is the paradigm for creative vision — where riding around the arena on a horseshoe can fit neatly next to BigXthaPlug and JPEGMafia-soundtracked interludes — once again Beyoncé’s incorporation of her family created something truly special. If you watched the Renaissance concert film, you got some great insight into how Blue Ivy started appearing as a dancer on the tour, and how her initial struggle lit a fire in her to do the work and ensure she deserved her place on the stage. Now, a couple years later, Blue Ivy is basically a star.

Arnault has not attended the gala since 1996.\n\nPietro Beccari, the chief executive of Louis Vuitton - an LVHM brand - will be attending. \n\nWhile many leading MAGA supporters won't be there, other political figures, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be there. \n\nThere is also a rumor circulating that former Vice President Kamala Harris might attend as well, the source said. \n\nThe charity fundraiser is meant to be about representation and fashion, Wintour said. \n\nShe added that 'the show was never about politics, not in conception, not now.' Instead, Wintour said it's really about 'self-determination, beauty, creativity and holding up a lens to history.' \n\nAlthough she acknowledged the true purpose of the event, Wintour pointed out that this year's theme has a 'heightened meaning in 2025' because it is 'recognizing and taking seriously the contributions of Black designers and the Black community in fashion.' \n\nThe theme this year is 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style' - inspired by the book 'Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity' written by Monica L. Miller. \n\nThis will be the first time the event is entirely dedicated to designers of color, and specifically focuses on the way black men have used fashion as a tool to challenge stereotypes and command honor and respect. \n\nAlong with Wintour, co-chairs, including Lewis Hamilton, ASAP Rocky, Colman Domingo and Pharrell Williams and honorary chair LeBron James will be running the event. \n\nCultural critic Louis Piscano told the outlet: 'This feels way bigger than just fashion.' \n\n'Putting Black style front and center sends a real message,' he stated, adding: 'It’s important that we don’t sit this one out.' \n\nPiscano said he's 'already bracing for the conservative backlash' the event will get, but that is 'why it’s especially important that people show up.' \n\nIn addition to high profile MAGA figures, big name celebrities will also not be on the carpet tonight, including Kanye West. \n\nHe hasn't been invited back since 2022 when Wintour vowed to never work with him again after his anti-Semitic rants.\n\nAnd even before that, he was a habitual Met Gal skipper - his last appearance was actually in 2019 when he attended with his then wife Kim Kardashian. \n\nWhile Kim Kardashian is expected to attend in 2025, the reality star has made a series of pro-Trump subtle statements on her Instagram in recent months.\n\nMost notably, she shared a photo of Melania Trump's inauguration outfit - with many fans saying it was a clear show of who she voted for in the election.\n\nKardashian has never publicly endorsed Donald Trump. \n\nSex And The City star Sarah Jessica Parker is opting out this year due to work commitments.\n\nSince her first attendance in 1995 the actress, 60, Sarah has been a regular at the annual New York fashion event.\n\nThere is also a question mark over Hailey and Justin Bieber's attendance at this year's Met Gala. \n\nThe model was present at every Met Gala from 2017 until 2022. Meanwhile her husband Justin has only attended twice, once in 2015 and then again in 2021. \n\nThe singer has sparked concerns about his health and possible drug use in recent months after stepping out in public looking gaunt and hollow-eyed.\n\nAmy Schumer's comments on the Met Gala didn’t get her banned but she has made her feelings on the event clear.\n\nSpeaking during an interview with Howard Stern in 2016 the actress said: 'It’s people doing an impression of having a conversation.\n\n'I don’t like the farce...We’re dressed up like a bunch of f*****g assholes. I don’t like it. I have no interest in fashion...I don’t care.'\n\nZayn Malik attended the 2016 Met Gala with his then-girlfriend Gigi Hadid but made it clear he had no interest in a redo, especially as the couple have now split. \n\nDua Lipa, Zendaya and Sabrina Carpenter are expected to attend.","summary":"The star-studded event of the year is tonight, but certain MAGA figures will not be attending the Met Gala.

Smith responds to Trump’s presidential praise: ‘Evidently I have no chance’","text":"It says a lot about someone when President Donald Trump endorses them for president.\n\nLast week, Trump publicly backed media mogul Stephen A. Smith for a 2028 presidential run, which sounded strange coming from him.\n\nTrump has floated the idea of running for a third presidential term despite the Constitution clearly opposing that.\n\nHence, for Trump to back anyone — and someone who he perceives as a “Democrat,” at that — was the most shocking development during the NewsNation town hall last Wednesday.\n\n“I love watching him. He’s got great entertainment skills, which is very important,” Trump, who called in during the broadcast, said of Smith. “People watch him. You know, a lot of these Democrats I watch, I say they have no chance. I’ve been pretty good at picking people and picking candidates. And I will tell you, I’d love to see him run.” \n\nSmith, who says he regrets voting for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in November despite carrying himself like an Independent, was left “aghast” by the unexpected plug, but won’t play into it too deeply.\n\n“I was aghast to be quite honest with you,” Smith said. “I wasn’t looking for any kind of endorsement from anybody, especially him. But he is the President of the United States. There’s a bit of flattery that comes with getting such words from the man who holds the highest office in the land, and I can appreciate that. But in the same breath I’m saying to myself, ‘You know what, evidently I have no chance,’ because if someone like that is throwing out my name, clearly they think that, ‘Yeah, go ahead and do it so we can beat you. We can romp you too.’ \n\n“So I’m not falling for it. It was nice to hear and I appreciated it, but obviously it is what it is. I hear where he’s coming from, but I wasn’t thinking about it any more seriously than that.”\n\nLast month on “The View,” Smith, who recently has delved into politics, said he can “beat them all” for a United States presidential bid in 2028, because, well, Donald Trump did it.\n\n“I mean, right now in the polls, you are nearly tied with Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), Governor Gretchen Whitmer. You have a higher favorability than John Fetterman and Vice President (Kamala) Harris. What do you make of this?” asked co-host, and ex-White House director of strategic communications and Assistant to the President, Alyssa Farah Griffin.\n\n“I make of it that citizens, particularly on the left, are desperate. And I mean it when I say it, I think I can beat them all,” Smith responded. “And I have no desire whatsoever to run for office. I am not a politician, I am not qualified. But I know this much: When you consider who is on the other side and how he has gotten away with saying very little in terms of being coherent and articulating his thoughts clearly and concisely and what have you. This is not something that he is known to do, yet and still he has owned the Republican Party since 2015.”\n\nHowever, based on his most recent comments, it does not appear ESPN’s $100 Million man will seriously apply to become the country’s next commander and chief.\n\nTodderick Hunt covers Sports and Culture.

Last week the administration removed board members appointed by former President Biden from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., including former second gentleman Doug Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris. “Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized,\" Emhoff, who is Jewish and a leader in fighting rising antisemitism against Jewish Americans, wrote on social media after his termination. \"To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.” A few days earlier, the Associated Press reported that a week of events connected with the city's World Pride Festival celebrating the LGBTQ+ community had been quietly canceled at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The news was not surprising to those who have followed the national arts institution since Trump fired much of the board and orchestrated his appointment as chairman. A page on the Kennedy Center website still references its Tapestry of Pride programming, but it doesn't connect to any events. Groups planning festivities at the center told the AP that after Trump's takeover, their contact with the venue went dark, forcing them to relocate their performances to other venues. One sign of resistance, however, flashed on Friday, when House Democrats asked the Smithsonian's inspector general to investigate the legality of Trump’s executive order threatening to pull funding for museums with ideology that the president deemed \"improper.\" That announcement follows resistance seen on a more local level, including the Japanese American National Museum in L.A. declaring that it would not bend to pressure to scrub references to diversity, equity and inclusion from its website. “Our community is based on diversity, equity is guaranteed to us in the Constitution, and inclusion is what we believe in,” a museum official said.

The president’s approval rating hit a historic low, the economy was likely headed toward a recession, and majorities of Americans were feeling less optimistic about the future.\n\nMore people gave Trump’s first 100 days an “F” than any other grade, including about half of independents. People disapprove of Trump’s handling of just about every issue.\n\nEven knowing all that, it was initially a bit of a shock to see a poll showing a majority of Americans agreeing that Trump is a dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy. That clarity is very good news.\n\nAmericans support constitutional checks and balances and due process under law for everyone, which Trump has trashed. Huge majorities, including most Republicans, reject the idea that the president should ignore or defy Supreme Court rulings he disagrees with.\n\nTrump’s response to all this bad (for him) news was to attack the messengers and threaten pollsters and media outlets. It’s so typical for him that it’s not at all surprising. It is barely interesting anymore.\n\nI am far more interested in what our response will be. How will we use the next 100 days and the next 1,000 days to move our country in a better direction?\n\nBy “we,” I mean the American majority that is made up of Democrats, independents and Republicans who still put country over party.\n\nBy “we,” I mean the public officials poised to be part of a significant generational shift in political leadership.\n\nBy “we,” I mean center-left and progressive advocacy organizations, like the one I lead.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly, “we” must include the millions of Americans who have lost faith in democracy or seen their disappointments and challenges exploited and manipulated by right-wing strategists.\n\nRegarding that last “we,” one of the people I am listening to is Rob Flaherty, who directed digital strategy for the Biden White House and was a deputy campaign manager for Kamala Harris’s 2024 campaign. Flaherty recently shared insights about the MAGA movement’s effectiveness at communicating with millions of Americans who are not politics-obsessed activists, people who are sick of traditional politics and don’t trust politicians or the mainstream media.\n\nFlaherty describes how “opt-out” voters were introduced to right-wing politics through “a network of influencers, personalities, podcasters and TikTokers who both inflame their bases and push messages into nonpolitical subcultures” — parenting, fitness and the so-called “manosphere,” among others.\n\nThis profitable and thus sustainable network pushes political messages into nonpolitical outlets and subcultures far more effectively than strategies that are aimed at reaching people through traditional news and advertising.\n\nFlaherty is calling for a strategic re-think that requires a major investment in building both “our corner of the cultural honeycomb” and “pipelines to everyone else.”\n\nThat makes a lot of sense to me. My organization, People For the American Way, was founded by television producer Norman Lear, who was driving political conversations through shows like “All in the Family” years before right-wing strategist Andrew Breitbart ever talked about politics being downstream from culture.\n\nLear started a national conversation about the dangers of authoritarian religious nationalism by producing a short TV ad featuring a forklift driver who didn’t like preachers or politicians decreeing whether he or his wife was a better Christian based on their political beliefs.\n\n“That’s not the American Way,” he said.\n\nThe hardhat ad engaged people at an emotional level, the way the humor in Lear’s TV shows reached people’s hearts and opened their minds.\n\nWe must combine Lear’s ideals and Flaherty’s insights into more effective advocacy within today’s radically different media environment. I believe Democratic Party leaders understand the need to move in that direction as well.\n\nThat’s important, but the cultural communications networks Flaherty is talking about must be broader and beyond the control of the party apparatus and its short-term focus on election outcomes.\n\nThat’s how we’ll reach the millions of Americans who instinctively get the danger of too much power concentrated in any one politician’s hands, whose values lean toward fair play, an economy that works for more of us, and laws that apply to and protect all of us.\n\nThat’s how we’ll build a better America over the next 100, 1,000 and 10,000 days.\n\nSvante Myrick is president of People For the American Way. \n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

which the FCC must approve. \n\nParamount has been trying to broker a settlement with Trump's lawyers to put the Kamala interview debacle to bed, and to smooth the way for that deal.\n\nParamount owner Shari Redstone even reportedly asked CBS News' chief executive if it was possible to delay running sensitive stories about the president on 60 Minutes until the merger discussions ceased - something that has enraged the righteous journalists at the network. \n\n60 Minutes clearly ignored the memo on Sunday. \n\nSunday night's show started with Pelley admitting it was 'nearly impossible to get anyone on camera' to speak about the executive orders Trump has levied against law firms. \n\nHe was able to speak with Marc Elias, a former Perkins Cole partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, who called Trump's executive orders 'an assault on the entire legal profession.'\n\n'Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system,' Elias declared.\n\n'And so when Donald Trump says that I am unethical or that I am undermining his vision of America, I say, \"Boy I must be doin' something right.'\n\nHe then went on to compare the commander-in-chief to a mob boss who is intimidating people in a neighborhood.\n\n'The fact is that these law firms are being told, \"If you don't play ball with us, maybe something really bad will happen to you,\"' said Elias - who first crossed Trump in 2016 when he served as the top lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign and then again in 2020 when he defeated Trump's efforts to contest the election results in court.\n\nPerkins Cole, the former firm, has now been accused of 'unlawful or unsavory practices' due to its connections to investigations related to President Trump or his allies.\n\nA federal judge permanently blocked the executive order against the law firm last week, calling it 'unconstitutional retaliation.' \n\nStill, Trump has targeted other law firms that bring immigration lawsuits or other cases against the government that he deems to be unethical.\n\nHe directed the Justice Department to seek sanctions against attorneys for professional misconduct and asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to refer such firms to the White House so they can be stripped of security clearances and for federal contracts they worked on to be terminated.\n\nSome law firms have since tried to fight back, suing the Trump administration.\n\nMany others, though, inked settlements with the Trump administration, committing to $600 million in free legal work for causes Trump supports.\n\nThe deal cut by five law firms brings Trump's legal kitty close to $1 billion – and specifies that the work will continue 'beyond' the Trump administration.\n\nAmong the law firms that have agreed to work with Trump was Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom - the fifth largest law firm in the world.\n\nIts agreement, though, sent lawyer Brenna Frey leaving the firm in protest. \n\n'The law firm is tacitly saying, \"We'll listen to the administration, we won't fight in court,\"' she said of her decision to resign.\n\n'If we won't fight over this, what else won't we fight over in court against the federal government.' \n\nElias agreed, claiming he is already seeing some law firms refuse 'to take on certain kinds of clients that might upset the administration or not taking on certain kinds of causes that might put them in the crosshairs of the administration.' \n\nJohn Keker, a high-profile attorney in San Francisco, went even further - saying the president was engaging in bribery.\n\n'I'm suggesting that he is violating the rule that says, \"You can't offer a thing of value in return for an official act,\"' he said. 'That happens to be the definition of bribery.\n\n'Anybody else who came to Washington and said, \"I will give you $100 million of free legal services if you do this for me\" would be convicted of a bribe.'\n\nHe added that when the judicial system is afraid to stand up to the country's executive it becomes a 'dictatorship' like China or Russia.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on Sunday's episode, which came just one week after Pelley hit out at his own bosses at Paramount for trying to secure political favor from the Trump administration.\n\nIn his monologue last week, Pelley spoke out about the sudden resignation of the show's long serving executive producer, Bill Owens. \n\n'Bill resigned Tuesday. It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us - and you,' Pelley told viewers, before delivering the bombshell. \n\n'Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.\n\n'No one here is happy about it.' Pelley revealed about the extra supervision that corporate leaders are imposing. He also noted how in quitting, Owens proved he was 'the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.' \n\nThe newscaster went on to make it clear that even though no stories have been blocked outright, Owens believed the creeping corporate oversight had crossed a red line and was undermining the very foundation of journalistic integrity.\n\n'None of our stories has been blocked,' Pelley declared, 'but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires. No one here is happy about it.\n\n'Stories we’ve pursued for 57 years were often controversial, lately the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration. Bill made sure they were accurate and fair—he was tough that way.'\n\nOwens, 58, had been with CBS News for decades and served as only the third executive producer in 60 Minutes' 57-year history since 2019.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Owens cited corporate interference as the breaking point, saying it had 'become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it - to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience.'\n\nOwens - a respected figure who recently helped overhaul CBS's Evening News - went on to promise that '60 Minutes will continue to cover the new administration,' and 'future' ones as well. \n\n'The show is too important to the country,' Owens ultimately declared, weeks after sources told DailyMail.com how the bigwig was 'feeling the pressure' brought by the Trump lawsuit.\n\nHe reportedly added during a '60 Minutes' staff meeting: 'It’s clear the company is done with me.\n\n'It has to continue, just not with me as the executive producer,' Owens said. \n\nThe company has not yet addressed the internal revolt, and representatives for the company did not respond to media inquiries following Pelley's on-air remarks.","summary":"60 Minutes decided to provoke President Donald Trump with a scathing segment on Sunday , even as the show's bosses at Paramount desperately try to settle the president's $20 billion lawsuit.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-14678447/60-Minutes-segment-Trump-law-firms-lawsuit.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/05/05/98031083-0-image-a-28_1746419389796.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/06/2373240474461094917/1024x576_MP4_2373240474461094917.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-05 13:17:41","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":318065316,"title":"'Christmas in May': Former Trump advisor welcomes potential Kamala Harris 2028 bid","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nFox And Friends May 05, 2025 04:22 \n\n 'Christmas in May': Former Trump advisor welcomes potential Kamala Harris 2028 bid \n Former Trump senior advisor Jason Miller discusses Kamala Harris' possible 2028 presidential candidacy as the Democratic Party continues to look for leadership and weighs in on options for potential successors to President Donald Trump.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRFOX & FRIENDSUSELECTIONS","summary":"Former Trump senior advisor Jason Miller discusses Kamala Harris&apos;

This conversation was a part of his town hall talk with Anderson Cooper. Trump’s usual orders are Filet-O-Fish, McDonald’s Big Mac, fries, and a vanilla shake. Moreover, he can eat two McDonald’s Big Mac and Filet-O-Fish sandwiches when he is in the mood.\n\nApart from this, he believes in getting his order with Diet Coke to wash it down.

He's the only Democratic senator seeking reelection from a state Trump carried in winning last year's presidential election.\n\nOssoff is among many Democrats looking for the right way to challenge Trump and Republicans after the GOP won the White House and congressional majorities in 2024. While some Democrats may be eyeing the presidency in 2028, Ossoff has a more immediate goal -- retaining his seat in Georgia, where Republicans hope to pad their narrow Senate majority.\n\nStill, midterm elections typically favor the party opposing the president. And Republicans in recent years have often nominated candidates seen by moderates as as too extreme, including in Georgia. \n\nOssoff, meanwhile, picks his spots carefully, challenging Trump vigorously on some fronts while still professing a willingness to work with him. In recent weeks, he launched his reelection bid with a blistering critique of Trump's second term, weathered criticism from Democrats that he wasn't fighting hard enough, and touted patriotism and service to potential military academy students at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta. \n\nOssoff says there’s no clash between bipartisanship and fighting Trump, but in this still-early stage of the second Trump administration, he's clearly looking to strike the right balance. Georgia voters returned to Trump in 2024 after narrowly choosing Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 and giving Democrats control of the Senate by electing Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in twin runoffs.\n\n“My first and highest obligation is to deliver for the state of Georgia,” Ossoff said in an interview with The Associated Press, vowing to pursue “opportunities to work with this administration or to continue to partner with Republicans in Congress.”\n\nBut Ossoff isn't new to criticizing Trump. He became a resistance hero in his unsuccessful 2017 run in the first special election of Trump's first term, setting a then-record for spending on a House seat.\n\n“We have never seen a president try to wield the federal government to crush his critics and political adversaries. That is something new in American history, and it is, in my view, un-American,” Ossoff said. “And it’s something that should chill us to the bone, no matter our politics, no matter our policy preferences.”\n\nAt a recent town hall, some voters pressed Ossoff to more directly confront Trump.\n\n“Do you think that there’s nothing going to be done?\" asked Kate Denny, of Avondale Estates. ”No. Do something more.\"\n\nWhile Ossoff told Denny that “there is no doubt that this president’s conduct has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment,” he also said he has “no magic button” to stop Trump. The only reliable solution, he said, is reclaiming the House and the Senate.\n\nOssoff said he won't change his approach.\n\n“I am who I am, and I speak directly, I speak candidly,\" Ossoff said. \"I also think before I speak.”\n\nDemocrats had hoped 2021 victories by Ossoff and Warnock signaled the party's resurgence in Georgia. But Republican Gov. Brian Kemp cruised to reelection in 2022 over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Warnock needed a runoff to dispatch the flawed Senate campaign of former football star Herschel Walker. \n\nIn 2024, Georgia voters favored Trump over then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 2 percentage points. Many Republicans bet Ossoff's election in 2020 was a fluke and aim to keep him from running to the center as Warnock did in 2022.\n\n“Ossoff's far-left politics only worked in specific moment of GOP chaos,” Republican political consultant Dan McLagan said. “Now it's like he's showing up at a Lee Greenwood Fourth of July concert with a ‘Free Palestine’ sign and a Che Guevara T-shirt. Everyone has already seen him, and it's too late to change his clothes.”\n\nEven within his own party, Ossoff's course hasn't always been smooth. Some Black Democrats took offense at his effort to oust U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta as chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia. The party changed its rules to make the position paid and full time, with Williams stepping down before Democrats elected a new chair Saturday. Ossoff said he asked Williams to quit, saying that to progress “Georgia Democrats need a statewide party organization with nationally unparalleled professionalism, resources and capabilities.” \n\nThe first Jewish senator from Georgia, Ossoff also upset many Jewish voters when he supported a November resolution by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, to block the sale of some weapons to Israel. \n\nThe vote earned Ossoff a public letter of rebuke from many Jewish institutions, including The Temple, the historic Atlanta synagogue where he had his bar mitzvah. A second letter, first reported by The New York Times, was sent privately by top Jewish donors to Kemp urging him to seek Ossoff's seat.\n\nIn April, Ossoff voted against a new set of Sanders resolutions, and tensions have eased, said Alli Medof, a Democrat long active for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. “The temperature is lowered, but the trust level is not yet restored,\" she said.\n\nOssoff touts his success in getting India to lower tariffs on Georgia-grown pecans and has cultivated voters in Republican areas beyond Atlanta. He enthusiastically backed Biden's incentives to build electric vehicles and has competed with Kemp to take credit for investments. \n\nOssoff walks a finer line on immigration. He voted for the Laken Riley Act, which requires detention of immigrants who are in the U.S. illiegally and are accused of theft and violent crimes. The law is named after a slain Georgia nursing student whose case Republicans publicized. Ossoff said that Americans “deserve secure borders” and that “the Biden administration failed in its border policies,\" but he also says immigration policy must be \"humane.”\n\nRepublicans have already launched ads attacking Ossoff's opposition to a bill barring schools from allowing transgender women to participate in women’s sports. Ossoff calls that an obsession most voters don't share.\n\nOne of Ossoff's trademark moves is to announce investigations — a callback to his job producing documentaries examining corruption before he ran for the Senate. \n\n“I think that in some ways, Congress has neglected now for decades the vigorous use of our oversight authorities,\" Ossoff said at the town hall.\n\nOne investigation led to the Federal Prison Oversight Act, which mandated prison inspections and created an ombudsman to investigate complaints. But not all reform moves have succeeded. After announcing a bipartisan agreement in July to ban congressional stock trading — a major theme of Ossoff's winning campaign against Republican Sen. David Perdue — the deal went nowhere.\n\nOne question is who Ossoff's Republican opponent will be. Kemp, likely the strongest GOP candidate, may decline to run. If he opts out, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is one possible Republican candidate. \n\nGreene could be Ossoff's dream opponent, and he has seemed to invite her entry — betting the north Georgia firebrand would repel swing voters who couldn't stomach Walker. \n\nEither way, the race won't be cheap. Ossoff raised $11.2 million in 2025's first quarter and is already spending heavily.\n\nOssoff declines to discuss possible opponents but says he's ready.\n\n“I welcome any challenger,\" he said, “and I am more than prepared for any challenger.”\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of Sen.

Gen Z is stepping up now. The next generation of conservative leadership doesn’t begin in Washington — it begins in the states,” Run GenZ Executive Director Adam Pennings told the Washington Examiner.\n\n“When bold, young people lead at the state level, the national conversation shifts,” he added. “And when young people lead, real change begins — community by community, chamber by chamber, election by election.”\n\nAccording to a poll by Stay Tuned NBC, Generation Z, both women and men, favor Trump less than the older generations. However, former Vice President Kamala Harris underperformed with young voters in November, with men in particular shifting away from the Democrats.\n\nAs more Gen Z lawmakers enter office, Republicans feel they have an opening to keep chipping away at Democrats’ traditional dominance with the youth vote.\n\nKentucky state Rep. TJ Roberts, a 27-year-old attorney, outlined to the Washington Examiner the messaging the lawmakers discussed with the White House on how to reach younger voters. \n\n“​​We discussed the importance of free speech,” he said. “That was one of the first policy platforms that President Trump discussed in Agenda 47. We have a censorship industrial complex that needs to be addressed at every level of government in order to make sure that Americans, by their birthright, have the right to speak their mind.”\n\n“Government efficiency has been a huge thing that people knew was coming,” Roberts added, naming school choice as a state priority and the border at the federal level. “Those were some of those issues that really stuck with me.” \n\nRep. Brandon Gill (R-TX), 31, was sworn into Congress three months ago, just days before Trump returned to the Oval Office and Republicans started their work with a trifecta in Washington. The Texas firebrand became the youngest GOP member in the 119th Congress and was also named the Republican freshman class president. \n\nMany Gen Z lawmakers at the state level look to Gill for guidance on messaging, which makes them feel that the younger generation has a place at the table. \n\n“I think one thing [the future] looks like is not being hemmed in by political correctness,” Gill told the Washington Examiner. “[Diversity, equity, and inclusion], for instance, we can talk about it is unjust, but this is flagrant anti-white racism, and that’s how I have framed it. That’s the truth.” \n\n“You just have to say things in a direct and blunt way that really reveals the truth,” Gill continued. \n\nA Newsweek analysis of major pollsters since early March shows support from younger voters has fallen off since the 2024 election, with 37% approving and 58% disapproving of his job performance today.\n\nBut Republicans believe Trump offered a template that future candidates for office can build upon. Social issues featured prominently in the president’s campaign rhetoric, but he also focused heavily on the economy, as voters still felt the effects of inflation under former President Joe Biden.\n\n“While he isn’t doing as well with Gen Z, I do think that the president has engaged an entirely new electorate of young voters that were politically apathetic before, that are now actually getting involved in politics because they watched COVID ruin their lives, ruin their prom, ruin their high school graduations or college graduations,” South Dakota state Sen. Amber Hulse told the Washington Examiner. \n\nHulse is one of the 25 who traveled to Washington this week. She is the youngest female Republican senator in South Dakota’s history, reaching many young voters on social media. \n\n“On social media, I think I try to be a lot more relatable, and I share my life,” Hulse said. “I’m just trying to be authentic.”\n\nHulse, who was Miss South Dakota in 2019 and Miss South Dakota USA 2023, graduated from Georgetown Law. The 26-year-old shares bits and pieces of her life on Instagram while promoting her campaign. She said the White House shared ways to be effective surrogates for the president’s agenda as they try to appeal to younger voters.\n\n“They want to see more state and local elected officials promoting, especially our age, promoting President Trump’s agenda, probably to push more younger voters to see from our perspective, obviously we’re very supportive of the president, and so when you have someone your own age sharing that message of support, it may resonate in a different way than hearing someone who’s a 40-year-old white man sharing the same message,” Hulse said. \n\nThroughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made many appearances on podcasts and media outlets that young voters pay attention to, including Joe Rogan’s podcast. \n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) demonstrated Republican interests in these newer formats by inviting conservative podcasters Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh to Trump’s joint address.\n\nMany Democrats, for their part, have agreed they could take a page out of the GOP book when it comes to utilizing these mediums after Republicans succeeded with their campaign strategy in November. \n\n“I think we’ve got to be active on podcasts. We’ve got to be active in speaking to young voters. We’ve got to be going to college campuses. We’ve got to really speak at sporting events, and football games, and get young people where they’re at,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.","summary":"A group of young state lawmakers gathered at the White House this week to discuss how to build on the inroads President Donald Trump made with their demographic in the 2024 election.

Cuomo had subjected New York’s political class to a decade of vicious bullying—he once screamed “I will destroy you!” on a phone call to an assemblyman who was drawing a bath for his daughters—and faced impeachment if he didn’t leave by choice. After his resignation, “it felt like a pall had been lifted from the capitol building,” one state senator recalled. Yet somehow, not four years later, Cuomo is the front-runner to be the next mayor of New York City.\nAt Calvary Baptist, the pastor, Victor Hall, revisited the high point of Cuomo’s career: the early weeks of the pandemic, when he became a national figure by holding daily press conferences that distinguished him as a stern, fatherly foil to the conspiracy-addled President. His lilting Queens accent and snug polo shirts inspired the term “Cuomosexual.” Less than a year before he was ousted, some Democrats called for Cuomo to replace Joe Biden on the Presidential ticket. “My family in Texas, during COVID, watched Andrew Cuomo every day,” Hall told the congregation. When Cuomo got up to speak, he offered a bit of fan service, beginning his remarks with an extended ribbing of his son-in-law, who was known as “the Boyfriend” during the pandemic pressers. “We got off to a little rocky start early on,” the former Governor said, to knowing laughter in the crowd.\nNew York: A Centenary Issue\nSubscribers get full access. Read the issue »\n\nEventually, Cuomo got to the day’s main theme, which was comeback stories. He read dutifully from Bible passages that evoked humanity’s need for salvation, the creases in his forehead scrunching like an accordion when he was especially animated. “They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated, they will renew the ruined cities,” he said, quoting briskly from the Book of Isaiah. New York City, in his telling, was itself a devastated place—too unaffordable, too crime-ridden, too prone to division. “To be honest, this city needs work,” Cuomo said. “Today, we celebrate the power of resurrection.” On those last two points, at least, everyone could say amen.\nWhen Cuomo stepped down, he was technically homeless; in his third term, the governor’s mansion was his only permanent address. He crashed with his sister Maria at her estate in Westchester, and filled his days with extracurriculars that evinced a desire to return to public life: private legal work, a straight-talking political podcast, and the emphatically named nonprofit Never Again, NOW!, which was meant to combat antisemitism. Three decades ago, his father, Mario Cuomo, earned the nickname Hamlet on the Hudson for his tortured deliberations about whether to run for President. The younger Cuomo’s style has always been more Richard III.\nCuomo found his opening last September, when Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City, was indicted on federal corruption charges. To establish residency in the city, he commandeered a midtown apartment where his thirty-year-old daughter, Cara, had been living. (He may have cribbed the move from Adams, who, in the last election, was suspected of trying to pass off his son’s Brooklyn apartment as his own.) His old allies from Albany formed a super PAC and swiftly began collecting checks from New York’s élite. Cuomo made overtures to Black clergy, to the city’s most influential unions, to staunchly pro-Israel Jewish voters. Political figures such as Representative Ritchie Torres, of the Bronx, endorsed Cuomo before he officially announced that he was running, as if moved by the Spirit. “We need a Mr. Tough Guy,” Torres said.\nFor most of the campaign, Cuomo has scrupulously avoided his opponents, the press, and open-air public events, an approach that’s been described as a “Rose Garden” strategy. “He’s a terrible campaigner,” a former aide told me. “We saw this in the polling—when people saw Andrew, they didn’t like him.” Still, an aura of inevitability has hardened around Cuomo, whose opponents include Zohran Mamdani, a thirty-three-year-old democratic-socialist state assemblyman; a handful of progressives mired in the single digits in polls; and Adams, who has lately courted the favor of Donald Trump to avoid possible jail time.\nPerhaps the city’s current crises—crumbling public infrastructure, intractable civic strife, the President’s attempts to strangle his home town—have reminded New Yorkers of a different period of chaos, when Cuomo seemed a beacon of sanity. After being cheered off the stage at Calvary Baptist, the ex-Governor herded his daughters into the back seat of his black Dodge Charger. As he ducked behind the wheel, he cracked the smallest of smiles.\nAt the start of his tenure, Adams declared that he would be a mayor with “swagger.” He became a fixture of exclusive night clubs and doled out cushy positions to old friends from the N.Y.P.D. and the Brooklyn Democratic Party. “Mayors usually have one guy or two,” a former senior official in the Adams administration told me recently. “Adams had twelve guys. There were so many of them, they were bumping into each other.” When the federal corruption charges against him were unsealed, they seemed so inevitable as to be underwhelming. The case focussed on campaign donations, discounted air travel, and other freebies accepted from representatives of the Turkish government, allegedly in exchange for favors like fast-tracking the opening of a new Turkish consulate building—the kind of petty dealmaking that Tammany Hall bosses once approvingly called “honest graft.” But the indictment gave way to something much worse: the Mayor’s cozying up to Trump.\nThe courtship spilled into public view in October, at the Al Smith dinner, an annual white-tie fund-raiser for Catholic charities. During Trump’s remarks, he made an overture to Adams, a fellow criminal defendant: “I was persecuted, and so are you, Eric.” An awkward flirtation ensued. Adams, who during Trump’s first term called the President an “idiot,” hired the celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro, who has represented Elon Musk, for his defense. After Trump won the Presidential election, the Mayor called to congratulate him; later, at a meeting, he told the city’s senior agency heads to refrain from criticizing the President-elect. (“Surreal,” one attendee said.) When Trump was asked if he would consider giving Adams a pardon, he appeared to consider the question for two seconds before saying, “Yeah, I would.”\nIn January, Frank Carone, an ex-marine and a longtime Brooklyn power broker who had served as Adams’s City Hall chief of staff, coördinated with Eric Trump, the President’s second son, to arrange a meeting between the Mayor and the soon to be reinstalled President. Over lunch at Trump International Golf Club, in West Palm Beach, the two men found what Carone, who joined them at the table, described to me as “pleasant surprises of commonality.” But Carone vigorously dispelled any notion of an arrangement between Adams and Trump. “I’ll give you the facts—reality,” he said. “There was no discussion with President Trump about his case, or about immigration, or any deal whatsoever.”\nMaybe there didn’t need to be a discussion. Three days later, on Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, Adams ditched local civil-rights commemorations to attend Trump’s Inauguration, in Washington. Just a few weeks after that, Emil Bove, a senior official in Trump’s Justice Department, asked the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan to put Adams’s case on hold, arguing that the charges were interfering with the Mayor’s ability to help enforce White House immigration policies.\nThe move looked to many like a quid pro quo: legal favors in return for Adams’s coöperation with Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The impression was reinforced by a disastrous joint appearance between Adams and Tom Homan, Trump’s thumb-faced border czar, on a Fox News morning show. “If he doesn’t come through, I’ll be back in New York City,” Homan said of Adams, in his best approximation of a joke. “I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, ‘Where the hell is the agreement we came to?’ ” Adams grimaced, with the good humor of a hostage. The federal judge who eventually dismissed the case, Dale Ho, did so begrudgingly. It was untenable to keep the case hanging over the Mayor’s head, he wrote in his ruling, but added, “Everything here smacks of a bargain.”\nFor months, as this saga played out, New York City politics was paralyzed. Would the Mayor step down? Or go to jail? Or somehow get reëlected? Adams himself liked to point out that he had been surviving allegations of corruption throughout his entire career. But his new relationship with Trump was different: he was making a city with more than three million immigrants vulnerable to a virulently anti-immigrant Administration. Half of Adams’s deputy mayors quit. His fund-raising dried up, his poll numbers sank below freezing, and Governor Kathy Hochul took meetings with civic leaders, including Adams’s longtime ally Al Sharpton, to discuss whether she should exercise her power to remove him. “He was the front-runner until he went on ‘Fox & Friends’ and blew up his career,” an Adams adviser told me, incredulous. “This is very difficult,” Norman Siegel, a former New York Civil Liberties Union head, told me. Siegel represented Adams for years, when he was a cop fighting discrimination in the N.Y.P.D. “I thought Eric would be a transformative mayor,” he said. One current City Hall official told me, “I can’t fathom how this guy is going to govern in August. There’s going to be five people left in this building.”\nThe Mayor, who has denied any wrongdoing in office, sees his alignment with Trump as a lifeline, not a leash. The day his case was dropped, Adams, toting a copy of “Government Gangsters,” by Trump’s F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, gleefully announced that he was indeed running for reëlection—but he would skip the Democratic primary and appear on the ballot in November as an independent. It was a gambit that would strip Adams of party infrastructure, fund-raising networks, and staff, in exchange for six months to rebrand himself. (He is now collecting signatures for two ballot lines of his own invention, called Safe&Affordable and EndAntiSemitism—the latter clearly a dig at Cuomo, who has called antisemitism the “most important issue” in the race.) At his first City Hall press conference after the dismissal of the charges, Adams strode in victoriously to his usual walk-on song—Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind,” spliced with a loop of himself intoning the words “Stay focussed, no distractions, and grind.” He was wearing a tight T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag and the words “In God We Trust.” It was a reference, he explained, to his Orphean political journey to Hell and back.\nWeiner’s downfall allowed Bill de Blasio, then the city’s public advocate, to storm to victory. De Blasio, who won with a rare coalition of Black voters and white progressives, initially seemed poised to be a transformative force in city politics. He established universal pre-K and presided over historically low crime rates. But New Yorkers soured on him, too. He managed to incense both the N.Y.P.D. and people who wanted to defund the police. He dropped a groundhog on Groundhog Day. (The groundhog later died.) He made a wayward Presidential run. In 2022, de Blasio briefly tried to run for Congress in the Tenth District, which covered his neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn, but he barely registered in polls. “Time for me to leave electoral politics,” he tweeted. Unlike many unloved politicians, he had heard the message.\nOne morning a few weeks ago, I met de Blasio at his regular coffee shop in Park Slope. He had just come from the gym—the same one that he’d insisted on commuting to every morning from Gracie Mansion, no matter how much grief the press gave him for it—and was wearing sweats. He held forth among his fellow-patrons with a spirit of magnanimous, possibly unreciprocated camaraderie, greeting a startled man by the door with a familiar “How you doing, brother?” and ordering his breakfast (scrambled egg whites, cheddar, ham, and tomato on multigrain toast) as “mi sandwich especial.” These days, de Blasio most often makes the news for his love life or for such momentous moves as dyeing his salt-and-pepper crewcut. But he’s sensed a bit of de Blasio nostalgia creeping into town. “Since I left office, the No. 1 thing that people come up to me on the street and talk about is pre-K,” he told me, lacing his iced espresso with a heavy pour of simple syrup. “The No. 2 thing that people talk about is that Onion headline.” He quoted it for me, savoring every word: “Well, well, well, not so easy to find a mayor that doesn’t suck shit, huh?”\nThe headline ran in June, 2021, shortly before Adams was declared the winner of the Democratic primary, and before a Cuomo mayoral run was even a distant possibility. De Blasio has little love for Cuomo, who was once a close friend, but who relentlessly undercut him from the governor’s mansion. Their break began in 2014, when Cuomo rejected de Blasio’s attempt to tax the wealthy to pay for universal pre-K. The following year, ahead of a blizzard, Cuomo gave de Blasio only a fifteen-minute heads-up before ordering a general shutdown of the subways, the first snow closure since the system opened, in 1904. Despite what de Blasio sees as Cuomo’s callousness toward the city, he wasn’t surprised that his old foe was dominating the race. “When you have an incumbent mayor in crisis and lots of candidates, it’s like a perfect storm that has opened the door wide for someone with a lot of name recognition,” he said. “It’s a sad state of affairs. But it’s not mysterious.”\nPerhaps the nostalgia is not for de Blasio but for his political moment, when loathed political figures seemed to stay gone. “I think we are in a post-shame era of politics,” Lis Smith, a veteran Democratic strategist who counselled Cuomo through his sexual-harassment scandal, and later regretted it, told me. “I don’t know that without Donald Trump you have an Eric Adams comeback, or an Andrew Cuomo comeback.” Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor who resigned after he was caught patronizing a prostitution ring, told me that he recently offered advice to a mayoral candidate who was struggling to compete with Cuomo’s name recognition. “I said, ‘There are three ways to get into the public consciousness: be around for a very long time, have a ton of your own money, or have a scandal,’ ” Spitzer said. “You know, I did all three at one point.” In this environment, even Weiner has got the idea that New Yorkers might give him another shot. He’s running for City Council in Manhattan. “I collected petitions the last few weeks, and it might have been four out of a hundred people who refused to sign because of my scandal,” he told me in March. “But there might have been five people that didn’t sign because I’m a Zionist.”\nCuomo’s competitors are hoping that voters aren’t quite so ready to forgive and forget. In March, nine mayoral candidates appeared together at a memorial service for elderly New Yorkers who died after Cuomo ordered nursing homes to readmit COVID patients from hospitals—a jab at the former Governor, who sold a five-million-dollar memoir commemorating his pandemic leadership before there was even a vaccine. That same month, the former city comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the mayoral candidates, invited reporters to join him on what one adviser described as “a bus tour of places in the city Andrew Cuomo fucked up.” The stops included One57, a tower on Billionaires’ Row, intended to symbolize the city’s housing crisis, which worsened under Cuomo’s governorship, and the Fifty-ninth Street–Columbus Circle subway station, representing his neglect of mass transit.\nThe tour started outside the Oriana, the dreary midtown rental tower that serves as Cuomo’s city address. Just before Stringer arrived, Cuomo himself strolled out of the lobby, then hurried back inside at the sight of reporters. “I have nothing to say,” he said tersely. Stringer showed up a few minutes later, carrying a dozen bagels, which he’d picked up to welcome Cuomo into the race—a local’s dig at a carpetbagger from Albany. “You just missed him!” someone shouted.\nIn this campaign, Cuomo has touted his biggest wins as governor, which include legalizing same-sex marriage and instituting a fifteen-dollar minimum wage, guaranteed paid family leave, and gun-control measures. His accomplishments, however, were often achieved by tormenting both his opponents and his subordinates. Andy Byford, the renowned transit expert whom Cuomo hired to fix the city’s beleaguered subways, quit two years into the job, saying that the Governor’s undermining had made his work “intolerable.” In early 2020, Michael Evans, the official in charge of the renovation of Moynihan Train Hall, died by suicide, having spent the final weeks of his life fretting over a looming deadline to complete the project. In a since-deleted tweet, his partner wrote that Evans had killed himself “after being terrorized by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.” (“A lot of us are still saddened by this loss,” a spokesperson for Cuomo said, adding, “As was reported at the time: Evans rarely spoke to the governor.”)\nDuring the pandemic, Cuomo’s feud with de Blasio reached dangerous levels of dysfunction, as the two jostled for control of shutdown orders, vaccination sites, and distribution of personal protective equipment. “He went out of his way to make it harder for us,” a de Blasio administration official recalled. “If we were going to do something, Cuomo would rush to do it before us—just to cut us off at the knees.” And some of those who brought Cuomo down have continued to feel his wrath: Lindsey Boylan, a former state official who was the first woman to publicly accuse him of harassment, said that she has spent nearly two million dollars on legal fees, fending off the aggressive tactics of Cuomo’s taxpayer-funded lawyers. “He will go to all lengths to destroy people who have not been quote-unquote loyal to him,” Karen Hinton, a former press aide of Cuomo’s, said.\nCuomo declined numerous requests for an interview. But he did answer one question I sent him, over text message. Two years ago, as the rumors of a Cuomo comeback persisted, I wrote an article arguing that few people in New York wanted Cuomo or his style of politics back. When he resigned, his approval ratings were below forty per cent, and he had few remaining friends in public life. I asked Cuomo, who had read the article, what I’d missed. “Either the world changed or you were wrong,” he wrote, promptly. “You pick it.” He declined to answer further questions.\nThe night began with an interruption from Paperboy Prince, the activist and perennial gadfly candidate, who hijacked the stage wearing clown makeup and white gloves. Stalking back and forth, Prince, who’d qualified for the primary ballot, denounced the organizers for excluding him from the forum. He declared the entire proceeding, and maybe the entire city, a farce. “Take him down, please!” one organizer shouted at some N.Y.P.D. community-affairs officers. “Leave him alone! Let him speak!” a woman in the crowd shouted back.\nThen the candidates appeared, one by one, making short speeches and taking questions from Ayana Harry, a reporter for NY1. Zellnor Myrie, a progressive state senator wearing a suit and neon-yellow Nikes, talked about his plan to build a million more homes in the city. Adrienne Adams, the sober, well-liked speaker of the City Council, spoke about racism and maternal-mortality rates. Stringer did his Borscht Belt-comedian-with-an-M.B.A. shtick, referring to Trump as “that schmuck.” Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, rattled off racial disparities in net worth for New York families, sounding like a companionable guest on an economics podcast.\nMamdani, the leftist assemblyman, smiling, handsome, and bearded, called for freezing rent on rent-stabilized apartments, establishing government-run grocery stores, and making buses free. “I think New Yorkers are hungry for a different kind of politics,” he said, speaking with the polished sincerity of a socialist who went to Bowdoin. A guy sitting next to me remarked, “He’s got a guru factor.” An older woman in the row ahead of me wrote his name in a notebook that she’d brought with her, then looked him up on her phone. She crossed out what she’d written and spelled his name again, correctly.\nMr. Tough Guy spoke last, at around 9 P.M. As Cuomo strode across the stage, people took out their phones, straining their wrists to preserve a glimpse of the man. About a dozen people in the audience, members of groups called Planet Over Profit and Climate Defiance, came down the aisles and assembled on the stage. “Fuck you, Cuomo!” several protesters yelled. “Cuomo lies, New Yorkers die!” Cuomo, who was already seated, warily arched his eyebrows. Cops jostled with the demonstrators for several minutes, trying to force them from the stage before they could unfurl their banners.\n“Get them out, please,” Henry Butler, the vice-chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, a former Brooklyn N.A.A.C.P. committee chairman, and a Cuomo endorser, pleaded to the police. Addressing the audience, he announced, “The clown show is over. I’m going to say this: One of the issues and problems with the Democratic Party—we claim to be a big-tent party—is that if you don’t have a certain view, then they try to shout you down. And I think it’s a disgrace when I see a bunch of young, white progressives trying to tell Black people who we should vote for.” Not everyone in the protest group was white, but this last line prompted the event’s biggest applause anyway.\nCuomo got on with the interview, unfazed. Unlike his opponents, he felt little need to dwell on the specifics of policy. (A few days earlier, it had emerged that his housing plan was written with help from ChatGPT.) When he was asked about the disconnect between falling crime statistics and persistent fears about crime in the city, the former Governor made it personal. “Don’t tell me that my feeling is wrong,” he said of his perception that the city has become unsafe. “My feeling is legitimate because that’s what I feel.” The statement was a notable contrast with how Cuomo has discussed the women who accused him of sexual harassment—a subject that he wasn’t once asked to speak about that night.\nMost of the Democrats running for mayor are not scandal-tarred political titans of yore but, rather, wonkish reformers with polished résumés. In other words, they would rather talk about nearly anything other than the foibles of Adams and Cuomo. “Celebrity is flashier than competence,” Lander, a stalwart of municipal government, said. Adrienne Adams told me that she meant to pick up where Kamala Harris’s campaign had left off, offering voters a chance to elect a Black female leader. She has suffered from what consultants call a “name-I.D. problem,” not least because she shares a last name with the embattled incumbent.\nMamdani, the only non-Cuomo candidate to consistently breach double digits in polling, has done so because he’s the most ideologically distinct and social-media savvy. He began his campaign for State Assembly in 2019, as young leftist politicians in the mold of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were being elected around New York. He still retains the idealism of those days, though his platform reflects more modest ambitions: free buses, not free health care. “Ideas are only as good as our ability to implement them,” he told me, over adeni chai at a Yemeni coffee shop on the Upper West Side. Outlets such as the Post have defined Mamdani by his opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza and his support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, calling him “preposterous” and “dangerous”—a framing that Cuomo and his allies have happily embraced. Though Mamdani has yet to surpass twenty-five-per-cent support in any poll, he believes that he can appeal to voters beyond his leftist base. “I’ve had a lot of uncles at mosques across the city come up to me, take a selfie, and show me a selfie of them with Eric Adams at the same mosque four years ago,” he told me. “They’re saying, ‘I voted for him, and now I’m voting for you.’ ”\nCuomo grew up in Queens, too—in Holliswood, about a mile from Trump’s childhood home. Three years ago, when the ex-Governor was still politically radioactive, Adams extended a friendly hand to him, publicly dining with him at Osteria La Baia, a midtown Italian restaurant where the avowedly vegan Mayor was known to order the fish. Now Cuomo is trying to capitalize on his moment of weakness. Adams has responded with astonishment. “I was here already,” he told reporters a couple of weeks ago at City Hall, sounding genuinely upset. “Why are you in my race? It’s like almost when you have a house somewhere and someone is trying to move in—it’s, like, go find your own house.” Still, one gets the sense that Adams is excited to spend the summer sparring with Cuomo, even if he’s likely to lose. “You can’t campaign through tweets and videos,” he said in March, seeming to taunt the ex-Governor. “Come out here and [answer] tough questions.”\nIt’s been nearly fifty years since Cuomo was last involved in a mayoral race. In 1977, at the age of twenty, he helped manage his father’s doomed run against Ed Koch. Koch, who never married, held a decades-long grudge against the Cuomo campaign, and particularly Andrew, for the “Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo” signs that reportedly appeared in Queens that summer. Since entering the race this year, Cuomo has made claims of having changed. In a seventeen-minute video that he used to launch his campaign, he admitted to having made mistakes, though he didn’t specify which mistakes, or what lessons he has drawn from them. But, as Trump tries to impose his will on New York City, such gestures might be beside the point. “That’s part of the pitch—that we need this, like, superhero-strongman-asshole, and that’s Andrew Cuomo,” Lis Smith, the Democratic strategist, said. Several people who have fallen out with Cuomo made the same comparison. “He’s the Democratic Party’s Donald Trump, without question,” Karen Hinton, the former press aide, said. “So, if that’s who New Yorkers want to vote for, Andrew Cuomo is their man.”\nWhat would Mayor Cuomo’s posture be toward President Trump? Cuomo has appeared to be of two minds on the subject. In an interview with ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, Cuomo expressed a neighborly view of the President. “Donald Trump is from New York City, and he knows our problems here,” he said. During a private event in Washington Heights at around the same time, he assured a roomful of people that he would fight Trump on their behalf: “We’re going to be able to handle President Trump—don’t you worry about it.” One former aide to Cuomo told me that the two seem to understand each other. “When he talks to Trump, he calls him ‘boss,’ ” the former Cuomo aide said. “I’ve never heard him call anyone else ‘boss.’ ” (The Cuomo campaign denies this.) The former aide continued, “I think he and Trump get along very well—he kind of admires him.” ♦","summary":"As the Trump Administration encroaches on the city, Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams try to salvage their political careers.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/05/12/why-cant-new-york-have-nice-mayors","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6812495d40782b1b15d7f858/16:9/w_1819,h_1023,c_limit/NYadamscuomo20250423_15013131.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 10:00:00","author":"Eric Lach","authors":["Eric Lach"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.013},{"id":317993762,"title":"America’s Labor Unions Are Souring on Trump","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nStock markets slid and business executives frowned when President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on auto imports, but he could take solace that the nation’s most prominent union president applauded the move. Shawn Fain, the usually combative president of the United Auto Workers, heaped praise on the tariffs, saying they would help “end the free-trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades.” Fain added, “The Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”\n\nFain’s words got plenty of attention—he had been an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign, and many Americans saw his praise of the auto tariffs as evidence that labor unions were enthusiastic about Trump.\n\nBut now, five weeks later, it’s abundantly clear that most unions are angry as hell about Trump 2.0. “We’ve been facing a barrage of attacks from the administration,” said Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main union federation, in an interview. “They’re slashing jobs. They’re ripping up union contracts. They’re cutting services. Trump’s delivered on nothing that he promised. We would say his scorecard is a fail.”\n\nTrump’s anti-union moves have come faster and been vaster than labor leaders had anticipated. He and Elon Musk have fired tens of thousands of federal workers while ignoring job protections in their union contracts. Trump dismissed the chair of the National Labor Relations Board well before her term ended, leaving the board without a quorum to function. He issued an executive order to destroy collective bargaining rights for 1 million federal employees. “That’s the biggest assault against labor in our history,” Shuler said.\n\nAmerica’s labor unions—which represent 16 million workers—have responded to Trump’s blitz in several ways. First, they’ve mounted a huge defensive effort, largely through lawsuits, to save the jobs of fired federal employees and to preserve federal workers’ bargaining rights. (A federal judge ruled that Trump violated the law in terminating the bargaining rights of federal workers.)\n\nSecond, many unions and their members have joined the resistance—they’ve marched in many communities’ “Hands Off” rallies, and they have staged many of their own protests. Third, unions have held town hall meetings in purple districts where Republican members of Congress refused to do so because they feared the public’s wrath.\n\nShuler said a new AFL-CIO poll found that a majority of union members say the country is moving in the wrong direction, with many complaining that Trump has done nothing to reduce inflation. “We’re seeing the most unified labor movement we’ve seen in a long time,” Shuler said. “The best organizer is a bad boss.”\n\nUnions weren’t unified during the 2024 campaign—indeed voters in union households backed Harris over Trump by just 8 percentage points—53 percent to 45 percent, according to exit polls. While most unions endorsed Harris, two powerful unions—the Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters—didn’t endorse anyone, a move seen as a blow to Harris. The Teamsters have sought to maintain good relations with Trump, and the union’s president, Sean O’Brien, vigorously backed Trump’s choice for labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the daughter of a Teamster. But some Trump moves have irked union leaders who sought good relations; O’Brien slammed Trump’s choice of a management-side lawyer, Crystal Carey, to be the NLRB’s general counsel. O’Brien said she worked at a “notorious union-busting” firm,” “wants to decimate labor unions,” and “has spent her entire professional career backing Big Business to the detriment of working people.”\n\nConstruction workers have long been viewed as more pro-Trump than most union members, but that didn’t stop Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trade Unions, from angrily calling on Trump to bring home Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongly deported immigrant who was a member of the sheet metal workers’ union. “We demand” that he “be returned to us and his family now,” McGarvey said. “Bring him home.”\n\nJimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, explained why many construction unions are souring on Trump: As a result of Trump’s cancellation of subsidies and various projects, he said some $100 billion in planned construction has been scrapped, from electric battery factories to offshore windmills—eliminating a large number of construction jobs. “It’s been chaos. It’s been economic chaos,” Williams said. “Then there are the immigration raids, and Trump’s sheer lack of wanting to follow the rules and the law. It’s scary. We are more conservative than most unions, but what you’re seeing right now from the Trump administration is not conservative. You’re seeing fascism.”\n\nAfter lauding Trump’s auto tariffs, the UAW’s Fain faced criticism within the labor movement, and he has increasingly distanced himself from the president since then. In an April 10 speech, Fain said, “We’re not aligning everything we do with the Trump administration.” Then he voiced a far-from-glowing view about Trump’s tariffs: “Big picture, we support some use of tariffs on auto manufacturing and other similar industries. We don’t support the use of tariffs for political games about immigration or fentanyl. We do not support reckless, chaotic tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”\n\nHe slammed Trump for seeking to destroy federal workers’ bargaining rights, for “illegally firing” a member of the NLRB, and for “attacks planned” on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. “That’s not good for the working class,” he said. Asserting that Trump has ignored due process, Fain attacked many deportations, noting that Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who faces deportation for his pro-Palestinian activism, had been a member of a UAW graduate students’ union.\n\n“There is a reason we campaigned aggressively against this vision of America in the last election, and we will continue to speak out against it and mobilize against it,” Fain said.\n\nAlthough the 2026 elections are 18 months away, the union movement is already planting seeds to help ensure the Democrats win back control of the House of Representatives. Labor leaders hope that union members who have marched in protests this spring will be willing to talk to fellow workers and knock on doors next year when the 2026 campaign heats up. “This is about ladders of engagement,” Shuler said. “Most of the actions on the ground are pathways and drumbeats that will keep escalating. People are frustrated, and they want to channel that into action.”\n\nJoseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said it’s good that unions are mobilizing against Trump, but he added a note of caution: “There’s still a lack of strategy to really bring pressure to bear. Part of it is everyone was caught by surprise by the ferocity and scope of what’s happening. There is a movement to form an effective strategy, but I don’t think it’s fully in place yet.”\n\nMcCartin said unions did well last November in getting out members to vote for Harris. “But they just weren’t able to compensate for the bleeding of working-class voters beyond their ranks,” he said. “The threat of a smaller union movement trying to swim against that current raises serious questions.”\n\nSome labor leaders I spoke to worry that unions face an existential crisis, with Trump seeking to sabotage the NLRB and destroy bargaining for federal workers. Moveover, Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon have brought lawsuits seeking to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional. And then Trump is forever seeking to use his populist magic to woo blue-collar workers.\n\nBut Michael Podhorzer, a former AFL-CIO political director, sees a silver lining. “I don’t see anything out there right now that will divide unions,” he said. “It’s an eternal truth about politics that when you’re running against the party in power, it really takes a lot to divide you. The major elements of the labor coalition have come together, and Trump has certainly reinforced that.”\n\nIn other words, a united labor movement will play a big role in helping the Democrats take back the House in 2026.","summary":"And they're already planting seeds to help ensure the Democrats win back control of the House of Representatives.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/05/unions-donald-trump-2026-election-kilmar-abrego-garcia.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/35eeaba5-b374-4be9-bcf1-9be6f9345562.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 09:40:00","author":"Steven Greenhouse","authors":["Steven Greenhouse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":318017238,"title":"Trump orders ‘100% tariff’ on all movies produced abroad after China’s plan to cut US film imports","text":"US President Donald Trump said Sunday he was ordering new tariffs on all films made outside the United States, claiming Hollywood was being “devastated” by a trend of US filmmakers and studios working abroad.\n\nThe announcement comes as the White House is coming under mounting criticism over its aggressive trade policies that have seen Trump impose sweeping tariffs on countries around the globe.\n\n“I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick reposted Trump’s missive, saying “We’re on it.”\n\nNo details were provided on how the tariff would be implemented.\n\nTrump’s post comes after China, which has taken the brunt of the US president’s combative trade policies with 145 percent tariffs on many goods, said last month it would reduce the number of US films it imported.\n\n“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.

Host Scott Pelley spoke to several lawyers about Trump’s executive orders targeting and penalizing law firms associated with Democratic attacks against him. Pelley said it was \"nearly impossible\" to find people to speak on camera about the subject out of fear of retaliation. One of the few who did speak to Pelley was Democratic attorney Marc Elias, who worked as general counsel for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and whose former firm, Perkins Coie, was at the center of one executive order in March. Perkins Coie was the firm that hired the company behind the infamous Christopher Steele dossier about Trump’s alleged connections to Russia. Among other things, the order called for Perkins Coie employees to be stripped of their security clearances and banned from accessing government buildings. It also called for the termination of the firm's existing contracts with government clients. TRUMP LASHES OUT AT CBS, '60 MINUTES,' SAYS THEY SHOULD PAY A 'BIG PRICE' Elias referred to Trump as \"the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system\" and suggested the rule of law is at risk if these executive orders stand. Without that, Elias claimed, Trump could take on other institutions. \"This is why the business community ought to care,\" Elias said. \"Today, it might be that, you know, Donald Trump thinks he can take over the election system through one of his executive orders. Tomorrow, maybe it's the banking system. After that, maybe it's contracts. Maybe he decrees I'm going to decide which contracts are binding and which contracts aren't binding.\" He added, \"So, the legal system is fundamental to how our society operates, how capitalism operates, and everyone should have a stake in that.\" Donald Ayer, former Deputy Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush, also called Trump’s order \"a direct attack on the whole functioning of our judicial system\" with the whole system of government at risk. Another lawyer, San Francisco attorney John Keker, spoke about his effort to recruit law firms to oppose and challenge Trump’s executive orders, saying that the alternative could result in a dictatorship. \"That's what's happened in China. It happened in Russia. These are legal systems that look like legal systems, but in fact are controlled by a dictatorship,\" Keker said. \"60 Minutes\" did not air a guest to argue in favor of Trump’s orders against law firms.

The reign of Black mayors can be traced back to one man: Maynard Jackson, who the city’s largest airport is partially named after. \n\nBut even after his death in 2003, Black mayors have continued to shape Atlanta, making it one of the most talked about places on the map. In fact, they don’t call Atlanta the Black Mecca for no reason. Nestled in the middle of the red state of Georgia, Atlanta is not only the capital, but it is a hub for all things Black culture. Known as the chicken wing capital, the history behind what makes Atlanta so special can be boiled down to just a few things: Black folks, good food, and complicated politics.\n\nThis is the very true story of all of Atlanta’s Blackity-Black mayors. The good, the bad, and especially the ugly...\n\nThe Year That Set the Tone\n\nAfter the 1968 assassination of Atlanta native Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the city took a moral hit. But a new kid on the block promised hope for Black folks and change for everyday people which would be the start of a historic political run. In 1973, Maynard Holbrook Jackson Jr. was elected the first Black mayor of Atlanta with 60 percent of the vote. At just 35 years old, Jackson unseated incumbent Sam Massell and changed the course of history.\n\nJackson’s First Term Successes and Critiques\n\nJackson’s first term was mostly spent trying to regroup the city following major the racial upheaval of the 50s and 60s. But while he made good on his promise to help Black families in the city, the Morehouse College graduate faced harsh criticism from white Atlantans who said he was going too far, too fast, and being too Black.\n\nThe Atlanta Child Murders of 1979-1981\n\nDespite the public largely approving of Mayor Jackson, a string of gruesome child murders would forever taint his legacy as many families of the young Black victims said he wasn’t doing enough. Additionally, crime in the city was up with a 69 percent increase in homicides between 1978 and 1979, according to the Census Bureau’s Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, and per usual, the mayor was to blame.\n\nJackson Steps Down\n\nBy the end of his second term in 1982, Atlanta’s first Black mayor decided to change directions and pursue a business venture. And in the meantime, another Black democrat would take the spotlight and win over the people’s hearts.\n\nThe Rise of Andrew Young\n\nWith Jackson out, Andrew “Andre” Young, a pastor and former leader of the Civil Rights Movement, saw his opportunity to hit the Georgia political scene. In 1972, the Howard University graduate became the first Black American elected in Georgia to Congress since Reconstruction. And his success in Congress prompted then-President Jimmy Carter to appoint him to serve as ambassador to the United Nations in 1977.\n\nCoretta Scott King Taps Young for Mayor\n\nMLK’s widow, Coretta Scott King, urged Young to throw his name in the mayor election pool. Young won with 55 percent of the vote in 1981, making him the second Black mayor the city had ever seen. And at the end of his second mayoral term, Mayor Jackson encouraged Young to run for office as his replacement “because it was very important that we not go back on the progress that Maynard made,” Young told the AJC, “and the progress that he made was controversial.”\n\nYoung Building on Jackson’s Foundation\n\nFollowing in his predecessor’s footsteps, as mayor, Young set out to help Black families and bring businesses back to Atlanta. During his term, Young used his international connections to bring global business back to his city. Eventually, Young ran for governor and lost.\n\nThe Comeback of a Lifetime\n\nWe should’ve known Jackson couldn’t stay away for too long... In 1990, the city’s first Black mayor won back his office just in time to start preparing for the 1996 Olympics coming to Atlanta. Jackson’s third term was all about getting the city ready for an expected economic and population boom. One of his greatest achievements was the completion of Freedom Parkway.\n\nBill Campbell AKA the New Kid on the Block \n\nAfter the reign of Jackson, he endorsed William “Bill” Campbell for mayor. Marking the third back to back Black mayor of the city, Campbell’s contributions to the city included rebuilding the public housing system and modernizing the legal, public works, and water departments. Also, violent crime dropped significantly during his time. According to journalist Douglas A. Blackmon, Campbell was a “post–civil rights movement black politician who would leverage the economic rebirth of Atlanta, build a bridge to white voters, and become a U.S. senator or a Georgia governor.”\n\nCorruption Digs Deep\n\nBy the middle of Campbell’s term, he was facing scrutiny over his handling of Atlanta’s notorious “Freaknik” parties and an even bigger scandal which would lead to his indictment. In 2006, the former mayor was convicted of evading taxes between 1997 and 1999. He was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison but was acquitted of corruption charges.\n\n Shirley Franklin as the First Black Woman Mayor of Atlanta\n\nBy 2002, Atlanta was ready to turn another page in the history books. Shirley Franklin was elected with 50 percent of the vote, making her not only the first Black woman to hold the office but the first woman elected in Atlanta history... ever!\n\nGoing Down as One of the Best Mayors in Atlanta\n\nIn 2005, Time Magazine named Franklin one of the five best big-city American mayors. Later that year in October, she was included in the U.S. News & World Report “Best Leaders of 2005\" issue. Most notably, the Howard University graduate repaired Atlanta’s sewage system, and she was reelected in 2005 with a whopping 90 percent vote. “I have a theory about legacy, which is, if you have to talk about it, you don’t have much of a legacy,” she said to the AJC.\n\nStarting Over With Kasim Reed\n\nAt the end of Franklin’s second term, Atlantans wondered who exactly could fill her huge shoes. Kasim Reed stepped up to the plate— being Franklin’s 2001 campaign manager— and soon began winning people over. In 2008, the Howard University graduate resigned from the Georgia Senate to run for mayor winning only by a few hundred votes.\n\nBribery, Indictments, and More Corruption in Atlanta\n\nSoon after winning reelection in 2013, the city was hit with yet another corruption scandal. This time, Reed was at the center of it all after he fired key personnel. During a news conference, Reed insisted “I have never taken a bribe,” and he gave reporters access to over 400 boxes worth of documents which were demanded by federal investigators. Reed was never charged, but still the thought of his connection to bribery haunts his legacy.\n\nAtlanta Gets a Black Mayor Named Keisha\n\nWe all know her name: Keisha Lance Bottoms. In 2017, she revived Atlanta politics when she was elected mayor. During the height of President Donald Trump’s first term, Bottoms declared Atlanta as a “welcoming city” for refugees targeted by the president. “Our city does not support ICE. We don’t have a relationship with the U.S. Marshal[s] Service,” she said. “We closed our detention center to ICE detainees, and we would not pick up people on an immigration violation.”\n\nOne Term Mayor Catches Hell From All Angles\n\nMuch of Mayor Bottoms’ term was shaded by 2020 BLM protests, a global pandemic, and constant attacks from the president and his supporters. By the end of her term, the FAMU graduate set her eyes on the White House. She took her name out of the reelection cycle and instead drew closer to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrouble in White House Paradise\n\nIn 2022, Biden appointed Bottoms as the director of the Office of Public Liaison, according to Fox News. And in 2023, she moved to the President’s Export Council. Just last month, she was fired by President Trump, and now rumors suggest she could come back and run for reelection as mayor or even take on governor.\n\nThe Underdog and Cop City\n\nWhen Bottoms dropped out of the race, once again, democrats were scrambling to pick a new candidate. They landed on Andre Dickens who won office in 2022. With the city looking to build “Cop City,” reviews of Dickens are mixed almost three years into his term. Dickens has outwardly supported “Cop City,” according to GBP, and many Atlantans are unhappy with his stance. Still, this isn’t the end for the Georgia State graduate.\n\nUnwritten History\n\nAtlanta continues to be a beacon of Black excellence, innovation and drama. Perfectly fusing the traditions of southern culture with modern society, Atlanta not only is home to the world’s busiest airport but also to some of the world’s greatest political minds.","summary":"Unlike most cities, especially in the south, Atlanta has consistently been run by Black politicians since 1974, and there’s a secret to it all. The reign of Black mayors can be traced back to one man: Maynard Jackson, who the city’s largest airport is partially named after. \n\nRead more...","url":"https://www.theroot.com/the-true-story-behind-why-atlanta-hasnt-had-a-white-may-1851774377","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/fb5ed711c3f6df64c39b9ae345ca8113.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 09:00:00","author":"Phenix S Halley","authors":["Phenix S Halley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":317934896,"title":"Donald Trump Is Labelling His Opponents As \"Communists\"","text":"For years, President Donald Trump blamed \"communists\" for his legal and political troubles. Now, the second Trump administration is deploying that same historically loaded label to cast his opponents - from judges to educators - as threats to American identity, culture and values.Why? Trump himself explained the strategy last year when he described how he planned to defeat his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in the White House election.\"All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody who is going to destroy our country,\" he told reporters at his New Jersey golf club in August.Trump did just that - branding Harris \"comrade Kamala\" - and he won in November. With the assent of more than 77 million Americans who cast ballots - 49.9% of the vote - Trump is carrying that strategy into his second term.What he's talking about is not actually 'communism'In 2025, communism wields big influence in countries such as China, Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba. But not the United States.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"The core of communism is the belief that governments can do better than markets in providing goods and services. There are very, very few people in the West who seriously believe that,\" said Raymond Robertson of the Texas A&M University Bush School of Government & Public Service. \"Unless they are arguing that the government should run U.S. Steel and Tesla, they are simply not communists.\"The word \"communist,\" on the other hand, can carry great emotional power as a rhetorical tool, even now. It's all the more potent as a pejorative - though frequently inaccurate, even dangerous - amid the contemporary flash of social media and misinformation. After all, the fear and paranoia of the Russian Revolution, the \"Red Scare,\" World War II, McCarthyism and the Cold War are fading into the 20th century past.But Trump, 78 and famous for labeling people he views as obstacles, remembers.\"We cannot allow a handful of communist radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws,\" Trump said Tuesday in Michigan while celebrating his first 100 days in office. The White House did not reply to a request for what Trump means when he calls someone a \"communist.\"The timing of his use of \"communist\" is worth noting.Trump's Michigan speech came during a week of dicey economic and political news. Days earlier, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs published a poll showing that more Americans disagree with Trump's priorities so far than agree with them, and that many Republicans are ambivalent about his choices of focus. After the speech, the government reported that the economy shrank during the first quarter of 2025 as Trump's tariffs disrupted business.On Thursday, senior presidential aide Stephen Miller stepped to the White House podium and uttered the same c-word four times in about 35 minutes during a denunciation of past policies on transgender, diversity and immigration issues.\"These are a few of the areas in which President Trump has fought the cancerous, communist woke culture that was destroying this country,\" Miller told reporters.His collection of words offered a selection of clickbait for social media users, as well as terms that could catch the attention of older Americans. Voters over age 45 narrowly voted for Trump over his Democratic rivals in 2020 and 2024.Smack in the middle of Miller's sentence: \"communist.\"\"It tends to be a term that is loaded with negative affect, particularly for older Americans who grew up during the Cold War,\" said Jacob Neiheisel, a political communications expert at the University at Buffalo. \"Appending emotionally laden terms to political adversaries is a way to minimize their legitimacy in the eyes of the public and paint them in a negative light.\"A 'Red Scare'-era figure influenced a young TrumpThe threat that communists could influence or even obliterate the United States hovered over the country for decades and drove some of the country's ugliest chapters.The years after World War I and the Russian Revolution in 1917, along with a wave of immigrants, led to what's known as the \"Red Scare\" of 1920, a period of intense paranoia about the potential for a communist-led revolution in America.\"McCarthyism\" after World War II meant the hunt for supposed communists. It's named for Sen. Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin Republican who conducted televised hearings at the dawn of the Cold War that drove anti-communist fears to new heights with a series of threats, innuendos and untruths.Culturally, the merest suggestion that someone was \"soft\" on communism could end careers and ruin lives. \"Blacklists\" of suspected communists proliferated in Hollywood and beyond. McCarthy fell into disgrace and died in 1957.The senator's chief counsel during the hearings, Roy Cohn, became Trump's mentor and fixer as Trump rose as a real estate mogul in New York. The Cold War was more than three decades old. The threat of nuclear war was pervasive.Communism started to collapse in 1989 and the Soviet Union was dissolved two years later. It's now Russia, led by President Vladimir Putin.But communism - at least in one form - lives on in China, with which Trump is waging a trade war that could result in fewer and costlier products in the United States. By week's end, Trump was acknowledging the potential consequences of his government stepping in: Americans might soon not be able to buy what they want, or they might be forced to pay more. He insisted China would be hurt more by the tariffs.The real modern debate, Robertson says, is not between capitalism and communism, but about how much the government needs to step in - and when. He suggests that Trump is not really debating communism vs. capitalism anyway.\"Calling people who advocate for slightly more government involvement 'communists' is typical misleading political rhetoric that, unfortunately, works really well with busy voters who do not have a lot of time to think about technical definitions and economic paradigms,\" he said in an email. \"It is also really helpful (to Trump) because it is inflammatory, making people angry, which can be addictive.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"The threat that communists could influence or even obliterate the United States hovered over the country for decades and drove some of the country's ugliest chapters.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-is-labelling-his-opponents-as-communists-8333864","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-04/caam6hm_donald-trump_625x300_26_April_25.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 07:56:15","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.037}]}
