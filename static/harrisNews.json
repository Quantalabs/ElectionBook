After disastrous week ex-US Rep rallies support in California governor run - AP News","text":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Katie Porter is fighting back.\n\nAfter a disastrous week that saw calls for the former Democratic congresswoman to end her campaign for California governor, supporters are rallying around her and seeking to deflect criticism about her temperament and readiness for the state’s top job.\n\nOn Wednesday, a snippet of a recent TV interview went viral showing the progressive favorite Porter in an awkwardly tense back-and-forth with a reporter — at one point she threatened to walk out. Shortly afterward, a video surfaced of a 2021 interview showing her loudly berating a staffer. \n\nAfter a round of condemnation from her Democratic rivals and a flood of online mockery, Porter showed no sign of stepping aside while her campaign lined up supporters to help her weather the fallout. \n\n“In this critical moment in our country we don’t need to be polite, go along to get along, establishment politicians that keep getting run over by the opposition,” said Teamsters California Co-Chairs Peter Finn and Chris Griswold, which endorsed Porter in September. “We need strong leaders like Katie Porter that are willing to call it like it is and stand up and fight for everyday Californians.”\n\nTiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United, said in a post on the social media platform X that Porter “is one of the toughest, most authentic leaders I’ve ever met.” Jessica Mackler, the president of EMILYs List, which works to elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights and endorsed Porter last month, said in a statement that Americans know that Porter is “the gutsy leader California needs to go toe to toe with (President) Donald Trump.” \n\nAn unexpected word of support came from Whoopi Goldberg, who said on “The View” that “Some people apparently are surprised by these videos. I am not. We see these videos with ... lots of different people.”\n\n“Human beings have bad days,” Goldberg added.\n\nIt’s yet to be seen whether Porter suffers with voters, if at all — the primary isn’t until June, and the general election is in November 2026. But the unflattering videos are certain to encourage other potential candidates to give the wide-open, crowded race a look. \n\nPadilla considers running\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla is among those who have not ruled out a run in the 2026 contest. \n\n“There are quite a few people looking at this field and saying, ‘There has got to be somebody better,’ ” said Democratic consultant Andrew Acosta. Potential candidates are watching, “How far does Porter fall?”\n\n“I think this whole thing is indicative of a race that is not catching fire,” he added. \n\nPorter — who became a social media celebrity by brandishing a white board at congressional hearings to dissect CEOs and break down complex figures into assaults on corporate greed — is probably the best- known candidate in a race that was bypassed by former Vice President Kamala Harris. Porter is known for her potent small-dollar fundraising across the country.\n\nThe crowded field to replace outgoing Gov. Gavin Newsom includes former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra and former state controller Betty Yee, all Democrats, and Republicans Steve Hilton, a conservative commentator, and Chad Bianco, the Riverside County Sheriff, among others.\n\nTesty exchange with reporter\n\nA segment of Porter’s recent interview with Julie Watts, a CBS California reporter, went viral. In the clip, Watts and Porter get into a testy back-and-forth discussion and Porter at one point says, “I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m going to call it,” clapping her hands.\n\nPorter’s campaign said the interview continued for 20 minutes after the tense exchange settled down.\n\nPorter issued a statement in response to the video of her shouting at a staffer, obtained by the website Politico, saying, “I have sought to be more intentional in showing gratitude to my staff.”\n\nCampaign spokesperson Peter Opitz said in a statement, “Californians are hungry for a governor ... they trust can fight for them against Trump.”\n\n“Katie is never going to be shy about calling out ‘B.S.’,” Opitz said. \n\nStatements of support for Porter implied, sometimes indirectly, that the videos illustrated a well-known aspect of her style — she’s known to display a tough, even if sometimes blunt, personality.\n\n“Katie Porter is a fighter,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Dave Min, who holds Porter’s former Orange County seat, said in a statement. “She would make a great governor.”","summary":"Katie Porter pushes back.

The weekday show runs from 6-10 a.m. \n\nMORE: Take a peek inside World of Flight, Nike's new Jordan Brand store in Center City\n\nThe programming change comes days after iHeartMedia laid off talent at stations across the country. The cuts included Power 99 hosts Mikey Dredd and MuthaKnows, who started their \"Rise & Grind Morning Show\" at the station in 2011 after years together hosting \"The Hot Boyz\" show on weeknights. \n\n\"The Breakfast Club,\" which debuted in 2010 on Manhattan's Power 105.1, is hosted by the trio of Charlamagne Tha God, DJ Envy and Jess Hilarious. The show is known for boundary-pushing gossip, entertainment news and high-profile guests that have included former president Barack Obama and former Democratic presidential nominees Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton. \n\nPhilly natives Kevin Hart, Will Smith and Patti LaBelle are among a long list of artists and comedians who have made appearances on the show in years past. \n\n\"The Breakfast Club\" reaches an audience of 6.6 million monthly listeners and has been streamed more than one billion times on its podcast, according to iHeartRadio data. The show now airs in more than 90 markets. Charlamagne and DJ Envy both entered the Radio Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\nIn a statement Friday announcing the move to Power 99, iHeartMedia executive vice president of programming Thea Mitchem called \"The Breakfast Club\" a \"cultural touchstone.\"\n\n\"Its unique blend of candid conversation, humor and insight keeps it as relevant today as ever, shaping culture while giving a platform to voices that matter,\" Mitchem said. \n\nThe hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" have sometimes been embroiled in public feuds with their guests, including Charlamagne's intervention in a past beef between Philly rappers Meek Mill and Beanie Sigel. In a tense 2016 interview with Sigel, Charlamagne called the rapper a \"hater\" for taking shots at Meek Mill, who also has appeared on the show several times over the years. \n\nMore recently, Meek Mill criticized the show's hosts after they discussed his commentary on the federal sex trafficking trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. During Combs' trial in May, the hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" brought up past speculation about Meek Mill's relationship with the convicted hip hop mogul. Combs was sentenced last week to spend 50 months in federal prison. \n\nIn a 2023 lawsuit filed against Combs, public court documents contained alleged details about the rapper's infamous parties at his home in the Hamptons. In the court filings, the redacted name of \"a Philadelphia rapper who dated Nicki Minaj\" prompted rumors about Meek Mill's sexual orientation after the lawsuit alleged Combs had sex with the unnamed rapper. Meek Mill dated Minaj about a decade ago. \n\nMeek Mill posted about the trial on social media in May, saying hip-hop blogs had \"amplified an agenda\" against him two years ago. The hosts of \"The Breakfast Club\" later spoke on their show about how Meek Mill's ties to Diddy had largely faded from public discussion by the time of Combs' trial. They wondered why Meek Mill, who has become a well-known advocate for criminal justice reform since serving time in prison, would have bothered to enter the fray again. \n\nMeek Mill responded to becoming a topic on the show in a comment posted on Instagram and later shared on Facebook by DJ Envy. \n\n\"...I been saving communities and helping families 10 plus years,\" Meek Mill wrote. \"We don't follow the world of talkers.\" \n\nThe layoffs at iHeartMedia come in advance of the company's quarterly earnings report, which is around the same time the nation's largest radio station owner made cuts last year. The company underwent restructuring when it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 and has made several rounds of layoffs in recent years. \n\nMikey Dredd and MuthaKnows both posted on social media after learning they had been let go from Power 99. \n\n“After 30 unforgettable years at Power 99, today I say goodbye to a place that became much more than just a job,\" Dredd wrote. \"From nights and mornings on air for 25 years, I’ve had the privilege of connecting not only with an incredible audience but also with friends and colleagues who became family. The deep relationships I’ve built, both inside and outside the station, have filled my life with true joy and love.”","summary":"A","url":"https://www.phillyvoice.com/power-99-breakfast-club-philly-charlamagne-iheart-layoffs/","image":"https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/101025_Breakfast_Philly.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 21:31:31","author":"Dj Envy,Michael Tanenbaum","authors":["Dj Envy","Michael Tanenbaum"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.421},{"id":368160372,"title":"LA Palisades firebug’s arrest isn’t a relief — it launches a reckoning","text":"On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom assured us that the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht, the alleged arsonist who set the most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles history, brought “closure” to the “thousands of Californians whose lives were upended.”\n\nHe couldn’t be more wrong.\n\nRinderknecht’s arrest isn’t an end to the January tragedy that killed 12 of my neighbors and wiped out 7,000 Pacific Palisades homes and businesses.\n\nIt is just the beginning of a reckoning for California — and for the nation.\n\nWhy? Because as the investigation and prosecution unfolds, the tentacles of the case will force us to face up to the mess we’ve gotten ourselves into on multiple fronts. \n\nThe devastating Palisades Fire, which blazed out of control for nearly three weeks, was a damning indictment of LA’s irresponsible leadership, with empty reservoirs and a missing mayor.\n\nBut we haven’t yet talked much about the missing firefighters.\n\nAt least 3% of Los Angeles County firefighters lived outside the state as of 2022 — many of them senior commanders.\n\nThey reside in border states like Arizona or Nevada, and even as far away as Florida and Alaska.\n\nThere they can afford to own homes and can send their children to schools that don’t replace math lessons with gender-identity quizzes.\n\nThey fly in to do a 7-to-12-day shift, then fly home for several weeks off.\n\nWho could blame them, given the Golden State’s exorbitant cost of living? \n\nOn the first night of the fires, when the winds turned a fever dream into a nightmare, the county put out an all-hands call for firefighters.\n\nEveryone was asked to report to work as soon as possible, no exceptions.\n\nBut with 3% of the force residing in other states — and hundreds more firefighters living hours away, in Central and Northern California — the investigation may uncover some uncomfortable truths.\n\nHow many of our firefighters were missing in action as Rinderknecht’s fire raged beyond control?\n\nHow many homes burned because they could not take their posts when ordered?\n\nWhy hasn’t Los Angeles set any sort of residency requirement for its emergency personnel, like most other big cities do?\n\nIt’s not just about questionable employment tactics; it’s about the interconnectedness of every terrible progressive idea — which we now know can literally burn down entire neighborhoods.\n\nHow can we expect our first responders to protect us when it counts if they can’t even afford to live here?\n\nHere’s another tentacle: The arsonist is a dual citizen, born and raised in France, who took up residence in the United States as an adult. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it his mission to wrestle with our illegal immigration problem, but as the arson arrest makes clear, America is going to need to take a long, hard look at its legal immigration system, too.\n\nRinderknecht’s chaos, the “despair and bitterness” of the rap song he had on repeat, should have been France’s problem, not ours.\n\nAmerica has enough of our own criminals and fringe lunatics. Why was this arsonist here at all?\n\nFinally, the case could make us confront the insidious concern lurking underneath this arrest: the specter of terrorism.\n\nRight now, the arson suspect is being dismissed as a lone wolf, but we’ve seen a concerning uptick in domestic terrorism since Trump was re-elected.\n\nIs there a connection to the deliberate and despicable anti-government chaos we’re seeing today in Portland, Chicago and elsewhere?\n\nWas Rinderknecht inspired by the online hatred that’s fueling violence all around us?\n\nThe accused arsonist was “agitated and angry,” witnesses say, and obsessed with “dystopian” visions.\n\nWhat happened in Los Angeles County in January has a lot of the markers of domestic terrorism — yet another tentacle that could reach out far beyond California.\n\nIf it turns out Rinderknecht had connections to groups like Antifa, this case goes from bad to worse . . . for all of us. \n\nThe arsonist will be held accountable, but his apprehension is not the end of anything. \n\nAll eyes are on California these days, as Newsom dangles his presidential ambitions and Kamala Harris tours the country to remain relevant.\n\nWith the recent epic meltdown of gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter, the rest of America is being treated to the daily insanity we suffer at the hands of both our politicians and our criminals.\n\nThe fires, the fallout and the felonies are part of that larger story — and this state and our nation must now grapple with the consequences.\n\nKira Davis is an independent opinion journalist and podcaster living in Southern California.","summary":"As the prosecution of the alleged arsonist unfolds, the tentacles of the case will force us to face up to the mess Californians have gotten ourselves into.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/10/opinion/la-palisades-firebugs-arrest-isnt-relief-but-a-reckoning/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/JRCAL1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 21:20:49","author":"Kira Davis","authors":["Kira Davis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":368149680,"title":"US senator seeks telecom firms' data on lawmakers from probe of Jan 6 capitol riots","text":"WASHINGTON :Republican U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn wants the CEOs of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile to disclose whether they received or objected to subpoenas for phone data from eight U.S. senators related to a probe of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, according to letters seen by Reuters on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Republicans disclosed a 2023 document that showed the FBI obtained phone data known as \"toll records\" from senators' phones, including Blackburn, tied to the U.S. Justice Department's investigation of the riot.\n\nShe wants the telecom companies to answer questions including whether they provided \"the cell phone records of their personal devices, their official government devices, or both?\"\n\nSeparately, Republican Senator Bill Hagerty - who is among the eight lawmakers whose information was seized - said he had written to Verizon seeking answers about the disclosure of his phone records.\n\nVerizon on Friday told Reuters it had provided the requested customer information and call records.\n\n\"Federal law requires companies like Verizon to respond to grand jury subpoenas,\" Verizon said. \"We received a valid subpoena and a court order to keep it confidential.

When the talks between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza were brought up, she interrupted and challenged the network to take charge of the story. She “came in hot,” the source said, suggesting names to book on the air—including Mike Pompeo, Hillary Clinton, and Antony Blinken—and offering to reach out to people herself if they hadn’t been contacted already. “I’m not sure she realizes we have an entire booking team that works through all of this,” the source said. “It was very clear right away that she doesn’t quite understand how things work.” After Weiss proposed getting in touch with Pompeo, top producer Jenna Gibson told her that he was a Fox News contributor and could not appear on CBS News.\nGrowing pains are to be expected for Weiss, a successful and charismatic operator who nonetheless has no experience running a TV news network, much less a newsroom as large as the one at CBS News. After the call, Weiss returned to her office, outside of which stood two burly private security guards. Later on Thursday, she had lunch with Face the Nation moderator Margaret Brennan and met with other correspondents. Earlier in the week, she lunched with O’Donnell. There was a dual purpose for her trip down to DC: On Wednesday night, she hosted an event for the website she cofounded just four years ago, The Free Press, which Paramount, under the new ownership of David Ellison, acquired for a reported $150 million in a deal that led to her installation as the top editor of CBS News.\nWeiss’s first week on the job offered glimpses into what kind of editor she’ll be at CBS, a lingering question that has been a source of endless speculation inside the network.\nWill she be the Bari Weiss who cofounded The Free Press, the popular but polarizing website known for assailing the liberal pieties of traditional media institutions like CBS News? The polemicist who began her career in the public eye with a crusade against university professors critical of Israel?\nOr will she bring some much-needed innovation to a nearly century-old news network, streamlining operations that insiders describe as antiquated and instilling fresh energy in a network whose flagship evening newscast is mired in third place in the ratings—while leaning on an experience with which she has undoubtedly had success: building up a robust, paying, and relatively young audience online?\nStaffers at 60 Minutes, the network’s iconic newsmagazine program, are anxiously waiting to find out. “Fair to say everyone here, from top down, is on edge,” said the staffer in the DC bureau. “There were a lot of jokes about loyalty tests on Monday morning.” They’re mostly keeping quiet, biting their tongues, and avoiding leaks as media reporters frantically hit the phones with questions about this uncertain new era at CBS.\n“Let’s do the fucking news,” is how Weiss signed off when she spoke to CBS News staffers for the first time on Tuesday, a cringe-inducing rallying cry perhaps better suited for a start-up like The Free Press than the venerable employer of Lesley Stahl.\nYet Weiss has given some staffers reason for optimism. “The mood right now is a lot different than if you had asked me 48 hours ago,” said one current CBS producer on Tuesday night. “People like her enthusiasm.” The memo she wrote introducing herself to staff also hit the right notes. Upholding the “journalistic values” she identified, said a former CBS producer who worked for decades at 60 Minutes, is “what 60 Minutes has been trying to do for 58 years.”\nWeiss, the current producer added, seems thus far “impressed” by the might of the CBS newsroom, suggesting that the worst fears about how she would approach the job are so far assuaged. Those fears are that this legacy-media apostate—who, after quitting The New York Times in dramatic fashion, launched a website premised on the notion that institutions like the Times and CBS are hotbeds of woke politics—might seek to gut CBS from the inside and reorient its coverage to appease the right.\nInstead, Weiss has emphasized in several meetings that she understands the true problems facing CBS News, pertaining less to its editorial direction and more to the future viability of its business model. “She’s mentioned in a couple of meetings that she wants to focus first on digital and social strategy,” the current producer said. “Which is smart.”\n“But the proof is not in what you say to the troops on opening day,” said the former CBS producer. “The proof is how you lead the troops during difficult times.”\nHer position at CBS News is an unusual one. Not only is “editor in chief” a new job at the outlet, but Weiss will report directly to Paramount boss Ellison, while Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News, reports to Paramount television head George Cheeks, who also reports to Ellison, as does Paramount president Jeff Shell.\nWhy Weiss will report directly to the boss of her outlet’s parent company has been a point of confusion among CBS staff.\nOne source with knowledge of the negotiations between Weiss and Ellison explained: “That’s easy. She made it a condition of the acquisition. She doesn’t want anyone meddling in editorial decisions other than the owner.” (Vanity Fair has reached out to Paramount for comment. A spokesperson for The Free Press declined to comment.)\nIn that sense, you can see Weiss’s role as that of editorial monarch, operating outside the org chart and accountable only to Ellison, while Cibrowski handles the gritty and unglamorous business of managing a network bracing for reported layoffs in the coming weeks as the newly merged Paramount Skydance looks to cut costs and consolidate resources. (Representatives for Paramount did not provide comment to several outlets that reported on the expected layoffs.)\nWhile the charm offensive may be working for now, sources cautioned that it shouldn’t be expected to last. “At no point has Bari Weiss ever had a light touch, socially or professionally,” said the source with knowledge of the deal negotiations. “The woman commands every room she enters.”\nOn Friday morning, Weiss sent an email to CBS News staff requesting a “memo from each person across our news organization” outlining “how you spend your working hours,” as well as “your views on what’s working; what’s broken or substandard; and how we can be better.”\nIn a conclusion seen internally as somewhat ominous, Weiss wrote that she wanted to “familiarize” herself with the staff “to know that we are aligned on achieving a shared vision for CBS News.”\nIn addition to taking the top editorial job at CBS News, Weiss will retain her titles of CEO and editor in chief of The Free Press. There will no doubt be friction between those two roles, not least because the latter outlet is a hard-charging commentary site that has frequently attacked the former. (A sampling: “How Is CBS Marking October 7? By Admonishing Tony Dokoupil”; “Does CBS News Know Where Jerusalem Is?”; “The Fallout at CBS Continues: At the home of Walter Cronkite, journalists debate Israel’s existence.”) Weiss has repeatedly emphasized in meetings with staffers that restoring “trust” in the media is a guiding principle. That mission will certainly be complicated by her side gig as the editor of a commentary site often seen as partisan, though the website will, according to a press release, “maintain its own independent brand and operations.”\nThe night before meeting with staff in the Washington bureau on Thursday, Weiss hosted a Free Press event at which she interviewed Palmer Luckey, the young Oculus founder who went on to launch defense-tech company Anduril. Luckey, who has claimed he was fired from Facebook over his support for Donald Trump, has also described himself as a “radical Zionist.” (Facebook has denied Luckey’s claim, with a spokesperson saying: “We can say unequivocally that Palmer's departure was not due to his political views.”) A number of CBS News stars attended the event, including senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang and political director Fin Gómez.\nAmid roiling anxieties about what the future holds under Ellison’s CBS, insiders hope both he and Weiss keep their hands off 60 Minutes, the vaunted Sunday news program that remains, in its 58th season, the crown jewel of the so-called Tiffany Network. “There’s nothing to fix at 60,” said the former producer who spent decades at the show. “And I think she’ll see that.” (Its latest season debuted to an impressive 10 million viewers, some four times the average prime-time audience for Fox News.)\nThat Weiss will let 60 be 60 might be wishful thinking. She is expected to be deeply involved in its programming—particularly when it comes to coverage of Trump’s administration, a fraught subject for the network, and the war in Gaza, a story of particular interest to Ellison and Weiss, both of whom are strong supporters of Israel.\nThe chief concern among those who see Weiss’s appointment as either a way to appease the Trump administration or an effort to instill coverage more supportive of Israel is that she will use her power to neuter coverage of those subjects. Both are fraught for the network: A 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris sparked a spurious Trump lawsuit, which CBS parent Paramount settled to the tune of $16 million ahead of its merger with Skydance, in an agreement House Democrats have denounced as a “bribe” to achieve regulatory approval. A January 2025 segment on atrocities in Gaza and US involvement in the war drew a rebuke from then Paramount chief Shari Redstone and prompted CBS to appoint a minder for 60 Minutes, eventually leading to the resignation of executive producer Bill Owens, who cited an inability to make “independent decisions.”\nEllison and his father, billionaire Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, are both staunch supporters of Israel. Weiss, who once said she “happily agreed” with being called a “Zionist fanatic” and whose site this summer published a widely criticized piece nitpicking cases of starvation in Gaza, has her own opinions about how the press should cover the Middle East. (When asked about the Free Press reporting on Gaza starvation, the former 60 Minutes producer sighed. “Isn’t that a sad thing to try to be debating the fine points of?” he asked. “That is pitiful.”)\nThose biases could set up a clash down the road between Weiss and 60 Minutes. One source pointed out that star correspondent Scott Pelley signed a new multiyear contract last year, saying that the deal gives him leverage to hold his ground should a conflict with Weiss come to a head, and adding that veteran Stahl is in a similar position to push back.\n“If their stuff starts getting censored or preempted or tabled or pushed, then all bets are off,” said one CBS staffer. Installing her own team in the standards and practices department could be a way that Weiss—and, by proxy, Ellison—plans to influence coverage in a manner more subtle and insidious than outright spiking stories or installing new producers.\nSixty Minutes is in good hands with executive producer Tanya Simon, a highly regarded journalist who served as executive editor of the newsmagazine for six seasons before ascending to the top job. Staffers there hope that she will stand firm against any undue interference or political pressure, acting as a buffer between the show and network leadership in the same way Owens tried to.\nWeiss may find there’s little to fix. Despite complaints from the right, the average episode of 60 Minutes is a remarkably moderate production. “Has anybody actually watched it?” joked a former CBS News executive. “If there’s a problem with it, it’s that it’s too inoffensive! It’s not taking any chances.”\nIn that sense, it might not be a conflict over coverage that ends up being Weiss’s first real test. The first hurdle for Weiss may very well be a president so intolerant of coverage that falls short of hagiography that he regularly takes Fox News to task.\nTrump has signaled openness to this new iteration of CBS News. With the president having vanquished CBS in his fight over the Harris interview, emerging with $16 million for his legal costs and future presidential library, his White House is reportedly now in talks with 60 Minutes about a sit-down interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker.\nWeiss has yet to signal how she might be involved with such a high-stakes interview. For now, the dozens of staff members who make up the workforce of 60 Minutes can only wait and see how their coverage will be handled, and which stories on the upcoming slate will trigger an intervention. I’m told there are few stories in the works that could generate controversy; the first two episodes of the season barely mentioned Trump. Still, anxieties persist.\n“It’s natural to be scared of something or someone that you don’t understand and you don’t know,” said the former 60 Minutes producer. “The fear of the unknown is one of the great fears in the human heart.”\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that George Cheeks reports to Jeff Shell; he reports to David Ellison.","summary":"As the Free Press cofounder takes the helm at CBS News, all eyes are on its preeminent newsmagazine—inside and outside the building.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/bari-weiss-gets-to-work-at-cbs","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68e81ec2ac22ea6851f8b406/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/vf1025-bari-weiss.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 19:31:59","author":"Aidan McLaughlin","authors":["Aidan McLaughlin"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":368127516,"title":"The lyrics to Taylor Swift's song 'Elizabeth Taylor' pay homage to the starlet's life and scandals. Here are the details you missed.","text":"Taylor Swift&apos;s \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is sprinkled with nods to her fiancé&comma; her family&comma; and&comma; of course&comma; her adversaries — but the album&apos;s most overt homage is to a Hollywood icon with no apparent personal connection to the author.The second song on \"Showgirl\" is named \"Elizabeth Taylor\" after the famous actor&comma; who died in 2011 at 79 of congestive heart failure. Taylor became a box-office sensation in the &apos;50s and is often cited as the highest-paid movie star of the &apos;60s&comma; largely thanks to a historic multi-million payday for 1963&apos;s \"Cleopatra.\"Today&comma; Swift is likewise renowned as a commercial force; last year&comma; the Eras Tour became the first to gross over $2 billion&comma; and \"Showgirl\" just scored the biggest album sales week in history.The two women also share a knack for captivating critics&comma; casual onlookers&comma; and tabloids with their romantic exploits. Taylor&apos;s name is synonymous with her eight marriages and seven husbands&comma; which earned her a reputation as a dangerous seductress. The producers and distributors of \"Cleopatra\" even sued Taylor and her costar-turned-husband&comma; Richard Burton&comma; for \"depreciating the commercial value of the movie by their &apos;scandalous&apos; conduct&comma;\" The New York Times reported. (Both Taylor and Burton were married to other people when they began filming.)Swift has sparked similar moral outrage and mockery for her \"string of high-profile romances\" and \"super intense relationship patterns.\" Swift has repeatedly rejected this narrative: While promoting her 2017 album \"Reputation&comma;\" she observed that analysis of her music is often reduced to a \"paternity test.\"\"My mistakes have been used against me&comma; my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment&comma; and my songwriting has been trivialized as &apos;oversharing&comma;&apos;\" Swift wrote.Taylor&apos;s son&comma; Chris Wilding&comma; even said in an interview last year that he admires Swift&apos;s defiance&comma; specifically citing Swift&apos;s endorsement of Kamala Harris for president&comma; which she signed&comma; \"Childless Cat Lady.\"\"Huge props to her&comma;\" Wilding told The Guardian. \"That reminds me a little bit of the same spirit my mom had.\"In a clip from \"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl&comma;\" a theatrical event paired with the album&apos;s release&comma; Swift said \"Elizabeth Taylor\" explores themes of love&comma; notoriety&comma; and anxiety.Swift also said the lyrics are woven with biographical details about Taylor&comma; \"but the feelings of what it conveys are things that I&apos;ve absolutely experienced.\"Indeed&comma; Swift sings to open the song&comma; \"Elizabeth Taylor&comma; do you think it&apos;s forever?\" She uses the starlet&apos;s name to evoke a sense of public scrutiny&comma; posing a question like a cynical reporter (or&comma; in Swift&apos;s case&comma; a gossip blogger). The lyric reads like an attention-grabbing headline.During an interview with Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show&comma;\" Swift described Taylor as a role model for handling \"immense pressure\" and scrutiny.\"She kept making more and more daring art&comma;\" Swift said. \"It&apos;s almost like the more polarizing people were about her&comma; the more she just kept doing even more challenging roles&comma; taking bigger risks.\"Swift added that she admired how Taylor continued working diligently at the height of her fame and used humor to deflect attention from her detractors.\"I&apos;ve done that with songs like &apos;Blank Space&comma;&apos;\" Swift said&comma; referring to the No. 1 hit single she wrote as a satire of her serial-dater reputation. \"I think you have to be able to combat negativity with humor.\"In the first verse of \"Elizabeth Taylor&comma;\" Swift sings&comma; \"That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée.\"According to Taylor&apos;s website&comma; which is run by the trustees of her estate&comma; Burton proposed to her in Portofino&comma; Italy&comma; in 1964&comma; on a \"wisteria-covered balcony\" at the Hotel Splendido. Taylor&apos;s website also states that she and Burton lived at the Hôtel Plaza Athénée in Paris for six months in 1971.For her part&comma; Swift was in Paris in May of last year&comma; when she performed four shows at the La Défense Arena. Swift previously revealed that she wrote and recorded \"Showgirl\" during her downtime on the European leg of the Eras Tour — so it&apos;s possible these lyrics were inspired by that stopover.The reference also suggests that Swift was daydreaming about a romantic engagement&comma; à la Burton&apos;s proposal to Taylor&comma; over a year before Kelce proposed in Missouri.In the song&apos;s hook&comma; Swift sings&comma; \"If your letters ever said&comma; &apos;Goodbye&apos; &sol; I&apos;d cry my eyes violet&comma; Elizabeth Taylor.\"Taylor was known for her striking eyes&comma; which came across as blueish-purple onscreen.In the second verse&comma; Swift sings&comma; \"We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank&apos;s &sol; They say I&apos;m bad news&comma; I just say&comma; &apos;Thanks.&apos;\"This lyric nods to a Hollywood hot spot&comma; Musso & Frank Grill&comma; which Taylor reportedly frequented in the &apos;50s. It also nods to Taylor&apos;s reputation&comma; both as an outspoken woman in a male-dominated industry and as a serial heartbreaker — in short&comma; as \"bad news.\"Confronted with the same accusation&comma; Swift&apos;s semi-autobiographical narrator responds with dry sarcasm.Like many of the tracks on \"Showgirl&comma;\" \"Elizabeth Taylor\" is ostensibly a love song.Swift has frequently expressed anxiety about making love last&comma; as in 2019&apos;s \"The Archer\" (\"Who could ever leave me&comma; darling&comma; but who could stay?\")&comma; 2020&apos;s \"Peace\" (\"Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?\")&comma; and 2024&apos;s \"The Prophecy\" (\"I&apos;m so afraid I sealed my fate&comma; no sign of soulmates\").Swift&apos;s romantic anxiety is reinforced by her past experiences with dating in the public eye&comma; as she observes in the first verse of \"Elizabeth Taylor\" (\"All the right guys promised they&apos;d stay &sol; Under bright lights&comma; they withered away\").However&comma; in the song&apos;s bridge&comma; Swift takes pride in the body of work she has built off those disappointments: \"All my white diamonds and lovers are forever &sol; In the papers&comma; on the screen&comma; and in their minds.\"Not only is this a reference to Taylor&apos;s famous collection of jewels and her signature fragrance&comma; \"White Diamonds&comma;\" but Swift seems to compare her own songs to precious gems or historical artifacts. Swift&apos;s lovers and experiences are immortalized in her discography&comma; much like the enduring legacy of Taylor&apos;s filmography.Swift previously referenced Taylor in \"…Ready For It?\" in 2017. The opening track on \"Reputation\" is about the thrills and fantasies sparked by a budding romance.\"He can be my jailer&comma; Burton to this Taylor &sol; Every love I&apos;ve known in comparison is a failure&comma;\" Swift sings. \"I forget their names now &sol; I&apos;m so very tame now &sol; Never be the same now.\"Taylor was famously married twice to Burton. As husband and wife&comma; they costarred in classic films like \"Who&apos;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966) and \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967).In keeping with the core theme of Swift&apos;s sixth album \"Reputation\" — love and tenderness coexisting with scandal and notoriety — Wilding told The Guardian that his mother was the \"dominant figure\" in her relationship with Burton: \"He&apos;s sitting there quietly&comma; and she&apos;s protecting him&comma; fending off reporters and taking charge.\"Wilding also said he never questioned his mother&apos;s cycle of marriage and divorce&comma; despite the media frenzy it inspired.\"It seemed normal&comma;\" Wilding said. \"She was the anchor and the constant factor.\"","summary":"Taylor Swift's new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" features the song \"Elizabeth Taylor.\" Here's a guide to the song's lyrics and their meaning.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-elizabeth-taylor-song-lyrics-explained-2025-10","image":"https://i.insider.com/68e7dadd1c1f80efbec5450c?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 19:01:47","author":"Callie Ahlgrim","authors":["Callie Ahlgrim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.234},{"id":368118480,"title":"D4vd altered Texas home ownership after cops search his house where Tesla with teen girl's body was found?

The 20-year-old American singer reportedly transferred the deeds of two homes he owns near Houston, Texas, to his mother, reported TMZ. The move comes around a time when the body of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, the teenager who was found in a Tesla registered to the singer. The homes are reportedly not listed directly under the 20-year-old performer's name, but are instead listed under the Thorn Rose Trust, according to KPRC Houston. The name is reminiscent of D4vd's 2023 EP Petals To Thorns.ALSO READ: Pam Bondi exposed?

Police found the decomposing remains of the girl, who went missing aged 13 in California last April, last month in a Tesla. The vehicle had previously been parked near a Hollywood Hills mansion that he was renting before it was towed to an impound lot.Live EventsOfficers then raided the home of the singer for evidence and d4vd has now cancelled all the tour dates he had left in support of his debut album Withered, including a date at London’s Roundhouse. According to the real estate documents, D4vd transferred the home deeds on September 18 and 22. The first transfer happened just a day after police executed a search warrant at D4vd's Hollywood rental home on September 17.ALSO READ: Ex-Johns Hopkins Professor Wendy Osefo arrested for major fraud: Her surprising link to Kamala Harris in spotlightLate last month, the Los Angeles Police Department disclosed that Celeste Rivas had likely been dead for “several weeks” before her body was found in the front trunk of D4vd’s Tesla. The slow pace of the investigation and the limited release of details surrounding Rivas’ death have drawn widespread criticism of the LAPD. Throughout the opaque inquiry, D4vd has remained silent regarding any potential connection to the victim discovered in his vehicle.According to reports, the singer abruptly ended his $20,000 lease and vacated his Hollywood Hills home—the same area where his Tesla had been parked—shortly after police conducted their search. An LAPD spokesperson confirmed that “several items of evidence” were collected during the raid, though no further information about the specifics has been released.ALSO READ: Is October 13 a holiday in US?

Since launching the campaign, we’ve organized more than 30 events across the state and voters consistently tell me they want an open and vibrant primary process. With so much at stake, Mainers want to decide which candidate can defeat Susan Collins, defend our democracy from Donald Trump, and deliver for working families,” he said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to spokespersons for Collins, Mills and other Senate candidates for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMaine generally leans Democratic, having backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about seven points last November, but Collins has handily won reelection in the past due to her more moderate policy positions and close ties to the state. Democrats, however, believe 2026 has the potential to be her closest race yet as President Donald Trump’s approval slips nationwide, and as he remains unpopular in the Pine Tree State.\n\nNational Democrats view Mills, who has also won by wide margins in her two gubernatorial races, as a top recruit for the race. But others are less sold on the idea of her candidacy, believing that other Democrats already in the race such as Graham Platner, whose campaign has garnered nationwide attention, could make for a stronger candidate.\n\nMaine Governor Janet Mills speaks during a press conference in Lewiston, Maine, on October 26, 2023.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMaine is likely a must-win for Democrats hoping to reclaim control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority. Collins is the only Republican in a Harris-won state up for reelection. Democrats also view an open race in battleground North Carolina as a prime pickup opportunity, but other potential flips would require them to win more conservative territory.\n\nMills will bring high name recognition into the race, as voters are already familiar with her from her stint as attorney general and governor. She flipped the governor’s office in 2020, winning by about seven points, and won reelection in 2022 by nearly 13 points against former Governor Paul LePage. She is unable to run for reelection due to term limits.\n\nBut she may face a competitive primary against Platner, Maine Beer Company co-founder Dan Kleban and Wood, the former President of End Citizens United, all of whom have already announced their campaigns.\n\nPolling on the Senate race remains limited despite its importance for the midterms.\n\nPolls have generally found that Mills enjoys stronger approval than Collins.\n\nA University of New Hampshire poll from over the summer found that 14 percent of Mainers view Collins favorably, while 57 percent view her unfavorably. An additional 26 percent were neutral. Meanwhile, 51 percent of Mainers view Mills favorably and 41 percent unfavorably. Only 7 percent were neutral on Mills, according to the survey, which surveyed 846 Mainers between June 19 and June 23. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nA Pan Atlantic Research poll yielded better results for Collins, finding that 49 percent of Mainers view her favorably and 45 percent view her unfavorable. It found that 52 percent of respondents viewed Mills favorably, while 44 percent viewed her unfavorably. It surveyed 840 likely voters from May 12 to May 26, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult found earlier this year that Mills had a net approval rating of +2—making her the least popular Democratic governor in the country—though Collins’ approval was -16. That poll took place from April to June of this year, and the sample sizes varied by state.\n\nPolls in 2020 were notably off in Maine. Although surveys showed former Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon with a lead, Collins ended up prevailing with just over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nMills, viewed as a more centrist Democrat, engaged in a high-profile debate with the White House over Trump’s efforts to deny states funding over transgender athletes, telling him “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, wrote on X Thursday: “Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins. It’s disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.”\n\nPollster Adam Carlson wrote on X in August: “Sometimes to take out a mo...","summary":"Mills is preparing to launch a Senate campaign against Collins as early as next week, the Associated Press reported.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/janet-mills-chances-of-beating-susan-collins-in-maine-according-to-polls-10862355","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1746055222.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 17:12:14","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.126},{"id":368105838,"title":"Patrick Soon-Shiong Moves Forward With Plans to Take LA Times Public","text":"Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong’s purchase of the Los Angeles Times in 2018 helped some staffers feel like the paper was “on the brink of a golden era.” \n\nSeven years later, after the billionaire ordered the paper to cancel its endorsement of Kamala Harris ahead of the 2024 election, pushed out most of its editorial and news staff and launched various side projects bearing the paper’s name, he plans to raise $500 million as he tries to take the paper’s parent company public.\n\nSoon-Shiong’s company, The Los Angeles Times Media Group, said on Thursday it was working to make shares available to the public after it raised funds through a round of private placement financing. Afterward, shares would be available on the New York Stock Exchange. The money would help the company focus on the paper’s journalism.\n\nSoon-Shiong first revealed in July that he planned to take the paper public.\n\nThe newly named company is comprised of Soon-Shiong’s NantGames, a gaming company; NantStudios, a film and television production company; LA Times Studios, a company named after the Times focused on podcasting and live events; and the storied paper.\n\n“With the launch of the LA Times Media Group, we bring these capabilities together as one integrated platform, where accountable journalism meets cutting-edge technology, and where our community is invited to join us as partners in shaping the future of storytelling,” Soon-Shiong said in a statement.\n\nThe private placement round would make shares available at a preferred rate — as little as $5,000 — to accredited investors with a 7% annual interest rate, and those shares could become a regular share for a 25% discount once they’re available to the public. \n\nSoon-Shiong told the Times in an interview that the combined company was “at a place of efficiency,” and that he would not consider offloading the paper individually. “We committed as a family to support and maintain the integrity of the whole newsroom together with activating this platform so we can engage with a broader global audience,” he said.\n\nSoon-Shiong’s management of the paper and hat-tips to the Trump administration have rankled its staff in recent years as it faces dwindling revenue and losses of tens of thousands of subscribers. It let go 20% of its staff last year through several rounds of layoffs, and on Thursday, 85% of its union authorized the ability to call a strike after prolonged negotiations over a new contract.\n\nHis own comments about the paper have also ruffled feathers. After initially saying last year he didn’t want the paper to endorse Harris in the 2024 election over fears that “it would just add to the division,” Soon-Shiong told conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly on Thursday that he made the decision because he “didn’t believe, frankly, that she would be competent as the President of the United States.”\n\n“That was a decision we made, and I think I’m very comfortable still with that decision,” he said.","summary":"The Los Angeles Times' parent company plans to raise up to $500 million to boost the paper’s journalism\n\n\nThe post Patrick Soon-Shiong Moves Forward With Plans to Take LA Times Public appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/patrick-soon-shiong-los-angeles-times-public/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Patrick-LA-Times-owner.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 17:12:00","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.161},{"id":368118502,"title":"Pam Bondi exposed?

Mills will announce challenge to Sen. Collins in key 2026 Senate contest, AP sources say","text":"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine’s two-term Democratic Gov. Janet Mills will run for the U.S. Senate seat held by veteran Republican Sen. Susan Collins next year, according to two people familiar with Mills’ plans on Friday, setting up a potential matchup between the parties’ best-known figures in a state where Democrats see a chance to gain a seat in their uphill quest for the majority.\n\nMills was the top choice of national Democrats to try to unseat Collins, who has held the seat since 1997, and was urged to run by party leaders including Sen. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader. Her entry in the race is another recruiting win for Democrats, who also have well known Democrats with statewide experience looking to pick up GOP-held seats in North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nDemocrats see Maine as an important target, considering it is in the only place on the 2026 Senate election map where Republicans are defending an incumbent in a state carried last year by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up a net of four seats to retake the majority, but doing so remains difficult, as most of the Senate seats on the ballot next year are in states President Donald Trump won easily.\n\nMills, 77, was elected governor in 2018 and reelected in 2022. Maine governors are barred from seeking third terms and, while Mills early in the year seemed to dismiss running for Senate, she had said in late summer she was “seriously considering” running for the office.\n\nThe former Maine attorney general sparred with Trump during a February White House meeting of governors and the president, telling him, “We’ll see you in court,” in her opposition to his call for denying states federal funding over transgender rights.\n\nIn April, Maine officials sued the Trump administration in an effort to stop the federal government from freezing federal funding to the state in light of its decision to defy a federal ban on allowing transgender students from participating in sports.\n\nMills stoked Democratic enthusiasm in April when she said of the lawsuit, “I’ve spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weaknesses.” A campaign against Collins would pit her against a senator who has built a reputation as a moderate, but was a key supporter of Trump’s Cabinet and judicial nominations.\n\nCollins has won all of her four reelection campaigns by double-digit percentages, except for in 2020.\n\nCollins defeated Democratic challenger Sara Gideon, the former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, in 2020 by fewer than eight percentage points in a race that Democrats felt would help them pick up a seat in the Senate. Collins won that race in a year Democrats made a net gain of three seats in the chamber. And she won in spite of a poor showing by Trump at the top of the ticket.\n\nLike Collins, Mills was born in rural Maine. She became Maine’s first female criminal prosecutor in the mid-1970s, and would later become the state’s first elected female district attorney as well as its first female attorney general and governor. She served as attorney general twice, from 2009 to 2011 and 2013 to 2019.\n\nA few other challengers have declared candidacies for the Democratic nomination, including oyster farmer Graham Platner, who was launched an aggressive social media campaign. Platner has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who posted on social media on Thursday that Platner is “a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins” and that it’s “disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Gov. Mills to run.”","summary":"Mills was the top choice of national Democrats to try to unseat Collins, who has held the seat since 1997.\n\n\nThe post Maine Gov. Mills will announce challenge to Sen.

Bush, came after prominent MAGA personalities expressed shock over his Washington Post piece endorsing Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. (The president, despite his persistent lobbying for the award, lost out to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.)\n\n“Not only does Donald Trump deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, but there has arguably never been an American president who deserved it more,” Thiessen wrote in his Thursday column, adding that Trump has “an unprecedented peacemaking accord.”\n\n“No way,” far-right host and Pizzagate conspiracist Jack Posobiec reacted on social media, sharing a screenshot of the column’s headline: “Yes, Trump deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.”\n\nMark Dubowitz, the leader of the neoconservative think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, responded to Posobiec’s tweet by suggesting that Thiessen was one of the few right-leaning writers at the paper. “Written by @marcthiessen who is a (welcome) outlier at the Washington Post,” Dubowitz posted. \n\n“Thanks Mark. But not such an outlier any more! We’re now a conservative opinion page,” Thiessen promptly replied to the think tank head.\n\nMeanwhile, the president made it clear that he appreciated Thiessen’s column, sharing a link on his Truth Social site alongside the caption: “Thank you Washington Post. Wow!!!”\n\nOver the past year, the Washington Post has come under fire from both staff and readers over its rightward shift and efforts to appease Trump as Bezos has been accused of cozying up to the president, prompting the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of subscriptions and dozens of high-profile editors and journalists to flee the paper.\n\nAfter sparking backlash last October for blocking the Post’s planned presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris, resulting in several editorial board members resigning over the mega-billionaire’s meddling, Bezos caused even more outrage in February with his new mandate for the paper’s opinion pages.\n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” he declared. “We’ll cover other topics too, of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nNotably, the night he announced his new directive for the opinion section, Bezos had dinner with Trump.\n\nBezos’ push for the section to focus intently on traditionally conservative and libertarian principles led to the resignation of opinion editor David Shipley, who would eventually be replaced by 33-year-old Adam O’Neal, a former correspondent for The Economist and editorial page writer for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSince turning to O’Neal, whose only management experience was a tumultuous one-year stint at the conservative outlet The Dispatch, the Post has seen a flood of veteran columnists and editors ditch the paper in recent months. Many of them took up beleaguered publisher Will Lewis’ offer of a buyout to those who “do not feel aligned” with the paper’s new editorial direction.\n\nIn recent weeks, O’Neal has appeared to be more overt with his efforts to reshape the opinion section and make it more conservative. \n\nLast month, longtime writer Karen Attiah – the paper’s founding Global Opinions editor who rose to prominence following the horrific murder of her columnist Jamal Khashoggi – said she was fired over “unacceptable” social media posts she made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder. Attiah also said she was the last full-time Black columnist left on the paper’s staff.\n\nO’Neal’s most recent hires for the section include columnists from The National Review, The Spectator and The Boston Globe, who all “fit comfortably within the traditional conservative mold,” according to Status News’ Oliver Darcy. “People who have spoken to O’Neal have said he has signaled that he very much wants to recruit those on the political right to The Post,” Darcy further reported.\n\nAt the same time, O’Neal let go of at least a half-dozen staffers and a number of high-profile contractors from the opinion section last week, including editor Benjy Sarlin, media critic Jack Shafer and respected journalist Marc Fisher – who had been with the Post for roughly four decades. \n\nMeanwhile, months into his tenure atop the opinion page, O’Neal finally granted his first public interview late last month. It was to Fox News.","summary":"Marc Thiessen declared on social media that he’s no longer an ‘outlier’ at the Washington Post, as the paper’s opinion section is wholly ‘conservative’ now","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/washington-post-conservative-opinion-marc-thiessen-b2843302.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/20/16/newFile-12.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 14:42:04","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.106},{"id":368033920,"title":"Washington Post columnist says the quiet part out loud after getting called out for Trump boost","text":"After his Washington Post article “Yes, Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize\" went viral Thursday night, columnist Marc Thiessen was bombarded with complaints and criticism.

On Monday, Weiss was formally named editor-in-chief of CBS News after her outlet, The Free Press, was acquired by Paramount for $150 million, according to multiple reports. She will be reporting directly to Paramount's new CEO, David Ellison. In a memo to CBS News employees, Weiss listed ten \"core journalistic values\" she wants practiced, including holding \"both American political parties to equal scrutiny.\" Ellison similarly expressed that he wanted to tamp down the \"partisan division\" in his own memo to Paramount staff. That message doesn’t appear to have resonated with the rank and file, at least not yet. According to show transcripts reviewed by Fox News Digital, CBS News has yet to provide any on-air coverage of the growing controversies plaguing Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in Virginia's attorney general race. BARI WEISS JOINS CBS NEWS AS EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, PARAMOUNT BUYS FREE PRESS FOR $150 MILLION Last week, text messages sent by Jones in 2022 to a fellow lawmaker surfaced showing him fantasizing about giving then-Republican House of Delegates Speaker Todd Gilbert \"two bullets to the head,\" even suggesting that if Gilbert witnessed the murder of his own children that it would encourage him to pivot on policy. Jones has since apologized. Other controversies have emerged, including allegations that Jones had said if more police were killed it would reduce the shootings of civilians, which he denied. And after a reckless driving conviction in 2022, Jones served 500 hours of \"community service\" to his own Political Action Committee. LIBERAL MEDIA DOWNPLAYS SCANDAL OF DEM VIRGINIA AG HOPEFUL JAY JONES' TEXTS FANTASIZING MURDER OF GOP LAWMAKER The political fallout remains unclear. Jones' troubles could impact Virginia's gubernatorial race as his Democratic ballot running mate Abigail Spanberger maintains a lead in the polls against her Republican rival, incumbent Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears. While Jones hasn't had any Democratic officials call on him to withdraw from the race, he was forced to cancel a fundraiser. Neither \"CBS Mornings,\" \"CBS Evening News\" nor its Sunday program \"Face The Nation\" mentioned Jones through Thursday, according to transcripts. The network did publish an article and referenced the story on its little-watched streaming platform. A CBS News staffer told Fox News Digital that Jones was mentioned in editorial discussions, but was stumped as to why the network's morning and evening newscasts avoided the subject. DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall says Weiss' directive may not work on \"activist journalists,\" pointing to the soft coverage of the Jay Jones scandal as an early example. \"Her task is not just about changing isolated news decisions,\" McCall told Fox News Digital. \"She will have to change the entrenched culture that led to CBS’ long-running tendency to lean left.\" What stories CBS News chooses to cover and not cover on its airwaves and how it frames the political news of the day have alienated large swaths of the country, particularly in the era of Donald Trump. BARI WEISS BEING NAMED TOP CBS NEWS EDITOR CAUSES LIBERAL MEDIA TO MELTDOWN Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl famously dismissed Hunter Biden’s scandalous laptop during a contentious exchange with Trump. \"This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify,\" Stahl scolded Trump. CBS News ultimately verified the laptop in 2022. Fast-forward to the 2024 election, \"60 Minutes\" was engulfed in a much bigger controversy, this time involving its handling of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump sued CBS News alleging \"election interference\" after the network was accused of swapping one of Harris' \"word salad\" responses ahead of a \"60 Minutes\" primetime election special after a preview clip that aired on \"Face The Nation\" went viral among her critics. A raw interview transcript that was later released revealed both sets of comments that aired came from different portions of the same answer. While CBS News denied wrongdoing, Paramount made a multimillion-dollar settlement in July hoping it would pave the way for its $8 billion merger with Skydance, which Trump's FCC approved days later. And as part of the settlement, CBS News updated its policies that would require programs to release unedited transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP That wasn't the only election controversy CBS was involved in. The network was panned by conservatives for how anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the vice-presidential debate between then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance and his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, the moderators repeatedly fact-checked Vance and even cut off his mic at one point. CBS DEBATE MODERATORS PUMMELED FOR ‘OBNOXIOUS’ FACT-CHECKING OF VANCE: ‘A TERRIBLE LOOK' Brennan, host of \"Face The Nation,\" has particularly irked conservatives for her combative exchanges with Republicans, including Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Her reputation has taken such a hit that she won this year's \"Liberal Hack Tournament,\" the annual viral NCAA-style contest run by the Ruthless podcast. CBS News faced internal strife when far-left staffers fumed over \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil for daring to challenge anti-Israel author Ta-Nehisi Coates in a tense interview last year. Things got so bad that CBS News leadership at the time scolded the Jewish anchor and forced him to meet with the network’s in-house Race and Culture Unit following complaints, saying his interview did not meet the company’s \"editorial standards\" (noteworthy as Weiss and Ellison are both staunch supporters of Israel). Just last month, CBS News anchor John Dickerson said that the motive behind the assassination of Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk remained \"elusive,\" despite reports about the alleged assassin's leftist ideology. CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN'S MOTIVES REMAIN 'ELUSIVE,' CBS NEWS ANCHOR CLAIMS Weiss' meteoric rise to the top of one of the storied legacy media institutions is leaving liberal journalists incensed. Weiss famously quit The New York Times in 2020, writing a scathing resignation letter in which she detailed bullying by colleagues in what she called an \"illiberal environment.\" In 2022, she launched The Free Press, which has largely been ostracized by the cultural left for its reporting that challenges DEI, gender ideology and media narratives against Israel in its war with Hamas. Staffers who spoke with Fox News Digital are open to \"fresh ideas\" Weiss may bring to CBS News, although she still has her detractors at the network, particularly after her first appearance on the network's editorial call Tuesday, where she made the rallying cry, \"Let's do the f---ing news.\" \"I feel like the people that wrote her off probably are further in their corner,\" one staffer told Fox News Digital. \"The people that are open to her, I think, are still open.\" Many of her liberal critics in the media claim Weiss is a \"conservative\" who will bend the network's knee to Trump, even though she has openly criticized him on her \"Honestly\" podcast. Some also believe her appointment by Ellison was part of an arrangement Paramount made with Trump to resolve his lawsuit. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS Status newsletter author Oliver Darcy, who helped lead the charge to oust CNN CEO Chris Licht when he attempted to reform the liberal cable network, has criticized Ellison’s move to put Weiss in charge. \"Ellison vowed not to politicize Paramount — yet his first big move at CBS News is a major bet on Bari Weiss, one of the most polarizing figures in media,\" Darcy began his newsletter Wednesday night. \"Weiss, the stridently pro-Israel, proudly anti-'woke' culture warrior, has built her brand on polarizing political commentary — supposedly the type of material Ellison signaled to reporters that he wishes to run away from.\" CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

We’re close to settling an eighth and I think we’ll end up settling the Russia situation, which is horrible... I think we’ll settle that so… I don’t think anybody in history has settled that many but perhaps they’ll find a reason not to give it to me.”\n\nAsle Toje, deputy leader of the Nobel committee, had already signaled that Trump might not get it by suggesting that his aggressive campaigning for the accolade might count against him.\n\n“These types of influence campaigns have a rather more negative effect than a positive one,” Toje said. “Because we talk about it on the committee. Some candidates push for it really hard, and we do not like it.”\n\nHad Trump been victorious, he would have been the fifth American president to receive the prize, following Theodore Roosevelt (1906), Woodrow Wilson (1919), Jimmy Carter (2002), and, most importantly for the current commander-in-chief, Barack Obama (2009).\n\nObama was given his prize in his first year in office for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” the committee said at the time.\n\nTrump is thought to have long envied Obama’s popularity, and many point to the former Illinois senator’s mocking him at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in April 2011 over his “birther” conspiracy theory, which wrongly alleged that the 44th president was not eligible to serve because he was not born in the U.S, as still sticking in the president’s craw. \n\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nWhile other political enemies have come and gone since the Trumps succeeded the Obamas in the White House in January 2017 – Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris – the Republican has continued to stew over his rival, not least over his Nobel Prize win.\n\nSpeaking to The New York Times this March, Trump’s estranged former national security adviser John Bolton claimed that the president “saw that Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize and felt if Obama got it for not doing anything, why should he not get it?” Trump has certainly griped to that effect in many of his speeches and rally addresses over the years.\n\nWhen Director of National Security Tulsi Gabbard announced a spurious investigation into Obama-era intelligence officials in July, Trump responded by posting an AI video of his predecessor being sent to prison, a wish-fulfilment fantasy in which Obama is imagined pacing a dank jail cell wearing an orange jumpsuit.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, in an op-ed for MSNBC, argued that the video amounted to “a projection of everything Trump fears and envies about his predecessor: Obama’s grace, intellect, global stature and, most of all, the fact that Obama’s very presence in the White House redefined what power could look like in America.”\n\nHe continued: “It’s clear that Obama has been living in Trump’s head rent-free for the last two decades. Some think he first ran for president because Obama made fun of him at the White House Correspondents Association dinner. He mistakenly called Biden by Obama’s name multiple times while campaigning, once even saying he beat Obama in 2016. He’s even claimed he is healthier than Obama.\n\n“Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize? Trump spends years obsessing about winning it himself. Obama passes a historic healthcare law?

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, comes across as a weary grandpa, glasses perched halfway down his nose as he reads his script in sleep-inducing monotone. Quick – who’s the minority leader of the House? You get bonus points if you can identify Hakeem Jeffries. Charismatic he is not.\n\nWhat’s to be done?\n\nDemocrats cannot afford to play possum and wait for Trump to implode, as onetime political guru James Carville urged in a New York Times opinion piece. That won’t be Trump’s fate – his boast that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters isn’t far off the mark.\n\nBarack Obama could go toe-to-toe with Trump. He’s the most popular living president – a YouGov poll, taken just before the last election, showed that over half of all Americans would most likely vote for him. Although the two-term president can’t run again, he’d garner the attention that Democrats badly need.\n\nBut the former president has had next to nothing to say about Trump’s initiatives. While he has scolded Democratic politicians for not speaking out, he has gone silent. He hasn’t appeared at any public event staged by opponents of the president. Instead, he’s producing movies and documentaries, playing golf (as of 2016, he was an “honest 13”) and building an $18m mansion in Hawaii.\n\nWhat’s the alternative?\n\nSeveral presidential hopefuls have already hit the rubber-chicken circuit, making coy noises about their intentions for 2028, but that’s not nearly good enough. These desperate times demand boldness. Here’s my proposition: a leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now.\n\nHear me out before you start laughing.\n\nFor starters, the reign of the ancien regime and its timid successors like Kamala Harris is finally over. That’s the message delivered by 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani, who trounced septuagenarian Andrew Cuomo, avatar of the past, in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary. Whoever runs for president should take a leaf from Mamdani’s playbook. No more tedious, repetitious TV ads. It is essential to reach voters where they are, knocking on doors, listening to what they say about what matters to them, then turning out a stream of TikTok and Instagram videos, delivering messages that resonate.\n\nGoodbye to laundry lists of forgettable nostrums, like the multipoint policy plans that Harris lugged around. My ideal candidate must have the skill to communicate ideas – bold ideas, not small-bore suggestions – in a non-wonky way. As former New York governor Mario Cuomo memorably put it: “You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.”\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine any Democrat winning over the Maga diehards, Republican voters who held their noses and voted for Trump could be swayed by someone who concentrated on meat-and-potato issues, pledging to build millions of units of affordable housing, deliver universal preschool and affordable healthcare, picking up the bill with a fair tax law. That was Mamdani’s message, and a considerable number of Trump backers voted for him after hearing his pitch.\n\nMy candidate should be prepared to take on some of the Democratic party’s sacred cows. Assailing Israel for the war crimes committed in Gaza comes to mind.\n\nThe toughest hurdle is raising enough money to be taken seriously, but it isn’t impossible. Billionaires including the Democratic mega-donor George Soros, Bill Gates, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman recently formed a group called Billionaires Against Billionaires to do battle with Trump’s coterie of billionaires. Imagine the impact if these mega-donors join forces with grassroots groups nationwide.\n\nThe Democratic Party has a deep bench, and there’s no shortage of politicians who could fill the bill. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, Arizona senator Ruben Gallego and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear are among those who come to mind. And while the first profile-in-courage candidate will have first-mover advantage, others may well enter the fray.\n\nLet’s be clear – there isn’t a candidate, no matter how artful, who has a prayer of dislodging Trump from his imperial perch. But the presidential hopeful who decides that now is the time to present themself as a genuine alternative will attract attention, and right now, attention is what matters most. Unless someone steps up – and improbable as this scenario is, I haven’t come up with a better alternative – the Democrats will be giving Trump a free pass for the next three and a half years. Think about what this human wrecking ball can achieve in that time.\n\n David Kirp is professor emeritus at the Goldman School of Public Policy, University of California-Berkeley","summary":"A leading Democrat, backed by substantial funding, should enter the 2028 presidential race right now\n\nThe Democratic politicians on the national scene, charged with leading the opposition, continue to bring a butterknife to the ongoing gunfight that is US politics under Donald Trump.

That ambition was made crystal clear across his two bids for the Oval Office in 1988 and 2008, before he finally got over the hump in 2020 after leveraging his claim as the dubious successor of the Obama years. His approval rating swooned shortly after that belated triumph, but judging by the policy ledger alone, it can be argued that Biden weaved together a moderately successful administration. He was able to usher several of his long-standing fixations across the finish line with acceptable consensus. Some of those achievements were broadly popular (the infrastructure bill); others were controversial but nonetheless hugely necessary (the long-overdue retreat out of Afghanistan). When the 2022 midterms rolled around, pundits predicted a harsh repudiation of the Biden coalition, due in large part to the gathering malaise that has yet to clear from the American consciousness. But that rebuke never materialized. Under Biden’s stewardship, career wingnuts like Kari Lake, Dr. Oz, and Herschel Walker were barred from Capitol Hill, thrust forever into make-work programs propped up by MAGA benefactors. (Walker is currently waiting to be approved for his position as ambassador to the Bahamas.)\n\nSure, President Biden did also cultivate a vast collection of familiarly shaped neoliberal failures across those four years, earning a simmering distaste from many of the people who helped put him into office. (Biden’s feigned helplessness on Gaza was especially flagrant, but, again, deference to Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel remains to this day a bipartisan moral stain.) What I am trying to say here is that if you are capable of ignoring all of the metaphysical baggage, Biden orchestrated a remarkably ordinary Democratic presidential administration. The man did the job in the precise way he always envisioned he might do it—which, more to the point, is the only thing anyone could have ever reasonably expected of him. He’s 82, and it’s basically clear that he got everything he’s always wanted.\n\nAnd that is why I find it so compelling, and a little bit poetic, that everyone has come to hate him for what that ascent hath wrought. The reign of Biden is now regarded, by a rare consensus within the Democratic Party, to have been a massive blunder. His legacy? A regrettable blip briefly interspersing the Trump order, starring the wrong man in the wrong moment. It is a status that makes the Biden presidency totally unique, in the worst possible way.\n\nIt is almost unnerving to consider just how quickly the worm turned for someone who was so accustomed to being liked. The No. 1 requirement for participating in Democratic Party politics remains the hatred and opposition of Donald Trump. But what comes in at No. 2? Right now, I’d argue, it is to distance oneself as far as possible from Joe Biden, and to admonish the former president at every turn for being stubborn, out of touch, unfathomably old, and cosmically incapable of meeting the rigors of the job.\n\nThe prime arbiter of this bloodletting is, of course, Kamala Harris, who waited a brisk nine months after the conclusion of her 2024 campaign to empty the notebook on her former superior. Harris’ memoir, 107 Days, aims to rehabilitate her reputation, and naturally, she concluded the easiest way to do so is by exposing a clueless, doddering Biden near the terminus of his term. The excerpt that received the most attention during the press cycle featured a paranoid president calling Harris minutes before her debate with Trump to accuse her of supposedly bad-mouthing him to a cabal of midlevel donors—an extremely unflattering anecdote that made Biden look something close to Bobby Moynihan’s drunk uncle. (In another gnarly reproach, Harris wrote about the “recklessness” of leaving the fate of the country up to “an individual’s ego.”)\n\nIt’s hard to think of many other vice presidents who have been granted the political latitude to go for the jugular, but Harris has plenty of cover in her upbraiding of Joe Biden. Everyone is getting in on the action. Pete Buttigieg, the administration’s former transportation secretary and a man Biden once compared to his dead son, has dropped all pretenses. He’s freely telling NBC hosts that his old boss shouldn’t have run for reelection, and that the country now faces the “decisions that come next”—cannily laying the rubble of the party at his feet. The same spirit can be found within Beto O’Rourke, who passed through the Pod Save America podcast studios with a message of ashen contrition shortly after the 2024 campaign wrapped up. (Democrats must admit that they “fucked up, and made a terrible mistake,” said O’Rourke, referring to anyone who endorsed Biden’s electoral murder-suicide.)\n\nThe list goes on. Some Democratic lawmakers extol vibes-based neuroscience. Sen. Chris Murphy asserted that there was “no doubt” the president’s cognition was in decline, as did Ro Khanna. (They’re both correct, but neither of them are doctors.) However, I think the most withering barbs came from Nancy Pelosi, who, in 2024, remarked to the New Yorker that Biden should set aside his bid not just because of his advanced age, but because, plain and simple, she didn’t have much faith in his electoral instincts.\n\n“I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,” she said, shortly after ushering the president out the back door. Ouch.\n\nIt must be reiterated how much this is a departure from tradition. A culture of decorum has protected innumerable other party bigwigs for decades, no matter their enveloping scandals or embarrassing electoral pratfalls. Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and John Kerry have all been redeemed in the baptism of big-tent clemency, and Biden, in comparison, never suffered the same humiliations of these other characters. He beat Trump, remember? Alas, the constituency is out for vengeance, and in these angry times, it has been unfathomably easy to let Biden’s head roll.\n\nAnd what, exactly, has all of this pain earned us? The political designs that Biden structured his whole presidency around have gone kaput. His obsession with strengthening NATO, highlighted during his final campaign, where he frequently touted Finland’s admission into the alliance to bemused press pools, was desecrated almost immediately after Trump’s reelection. The multi-polar world that Democrats like Biden have always feared—where America has shed its international primacy—is at hand, and who knows if the previous status quo will be reasserted. Meanwhile, Biden’s handling of the Gaza crisis will surely be remembered as singularly representative of a fecklessness that left the party alienated from its ostensibly youngest and most passionate voters. It required a humbling defeat for Democratic officials to begin toying, gingerly, with a rational stance toward Israel. Biden is the mascot for this deprecated doctrine.\n\nSome of his social programs might be recalled more fondly in the future. His college debt forgiveness plan, or flirtations with a minimum wage hike—both resulting in a wild-eyed freakout from conservatives and moderates alike—gestured toward a badly needed redefinition of Democratic politics. But of course, those ventures make it even more ironic that Biden was tapped for the nomination in large part to stall the momentum of Bernie Sanders. Yes, Joe Biden did beat both an aspiring fascist (first-term Trump) and a socialist. And now that he’s out of the picture, with his shortcomings burning in public recollection, those two ideologies are more invigorated than ever.\n\nYou have to wonder how he is processing all of this. Biden’s political career was thoroughly shaped by the chip on his shoulder—this insatiable feeling that he was continually being underestimated by a wealthier and more genteel Washington elite, always gossiping behind his back. That he scaled the mountain and made himself president only for his administration to become saddled with grumblings, caveats, and second-guesses—the kind of points-scoring, publicly aired disrespect that none of his contemporaries faced—must be the ultimate confirmation of his greatest fears. The things everyone believed about Joe Biden, namely that he wasn’t quite presidential material, turned out to be vividly true. And you know what? That does leave me with a touch of sympathy for the man.\n\nWith that said, it is also hard to argue that Biden didn’t bring all of this contempt on himself, and that is what truly underscores the tragicomic irony of this juncture in the American storybook. Think of the off-ramps passed by, or the narrative flourishes declined. How different would a Biden presidency feel if one of its fundamental projects had been the cultivation of Kamala Harris into an heir apparent? What would we be saying about him if he had presided over those successful 2022 midterms before graciously bowing out of the 2024 cycle? Yes, maybe the Democrats would have still lost, and many of the questions we’re asking about the party’s policy diet would remain as salient as they are now.\n\nBut Biden himself, unfailingly legacy-conscious as he is, would be shrouded in a much different light. Here was an old man standing athwart the tide of fascism, rather than one propping open the door. Ultimately, to make those choices, Biden needed to be a much different person—someone less headstrong, and less paranoid about the ways the political world has tilted against him. Someone who, perhaps, did not covet the presidency as much as he did. But Biden was always going to do things his way, and he’ll be paying for that for the rest of his life.","summary":"The forces that brought him to the brink of contentment were always going to drive him deep into despair.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/10/joe-biden-kamala-harris-book-trump-legacy.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/275591d5-041a-4369-8c13-82803ed0a8df.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 09:45:00","author":"Luke Winkie","authors":["Luke Winkie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":367966060,"title":"High-ranking Democrats admit to knowingly abandoning women","text":"Nothing woke America up to the realities of gender ideology quicker than the photo of Riley Gaines standing next to her National Championship opponent, a 6’1\" male towering over her with his broad shoulders and smoldering grin. You felt it in your bones – this isn’t right. The moment sparked a nationwide campaign to try and convince everyday Americans that this feeling was not just instinct; it was internalized bigotry and evidence that there was noble, progressive work still to do. Only one problem. It was all a lie. And recent admissions show that not even the top Democratic leaders believed what they were selling. Just five years ago, I was a freshman in college, testifying in my dorm room about a bill that stated men cannot compete on women’s sports teams. \"Politics are crazy,\" I thought, \"Why do I even need to testify on something so obvious?\" I quickly learned of my own naivety when the bill did not pass in my very conservative state. \"This isn’t a real issue,\" they insisted while I, a female athlete who had previously competed against a man, sat in front of them. There was clearly much more to this problem than I realized. USA VOLLEYBALL'S ANTI-WOMAN AGENDA LIVES ON, DESPITE TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER When the spotlight on the issue grew, it was somehow immediately deemed partisan. The issue was linked to the Democrats’ pro-LGBTQIA+ position, which they had insisted was the civil rights issue of our time, and now it was squarely at odds with something plainly unjust. But they were in too deep. At every turn, those who tried to find solutions to the problem of men in women’s sports, including traditionally far-left organizations like Women’s Liberation Front, found themselves up against the powerful political operatives of the Democratic Party. Though the ties between LGB and T were fading, the radical left insisted that to be pro-gay or pro-woman, you had to also stand for men in women’s sports. Democrats obliged. In some ways, this makes sense. If the Democrats acknowledge that sex exists in sports, then what does this mean to other parts of their agenda that rely on sex-denying ideology? The crusade to abolish sex is one that spans decades, and they are not about to budge now. So, they doubled down, even redefining \"sex\" as \"gender identity\" wherever they could, including in landmark pro-woman legislation like Title IX, and they continued to label anything contrary as \"extreme\" through the 2024 election. DEFINING FAIR PLAY: WHY SWING-STATE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF STEP ON PROTECTING WOMEN’S SPORTS Concerned Women for America LAC exit polling suggests this issue played an outsized role in the election, and the Democrats paid the price with a resounding loss in both chambers of the federal government and the White House. Voters did not buy the lie that their concerns were merely internalized bigotry. And at least some Democrats are finally ready to face the music and speak more openly about it. The Democrats' highest-ranking figure has finally addressed one of the biggest political flops of modern history, and while her confession is unsurprising, it should shake the party to its core. In her recently released book about her presidential candidacy, former Vice President Kamala Harris admits that she, too, shares concerns: \"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports.\" But she added, \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\" And there it is. Tension unmasked. When reality collides with allegiance, the Democrats choose allegiance. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The highest leaders of the party know they were ignoring the real, reasonable and consequential concerns of millions of women. Abandoning women and their safety was a calculation worth making in their eyes. Harris is not alone. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has publicly admitted that this is \"an issue of fairness – it’s deeply unfair.\" Yet, his state is one of the worst offenders of women’s rights in this area. On this Worldwide X/X Day (Real Women’s Day), the good news is that some party members are choosing reality and abandoning ship. Just a few weeks ago, 10 House Democrats voted, for the first time, for a National Defense Authorization Act amendment that would keep men from competing on women’s athletic teams at service academies. Just a few months ago, most of these same members refused to vote for a bill with similar protections.

Truth is our only sure foundation. Policy must be based on reality. We know wrong when we see it.

Describe that, because you said there’s a... We’ve talked mostly about pollingism, which I would argue is... Everyone here knows what pollingism is on some level, because when you watch Hakeem Jeffries say...The police sent to Chicago is a distraction from my health care talking points. That’s polingism. I think we all know what that is. We know where it’s coming from. We’ve lived through experiences. Magnetism, I struggled with a little bit more. I wasn’t as familiar with what you were getting at. So talk to the audience about that a little bit.\n\nShenker-Osorio: Yeah. So magnetism is, unfortunately, what MAGA has run on. And what’s ironic is that in all of these sort of Democrats need to be more moderated, Democrats need to sort of eschew the base and even like crap upon the base. In all of that, what folks are never asked is,how come Republicans do the exact opposite and they win with it? Like that’s asked, right? Why is it that that’s enough?I think the claim is that they have the geographic advantage based on the election. I think that’s usually the it’s usually you get this. Yeah.So magnetism is the idea that if you want people to come to your cause, you need to be attractive. So number one, that requires having a cause. That requires actually having an agenda that you desire to enact. Second of all, it requires understanding that the people who have previously voted for you, which the polling is, you know,issue as your base because they think only in demographic categories. When I say the people who have voted for you, I literally mean those human beings, not their demographic features. I mean those people. And yes, they have demographic features because people have demographic features. But I actually mean those human beings.First of all, you actually need those people to be carrying your tune. If you think back to the first six weeks of the Kamala Harris campaign, you know, the coconut tree and the meme and the cake hive and if you want people to come to your party,throw a better party and everyone and voter registrations going through the roof suddenly and people being excited and people wanting to affiliate and so on. So that’s the first premise is have a clause.\n\nBacon: I think it’s an important thing to say, the demoted. I remember the first few weeks of the Harris campaign had people doing these black women or white men for Harris. These phone calls, they’d be on a boring Zoom call. People were going to events. And then...And she was getting criticized, though, for parts of the party for not being centrist enough. And then she started moving. I want the most lethal military in the world. And then we get Ezra Klein and Jonathan Shane and someone saying she’s running the greatest campaign of all time. Look how brilliant is her numbers started stalling the moment she started doing the thing that they asked for. This is enough. Sorry.\n\nShenker-Osorio: Yeah, yeah. So the Freedom ad, which, if you ask people, is the only ad that they remember from the Harris campaign. And I’m very biased because I ran an entire Protect Our Freedoms campaign in 2022 and Our Freedoms, Our Families, Our Futures in 2024, so biased. But when there was excitement, that was magnetism. So you have a cause. And on the economic side, let’s remember, in those first six weeks, she was running on ending price gouging, which Donald Trump called communism and price controls.In the let’s give them something to talk about theory of messaging, which I espouse, when your opposition is attacking you because you’re going to implement price controls, that is quite different than attacking you on you’re going to turn the border into a sieve and “illegals” — pardon my use of the opposition language — are going to come and, like, destroy all of life as we know it. So she was making, like Mamdani, super concrete economic promises. She talked about raising the minimum wage. She talked about, you know, slashing childhood poverty. She talked about an extensive hike to the capital gains tax.\n\nSo it wasn’t just that she was, like, being coconut meme, freedom, happy, throw a better party. She also had super concrete economic policies. Fast forward six weeks, the folks come in, tell, you know, the grownups come into the room, say, stop having your nice time. Yeah. And we veer from those concrete promises, which are important, to an opportunity economy, a walk back of the capital gains tax, no more talk about price gouging, and these sort of vague things plus Liz Cheney. \n\nSo magnetism is also an understanding that, like any magnet, you have a polarity. And what that means is, yes, you attract people to your cause, but you also repel. So let me give a super concrete example. You repel the portion of people that cannot, shall not, will not ever vote for you. Like, you will never have those people. You will, you know, like... Me and Trump, like there is nothing he could ever do. He could say he could produce, he could provide. I’m never going to vote for him. Right. And he relishes in repelling people like me. And I’m speaking in the singular because I don’t want to speak for anybody else. \n\nYou understand that the job of politics is actually to agenda set, both because you want to make people’s lives better with public policy and also discursively you want to agenda set because you want people to be talking about your thing, including coming at you for daring to take on price gouging. Like, imagine if that’s what she were being attacked for rather than, you know, the border or trans kids. That’s an argument that you want to be having. So that’s what the right does over and over again. They figure out this is what we need people talking about.So in... You know, back in the day, not so long ago, it was critical race theory. Do you think there’s ever been a survey in history in which the majority of American voters were asked, what is your top issue, your most pressing issue? Critical race theory. Do you think there’s ever been a survey where the majority was like, my most pressing issue is trans girls playing volleyball or my most pressing issue is DEI? That’s never happened. Their most pressing issue is money. It’s always going to be money. So the right sees those issue surveys and they’re like, great. Nobody cares about this. Nobody knows what this is. We can use it as a vessel to populate it with our own disgusting meaning and then make an astroturf group like Moms for Liberty to be our choir and make believe this is a big issue. Or with DEI, we call university presidents into Congress. And have at them. So they don’t just issue talking points, right? They don’t just do a social media post. They do a 360-degree surround-sound strategy around issues that are not popular. \n\nBacon: So you’re saying in New York, I don’t think, I’m going to close here. New York, I hadn’t thought of it this way, but saying I’m for free buses, I’m for free childcare, and so on, and getting people to say, no, in fact, it’s not, because I thought of him as being, he’s charismatic, he smiles a lot, he has good ideas, people like him, but you’re saying he is magnetic, Mamdani. I mean, he is magnetic to people who agree with him, but he’s also getting the right, he’s also drawing the right opposition in a certain way.\n\nShenker-Osorio: He is drawing the right opposition he’s forcing i don’t know if folks have seen that brilliant brilliant uh dramatic reading of the piece from the new york times about the people in the hamptons who are you know crying themselves into their whatever and I mean that is a perfect encapsulation of magnetism like he is reveling in repelling the billionaire class that’s very upset about him. He’s not making believe. Don’t worry. A rising tide lifts all boats. And like, it’s fine. Everyone’s going to do better. I’m not going to. He’s like, no. I’m not sure if I’m allowed to swear here. This is the longest I’ve gone without swearing. No, jerk face. That’s my PG. No, jerk face. Like, I’m going to tax you. I’m not going to pretend I’m not going to. And when that pisses you off, I’m not going to be concerned about that. I’m going to call it magically delicious. \n\nBacon: I think part of the issue is here, I guess people probably listening to this call and myself even, the paragon of our politics is a man who sort of famously said there are no red states or blue states, which he probably knew was inaccurate at the time and has become really much so I don’t think Obama, I don’t think most of the time was trying to get everyone to like him and antagonize no one. So I’m struck by this. You need magnetism means not just being appealing, but also picking the right enemy, so to speak, or picking the right.And I think it’s an interesting insight that I’ve got to think some more about.\n\nShenker-Osorio: Yeah I mean Obama because I’m going to provide you some information you didn’t know Perry because America has a slight problem with black men because there’s a little bit of racism in our country which i’m happy to i’m glad to explain to you. Because you don’t know never heard of it... yeah boy i hope people can hear sarcasm. He was magnetic in the attractive, repulsive by his very being.Okay, that’s fair.Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I hope it’s clear. That’s not a him thing.I agree, yes.My younger son says to me, that’s an ish you, not an ish me. So that was an ish you for America, not an ish me. That’s just the reality of who he was, who he is, of course. And so... But, and I talk about this in the piece, one of his most famous ads,which actually was only released on the web, they never spent any TV money on it at all, was a group of celebrities singing from the concession speech that he gave when he lost in his first primary or second, I don’t know, I think it was Iowa, was him saying, yes, we can, and speaking about enslavement.\n\nBacon: I mean, I’ll go back and look at that.Okay.Yeah. Back and look at it. \n\nShenker-Osorio: That is an example of magnetism.\n\nBacon: All right. Well, let’s, I think this has been a good, we’re going to come back and come back and talk to you again to get into this more. We can talk about this for two hours, but I’m going to stop here. Anything else with the piece or anything else about what you really about polling is a magnetism.You want to tell the audience that I didn’t ask about.\n\nShenker-Osorio: The siren song of authoritarians everywhere, both in contemporary time and in history, is to foment a counter-revolution against a revolution that never occurred. It is to say, would you like to know why you’re struggling? Would you like to know why you’re having a hard time? Would you like to know why you feel out of place? Would you like to know why you have more month than check and the world is making no sense to you? It’s because of those people. And those people could be welfare queens back in the day who are not working, who are living high off the hog in the system. Those people could be, forgive the terminology, illegals. Those people in other times and places are Roma in Hungary, or they’re Syrian refugees there as well, or they’re Southern Europeans in the case of Brexit, or they’re Muslims in the case of India with Modi. But this is what authoritarians do, right? There’s no quicker route to an us than construction of a them.\n\nBacon: Education is too woke. You know, yeah, yeah. All the things that they say.\n\nShenker-Osorio: Right. You’re saying that your opposition is correct. Yes. In some way, right? And you are feeding their origin story, their lie, and you are failing to give a correct origin story. But the only way that the correct origin story can work is if you actually mean it — if you actually mean that you are going to govern with, for, and by working people.\n\nAnd that means that you can’t talk about, you know, the rules are rigged and we have to actually make things right for you and vote for, you know, crypto corruption. You can’t do that. And you can’t, you know, not full-throatedly support and endorse and force a hike of the minimum wage. You know, you have to full-throatedly support unions.\n\nWhen FDR said about the billionaires — you want to talk about magnetism — “I welcome their hatred. I welcome their ire,” right? Because he knew there are sides, and the sides are the working people of America across races, places, genders, whatever, and the owning class that is taking the wealth our work creates.\n\nAnd when you try to replace that and have no villains because you just want neoliberalism and a rising tide lifts all boats and we’re all going to do better and we don’t need to actually have and support unions and raise wages and all the rest of it, then you render people susceptible to this siren song of the right. Neoliberalism is the handmaiden to authoritarianism everywhere. That’s what I would say.\n\nBacon: And that’s a great note to end on, Anat. Thanks for joining us. Thanks to the audience who tuned in to watch. And we’ll be back next week. Thank you.

Then, Harris came out to a sold-out crowd at Warner Theater. The two discussed a range of topics, including the government shutdown, her presidential campaign, and the future of the Democratic party. \n\n“A conversation with Kamala Harris”\n\nThe event kicked off forcefully: Harris opened the discussion with a profanity-laced remark about the Trump administration, setting an intense tone for the evening. \n\nSwisher started by recalling a conversation she had with Harris right before taking the stage, about Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warning that boys who were circumcised were twice as likely to be diagnosed with autism later.\n\nHarris said her mother was a scientist and that she can’t laugh about the Trump administration’s actions regarding science. \n\nThen she said, “It’s f***ed up,” and the crowd erupted in cheers. \n\n“What they are doing to push misinformation and lies at the highest level of government, it’s criminal, and people will die because of what they’re doing. I can’t laugh about that. I’m sorry,” Harris said. \n\nSwisher questioned the former vice president on excerpts from her book and current events, including the recent indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James. \n\nWhen asked if she worries about being indicted or targeted by the Trump administration, Harris said, “Sure, of course.” \n\nHarris told the audience she doesn’t “know that it won’t get worse before it gets better.” \n\n“Every day, something is coming out of this White House. And I said that yesterday in Atlanta, and then [James’s indictment] today – I’m serious. I said it yesterday. I said it the day before, everyday I have been on this book tour, and every single day something happens.” \n\nOn Trump and the government shutdown\n\n“Whatever he’s doing is for his own well-being and to take care of himself. Let’s be clear about that. Let’s be clear about what he is doing to monetize this presidency for himself,” Harris said about Trump. “But this con man happens to be President of the United States, making decisions that are, in such a tremendous way, injuring the people of our nation.”\n\nDuring the conversation, Harris kept referencing a line she wrote in the book about all the “guardrails” failing to protect democracy against the Trump administration’s actions. She also discussed Trump v. The United States, which decided former presidents have criminal immunity for official actions taken while in office, but not for private or unofficial acts. \n\nSwisher asked Harris what people can do if there are no guardrail protections, and Harris responded: Democrats need to win the midterms. \n\n“We can reinvest in the three co-equal branches of government and hope that where the courts fail, if it goes to the highest court, that we, at least at another branch, have a Congress,” she said. \n\n“But we can also see that we’ve had complicit legislators who are Republicans and know what is wrong about this and are not stepping up,” Harris added. \n\nSwisher asked Harris what her former colleagues in the Senate are telling her, and she said there are Republicans who believe they are doing the wrong thing but aren’t “stepping up.” \n\n“I do believe there are a lot of people who know what’s wrong with this, don’t agree with it, even though they vote a certain way, but they are living in fear of retribution and more invested in their own political survival than speaking up and taking the hits that might come,” Harris said. \n\nHarris praised her former Democratic colleagues in the Senate for standing firm during the government shutdown, after Congress failed to pass more funding earlier this month. \n\n“I look right now at what my former colleagues in the Senate are doing, and I praise them for having the ability to say that we are not going to compromise affordable health care for the American [people],” Harris said. “I know there are plenty of Republicans who know this is wrong, but they’re not stepping up.”\n\nRegarding how Democrats can combat the administration, Harris said the party needs to “chew gum and walk at the same time” by criticizing the administration and addressing the immediate problems for Americans, including the cost of goods. \n\n“We have to continue to highlight the corruption and the – literally – the violation of rule of law and all of the essence and spirit behind rule of law and Constitution of the United States – free speech, free association, just freedom period,” she said. \n\n“We also have to emphasize what our plan is immediately for bringing down the cost of everyday life, and all of those things have to happen at the same time.”\n\nOn the political future, including her own\n\nHalfway through, Swisher revealed that she had a surprise “guest”: It was a prerecorded video of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking Harris about debating Trump. \n\n“[Trump is] no doubt he’s unhinged, and I and Secretary Clinton did the work in her debates of demonstrating that, as I attempted to do in my debate with him, we have in this president the most, one of the most callous, corrupt and incompetent individual,” Harris said.\n\nHarris also revealed that part of her “dilemma” is that she doesn’t have a solution on how to combat this administration. \n\n“I don’t have the solution right now to how it stops before the end of his term, but I know that we have to fight,” Harris said. “We have to fight. We cannot get used to this. We cannot be overwhelmed. We cannot be silenced.” \n\nDuring the conversations about the future and the stars of the Democratic Party, Harris gave a shout-out to Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott. The audience erupted in applause and the theater put a spotlight on Scott, who waved to the crowd. \n\nHarris also highlighted Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), and Gov.

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears came out swinging against what she called former Rep. Abigail Spanberger’s dodges on calls for fellow Democrat Jay Jones to drop out of the attorney general contest after texts envisioning the murder of a Republican leader came to light. Throughout the debate, Spanberger mostly declined to make eye contact with Earle-Sears and ignored her when she was interrupted. Earle-Sears repeatedly addressed Spanberger directly during both women’s answers but did not receive any direct responses in return. SPANBERGER DEFENDS ABORTION AD CRITICIZING SEARS AFTER BERNIE WARNS AGAINST HIGHLIGHTING ISSUE Early on, Earle-Sears interrupted Spanberger, asking her to give a direct answer. The Democrat told the moderators she was \"aware of these messages\" and that they were \"absolutely abhorrent.\" \"I denounced them when I learned of them and I will denounce them every chance I get,\" Spanberger said, as Earle-Sears interjected once more to attempt to press for a straight answer. \"I didn’t hear an answer on [the Jones] question,\" co-moderator Deanna Albrittin told Spanberger. Since Earle-Sears had already called for Jones to drop out, the moderators asked her instead about President Donald Trump’s stated \"hate\" for political opponents after the murder of Charlie Kirk. Earle-Sears later turned to Spanberger and admonished her for refusing to give a yes-or-no answer on Jones, asking whether it would take Jones \"pulling the trigger\" to actually condemn what he had said about then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah. WINSOME EARLE-SEARS RELEASES ‘TWO BULLETS’ AD SCATHING OPPONENT FOR FAILING TO DEMAND JAY JONES’ OUSTER The Republican was later asked whether she needs Trump’s endorsement, as he has explicitly endorsed lieutenant governor candidate John Reid but offered more muted comments for Earle-Sears during the span of the race. Earle-Sears also criticized Spanberger for purportedly waiting several days before condemning a left-wing protester’s racist sign at an Arlington anti-transgender-sports demonstration headlined by the Republican candidate. The sign said that Earle-Sears should not be able to share water fountains (as a Black woman) if transgender students cannot share bathrooms. In the latter regard, moderator Tom Schaad asked Spanberger whether transgender girls born male should be able to use female bathrooms and be on co-ed sports teams. \"Nothing is more important to me than their safety and their experience in schools,\" Spanberger said, before offering a lengthier answer that also cited her experience as a former federal agent investigating crimes against children. TOP GOP GROUP DROPS BIG MONEY INTO VIRGINIA SHOWDOWN AFTER DEM AG NOMINEE'S VIOLENT TEXTS GO VIRAL \"That work, in part, has earned me the endorsement of the Police Benevolent Association,\" she said. Schaad reiterated the question, saying there had been no direct answer, and later attempted to ask whether Spanberger would rescind an executive order by Gov. Glenn Youngkin laying out a bathroom policy along biological lines. \"My opponent will not answer the question because she voted for men nude in girls' locker rooms,\" Earle-Sears later said. Later, both candidates were asked whether they would continue or undo any specific policies from Youngkin – whom the moderators reported enjoys high approval ratings as he closes out his last three months of his term. Earle-Sears said she would not disclose private conversations with Youngkin but that she would not undo their progress. ‘CONSUMED WITH HATE’: WINSOME SEARS, JASON MIYARES UNLOAD ON DEMOCRAT JAY JONES OVER VIOLENT TEXTS Spanberger said she would continue Youngkin’s efforts to grow advanced nuclear power in the commonwealth. After the event, Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, Jr., D-Portsmouth, spoke to reporters as a surrogate for Spanberger. Scott said there is a \"double standard\" in pressuring Spanberger to call for Jones to drop out, claiming Earle-Sears has not denounced violent rhetoric from Trump. The speaker, who represents the area just south of the debate site, claimed Earle-Sears did not as vociferously condemn Trump for a remark he made in 2024 when discussing neoconservatism, and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s aisle-crossing endorsement of Kamala Harris. \"Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. OK? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,\" Trump said as a rebuttal to people in the political establishment who are war \"hawks\" or support proverbial forever-wars. WINSOME EARLE-SEARS RELEASES AD LINKING ABIGAIL SPANBERGER TO JAY JONES AFTER VIOLENT TEXTS RESURFACE The Trump campaign noted at the time that the president did not call for Cheney to be executed and that the press covered the remark \"disgracefully,\" while fact-checker PolitiFact deemed the comment illustrative of a \"combat zone\" situation rather than a call for murder. Fox News Digital reached out to the Earle-Sears campaign for comment on the debate, including the way the candidates comported themselves on stage. \"If you’re wondering who’s capable of leading Virginia, this was the debate to watch,\" Earle-Sears spokesperson Peyton Vogel told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Abigail Spanberger couldn’t even look Lt. Gov. Earle-Sears in the eye and confirmed she will not stand up to Jay Jones’ threat-laced, murderous rhetoric.\" \"If she can’t lead her own ticket, she can’t lead the Commonwealth,\" Vogel said.","summary":"Lt.

Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.\n\nThe timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.\n\nThe House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.\n\nTrump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.\n\nThe road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.\n\nThe Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.\n\nTrump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.\n\nA decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.\n\nAdministration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”\n\nRepublican Sen.

Harris' comments come as part of her effort to reframe the narrative surrounding the 2024 election during her nationwide tour for her new campaign memoir, \"107 Days.\" According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC), Harris set the tone for her 90-minute conversation from the moment she stepped on stage, stating, \"He does not have a mandate.\" KAMALA HARRIS TAKES APPARENT SHOT AT TRUMP ADMIN IN BIZARRE OUTBURST: 'THESE MOTHER----- ARE CRAZY' The former vice president also argued that Trump's supporters have been deceived by the president following his election win, saying he has failed to fulfill the promises he ran on. \"I do believe that there are a significant number of people that voted for Donald Trump because they believed him when he said he was going to bring down prices,\" she said. \"And he lied. Today, the cost of groceries is higher, unemployment is higher, inflation is higher. He made them a promise he has not kept.\" Harris has been on a public event blitz since the release of \"107 Days\" in September, kicking off her book tour in New York City before making stops nationwide to promote the new political memoir that walks readers from former President Joe Biden's attempted 2024 run through her picking up the mantle in an effort to defeat President Donald Trump at the ballot box.

Not only will redistricting play a role, but there’s also the gubernatorial race, with Vivek Ramaswamy likely replacing term-limited Gov. Mike DeWine, a fellow Republican. As has been the case for the past few election cycles, Ohio is a state to watch, and 2026 is no exception.\n\nOhio came up during Wednesday’s episode of “The Tony Kinnett Cast.” Former Rep. David McIntosh, the co-founder of The Club for Growth came on to discuss “a midterm blitz” and redistricting. In Ohio, there’s a predicted pick-up of at least two seats. \n\nFrom Redistricting… \n\nMcIntosh emphasized a key point, one Vice President JD Vance made about redistricting. “It’s key that we win these redistricting battles in the state level. The House is very closely divided,” McIntosh reminded.\n\n“The goal here is to add anywhere from five to 10 Republican seats by matching what the Democrat have done for the past decade, and then conservatives and Republicans will be represented in Congress,” he added.\n\nAs Kinnett put it, Ohio is “turning out to be way more important for ’26 than anyone thought.”\n\nNot only is redistricting mandated in Ohio, but some of the closest House races could be there. The two likely pickups are the seats held by Democrat Reps. Marcy Kaptur of the 9th Congressional District and Emilia Sykes of the 13th Congressional District. Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of the 1st Congressional District could be a third. All have been targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\nMcIntosh called to mind that there are really only 25-30 “battleground seats,” a category Kaptur and Sykes could certainly fall into. Those 25-30 races further benefit Republicans as “there are more Democrats sitting in a Trump district than Republicans representing a Kamala Harris district,” McIntosh explained. \n\nPresident Donald Trump won the 9th Congressional District and came close in the 13th Congressional District.\n\nMcIntosh later spoke about the search for the ideal candidates, emphasizing the importance of those who are “committed to free markets, limited government, lower taxes, [and] who’s going to support President Trump on that economic agenda,” as well as campaign strategy. McIntosh also referenced the endorsement of Trump, which “is going to tell voters in Ohio, ‘We need you back again, you can’t just vote every four years. This is almost like a referendum on President Trump, get out and vote.'”\n\nAs Kinnett reminded, “Ohio has gone more red in the presidential [races] over the last couple of elections.” Trump won the Buckeye State in 2016, 2020, and 2024, after former President Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012.\n\nSpeaking further about the “intensity” of such congressional races, Kinnett predicted that “this could be a big turning point, a big swivel point for the state of Ohio, for the next 10-20 years,” with McIntosh concurring.\n\nMcIntosh and Kinnett brought up Ramaswamy with what McIntosh is “seeing on the ground” in Ohio. Ramaswamy “is exciting Republicans and independents all over the state with his vision for the state,” McIntosh pointed out.\n\nThe U.S. Senate race also came up. Republican Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed to fill Vance’s seat is likely to face former Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown, who lost last year to now Sen. Bernie Moreno.\n\n“He’s sounded like one of them but he went back to Washington and just voted with these far-left crazies,” McIntosh said with regards to how Brown is “still trying.” Husted drew a contrast between himself and Brown when speaking to The Daily Signal, framing it as a “D.C. guy versus Ohio guy” race.\n\nIn between his appearances throughout Ohio, Ramaswamy took part in the Turning Point USA tour, speaking at Montana State University on Tuesday. While there, he spoke about the assassination of TPUSA’s Charlie Kirk.\n\nDuring his 20-minute speech, Ramaswamy showed himself to be a charismatic figure, one who likely represents the future of Ohio and the conservative movement. He further demonstrated he is not only unifying the Ohio Republican Party, but that he is a young politician to be on the lookout for. \n\nThe theme of his speech was “a fork in the road for the future of the conservative movement” as well as the importance of American “identity.”\n\nTowards the end of his speech, Ramaswamy referenced his run for governor and the restoration of the American dream.\n\n“That is up to us to deliver to you,” Ramaswamy told the crowd. “And if we fail now, we’ve got nobody left to blame but ourselves. I say that as somebody who is running for governor of my own home state of Ohio, next year. That is the standard I want you to hold me to. We expect that,” he said. “That’s on us. But in the meantime, don’t be cynical about our country, because it’s still the last best hope that we have on planet Earth.”\n\nThe State of the Race(s)\n\nKaptur and Sykes are in “Toss-Up” races, while Landsman’s is regarded as “Lean Democratic” or “Likely Democratic.”\n\nDays after Brown announced in August, an Emerson College poll showed Husted leading Brown. Ramaswamy led Democrat Amy Acton, who has declared, as well as former Rep. Tim Ryan, who has not declared, though there’s chatter he’ll run. Both races “Lean Republican.”\n\nTime will tell, not only when it comes to the effect the redistricting process will have, but how Trump’s second term and the state of affairs in Ohio, the country, and around the world will affect these races.","summary":"The 2026 elections are 13 months away, and they&#8217;ll especially matter in Ohio.

Engelbert addressed the alleged comments about the other players, claiming there have been a lot of \"inaccuracies\" reported in the media, but she did not explicitly deny making those comments as she did with the alleged Clark comments. \"There's a lot of innacuracy out there through social media and all this reporting,\" Engelbert said. \"A lot of reporting, a lot of innacuracy about what I say, what I didn't say.\" Engelbert later said, \"I'm disheartened.

Paramount's David Ellison addresses his father's involvement","text":"Billionaire Larry Ellison ponied up the money for his family to acquire the controlling stake in Paramount two months ago, and the tech titan would need to write another huge check should Paramount buy Warner Bros. Discovery. So, in Hollywood circles, the question has been: How involved is the elder Ellison in Paramount's strategy and operations? Paramount Chief Executive David Ellison said he speaks with his father every day, but he drew an important distinction: \"Look, I run the company day to day. Make no mistake about that,\" David Ellison said Thursday at Bloomberg's Screentime media conference in Hollywood, adding that his father had been a \"phenomenal\" mentor and \"we couldn't have a better relationship.\" \"He is the largest shareholder in the business,\" Ellison said. \"What's important for everybody to know is the way he approaches this is: How do we maximize value for our shareholders? ... I think he's best in the world for doing that.\" Since the Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners acquired Paramount in August, its stock is up more than 50%. Much of the run-up came last month after news leaked that Paramount was interested in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, TBS, Food Network and one of Hollywood's most prolific film and television studios. Ellison refused to comment on Paramount's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery or whether his team had already made a bid. But he did shed light on the business strategy behind any pursuit, while trying to tamp down fears that another big merger would result in more cost-cutting, more job losses and a reduction in content spending. \"The way we approach everything is, first and foremost: What's good for the talent community, what's good for our shareholders and value creation, and what's good for basically storytelling at large?\" Ellison said. \"We're looking at actually producing more movies [and] more television series ... because you need that content.\" Paramount staffers are bracing for a massive workforce reduction next month, part of the company's goal of finding more than $2 billion in spending cuts. But, since the takeover, Paramount's Ellison has made a priority of beefing up relationships with talent through a series of big bets, including agreeing to pay $7.7 billion for media rights to UFC’s mixed martial arts events in the U.S. in a seven-year deal with TKO Group Holdings. The company also invested in the construction of a Texas-based production hub for prolific “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan and agreed to pay $1.5 billion over five years for streaming rights for “South Park,” the Comedy Central cartoon. And Paramount lured Matt and Ross Duffer, who created “Stranger Things,” away from Netflix with an exclusive four-year television, streaming and film deal. Earlier this week, Paramount spent $150 million to acquire Bari Weiss' the Free Press news site, while also naming Weiss editor in chief of CBS News. Warner Bros. Discovery, led by Chief Executive David Zaslav, also has declined to discuss Paramount's interest, although people close to the company have suggested Zaslav would like to see bidding war. No other studios have publicly expressed interest and, on Wednesday, Netflix Co-Chief Executive Greg Peters downplayed such speculation. “We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers,” Peters said during a separate appearance at the Screentime conference, adding the track record for big mergers was not great. But Wall Street widely expects more consolidation among entertainment firms. \"Ironically, it was David Zaslav last year who said that consolidation in the media business is important,\" Ellison said, adding \"there are a lot of options out there.\" But he declined to elaborate. Analysts have speculated that, beyond Paramount, few other media companies have financial firepower to pull off a bid. And Paramount has an \"in\" that several other media companies, including Brian Roberts' Comcast, lack: a good relationship with President Trump and his administration. Trump has called Larry Ellison a good friend. After David Ellison spoke with Trump at a June UFC fight, the previous managers of Paramount got traction in their efforts to settle Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview last fall with Kamala Harris. Paramount paid $16 million in July to settle the suit and weeks later the Federal Communications Commission approved the Ellison takeover of Paramount. \"We have a good relationship with the administration,\" David Ellison said.","summary":"Larry Ellison helped finance the $8-billion takeover of Paramount, and his largesse would be key in any deal for Warner Bros.

Weiss is a vocal supporter of Israel and a fierce critic of antisemitism that has spread across the US since Hamas’ brutal Oct. 7 attack on Israel two years ago.\n\nWeiss’ right-of-center views, that also include anti-wokism and scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, have roiled the liberal network, which as reported by The Post has been compared to a “snake pit” by current and former CBS staffers.\n\nIn his memo to staff on Monday, Ellison lamented a “partisan” environment consumed by “hostile disputes” and said Weiss will bring “rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum.”\n\nEllison’s Skydance merged with Paramount in August for $8 billion, and as part of the deal, the newly-formed company vowed to the Federal Communications Commission that it would address bias complaints.\n\nWeeks before the merger was approved by the FCC, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Donald Trump over alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nThe network denied any wrongdoing, but it eventually settled the lawsuit, with Ellison sweetening the deal by agreeing to throw in an additional $20 million in pro-MAGA advertising to get the deal done, Trump has said\n\nAside from the Harris scandal, the network was forced to fend off calls of bias over its Israel coverage, which riled the company’s then-controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\n\nAmong the complaints was a controversial “60 Minutes” segment featuring State Department officials who quit over American support for Israel’s efforts to root out Hamas terrorists in Gaza — a piece that the American Jewish Committee said was “shockingly one-sided, lacked factual accuracy, and relied heavily on misguided information.”","summary":"\"This is the first time she [Bari] really got involved [in the editorial meeting].

Smith said on his show that the Democratic Party has anointed their nominees in recent elections rather than letting Americans choose them — unlike Republicans since President Donald Trump entered politics. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary Cleaning Up Kamala HERE)\n\n“See, when I talked about voting for Kamala Harris, I wasn’t excited about her. And as far as I’m concerned, she didn’t earn it because she didn’t go through a primary. And the Democrats talking about ‘a threat to democracy’ — shut the hell up,” Smith said. “I don’t want to hear that because you didn’t care about that when you circumvented the democratic process to make sure that the vice president, the former vice president, would be able to bypass a Democratic primary and go straight to the Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States.”\n\n“You could have got Joe Biden out earlier, but you didn’t do it because you wanted her there because it was her turn. In 2016, when Hillary had competition, Hillary Rodham Clinton — oh, it was her turn,” he continued. “When Biden was getting smoked in the primaries before [Democratic South Carolina] Representative Clyburn came to save the day, it was his turn. That’s my problem with the Democrats.”\n\nBiden and Harris both campaigned in 2024 on Trump supposedly threatening American democracy. Moreover, Democratic Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett has repeatedly compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, while Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have accused Republicans of being fascists.\n\nFurthermore, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in May agreed with comedian Akaash Singh on “Flagrant” that the Democratic Party was “a threat to democracy,” based on its presidential primary process since 2008.\n\n“I’m not going to argue with that point,” Sanders said. “And that’s why I’m proudly an independent.”\n\nEven left-wing voters and former President Bill Clinton adviser Doug Schoen asserted at the time of Harris becoming the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee that they were dissatisfied with the process.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Biden was the first president to recognize Indigenous People's Day.Columbus day vs. indigenous peoples’ dayColumbus Day, a federal holiday since 1971, has long been celebrated in honor of Christopher Columbus and embraced by many Italian Americans as a symbol of cultural pride, as per Fox News. However, in recent years, the holiday has become a flashpoint for debate, as activists and Indigenous groups argue that celebrating Columbus overlooks the suffering of Native Americans that followed European colonization.Critics contend that Columbus’s arrival in 1492 marked the beginning of centuries of violence, displacement, and genocide against Indigenous peoples. They have pushed to replace Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, a day that recognizes and honors the history, resilience, and cultures of Native Americans.Several US cities and states have since adopted Indigenous Peoples’ Day in place of Columbus Day, and statues of Columbus have been removed or toppled during protests, particularly amid the social unrest of 2020.Former Vice President Kamala Harris has voiced support for the shift, urging Americans to confront what she called the nation’s “shameful past” tied to European exploration and colonization.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onColumbus DayIndigenous Peoples' DayDonald TrumpChristopher ColumbusJoe Bidencolumbusindigenous peoples daytrumpTrump columbus dayColumbus Day vs indigenous peoples’ day\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

In the video, Porter yells, “Get out of my f*ing shot!” This clip has caused a lot of anger online and made people question how she treats her staff.The video was reportedly filmed in 2021 during a talk with Jennifer Granholm about electric cars and saving money for Californians, according to a report by TOI. A masked staff member sneaks in behind as Porter stands talking in a kitchen, trying to issue a correction in her statement. But that pisses Porter off, who sends a barrage of expletives in the staffers way before readying to re-start her remarks. However, the original footage—released in 2021—has now been edited out. The unedited clip resurfaced this week, creating a fresh political problem for Porter. The timing is bad for Porter because she is currently running for California governor in 2026, trying to appear as a progressive but practical leader. Recent interview troubleJust a few days before this video came out, Porter faced another controversy during a CBS News interview. When asked how she would win support from Trump voters, Porter got defensive and asked, “How would I need them in order to win, ma’am?”, as mentioned in the report by TOI. She then called the interview “unnecessarily argumentative” and tried to remove her microphone to end it early. These two incidents together have revived old concerns about her temperament and leadership behavior.Who is Katie Porter?A native of Fort Dodge, Iowa, Porter was born in 1974. She is both a Yale and Harvard alumni, getting degrees in American studies and law from them respectively. Porter taught law at the University of California, Irvine, focusing on bankruptcy and consumer finance. During the 2008 money crisis, she worked on mortgage deals for then–Attorney General Kamala Harris, which made her known for helping consumers. In 2018, she made news by winning a Republican area in Orange County, one of the first Democrats to win there in many years.Live EventsPorter became famous for her whiteboard questioning in Congress, grilling bank and pharma executives over prices and fees. Fans called her the “whiteboard warrior” for her sharp questioning style. She tried to win a U.S. Senate seat in 2023 but lost to Adam Schiff and Steve Garvey in 2024. Now, she is running to become California’s governor after Gavin Newsom. She calls herself a leader who wants big changes for the people.A pattern of tensionThe video coming back has made people talk again about Porter being a strict boss. Some former staff say she wants everything perfect and loses her temper quickly, while her supporters say she is just a tough but fair boss.Porter issued a statement saying she holds herself and her team to “a high standard” and tries to be “more intentional in showing gratitude”, as mentioned in the report by TOI.She did not say sorry directly, but her tone shows she knows this may have caused problems. Some people in her own party now say this seems like she gets angry often, not just once. Political aides fear that the angry video and CBS interview together could hurt her image as a disciplined and strong candidate. Analysts say this could damage her chances, since voters expect calmness from someone running for a governor’s role. Porter's image of being tough but fair may now look more like uncontrolled aggression, which could confuse voters about her personality. A high-stakes electionThe 2026 California governor race will be watched by many people in the U.S. Porter used to be seen as a rising progressive leader. Now, she has a tough job to win back trust from voters and her staff. She is still good at her policies and media work, but recent problems make people focus more on her behavior than her ideas. People from other parties may use these incidents to say she is not stable or ready for office.Despite all this, Porter remains defiant and continues campaigning statewide, saying her record of fighting powerful interests matters more than “any viral clip”, as stated by TOI report. However, experts warn that in today’s media age, one emotional outburst can overshadow years of hard work and discipline.FAQsQ1.

They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.\n\nThe singer born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.\n\nSince the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.\n\nFor his fans, Bad Bunny’s booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.\n\nRoc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world’s biggest stage.”\n\nHe is a known global hitmaker who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles.\n\nOn Saturday, Bad Bunny hosted the season 51 premiere of “Saturday Night Live” with a few jokes about his forthcoming Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nHe has long been critical of President Donald Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Some Trump supporters consider his Super Bowl booking to be a divisive political pick.\n\n“I’ve never heard of him,” Trump said in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax when asked about Bad Bunny. “I don’t know who he is… I don’t know why they’re doing it.

These men, they’re destroying everything.”\n\nRather than hosting fancy political fundraisers or headlining presidential campaign rallies, Fonda devotes her efforts to electing like-minded state legislators, city council members, utility board officials and candidates in other less flashy but critical races.\n\nFonda said her organization took its cue from successful GOP tactics.\n\n“I hate to say this, but you know, in terms of playing the long game, the Republicans have been better than the Democrats,” she said. “They started to work down ballot, and they took over state legislatures. They took over governorships and mayors and city councils, boards of supervisors, and before we knew what had happened, they had power on the grassroots level.”\n\nFonda said her PAC selects candidates to back based on their climate-change record and viability. The beneficiaries include candidates running for state legislature and city council. Some of the races are often obscure, such as the Silver River Project board (an Arizona utility), the Port of Bellingham commission in Washington and the Lane Community College board in Oregon.\n\n“Down ballot, if you come in, especially for primaries, you can really make a difference. You know, not all Democrats are the same,” she said. “We want candidates who have shown public courage in standing up to fossil fuels. We want candidates who can win. We’re not a protest PAC. We’re in it to win it.”\n\nSince her birth, Fonda’s life has been infused by political activism.\n\nHer father, the late actor Henry Fonda, witnessed the lynching of a Black man during the 1919 Omaha race riots when he was 14, casting him into becoming a lifelong liberal.\n\nThough such matters were not discussed at the dinner table, Fonda’s father raised money for Democratic candidates and starred in politically imbued films such as “The Grapes of Wrath,” about the exploitation of migrant workers during the Dust Bowl, and “12 Angry Men,” which focused on prejudice, groupthink and the importance of due process during the McCarthy era.\n\nBut his daughter Jane did not become politically active until her early 30s.\n\n“Before then, I kind of led a life of ignorance, somewhat hedonistic,” she said. “Maybe deep down, I knew that once I know something, I can’t turn away.”\n\nIn “Prime Time,” Fonda’s 2011 memoir, she describes the final chapter of her life as a time of “coming to fruition rather than simply a period of marking time, or the absence of youth.”\n\n“Unlike during childhood, Act III is a quiet ripening. It takes time and experience, and yes, perhaps the inevitable slowing down,” she wrote. “You have to learn to sort out what’s fundamentally important to you from what’s irrelevant.”\n\nIn 1972, Fonda appeared in Jean-Luc Godard’s film “Tout Va Bien,” about workers’ rights in the aftermath of widespread street protests in France four years earlier. It was her first role in a political movie and coincided with her off-screen move into activism.\n\nFonda’s most noteworthy and reviled political moment occurred the same year, when she was photographed by the North Vietnamese sitting atop an antiaircraft gun.\n\nThe images led to Fonda being tarred as “Hanoi Jane” and a traitor to the United States, which had deployed millions of American soldiers to Southeast Asia, many of whom never returned. Fonda says it is something she “will regret to my dying day.”\n\n“It is possible that it was a setup, that the Vietnamese had it all planned,” Fonda wrote in 2011. “I will never know. But if they did, I can’t blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen. It was my mistake.”\n\nFonda married liberal activist Tom Hayden in 1973. He served in the California Legislature for 18 years and was a force in Democratic politics until his death in 2016.\n\nFonda’s political beliefs have been a through line in her Hollywood career.\n\nIn 1979, she played a reporter in “The China Syndrome,” a film about a fictional meltdown at a nuclear power plant near Los Angeles. The movie’s theatrical release occurred less than two weeks before the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe 1980 movie “9 to 5,” starring Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, was a biting comedy that highlighted the treatment of women in the workplace and income inequality long before such issues were routinely discussed in workplaces.\n\nTwo years later, as home VCRs grew popular, Fonda created exercise videos that shattered sales records.\n\nShe urged women to “feel the burn,” and revenue from the videos funded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a political action committee founded by Fonda and Hayden.\n\nThis year, Fonda offered signed copies to donors to JanePAC, which she created in 2022.\n\n“I’m still in shock that those leg warmers and leotards caught on the way they did,” Fonda wrote to supporters in April. “If you’ve ever done one of my leg lifts, or even thought about doing one, now’s your chance to own a piece of that history.”\n\nUCLA lecturer Jim Newton, a veteran Los Angeles Times political journalist and historian of the state’s politics, described Fonda as confrontational, controversial and unapologetic.\n\n“She’s remarkable, utterly admirable, a principled person who has devoted her life to fighting for what she believes in,” said Newton, who quotes Fonda in his new book, “Here Beside the Rising Tide: Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and an American Awakening.”\n\nNewton added that Fonda’s outspoken nature certainly harmed her career.\n\n“I’m sure that there are directors, producers, whatnot, especially in the ’70s and ’80s, who passed on chances to work with her because of her politics,” he said. “And I’m sure she knew that, right? She did it. It’s not been without sacrifice. She’s true to herself, like very few people.”\n\nA year after Fonda and Hayden divorced in 1990, she married CNN founder and philanthropist Ted Turner, who she once described as “my favorite ex-husband.” Though Fonda largely paused her acting career during their decade-long marriage, she remained politically active.\n\nIn 1995, Fonda founded a Georgia effort dedicated to reducing teenage pregnancy. Five years later, she launched the Jane Fonda Center for Reproductive Health at Emory University.\n\nAfter Fonda and Turner divorced, she worked with Tomlin on raising the minimum wage in Michigan and then launched Fire Drill Fridays — acts of civil disobedience — with Greenpeace in 2019.\n\nFonda said she decided to create her political action committee after facing headwinds persuading Gov. Gavin Newsom to create setbacks for oil wells in 2020.\n\n“He wasn’t moving on it, and somebody very high up in his campaign said to us, ‘You can have millions of people in your organization all over California, but you don’t have a big enough carrot or stick to move the governor. … You don’t have an electoral strategy,’” Fonda recalled. “Since we’ve started the PAC, it’s interesting how politicians deal with us differently. They know that we’ve got money. They know that we have tens of thousands of volunteers all over the country.”\n\nInitially concentrated on climate change, JanePAC has expanded its focus since Trump was reelected in November.\n\n“We’re facing two existential crises, climate and democracy, and it’s now or never for both,” Fonda said. “We can’t have a stable democracy with an unstable climate, and we can’t have a stable climate unless we have a democracy, And so we have to fight both together.”\n\nFonda’s PAC has raised more than $9 million since its creation through June 30, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn 2024, JanePAC supported 154 campaigns and won 96 of those races. The committee gave nearly $700,000 directly to campaigns and helped raise more than $1.1 million for their endorsed candidates and ballot measures. In 2025, they have endorsed 63 campaigns and plan to soon launch get-out-the-vote efforts in support of Proposition 50, Newsom’s ballot measure to redraw California’s congressional districts that will appear on the November ballot.\n\nArizona state Rep. Oscar De Los Santos, the minority leader in the state’s House of Representatives, recalled Fonda’s support during the 2024 election, not only for his reelection bid but also a broader effort to try to win Democratic control of the state Legislature.\n\nIn addition to raising $500,000 at a Phoenix event for candidates, De Los Santos recalled the actor spending days knocking on Arizona voters’ doors.\n\n“It is a moral validator to have Jane Fonda support your campaigns, especially at a time when corporate interests have more money and more power than ever, having somebody in your corner who’s been on the right side of history for decades,” said De Los Santos, who represents a south Phoenix district deeply affected by environmental justice issues.\n\nVoters are often stunned when Fonda shows up on their doorstep.\n\n“I’ve had people walking out of their laundry room and dropping all the laundry,” Fonda said with a laugh.\n\nBut others don’t know who she is and Fonda doesn’t tell them.\n\n“It’s amazing. You wouldn’t think that in just a few minutes on someone’s doorstep, you can really find out a lot,” Fonda said, recalling discovering her love of canvassing when she was married to Hayden.”I loved talking to people and finding out what they care about and what they’re scared of and what they’re angry about.”\n\nFonda does not walk in lockstep with the Democratic party. In 2023, she joined other climate-change activists protesting a big-money Joe Biden fundraiser. They argued that the then-president had strayed from the environmental promises he made when he ran for election, such as by approving a massive oil drilling project on the North Slope of Alaska.\n\nFonda said she supported Biden’s 2024 reelection despite disagreeing with some of his policies because of the threat she believed Trump poses.\n\n“When you see what the choice was, of course you’re going to vote,” she said. “I get so mad at people who say, you know, ‘I don’t like him, so I’m not going to vote.’ [A] young person said to me, we already have fascism. They don’t know history. You know, we don’t teach civics anymore, so they don’t understand that what’s happening now is leading to fascism. I mean, this is real tyranny.”\n\nBut she also faulted Biden and then-Vice President Kamala Harris after she became the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, as well as 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, for failing to speak to the economic pain being experienced by Americans who backed Trump.\n\n“They’re not all MAGA,” she said.\n\nMany were just angry and hurting, she said, because they couldn’t afford groceries or pay medical bills. Fonda believes many now have buyer’s remorse.\n\nFonda reflected on the parallels between the turmoil in the 1960s and today. In the interview, which took place before the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, she argued that today’s political climate is more perilous.\n\n“I’m not sure that what we have right now in the U.S. is a democracy,” she said. “It’s far graver. Far, far graver now than it was.”\n\nFonda said she remains driven, not by blind optimism, but by immersing herself in work that she believes makes a difference.\n\n“This is what I’m going to be doing for the rest of my life,” she said.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Bush, announced this week he is running for governor in Maine.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Bush’s campaign for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBush’s campaign will be a key test as to whether there is still room for a more traditional version of conservatism in the Republican party, which has become increasingly dominated by President Donald Trump’s style of politics. In 2022, George P. Bush’s defeat in the Texas attorney general GOP primary was viewed as the potential end of the decades-long political dynasty, but Jonathan Bush’s campaign could give the family an opportunity to reboot its influence over the GOP.\n\nMaine is a Democratic-leaning state that backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by about seven percentage points last November. But it does have an independent streak and has been willing to support moderate Republicans like Senator Susan Collins in the past.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nBush, the co-founder of Athenahealth, who has been speculated to be considering a campaign, officially jumped into the race on Wednesday—joining many other Republicans and Democrats hoping to succeed incumbent Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat who cannot run for reelection due to term limits.\n\n“Maine is the greatest place on earth to live and raise a family, but for many Mainers, it’s gotten too hard to achieve the American dream here. We’re paying too much to Augusta and getting too little,” he said in a campaign launch video. “Maine needs big change. I’ve made my career disrupting the status quo, creating jobs and helping people achieve their American dream.”\n\nBush touted support for auditing the state government, lowering taxes, investing in trade schools, and erasing regulations as ways he would advance Maine’s economy.\n\nA Newsweek illustration shows Jonathan Bush, running for Maine governor, with Jeb Bush and former President George W. Bush.\n\nBush has cast himself as a disruptor and problem solver in a state where Republicans typically need to be moderate to win a majority of voters. President Trump will likely loom over the primary and general election—candidates like Bush may need to walk a fine line to win support from Trump-aligned conservatives without alienating moderates in the general election.\n\nBush is a nephew to former President George H.W. Bush, cousin to former President George W. Bush and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and grandson to former U.S. Senator Prescott Bush. He has ties to Maine, with the Walker’s Point Estate in Kennebunkport serving as a summer retreat.\n\nMaine politics experts told Newsweek in August that there could be Republicans in Maine who support the idea of a more moderate candidate—and that there could be a path to victory for Bush.\n\n“There are still Republicans in Maine who have fond memories of the Bush family, and some who support an idea of moderate, or at least non-Trumpish, conservatism who could well be open to such a candidate, and there are Republicans who hope to follow Trump’s political path. I don’t think it’s been established yet which faction is stronger,” Ronald Schmidt, professor of political science at the University of Southern Maine, told Newsweek at the time.\n\nBush won’t be the only candidate whose family has political ties. Both the son of Senator Angus King, Angus King III, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and Representative Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, are already in the race on the Democratic side.\n\nSeveral other notable candidates are also running, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and former Maine Senate President Troy Jackson on the Democratic side. Republican candidates include Robert Charles, former U.S. assistant secretary of state, and State Senator James Libby.\n\nForecasters give Democrats an advantage in the race—the Cook Political Report classifies it as Likely Democratic, and Sabato’s Crystal Ball views it as Lean Democratic.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nGOP candidate Robert Charles wrote on X: “Our state faces unparalleled chaos thanks to Augusta Democrats, and now has the chance to elect a conservative Governor who will cut crime, cut taxes and end Augusta Democrats’ nonsense. We cannot waste this once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix Maine on a divisive, Never-Trump elitist whose entire political identity is built on a hatred for the leader who delivered record jobs, border security, and American First policies.”\n\nJonathan Bush told WGAN on Friday: “I think Maine’s biggest problem is its economic growth crisis. That it’s just accepted it’s going to be a shrinking pie, and a shrinking pie is no way to live. We’re going to make more pie in Maine, and that’s what I’m going to do as governor.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMaine’s primary election is set for June 9, 2026, and the general election for November 3, 2026. Candidates like Bush will spend the coming months making their cases to voters about why the...","summary":"Jonathan Bush announced he is running for governor, joining several other candidates in the race to succeed Governor Janet Mills.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/bush-family-makes-move-to-reboot-dynasty-official-in-maine-10855360","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bush-family-makes-moves-reboot-political.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 17:09:25","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.096},{"id":367764906,"title":"Cabinet spontaneously applauds as Trump signs Columbus Day proclamation: 'We're back, Italians'","text":"President Donald Trump's Cabinet and others at the White House broke out into applause Thursday afternoon when Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. \"Today we have your Columbus Day proclamation for Monday, which we're signing a bit early,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf told Trump Thursday ahead of the monthly Cabinet meeting. \"Columbus, obviously, discovered the new world in 1492. He was a great Italian explorer. He sailed his three ships, the Nina, the Pinto and Santa Maria, across the Atlantic Ocean, and landed in what's today the Caribbean. And this is a particularly important holiday for Italian Americans who celebrate the legacy of Christopher Columbus, and the innovation and explorer zeal that he represented,\" he continued.

The press actually broke out in applause. Good. Columbus Day. We're back. Columbus Day. We're back, Italians. We love the Italians.\" Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1971, following decades of the Italian American community already celebrating the explorer and previous presidents recognizing the holiday with their own proclamations. Activists in recent years, however, have worked to disassociate the day from Columbus — claiming it celebrates colonialism and genocide of indigenous people — in favor of celebrating Native Americans. Activists also have worked to remove Columbus statues from cities, including toppling such statues during the riots of 2020. Former Vice President Kamala Harris was among political leaders who favored celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day instead of Columbus Day, and called on Americans in 2021 to \"not shy away\" from its \"shameful past\" of European explorers. \"Those explorers ushered in a wave of devastation for Tribal nations — perpetrating violence, stealing land and spreading disease,\" she said just one day after Columbus Day 2021. \"We must not shy away from this shameful past, and we must shed light on it and do everything we can to address the impact of the past on Native communities today.\" DAVID MARCUS: BRING BACK THE REDSKINS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE TORN DOWN BY WOKENESS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump also signed another proclamation Thursday honoring Viking explorer Leif Erikson on Oct. 9.
