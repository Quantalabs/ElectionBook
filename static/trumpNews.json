This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they've got going. 53 percent of the electorate are women.\"\"Women will vote,\" she added. \"They care about how they're being talked to and they care about the issues.

Harris spoke at the Ellipse — the same site where Trump delivered a pivotal speech on January 6, 2021.\"We know who Donald Trump is,\" she told the crowd. \"He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.\"\"That's who Donald Trump is and that's who is asking you to give him another four years in the Oval Office,\" Harris said.Hers was a carefully curated study in contrasts, political experts said: a Black and Asian woman standing in front of an exuberant and diverse crowd in a place that, just four years earlier, was the backdrop for a violent chapter in modern election history.\"This is bait,\" Erin Perrine, a former communications director for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' super PAC said on CNN. The question, she added, is whether or not Trump takes it.Again and again, Harris drilled down on what she called the behavior of a \"petty tyrant,\" and suggested turning the page in history.\"As Americans, we rise and fall together. America, for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust,\" she said. \"And it can be easy, then, to forget a simple truth: it doesn't have to be this way.\"A crowd of more than 75,000 people poured onto The Ellipse and spilled out onto the National Mall to hear Harris' speech.With exactly one week left before Election Day, Harris and Trump are neck and neck in polling. She has a razor-thin lead over Trump, at 48.1 percent to Trump's 46.7 percent, according to 538's aggregation of some of the election season's most statistically reliable polling.The two candidates have crisscrossed swing states in the final push to solidify their bases and win over the slivers of voters who say they are still undecided.In a nod to an issue she has struggled with on the trail that undecided voters have said they view as important, Harris sought to directly take on the issue of immigration.\"Politicians have got to stop treating immigration as an issue to scare up votes in an election, and instead treat it as the serious challenge that it is,\" Harris said.\n\"I will work with Democrats and Republicans to sign into law the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.\"\"We must acknowledge we are a nation of immigrants,\" she added. \"And I will work with Congress to pass immigration reform, including an earned path to citizenship for hardworking immigrants, like farmworkers and our laborers.\"This is a developing story.

JD Vance, of Ohio, has also nodded to the potential consumer pain of Trump’s vision for across-the-board tariffs, though he claimed that it would be worth the possible benefits.\n\n“Anything that you lose on the tariff from the perspective of the consumer, you gain in higher wages, so you’re ultimately much better off,” Vance said in an August interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”","summary":"Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk speaks at a rally for former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden in New York, October 27, 2024.  Angela Weiss &#124; Afp &#124; Getty Images Top allies and surrogates of former President Donald Trump, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, are agreeing with economists &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Elon Musk, Trump allies say his tariff plans could cause short-term pain for consumers appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/elon-musk-trump-allies-say-his-tariff-plans-could-cause-short-term-pain-for-consumers/","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108053344-1730072039927-gettyimages-2180769486-AFP_36KY6W7.jpeg?v=1730072084&w=1920&h=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 01:05:04","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":261596234,"title":"Mayor Adams says it's 'silly' to ask whether Trump is a fascist","text":"At a combative City Hall press conference on Tuesday, Mayor Eric Adams defended an NYPD chief’s recent appearance on the right-wing network Newsmax and dodged questions from reporters on his stance on former President Donald Trump.\n\nAdams accused reporters of searching for headlines and said everyday New Yorkers did not care about whether Trump should be considered a fascist.\n\n“When I’m at these town halls talking to people there, they’re not asking me these silly questions,” the mayor said. “We are in this bubble, you know.”\n\nAdams' remarks, which came a week before Election Day, highlighted his growing political alienation as he fights federal corruption charges he has said were motivated by his criticisms of the Biden administration. Trump has expressed support for Adams’ theory, although neither has provided any evidence to back the claim.\n\nAdams, a moderate Democrat, has refrained from expressing his views on the presidential candidates — and the stakes for the city and country — even as the outcome of the tight race could reshape key parts of the federal government. If Trump were to win the race, he would have the power to pardon Adams, should the mayor be convicted on federal corruption charges. Adams has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe mayor used a scolding tone when reporters asked him whether an interview given on Newsmax by the NYPD’s chief of patrol, John Chell, at Trump’s campaign rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday was appropriate.\n\n“So the group decided that Newsmax should not be on the list of reputable outlets,” Adams told reporters on Tuesday. “This is so silly.”\n\nNewsmax, a conservative channel, has been accused of pushing misinformation about the 2020 election and other inaccurate reporting. The network’s viewers have been characterized as the most devout Trump supporters — more so than Fox News watchers.\n\nChell, who was in charge of security for Trump’s rally at the Garden, has been interviewed on the network several times. On Sunday, he went on the show and praised both the event and Adams.\n\n“Our mayor lets me play offense, lets our cops play offense,” Chell told the anchors. The same day, he also did interviews with multiple mainstream outlets, as Adams was quick to point out.\n\nBut on Newsmax, Chell was effusive about the Trump rally. “Great atmosphere. Everyone is peaceful,” he said. “This is a very energetic day.”\n\nThe rally was later widely condemned for a parade of speakers who hurled misogynistic and racist insults. One comedian called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”\n\nAdams joined other elected officials in denouncing the rhetoric at the rally, although he did not mention Trump. But his statement was eclipsed by his remarks prior to the rally, when he broke from Vice President Kamala Harris by saying he did not believe Trump should be called a fascist and rejected the comparison of Trump to Adolf Hitler. The label has gained traction after former high-ranking Trump staffers used it to describe the former president.\n\nAdams' recent statements have prompted criticism from his fellow Democrats. New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who has been supportive of the mayor at times, called Adams “a Trump apologist” and “defender.” In the same post on social media, Williams said he was unsure whom Adams would vote for.\n\nAdams, who once proclaimed himself the face of the new Democratic Party, was asked exactly that question on Tuesday. The mayor did not give a direct answer. In recent weeks, he has refrained from saying Harris’ name.\n\n“I made it clear on who I endorse for president,” Adams replied.","summary":"Mayor Adams scolded the press at a contentious City Hall press conference on October 29, 2024.\n\n\n  \n\nAs the mayor defended an NYPD chief&#39;s appearance on Newsmax and dodged questions on the former president, he highlighted his own political alienation.

He has claimed that he had as many people in attendance that day as Martin Luther King Jr attracted for his “I Have a Dream” speech near the Lincoln Memorial, on August 28 1968.\n\nEstimates suggest King’s crowd was actually closer to 250,000 – about five times as big as Trump’s on January 6.\n\nSpeaking at the Ellipse, a park between the White House and the National Mall, Harris sought to paint a clear contrast between herself and her Republican opponent and offer a “closing argument” to voters.\n\n“America, we know what Donald Trump has in mind. More chaos. More division. And policies that help those at the very top and hurt everyone else. I offer a different path. And I ask for your vote,” Harris told the crowd.\n\n“And here is my pledge to you: I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better,” she added. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”\n\nThe message could not be more different than Trump’s speech at the site, where he made false claims about the election and railed against Republicans who would not go along with his plan to halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 win.\n\nThough Trump told supporters to “peacefully and patriotically” make their voices heard, the Republican also used the speech to pressure his vice president, Mike Pence, to suspend the certification and called on MAGA fans to “fight like hell” to preserve their country.\n\n“We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he told the crowd, as he repeated false claims that the election had been stolen from him.\n\nHe told the crowd: “And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It’s a disgrace. There’s never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we’ve been going through in this country. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace.”\n\nAccording to testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson during the January 6 hearings, Trump had reason to believe some of the crowd were armed. She said he wanted the magnetometers being used to check for weapons taken away so that the crowd would fill up more quickly.\n\n“I don’t f***ing care that they have weapons,” Trump said according to Hutchinson. “They’re not here to hurt me. Take the f***ing mags away.”\n\nTrump is facing federal criminal charges in Washington for his attempts to subvert his 2020 loss.\n\nOn the 2024 campaign trail, Trump has taken to describing the events surrounding January 6 as non-violent, refering to the day as a “peaceful transfer of power” and a day of “love and peace.”","summary":"On rally stage, vice president said she would seek ‘common ground’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-trump-ellipse-speech-b2637915.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/30/00/2024-10-30T005047Z_76969699_RC2MUAAV5FS9_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fVhvV16g-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-30 01:00:05","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":261596314,"title":"Elon Musk’s bromance with Donald Trump could cost him billions","text":"Trump has made no secret of his disdain for electric vehicles, having spent years denigrating them and promising to withdraw the tax and carbon credits that play a major role in their take-up.

Former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick has stepped into the political spotlight once again, urging voters to actively track their ballots as these incidents were reported. The ballot destruction in the Pacific Northwest, identified as an arson attack, means that voters must keep track of their votes.Ballot boxes in these states were deliberately set on fire using incendiary devices, causing the destruction of votes that had been cast. Such acts are serious offenses and can lead to strong legal consequences, including imprisonment and hefty fines.Local authorities, including police and fire departments, have swiftly responded to control and investigate these incidents, but these events have already raised alarms over election security and the need for stringent safeguarding of voting infrastructure.Patrick, known for her achievements in both IndyCar and NASCAR, has once again taken to her platform to address these concerns on social media. Using Instagram, Patrick told her followers to use the ballot tracking tools to ensure their votes were counted and mitigated against tampering.\"What?! Make sure you track your ballot so you know when it has been counted,\" she posted on her Instagram story. \"I voted on Wednesday at a local voting/drop off center. My confirmation email came Sunday.\"Vote early,\" she continued.Patrick has confirmed that she is voting for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, actively participating in his political rallies.Patrick's public political engagement has even seen her receive a direct acknowledgment from Trump himself, who commended her campaigning efforts. Reflecting on her unexpected political journey, she expressed her astonishment.\"If you would have told me a year ago I would speak at a Donald Trump rally 12 days before the election and have him call me out a few times during his speech.... I would have asked if you fell out of the coconut tree. Politics is so new and so unexpected for me. It's an honor to be part of one of the most powerful political movements in history. Not only as far as an election but also to expose the truth and really be the party of unification,\" Patrick shared on X, formerly Twitter.The 2024 election sees Donald Trump seeking a return to office, while Kamala Harris endeavors to make history as the first female president of the United States. The need for transparent and secure voting processes is paramount, regardless of which way you vote.As the election progresses, measures to ensure ballot security remain strong.

She repeated her promise to “deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class,” ban what she calls price gouging on groceries, cap the price of insulin, expand the child tax credit and help with down payments for first-time homebuyers.\n\nKey Background\n\nHarris delivered the speech as she and Trump are neck-and-neck in national polls and all seven battleground states just a week before Election Day. Trump has focused much of his closing message on immigration, telling his supporters during a press conference from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday: “I think what’s happening on the border is the single biggest issue.” Polls consistently show the economy and immigration are top issues for voters.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump Vs.

That is not the way to win women.”\n\nHaley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and one of the most prominent women in the Republican Party, said she remains “on standby” to campaign for Trump, but she has not been deployed to help the former president make his final pitch to voters. “It is their campaign’s decision on what he needs in these last final days.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Your Money Is Being Wasted’—Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk Declares ‘Financial Emergency’ As $35.7 Trillion ‘Debt Bomb’ Primes A Bitcoin Price Boom To Rival Gold\n\nLeak Reveals A $1.4 Trillion China Earthquake Could Be About To Hit Crypto As The Bitcoin Price Soars Over $70,000\n\nTrump Vs.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nIn her speech Tuesday night on the Ellipse, Harris made her “closing argument” to voters, urging Americans to put the divisiveness of Donald Trump behind them. “The United States is the greatest idea humanity ever devised,” Harris said. “In 7 days, let us turn the page and start writing the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.”\n\nDrawing a sharp contrast with Trump, Harris said she had no interest in jailing her political opponents, but said she would instead give them “a seat at the table.” She said political differences did not make her opponents “the enemy within,” but rather “they are our fellow Americans.

Here are some thoughts, with others on the side. \n\nDonald Trump believes he’s going to loseThat’s what he’s telling us when he complains about cheating. Yes, he’s eroding public trust in the institutions of government, but first and foremost, he’s saying that he believes Kamala Harris will beat him.\n\nNo one in his right mind would triple down on his base of support, knowing such a strategy is not enough to win a presidential contest. But that’s what Trump has done. His campaign looks like he’s talking to the same people, over and over, because he is. He makes no effort to broaden his appeal outside the bubble of white-power politics.\n\nThis is lazy and breathtakingly obtuse. And it forces him to do two things. One is complain about cheating in advance. The other is lie. \n\nHis rally at Madison Square Garden was widely panned by neutral observers for being racist, sexist and even fascist. A day later, he took to his social media site to falsely allege the discovery of “THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT” voter documents in Pennsylvania.\n\nThis afternoon, he held a presser to respond to the backlash against the MSG rally, especially that a speaker there said Puerto Rico and all of its American citizens were “an island of garbage.” In reality, the rally was a categorical hate-fest, but Trump said he was “like a love-fest.” \n\nBloomberg’s Timothy O’Brien said that whenever Trump “loses political ground,” he retreats to claims about voter fraud. It’s “like clockwork,” O’Brien said. So is Trump’s lying. We can set our watches to the likelihood of him saying that you didn’t see that thing you actually saw. Who are you going to trust, he says in essence, me or your lying eyes?\n\nThis is not what a winner does. A winner believes in his ability to win over a majority of the American people – or at least a majority of the voters in swing states that determine presidential elections. A winner looks forward to being tested and to showing the world what he’s made of. A loser doesn’t do that. He fears the test. He fears seeing all the lies he tells to others and to himself proven conclusively wrong. \n\nIn order to conceal the truth about him, he does what losers do.\n\nTrump is bad at politicsYou could say, as O’Brien did, that Trump resorts to loser tactics when he “loses political ground,” but you could put that another way. \n\nHe resorts to them when he gives ground away. \n\nHis campaign evidently felt it was a good idea to insult Puerto Ricans and Latinos generally a couple of days before holding a rally at an arena located in the Puerto Rican neighborhood of a majority-Latino city (Allentown) in the must-win swing state of Pennsylvania. According to Politico, some residents are so enraged by “island of garbage” that they’re planning to protest the rally, thus bringing more attention to a campaign that can’t break out of its bubble of white-power politics.\n\nA party official in Allentown, who said that his Latino family is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, said of Trump that “it’s not the smartest thing to do, to insult people — a large group of voters here in a swing state — and then go to their home asking for votes.”\n\nThat’s a nice way of putting it. \n\nAnother way is that he’s bad at politics. \n\nBack in the day, before Trump came along, we used to be able to count on both hands the number of unforced errors a candidate made. Recall that Republican nominee Mitt Romney was well-known for his gaffes.\n\nIn between the blunders, Romney ran a serious campaign. We could identify his gaffes, because they were the exception to the norm. \n\nThere are such exceptions with Trump. They are the norm. His campaign is nonstop gaffing. He overwhelms us with them. We never talk about them, because we put on the pile of “more of the same.”\n\nTrump could win. If he does, it will be because just enough white people in just enough places were willing to believe his lies and overlook his errors. He could also win by cheating and staging another coup, this one perhaps legal. But let’s also not kid ourselves. \n\nIf he loses, and I think he will, no one is going to look back at nine years’ worth of campaigning and say that it’s worth emulating. \n\nHarris believes she’s going to winMy main point is that the vice president is running a masterful campaign. Even if she’d had a year to prepare, I don’t think she could have put together a better operation than the one she has now. And as long as she executes according to plan, she’ll probably beat Trump.\n\nWith the help of Joe Biden, Harris orchestrated instantaneous unity within the Democratic Party, despite its factions and infighting. Since the convention, she has done what you expect from a nominee who is trying to win: she has expanded her base of power to include people who are not Democrats, namely Republicans, but also nonvoters.\n\nShe has done that with a mix of policy proposals, especially those that target price-gouging and the high cost of living, and basic appeals to reestablishing the regular order in political business. In doing so, Harris is creating a new kind of consensus. Or more precisely, she’s claiming as her own a consensus that has already emerged.\n\nAs if to illustrate the point, Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former Republican president George W Bush, came out Monday in support of Harris. She said she hoped that voters would support the vice president toward the goal of protecting women’s rights. She joined the Harris campaign in Pennsylvania over the weekend. \n\nAlong with Liz and Dick Cheney, and scores of other prominent Republicans, the addition of a Bush daughter suggests two things. \n\nOne is that Kamala Harris is standing at the mid-point in American politics. She represents the new centrism. The other is that Donald Trump is standing outside the mainstream. He’s a partisan candidate. She’s a bipartisan candidate, the first such candidate of my lifetime.\n\nThough the aggregate of quality national polls is showing that Harris has a slight lead over Trump, that’s not the reason I’m hopeful. \n\nI’m hopeful because Trump is bad at politics and acts like a loser. \n\nMeanwhile, Harris is good at politics and acts like a winner.","summary":"We have a week to go before Election Day, and like many of my comrades in the pundit corps, I’m being asked what I think is going to happen.

But other parts of it underscored the former businessman's appeal as someone who vows to fix the economy and the border, and as a political outsider eager to defy any and all conventions despite the risks.\n\nHarris, the vice president for the last four years, chose a more formal setting — the grassy Ellipse near the White House — to underscore the seriousness of this moment in American history and the threat Trump poses to democracy. She faced a massive audience in the same place where Trump addressed thousands of his loyalists on Jan. 6, 2021, before they stormed the U.S. Capitol in one of the darkest days of modern history. \n\nBut more than simply reminding voters of the danger that Trump poses to U.S. democracy, Harris' remarks were designed to highlight her opponent's record of prioritizing his personal interests instead of the nation's.\n\n\"Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That’s who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are,\" Harris said. “I pledge to be a president for all Americans — to always put country above party and above self.”\n\nSenior adviser Jen O’Malley Dillon noted that Harris’ closing argument is designed to reach the narrow slice of undecided voters; many moderate Republicans are among them. \n\n“We know that there are still a lot of voters out there that are still trying to decide who to support — or whether to vote at all,” O'Malley Dillon said. “And this race is extremely close. We talk about it as a margin of error race. We know it is going to be closed out in this final week.”\n\nTrump's team is more focused on energizing his partisan base and reaching infrequent voters across the political spectrum who are frustrated by the direction of the country and looking for change.\n\nStill, Trump framed his comments in recent days with a simple question that cuts across political lines, asking voters whether they are better off now than they were four years ago at the end of his first term. While the nation was still in the throes of the pandemic when Trump left office, polls indicate that most voters are unhappy with the direction of the country today.\n\nTrump has vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history and impose broad tariffs to generate revenue and boost American manufacturing. \n\nEver defiant facing criticism from even some Republicans, Trump on Tuesday called his Madison Square Garden event “a lovefest” and did not address the comments of pro-Trump comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” Hinchcliffe also made demeaning jokes about Black people, other Latinos, Palestinians and Jews in his routine before Trump took the stage.\n\n“Nobody’s ever had love like that,” Trump said of the hours-long Sunday event that featured his family members and high-level surrogates and supporters including billionaire Elon Musk, TV psychologist “Dr. Phil” McGraw and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “It was really love for our country.”\n\nThe Republican former president on Tuesday also offered a dark assessment of Harris' leadership. He said that she “obliterated” the nation's borders, “decimated the middle class,” brought “bloodshed and squalor” to major cities and “unleashed war and chaos all over the world.”\n\n“No person who has caused so much destruction and death at home and abroad should ever be allowed to be the president of the United States,” Trump told dozens of supporters who gathered at his Florida estate. \n\nTrump senior adviser Jason Miller said Trump has made clear his plans to fix the economy, secure the southern border and “improve people’s daily lives.”\n\n“Kamala Harris hasn’t done any of that,” he said. “It’s a message of despair, personal attacks and nothing from Harris or her campaign about what they’re actually going to do to help Americans. So it’s a massive contrast.”\n\nHarris has largely moved on from the “joyful” campaigning style that defined her entrance into the presidential contest this summer. She pledged unity on Tuesday night, but she also cast Trump as someone driven more by revenge and grievance than a commitment to the people. \n\n“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power,” Harris said. “This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better.”\n\nShe spoke directly to Republican voters at times and promised to listen to those who didn't vote for her if elected. Harris previously said she would include a Republican in her Cabinet. \n\n“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\" she said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.”\n\nHeading into the speech, the Democrat's campaign was aware of criticism from her party's far-left base that she has been too focused on courting moderate Republican voters. They urged Harris to focus more on working-class priorities than the threat Trump poses to U.S. democracy.\n\nUltimately, the vice president's speech was designed to tie both issues together. She warned of Trump threatening democratic norms and vowed to take action against high grocery prices and help first-time home buyers with making a down payment.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a top Harris ally, said voters can “walk and chew gum at the same time — meaning they can hear an argument about freedom and about something that affects their pocketbook. And I think she is certainly capable to prosecute both cases at the same time.”\n\nSisters Michelle Detwiler and Renee Newell drove from Virginia to attend Harris' remarks at the Ellipse.\n\n“We both have daughters and we’re both here for them,” Newell said. Detwiler said the location of the event is a “great counterpoint to the imagery of Jan. 6. D.C. is a great city for peaceful public gatherings. \n\n“We’re so glad to be here and to experience the joy,” she said. \n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller and Fatima Hussein in Washington and Jill Colvin in New York contributed.","summary":"In the shadow of the White House, Kamala Harris is vowing to put country over party","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-ap-kamala-harris-white-house-republicans-b2637917.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/30/00/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Harris_13415.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:34:50","author":"Steve Peoples","authors":["Steve Peoples"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.252},{"id":261594920,"title":"Leader of an important county in Nevada takes medical leave before the election","text":"RENO, Nev. – The manager of a key swing county in northern Nevada is out on medical leave, a departure announced just days before the election.\n\nWashoe County has received attention in recent weeks after turnover at the top of the elections office there. Now, with the departure of Manager Eric Brown, both elections and county government operations will be overseen by deputies during what is expected to be a very close election in this politically important county.\n\nThe county confirmed Tuesday that Brown is on leave for a planned medical procedure and will be out through late November. Assistant County Manager Dave Solaro will step in until Brown returns.\n\nCounty officials are trying to quell any concerns that the shuffling of staff would affect operations in Nevada’s second most-populous county. County spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale said that Solaro served as the interim manager for several months before Brown was hired in 2019 and that he has been with the county for more than two decades.\n\n“(Solaro) joins the rest of the county team in wishing Manager Brown well and looks forward to taking on the tasks at hand during the short period of time,” she said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nLast month, the county announced that Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess requested medical leave to deal with stress. But Burgess said she was forced out after refusing to go along with personnel changes sought by Brown’s office. She said she asked repeatedly to stay, even providing a doctor’s note vouching for her health, and has hired a lawyer.\n\nOverseeing the office now is Burgess’ deputy — the fifth person in four years to run the county election operation. The turnover is one symptom of a county that is closely divided politically and has been buffeted by election conspiracy theories since Republican Donald Trump lost the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe county has maintained that it’s “focused on conducting a smooth and fair election.”\n\nGeorge Guthrie, a spokesman in the Registrar of Voters office, said in an interview Tuesday before Brown’s medical leave was disclosed that employees in that office appeared to be in good spirits while working hard.\n\n“Election time is go-time for us. This is our Superbowl. The primary is the playoffs,” Guthrie said. “Our people are locked in, working long hours, 12-hour days and weekends.”","summary":"RENO, Nev. – The manager of a key swing county in northern&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/leader-of-an-important-county-in-nevada-takes-medical-leave-before-the-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Manager-of-a-key-Nevada-swing-county-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:34:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":261594980,"title":"Biden rips Trump supporters as ‘only garbage I see floating’ in rebuke of ex-prez over joke made by comedian at MSG rally","text":"President Biden raged against “Kill Tony” podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about Puerto Rico being a “floating island of garbage” and suggested that was a good description for supporters of former President Donald Trump. \n\n“Donald Trump has no character.

She emphasized compromise, sought to separate herself from Washington elites, and promised to approach her work with optimism.\n\n“We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,” Harris said. “And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States of America.”\n\nHarris also promised to offer a different vision than her boss, President Joe Biden.\n\n“My presidency will be different because the challenges we face are different. Our top priority as a nation four years ago was to end the pandemic and rescue the economy. Now, our biggest challenge is to lower costs, costs that were rising even before the pandemic, and that are still too high,” Harris added.\n\nRelated StoriesHarris Supporters Gather for Washington Rally A Week Before Election10/29/2024Harris Delivers Closing Argument Speech on the National Mall10/29/2024\n\nThe speech was delivered two days after the former president made his own closing argument to voters during a rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, where he urged Americans to “dream big again” and described Harris as “unfit” for office. \n\nThe Oct. 29 speech was Harris’s final salvo to any remaining undecided voters in the last days of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe speech came after an intense political campaign of a little more than three months after Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s candidate after he dropped out of the race on July 21.\n\nThe vice president saw a significant rise in polling following the Democratic National Convention in August. \n\nThat momentum slowed in October, with Trump now taking a slight edge in many swing state polls.\n\nIn the battleground polling averages, the two candidates are tied in Wisconsin, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, while Harris is up by 1 point in Michigan, and Trump leads by roughly 1 point in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona.Supporters Weigh InSome Harris supporters told The Epoch Times that they gathered in the capital in the name of history, workers’ rights, the next generation, women, and their shared drive to keep Trump out of the White House.\n\n“I would feel devastated on behalf of all women” if Harris loses the election, Meredith Shea, a freshman at George Washington University, told The Epoch Times.\n\nBrady Eagan (L) and Meredith Shea (R) ahead of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris' closing arguments speech at The Ellipse in Washington on Oct. 29, 2024.

I’m extremely proud of my fellow Bison, and I want to do everything I can to make sure we sustain democracy.”\n\nGeorge Washington University freshman Brady Eagan said this is the time for the next generation to step up.\n\nEagan said he feels as if another Trump administration would be “a threat to democracy as a whole.”\n\n“And I think it is up to young voters to prove that we are here and that we are ready to make change, and that’s what we’re here to do,” he said.\n\nA September CNN poll found that 41 percent of likely voters described the economy as the most important issue influencing their vote, followed by 21 percent who said it was “protecting democracy” and 12 percent who named immigration.\n\n“Protecting democracy” splits along party lines, with 37 percent of Harris supporters naming it as their top issue, while Trump supporters are focused on the economy (61 percent) and immigration (21 percent).\n\nNext, the vice president will take her closing argument on the road in the final stretch before Election Day. This week, she will visit North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nTrump started the week with a campaign rally in Georgia.

The former First Lady turned heads wearing a chic zebra-printed coat from Michael Kors. As the saying goes, a Zebra doesn't change its stripes, Melania's voguish ensemble was picked to send a powerful statement about honoring the Trump family 'roots'—New York City— the place where Donald was born and founded his economic empire.\n\nAccording to Nicki Swift, she gave a heartfelt speech about her husband, referring to him as the future 'commander-in-chief.' Additionally, she also praised the city's many achievements. She began, “Our hometown, where architectural symbols of strength, courage, and unity, create a canvas for the world’s undisputed capital of industry.”\n\nShe added, “Where titans of finance, fashion, and entertainment convene among an iconic range of superior design, structures, and artistic accomplishments.” Amidst cheers and applause from the audience, Melania recalled the time when she moved to New York from Slovenia to make a career in the fashion industry. However, she soon followed it up with claims of how the place has become 'unforgiving' and how the city's 'quality of life' has declined in recent years.\n\nAs per WWD, Herve Pierre, the former model's stylist, revealed that the Michael Kors coat was purchased a few years prior from a store on Madison Avenue. \"It was a few seasons ago and there was only one,\" Pierre shared. “We thought the graphic black and white pattern would look good with an ocean of blue, white, and red,” he explained, citing how Melania tends to prefer the black and white color scheme. \n\nThe former First Lady has largely remained absent from Donald's 2024 campaign trail. Instead, she has preferred to spend time with their 18-year-old son, Barron Trump, as he started college earlier this year in New York. Although Melania attended the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to support Donald, she broke traditions and opted out of introducing him. Additionally, as per reports Melania was paid hundreds of thousands to participate in private Republican events, such as a Log Cabin political meet in the spring.\n\nDuring her recent speech in the Big Apple, she asserted that “New York City and America need their magic back,” and promised that her husband would do just that. Meanwhile, Donald joined her on stage and congratulated Melania on her best-selling memoir that launched earlier this month, on October 8. “It’s a great book,” he said. While the husband-wife duo tried to give off a collected front, what piqued public interest was rather a cold awkward moment. As Donald approached Melania with arms wide open, Melania reciprocated with a formal, diplomatic peck on the cheek. This has led many to believe that Melania's public appearance was more strategic ahead of Election Day than a true rally of support.","summary":"“We thought the graphic black and white pattern would look good with an ocean of blue, white, and red,” her stylist said.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/melania-trumps-outfit-at-msg-rally-was-more-than-a-fashion-statement-it-carried-a-secret-message","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/722160/uploads/62cee050-95bc-11ef-890b-21a629729981_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.124},{"id":261594626,"title":"Where’s Ivanka Trump?","text":"Observers say that Ivanka and Kushner – or “Javanka,” for short – have also flourished financially, freed from governmental ethical rules.\n\n“They’re much richer than they were before they went into government,” Ward said. “And now he’s got a Rolodex of world leaders who are on the phone to him.

(AP) — Urged by some allies to apologize for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an “honor to be involved” in such an event and calling the scene a “lovefest” — the same term he has used to describe the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump gathered supporters and reporters to his Mar-a-Lago resort two days after a massive rally at Madison Square Garden featured a number of crude remarks by various speakers, including a set by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe in which he joked that Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage.” Some of Trump’s top Republican allies have condemned the remarks, and his campaign took the rare step of publicly distancing itself from Hinchcliffe’s joke, though not the other comments.\n\nBut given the opportunity to apologize at events and in an interview, Trump instead leaned in. Speaking at his Florida resort, he said that “there’s never been an event so beautiful” as his Sunday rally in his hometown of New York.\n\n“The love in that room. It was breathtaking,” he said. “It was like a lovefest, an absolute lovefest. And it was my honor to be involved.”\n\nWith just a week before Election Day, some Trump allies have voiced alarm that the rally, which was supposed to highlight the Republican presidential nominee’s closing message in grand New York fashion, has instead served as a distraction and even a liability, given the electoral importance of Puerto Ricans who live in Pennsylvania and other key swing states.\n\n“This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos,” former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump for the GOP presidential nomination and later endorsed him, said in an interview with Fox News Channel.\n\nTrump was set to hold a rally later in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a city with a large Hispanic population, where Puerto Rico’s shadow U.S. senator, Zoraida Buxo, will join him, according to a campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. She voiced her support for Trump on the social media site X, saying Trump is the “strong leader” that Puerto Rico needs.\n\nStill, there was anger in Allentown. Ivet Figueroa, 61, stood outside the rally venue holding a trash can with the words “Trash Trump” on it.\n\nShe said of the insult and Trump:: “The person who said it was vetted by him. So that’s what he allowed, so he has to take responsibility for what he said. Now it’s too late for saying ‘sorry.’ I don’t want an apology, I want justice, and justice is on Nov. 5.”\n\nThe fallout from the Madison Square Garden event risked highlighting voters’ concerns about Trump’s rhetoric and penchant for controversy in the closing stretch as both campaigns are scrambling for votes. Speakers at the rally also made racist comments targeting Latinos, Black people, Jews and Palestinians, along with sexist insults directed at Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump tried to move past the controversy and pivot back to Harris, lashing his rival’s record on the border and inflation, saying that, “on issue after issue, she broke it” and “I’m going to fix it and fix it very fast.” He took no questions from reporters.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News earlier Tuesday, Trump tried to distance himself from Hinchcliffe but did not denounce what he said.\n\n“I don’t know him. Someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,” Trump said, according to the network, insisting that he hadn’t heard Hinchcliffe’s comments. When asked what he made of them, Trump “did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn’t hear the comments,” ABC reported.\n\nThe comments have drawn outrage from Puerto Rican leaders.\n\nThe archbishop of Puerto Rico called on Trump to disavow them, saying it wasn’t enough for the campaign to say the joke didn’t reflect Trump’s views. The president of Puerto Rico’s Republican Party called the “poor attempt at comedy” by Hinchcliffe “disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible.”\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where Trump was to campaign later Tuesday, the Latino eligible voter population has nearly tripled since 2000. More than half of those are Puerto Rican eligible voters.\n\nAngelo Ortega, a longtime Allentown resident and former Republican who’s planning to vote for Harris, said he couldn’t believe what he’d heard about Trump’s rally.\n\n“I don’t know if my jaw dropped or I was just so irritated, angry. I didn’t know what to feel,” said Ortega, who was born in New York but whose father came from Puerto Rico. Ortega has been campaigning for Harris and said he knows of at least one Hispanic GOP voter planning to switch from Trump to Harris as a result of Hinchcliffe’s comments.\n\n“They’ve had it. They’ve had it. They were listening to (Trump), but they said they think that that was like the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said Ortega, a member of the Make the Road PA advocacy group.\n\nStill, some voters of Puerto Rican descent weren’t fazed. Maricelis Torres, 24, a waitress studying to be a radiologist, waited to get into the Allentown rally and said she and her family laughed at Hinchcliffe’s joke.\n\n“If you don’t understand humor, then that’s what I’m saying, people are way too soft these days,” said Torres, whose father is from the island.\n\nThe Harris campaign has released an ad that will run online in battleground states targeting Puerto Rican voters and highlighting the comedian’s remarks.\n\nAt a roundtable outside Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, Trump got some praise from a retired occupational therapist from Puerto Rico, Maribel Valdez. “Puerto Rico stands behind you, and Puerto Rico loves you,” Valdez told him.\n\nTrump thanked her and reminisced about his administration’s efforts to help the island after storms. “I think no president has ever done more for Puerto Rico than I have,” responded Trump, who delayed the release of billions of dollars in assistance to repair years-old hurricane damage in Puerto Rico until shortly before the 2020 election.\n\nGomez Licon and Price reported from Palm Beach, Fla.

He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” she said.\n\nBut Harris did not deliver a treatise on democracy – a staple of President Biden’s own attempts to draw a contrast with Trump. Instead she aimed to make a broader case for why voters should reject Trump and consider what she offers, while introducing herself to voters still clamoring for more information and encouraging the crowd to visualize their divergent futures hanging in the balance on Election Day.\n\n“He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute,” Harris said. “He says one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on Jan. 6. Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better.”\n\nHer speech drew a massive crowd to Washington, with an overflow crowd spilling under the Washington Monument on the National Mall. More critically, her campaign hopes the setting will help catch the attention of battleground state voters who remain on the fence about whom to vote for – or whether to vote at all.\n\nAhead of Harris’ remarks, her campaign organized a speakers list of ordinary Americans, rather than the star power that has been featured at some of her recent events, or the parade of elected officials often in the program at Washington events. They included Amanda Zurawski, a woman who nearly died from sepsis after being denied care under Texas’ strict abortion ban, and Craig Sicknick, the brother of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nRuth Chiari, 78, of Charlottesville, Virginia, was attending the rally with her husband to “support democracy.”\n\n“I think everybody understands what’s on the ballot,” she said as she waited in line near the Treasury building to enter the event. “We’re either going to have an autocrat or freedom.”\n\nKathleen Nicholas, 36, a government relations worker in Washington, remembered Jan. 6 and loved the contrast of the crowd and atmosphere to that day. “I like she chose this place for her closing,” she said. “Having something that is a direct contrast to that day is what we needed.”\n\nWith time running out and the race tight, Harris and Trump have both sought big moments to try to shift momentum their way.\n\nThe address came days after Harris traveled to Texas, a reliably Republican state, to appear with megastar Beyoncé and emphasize the consequences for women after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That, too, was a speech meant to register with voters far away in the battleground states.\n\nThe vice president’s latest address has been in the works for weeks. But aides hoped her message would land with more impact after Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York, where speakers hurled cruel and racist insults. Harris said the event “highlighted the point that I’ve been making throughout this campaign.”\n\n“He is focused and actually fixated on his grievances, on himself and on dividing our country,” she said.\n\nHarris sought to lay out a pragmatic and forward-looking plan for the country, including reminding voters about her economic proposals and pledging to work for access to reproductive care, including abortion.\n\n“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” Harris said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self.”\n\nAlso central to her message: positioning herself as a “new generation” of leader after Trump and even her current boss, Biden.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be this way,” Harris said. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict and confusion.”\n\nShe acknowledged that “many of you are still getting to know who I am” after her surprise elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden dropped out of the race in July, and used her remarks to try to answer voters’ curiosity.\n\n“I recognize this has not been a typical campaign,” Harris said, adding that she is “not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests.”\n\n“I’ll be honest with you: I’m not perfect,” she said. “I make mistakes. But here’s what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me. I will always tell you the truth, even if it’s hard to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.”\n\nAhead of Harris’ speech, Trump used remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday morning to accuse Harris of closing with a message that doesn’t address everyday Americans’ day-to-day struggles and kitchen-table concerns.\n\nHe said Harris keeps “talking about Hitler, and Nazis, because her record’s horrible,” a reference to Harris amplifying the warnings from his former chief of staff that Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi leader while in office.\n\nHarris’ aides, many of whom also advised Biden’s campaign before he dropped out, still believe that centering the race on who Trump is and how she’s different will be their strongest message for voters.\n\n“She’s already made her case, she’s presented the evidence. She’s offering up a summation tonight, and she has faith in the wisdom of the jury,” campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nBiden told reporters Tuesday that he will not attend Harris’ speech because the event is “for her,” but he planned to watch it on television. Ahead of Harris’ remarks, Biden is reacted to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend by saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle L.

Marco Rubio of Florida, whom Trump has enlisted to court Latino voters across the country.\n\nEarly on, Trump made no mention of the controversy but did refer to his Madison Square Garden rally, calling it \"the greatest evening anyone has seen politically,\" adding, \"the love was unbelievable.\"\n\nHis second campaign stop of the day in Pennsylvania -- after a roundtable in Drexel Hill, where the population is overwhelmingly white – the Allentown visit was an opportunity for the former president to court Hispanics, and more specifically Puerto Ricans, after Hispanic groups on both sides of the aisle called the racist jokes made at the New York rally \"derogatory,\" \"offensive,\" and \"disrespectful.\"\n\nThe comments in question were made by controversial comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during pre-programming earlier Sunday afternoon, including explicit comments about how Latinos \"love making babies.\"\n\n\"I don't know if you guys know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico,\" Hinchcliffe said on stage to a crowd of nearly 20,000 Sunday night, after the former president himself the previous day called the United States a \"garbage can for the world.\"\n\nHinchcliffe, instead of apologizing for his comments, attacked his critics as lacking a sense of humor and accused them of taking the joke out of context to \"make it seem racist.\"\n\nThe former president denied knowing the comedian on Tuesday, telling ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott: \"I don't know him, someone put him up there. I don't know who he is.\"\n\nTrump also insisted he didn't hear any of the comments, even as they've been played on television and written about extensively. When asked what he made of them, he did not take the opportunity to denounce them, repeating that he didn't hear the comments.\n\nTrump's campaign has also tried to distance itself from comedian Hinchcliffe's comments, saying they don't reflect their views.\n\nSeveral Republicans have come out against the jokes, including the chair Republican Party of Puerto Rico, Angel Cintrón, who called Hinchcliffe's comments as \"unfortunate, ignorant, and entirely reprehensible,\" as well as \"racist.\"\n\nResident of Puerto Rico, as a U.S. territory, do not vote for president in the general election, but the Republican Party of Puerto Rico held a primary in April as part of the Republican presidential nominating process. Donald Trump won the primary and netted the territory's delegates.\n\nPuerto Ricans living in the United States, however, make up the largest Hispanic group in seven states across the country, including in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, according to the U.S. Census data.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where President Joe Biden won in 2020 by just over 81,000 votes, 3.7% of the state's total population, or roughly 486,000 people, were of Puerto Rican origin. Pennsylvania is again expected to be an extremely tight race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with Trump ahead of Harris by just 0.2% according to 538's polling average as of Oct. 29.\n\nOverall, Pennsylvania's eligible Latino voter population has more than doubled since 2000, from 206,000 to 620,000 in 2023, according to WNTM's analysis of U.S. Census Bureau figures.","summary":"It comes after a racist comments about Puerto Rico at his New York rally.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hold-rally-pennsylvania-city-latino-majority-population/story?id=115273609","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/294ceccb-a7c0-4479-9e84-1a8eb478037e/trump-allentown-rally-gty-lv-241029_1730246263698_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:16:04","author":"Kelsey Walsh,Lalee Ibssa","authors":["Kelsey Walsh","Lalee Ibssa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":261593850,"title":"Harris to call Trump ‘unstable’ and ‘obsessed with revenge’ in DC closing speech","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris will warn Americans that Donald Trump is “unstable,” “obsessed with revenge,” and not at all focused on their needs when she delivers a major address in Washington in view of the White House on Tuesday evening.\n\nAccording to excerpts released by her campaign, Harris will also tell the American people that Trump is “consumed with grievance” and “out for unchecked power”, and claim that he would use to punish his perceived enemies and reward friends if returned to the Oval Office for a second four-year term. \n\n“He has an Enemies List of people he intends to prosecute. He says one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th,” Harris will say. \n\nShe will also remind supporters that Trump “intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him,” and has called people who don’t support him “the enemy within.”\n\n“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she will say.\n\nAccording to Harris campaign officials, the vice president’s speech will lay out her “closing argument” in this election and will include her calling on Americans to “turn the page” on nearly a decade of rancorous and divisive zero-sum politics that began when Trump announced his first campaign for the presidency in June 2015.\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, told reporters on a call early Tuesday that this evening would be “an optimistic and hopeful message” that is “really grounded in her belief in America” and targeted towards voters who still haven’t decided who to cast their ballot for this year.\n\n“We know a lot of these undecided voters. They’re exhausted. They’re certainly frustrated by the state of the partisanship and divided political system that really was defined under Donald Trump, his chaos, his lack of focus on real solutions about the things that the American people are concerned about, and that’s why we know tonight is really important,” she said.\n\nIn addition to calling out Trump’s instability, Vice President Harris is also set to contrast the ex-president’s focus on grievance with her comparatively positive plan for the country if she is allowed to assume the presidency next year.\n\nAccording to the excerpts released by her campaign, she will note that Trump has “spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other.”\n\n“That’s who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say: that’s not who we are,” Harris will say before saying that Trump only has “more chaos” and “more division” in mind for a second term and asking Americans for their vote while offering “a different path.”\n\nShe will also “pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better” because she is “looking to make progress” rather than “score political points,” and she will further pledge to “listen to experts” as well as “those who will be impacted by the decisions I make” and “people who disagree with [her].”\n\n“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self,” she will say.\n\nThe Ellipse, the historic location for the rally within sight of the White House’s South Lawn, was not chosen for its value in terms of electoral college votes. Washington, DC has never been a battleground and only has three electoral votes, which have always gone to Democrats.\n\nBut Harris campaign officials chose the location of the Ellipse because the White House backdrop will symbolize what a president can do for good when it comes to getting things done for Americans and uniting the country.\n\nO’Malley Dillon, who managed President Joe Biden’s victorious 2020 campaign against Trump, said the Ellipse is significant for two reasons.\n\nNot only does the White House visual “a reminder of the gravity of the job, how much a president can do for good and for bad, to shape the country and impact people’s lives” but the location will be a “stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump, and how he’s used his power for bad, really focusing on himself and spreading division and chaos and inciting a mob to try to maintain his own power and put himself over the country.”\n\nThe location Harris will speak from is the exact spot from which Trump delivered the infamous speech on January 6th, 2021 when he incited a mob of angry supporters to storm the US Capitol in hopes of stopping Congress from Joe Biden’s 2020 win.\n\n“It’s a place that certainly we believe helps crystallize the choice in this election between a candidate seeking unchecked power in Donald Trump and another that’s really offering real solutions to chart a new way forward,” O’Malley Dillon said.\n\nHarris and her aides hope the visual of Harris, talking about her positive vision for the country and common-sense plans in the same place where Trump urged on a riotous mob, will remind voters of why they are exhausted and frustrated by the state of politics in the age of Trump. They also hope it will help Harris harness the enthusiasm of voters who want to move forward and enter a new era of politics that is unburdened by the rancor of the Trump years.","summary":"In addition to calling out Trump’s instability, Vice President Harris contrasted the ex-president’s focus on grievance with her comparatively positive plan for the country","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-speech-ellipse-trump-dc-b2637795.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/29/19/AP24303001791288.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:14:33","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":261593906,"title":"Kamala Harris Calls for America to Reject Donald Trump on the Site Where He Stoked Jan. 6 Insurrection, Calls Him a ‘Petty Tyrant’ | Video","text":"Kamala Harris took to the Ellipse, just south of the White House, to deliver what her campaign called her closing argument against Donald Trump one week ahead of Election Day.\n\n“America was bo\n\nAmong numerous other arguments against her Republican rival, the former prosecutor pointed to the difference in how the parties approach immigration, just days after Trump and numerous others made anti-immigrant comments at his Madison Square Garden rally that drew widespread condemnation — including calls for UTA to dump comedian Tony Hinchcliffe after comments he made about Puerto Rico, Latinos more broadly and other minorities.\n\n“We know who Donald Trump is,” Harris said as she made her case. “He is the person who stood at this very spot, nearly four years ago, and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost. Americans died as a result of that attack.”\n\nShe went on to list more of the case that those opposing the Republican candidate have made against him throughout this presidential election cycle. That includes the idea that Trump is prioritizing his own interests ahead of those of the American people, as well as criticizing Trump having an enemy list and continuing to stoke fears of “the enemy within,” which Trump has said includes Democrats such as Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be this way,” Harris said. She called for unity, telling the crowd that it’s time to “stop pointing fingers” and to instead link arms.\n\n“It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,” Harris said, in a line that seemed a subtle reference to her own replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the ticket and the campaign instead turning around the anti-age arguments Republicans had championed to use against their own 78-year-old candidate.\n\n“I recognize this has not been a typical campaign. Even though I’ve had the honor of serving as your vice president for the last four years, I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am,” Harris said, before going on to lay out her own bio and her background working outside of Washington. That includes championing her work as a California prosecutor and fighting banks, predators who attacked women and children as well as criminal cartels.\n\nAs she drew a contrast with Trump, she pointed to the differences between 2020 and now. While the priority at the time was to get out of the depths of the Covid pandemic, Harris said that the priority now is to reduce costs, including underlining her plan to impose a federal ban on price gouging on groceries. She specifically went after Trump’s promises to impose tariffs and to cut taxes for the wealthy.\n\nEarlier, Harris opened her speech by making a straight appeal to the crowd and those watching around the country. “So listen: One week from today, you will have the chance to make a decision that directly impacts your life, the life of your family, and the future of this country we love,” Harris said. “And it will probably be the most important vote you ever cast.”\n\n“It is a choice about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American, or ruled by chaos and division,” Harris argued. “Many of you watching have probably already cast your ballots, but I know many others are still considering who to vote for, or whether you’ll vote at all.”\n\nHarris set up that she would go on to lay out the stakes of this election.\n\nThe event opened with a performance of the National Anthem, but with no introductory speaker for Harris — she stepped out on stage immediately following the performance to cheers from a raucous crowd.\n\nWhile Harris spoke from Washington D.C., Trump sought to pull attention by delivering his own speech at a swing state rally scheduled for a half hour after Harris’ speech was scheduled to start.\n\nWatch the live video of Kamala Harris’ closing argument speech here:\n\nMore to come…","summary":"The former prosecutor underlines that America is a nation of immigrants just days after her rival led a rally featuring numerous anti-immigrant comments by the candidate and his supporters\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris Calls for America to Reject Donald Trump on the Site Where He Stoked Jan. 6 Insurrection, Calls Him a &#8216;Petty Tyrant&#8217; | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/kamala-harris-closing-campaign-speech-immigrants-ellipse/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2181184404.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:14:31","author":"Mike Roe","authors":["Mike Roe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":261593966,"title":"Climate Change Driving 'Record Threats To Health': Report","text":"Climate change poses a growing threat to human health in a variety of record-breaking ways, a major report said Wednesday, the experts warning that \"wasted time has been paid in lives\".The new report was released as heatwaves, fires, hurricanes, droughts and floods have lashed the world during what is expected to surpass 2023 to become the hottest year on record.It also comes just weeks before the United Nations COP29 talks are held in Azerbaijan -- and days before a US election that could see climate change sceptic Donald Trump return to the White House. The eighth Lancet Countdown on health and climate change, developed by 122 experts including from UN agencies such as the World Health Organization, painted a dire picture of death and delay.Out of 15 indicators that the experts have been tracking over the last eight years, 10 have \"reached concerning new records,\" the report said.These included the increasing extreme weather events, elderly deaths from heat, spread of infectious diseases, and people going without food as droughts and floods hit crops.Lancet Countdown executive director Marina Romanello told AFP the report showed there are \"record threats to the health and survival of people in every country, to levels we have never seen before\".The number of over-65s who died from heat has risen by 167 percent since the 1990s, the report said. Rising temperatures have also increased the area where mosquitoes roam, taking deadly diseases with them.Last year saw a new record of over five million cases of dengue worldwide, the report noted.Around five percent of the world's tree cover was destroyed between 2016 and 2022, reducing Earth's capacity to capture the carbon dioxide humans are emitting.It also tracked how oil and gas companies -- as well as some governments and banks -- were \"fuelling the fire\" of climate change.Despite decades of warnings, global emissions of the main greenhouse gases rose again last year, the World Meteorological Organization said earlier this week.Large oil and gas companies, which have been posting record profits, have increased fossil fuel production since last year, the report said.Many countries also handed out fresh subsidies to fossil fuels to counteract soaring oil and gas prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.Fossil fuel subsidies amounted to $1.4 trillion in 2022, which is \"vastly more than any source of commitments to enable a transition to a healthier future,\" Romanello said.But there were also \"some very encouraging signs of progress,\" she added.For example, deaths from fossil fuel-related air pollution fell by nearly seven percent to 2.10 million from 2016 to 2021, mainly due to efforts to reduce pollution from burning coal, the report said.The share of clean renewables used to generate electricity nearly doubled over the same period to 10.5 percent, it added.And there are signs that climate negotiations are paying more attention to health, Romanello said, pointing to the COP talks and national climate plans to be submitted early next year.\"If action is not taken today, the future will be very dangerous,\" she warned.\"There is really no more time to waste -- I know we have been saying this for many years -- but what we are seeing is that the wasted time has been paid in lives.\"For people at home, Romanello advised a climate-friendly diet, travelling without burning dirty energy, ditching banks that invest in fossil fuels and voting for politicians promising greater action on global warming.","summary":"Climate change poses a growing threat to human health in a variety of record-breaking ways, a major report said Wednesday, the experts warning that \"wasted time has been paid in lives\".","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/climate-change-driving-record-threats-health-report-3748716","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4557699/worlds-biggest-greenhouse-gas-emitters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:12:23","author":"Daniel Lawler","authors":["Daniel Lawler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":261593522,"title":"Larry Hogan Won't Vote for Harris or Trump Amid Close Senate Race","text":"Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said on Tuesday that he will not be voting in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as he faces a tight Senate race in the state.\"I've decided that neither one of them has earned my vote,\" Hogan said, referring to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.He made the revelation during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer after Blitzer played an ad from Hogan's campaign featuring a split-ticket voter in Maryland.The woman in the ad said she would vote for Harris for president and Hogan, who is running as an anti-Trump Republican, for Senate.\"As you've said, you won't vote for Trump, right?\" Blitzer asked Hogan.\"Yes,\" Hogan replied.\"And in that ad, you seem to be promoting Kamala Harris as well,\" Blitzer said.\"No, actually, this is a woman who was a former chairman of the Democratic Women's Club in Montgomery County, and she's splitting her ticket,\" Hogan said.He went on to note that split-ticket voters are a big part of his coalition in the state.\"In Maryland, I've got to win most of the Republicans, most of the independents, where we're winning by 20 points, and about a third of the Democrats,\" Hogan said. \"And that's how I was elected governor twice and became only the second Republican in 248 years to be reelected.\"Blitzer continued pressing Hogan on his vote for president, saying: \"But you're not going to vote for Trump—are you going to vote for Kamala Harris?\"\"I've decided that neither one of them has earned my vote,\" Hogan replied. \"And I've never voted for anybody I didn't really believe in.\"Hogan, a former two-term Maryland governor, made headlines when he rebuked Trump during his first presidential term.When Trump said earlier this year that he would \"like to see\" Hogan win his Senate race, Hogan dismissed the former president's support, saying he had no interest in his endorsement.\"I didn't want to have it,\" he told a CNN affiliate in June. \"And I have no interest in it.\"Hogan is running against Democrat Angela Alsobrooks in an increasingly tight Senate race in a deep-blue state.But he's no stranger to uphill battles;

They married in 2019. \nThe proceedings were delayed by intense conflict with the two in regards to the custody agreements for their children, daughters Willa, four, and Delphine, two. \nBefore the breakdown of their marriage, Sophie, who hails from Northampton, and her ex-husband Joe, 35, had been living in America with their two daughters but was desperate to move back to the UK. \n\nSophie Turner has revealed the key reason she left the US amid her divorce with ex- husband Joe Jonas in a new tell-all interview \n\nThe Game Of Thrones star, 28, has given a rare insight into her rollercoaster year and touched upon homesickness and motherhood \n\nSophie, who hails from Northampton, and her ex-husband Joe, had been living in America with their children prior to their divorce (pictured in 2022)\nLifting the lid on the homesickness she felt, the Joan star said: 'Every city we ended up in, the first thing I’d do was find a British shop and stock up on a month’s worth of chocolate...\nBut Sophie revealed gun violence in the US was the key motivator to her wanting to return home. \nShe continued: 'The gun violence, Roe v Wade being overturned... Everything just kind of piled on.'\nIn June 2022, America's top court overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling which had guaranteed women the right to an abortion up until the point of fetal viability, which is about 24 weeks.\nSince moving back to the UK, Sophie has found success not only in her career with the drama Joan, but also in her personal life, moving on with aristocrat Peregrine Pearson. \nOf her return she said: 'I’m so happy to be back. It felt as if my life was on pause until I returned to England. \n'I just never really feel like myself when I’m not in London, with my friends and family. I was away for so long – six years – and it was when my friends were getting engaged, and when I got pregnant. \n'I went for dinner with someone the other day, and she said, \"I never got to touch your belly.\" We didn’t have those key experiences with each other.'\n\nThe actress cut a racy figure as she showcased her legs in a sheer black and white polka dot gown\n\nShe wore her blonde tresses in voluminous bouncy curls for the photoshoot\n\nSophie went Instagram official with her boyfriend, aristocrat Peregrine Pearson, in September, delighting fans\nIn the new photoshoot, Sophie put on a glamorous display in a black and white statement blazer, going braless underneath for her cover image.\nOther snaps saw the actress cut a racy figure as she showcased her legs in a sheer black and white polka dot gown.\nShe wore her blonde tresses in voluminous bouncy curls, before slipping into a smarter outfit - a floaty white shirt teamed with a stylish wide-rim fedora hat.\nSophie's character in Joan is a single mother trying to provide for her children in the new six-part crime series and the actress reflected on her own experience, admitting it has 'changed her so much in every way'.\nShe explained: 'Before I had kids, I was very depressed and anxious, and I would isolate [myself] a lot. Now, I think I live my life for them. I want them to see me having a social life and enjoying work and thriving in my career and relationships. \n'I want them to see a hard-working mum. I’ll come back and say, \"This is why Mummy was away – it’s because she's doing this for you, so Father Christmas can come with a big bundle of presents.\"' \nSophie has had a busy few months and most recently portrayed the real-life Joan 'The Godmother' Hannington, now 68, in her six-part ITV crime series Joan.\nShe will receive her Harper's Bazaar gong at the awards ceremony on November 5, held in partnership with The Platinum Card By American Express. \nOpening up on her leading role in Joan, Sophie told the publication: 'I'd never led a TV show before, and I feel as if it’s far more challenging than a big movie like X-Men. \n'There are so many people behind that, so many opinions. They make all the decisions, and you just kind of say, “Yes, OK, whatever needs to be done.” \n'Whereas with Joan, I had so much say in it, and it was so collaborative... It feels like I'm releasing something that’s very near and dear to my heart.'\nSophie catapulted to fame in 2011 when she stepped into the role of Sansa Stark on Game Of Thrones.\n\nSophie later slipped into a few smarter outfits - one being a floaty white shirt teamed with a stylish wide-rim fedora hat\n\nShe explained: 'Before I had kids, I was very depressed and anxious, and I would isolate [myself] a lot. Now, I think I live my life for them'\n\nSophie admitted that she became 'swept away' by emotion as she filmed ITV's Joan, after kickstarting work on the series during her divorce from Joe \n\n Sophie Turner's performance in 'brilliant' ITV drama Joan hailed as 'incredible' \nShe remained on the show throughout its entirety, spending more a decade on screen in the role.\nThe actress explained she auditioned while she was still at school and her entire year group gave it a try. \nShe admitted: 'I don’t know how it happened, because my audition tape was absolutely horrific. But, somehow, they ended up casting me.'\n'I went from 13 to 23 on that show – it was my whole childhood. We’re all still on a massive group chat, and we try and meet each other whenever we’re in the same country... they’re family.\n'At that age, all I knew was I wanted to act. I didn’t even think about my weight or how I looked, it was just, \"This is fun, I get to play every day.\"\nCommenting on the difficult side of finding fame at such an early age, Sophie added: 'I learnt far too young what I'm supposed to look like, and how I’m supposed to behave.\n'I think that’s how child stars end up being so messed up, because they’re not allowed to make mistakes, and therefore they're not allowed to grow...'\n\nSophie catapulted to fame in 2011 when she stepped into the role of Sansa Stark on Game Of Thrones\n\nThe Game Of Thrones star appeared smitten as she shared a sweet album to Instagram to wish her partner a happy birthday - just weeks after her divorce was finalised \nSophie recently went Instagram official with her boyfriend, aristocrat Peregrine Pearson, delighting fans. \nOn Sunday, she shared a picture of the pair kissing under a tent alongside others showing them codied up together on a canal boat, posing on a hot air balloon and skiing.\nOther shots show her fixing his tie at a party and sitting on his lap with a bottle of beer in hand.\n‘Happy Birthday my angel pie, 30, flirty and thriving,’ she captioned the post.\n\nThe December/January issue of Harper's Bazaar UK is on sale from 6 November \nOn her new role as mother Joan, Sophie said: 'She is so funny but she has gone through so much trauma and is so ambitious.\n'There really is so much to her – mother, lover, liar, thief. It's just remarkable that it's all a true story.'\nThe drama follows Joan as she escapes her violent husband but has to place her daughter into care as she gets back on her feet.\nWith no money and nowhere to live, she manages to secure a job in a jeweller's, from where she steals her first diamonds.\nHer life takes a turn for the better when she meets antiques dealer Boisie, played by Harry Potter actor Frank Dillane, who takes her on as a partner in crime.\nJoan is available on ITVX. \nThe December/January issue of Harper's Bazaar UK is on sale from 6 November.\nLondonGame of ThronesITVJoe Jonas\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSophie Turner reveals the key reason why she left the US amid her divorce with ex husband Joe Jonas as she discusses her rollercoaster year in tell-all interview: 'My life was on pause'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nChanning Tatum and Zoe Kravitz SPLIT after 3 years as they call off engagement\n\n'My life was on pause': Sophie Turner reveals the key reason why she left the US amid her divorce with ex husband Joe Jonas \n\nHeartbroken Great British Bake Off viewers insist the 'wrong person' has been sent home and say they won't be tuning in next week \n\nLucy Watson jokes she 'has a whole new face' eight years after starring on Made in Chelsea as she reveals if she will ever let her son watch her on TV\n\nStrictly's JB Gill departs rehearsals with new partner Lauren Oakley after Amy Dowden was forced to pull out of show following health scare\n\nBag an Iceland city break for a bargain price!

Trump In Her Closing Argument Speech Today","text":"Kamala Harris will blast Donald Trump as unstable and obsessed with revenge as she gives her closing election arguments Tuesday at the spot where her rival rallied supporters before the deadly 2021 US Capitol attack.The Democrat's speech outside the White House comes as Republican Trump brushed off a racism-tainted New York rally as a \"love fest\" and insisted that it was Harris who was spreading hate and division.Vice President Harris, 60, and former president Trump, 78, are in a dead heat with exactly one week to go until Election Day, in the closest and most volatile race for the US presidency in modern times.More than 50 million people have already cast their ballots early or by mail, figures showed on Tuesday -- already nearly a third of the total number of voters four years ago.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Harris was to pledge to be a \"president for all Americans,\" contrasting herself with Trump, whom she accused of wanting to jail his enemies and to use the US military against political opponents.\"This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power,\" Harris was to tell supporters in Washington, according to excerpts released by her campaign.\"But America, I am here tonight to say: that's not who we are.\"Police said more than 50,000 people were expected to attend her rally on the Ellipse, the park where Trump delivered a fiery speech in which he ramped up his false claims that he won the 2020 election.Trump supporters then marched on the Capitol to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, in an assault that left 140 police officers wounded and brought the country to the brink of chaos.- 'Freedom' -Some Harris supporters queued for more than seven hours before her speech on a stage flanked by huge blue signs saying \"Freedom.\"Student Ethan Glucroft, 21, said the choice of venue was \"definitely in the shadow of the insurrection on January 6.\"\"Tonight, this is about hopes, freedom,\" Glucroft told AFP.Trump tried to take the sting out of Harris's speech with a campaign event of his own, in front of a room of supporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.His remarks came as he was seeking to tamp down the firestorm over his weekend rally in New York's famed Madison Square Garden, at which a warm-up comedian called Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\"His campaign has tried to distance him from the remarks, with Trump already on the defensive over accusations by his former White House chief of staff that he would rule as a \"fascist\" dictator.Trump said the New York event was a \"love fest,\" the same phrase he used to describe the Capitol riot, and lashed out at Harris.\"Her message has been a message of hate and division,\" said Trump.- J-Lo on the trail -The Republican later rallied in blue-collar Allentown, in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most crucial of the seven battleground states that are expected to decide the election -- and a city that is home to a large Puerto Rican community.Fears of a repeat of the chaos from four years ago hang heavy over this year's election, with Trump repeatedly indicating that he might again refuse to accept the result if he loses.On Tuesday, Trump seized on reports of Pennsylvania authorities halting hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration forms.\"Really bad 'stuff.' WHAT IS GOING ON IN PENNSYLVANIA???\" he said on the social network X, formerly Twitter.Trump has survived two assassination attempts, while Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket following his shock exit from the White House race in July.The last days of the campaign will see both candidates on a grueling final swing through the battlegrounds.Actor and singer Jennifer Lopez was to join Harris in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Thursday, her campaign announced, in a bid to reach out to young and Latino voters.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Kamala Harris will blast Donald Trump as unstable and obsessed with revenge as she gives her closing election arguments Tuesday at the spot where her rival rallied supporters before the deadly 2021 US...","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-slam-unstable-trump-in-her-closing-argument-speech-today-6904335","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-10/dkob4plg_kamala-harris-reuters_625x300_19_October_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:07:58","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":261593232,"title":"Map Shows Locations Where Ballot Boxes Have Been Set on Fire","text":"Over the past week, two ballot drop boxes and one USPS mailbox have been torched in three separate incidents in Arizona, Oregon and Washington.Early on October 28, arson attacks targeted two ballot drop boxes situated in Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. This followed an incident on October 24 when a free-standing mailbox at a U.S. Postal Office in Phoenix, Arizona, was set on fire.The attacks come at a time of heightened tensions ahead of the 2024 presidential election on November 5 and follow on from the contested 2020 presidential poll.Donald Trump is continuing to insist the 2020 contest was rigged against him, though this has been repeatedly dismissed in the courts and by independent election experts.\nOver the past few months, Trump has targeted mail-in voting in particular with unsubstantiated allegations of vote rigging, branding it \"corrupt\" during events in Michigan and Pennsylvania. However, Trump's team has also encouraged his supporters to vote early, and earlier this month called for some restrictions on early voting and absentee ballots to be lifted in areas of North Carolina badly hit by Hurricane Helene.Newsweek has provided a summary of the attacks below along with a map showing their locations, with the Washington and Oregon incidents appearing as one circle due to their close proximity.Pheonix, ArizonaThe Phoenix Police Department said it was called shortly after 1:00 a.m. local time on October 24 to a mailbox that had been set on fire at 3900 North 7th Avenue.Together with the Phoenix Fire Department's Arson Investigation Taskforce police investigated the blaze, securing the scene and studying relevant CCTV footage.Police later arrested 35-year-old Dieter Klofkorn in relation to the incident. According to a statement released by Phoenix police Klofkorn \"admitted to committing the arson\" but denied his actions were politically motivated, saying he wanted to be arrested. The suspect was booked into jail \"on one felony count of Arson of Property.\"Initially, Phoenix police said 20 ballots had been damaged in the blaze, though Arizona's Secretary of State's Office later reduced this figure to five, according to ABC News.Responding to the incident on X Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said: \"There is zero tolerance for criminal activity in our community, and we are working collaboratively with every level of government to bring the perpetrator to justice.\"Portland, OregonAt around 3:30 a.m. local time on Monday, the Portland Police Bureau was alerted to a fire at a Multnomah County ballot box situated in the 1000 block of S.E. Morrison Street.In a statement, Multnomah County said the fire was caused by an \"incendiary device\" and that it was being investigated by the Police Bureau's Explosive Disposal Unit.Multnomah County said that fire suppressant protected most of the ballots, with only three being damaged. These three will be contacted \"via unique identifiers on their ballot envelopes\" so they can receive replacements.In a statement, Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade said: \"Make no mistake, an attack on a ballot box is an attack on our democracy and completely unacceptable. Whatever the motivation behind this incident, there is no justification for any attempt to disenfranchise voters.\"Vancouver, WashingtonJust hours after the Oregon incident, a ballot box was torched in Vancouver, Washington, a small town around 10 miles from Portland.The incident took place by Fisher's Landing Transit Center with officials saying the blaze began at around 4 a.m., destroying several hundred ballots.According to Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey, the box was fitted with a fire suppression system but unlike in Portland it \"doesn't appear it worked very well.\"At a press conference on Monday, police said they believe the Oregon and Washington arson attacks are connected, and noted they are \"very similar\" to a failed attempt to burn another Vancouver ballot drop box which occurred on October 8.In a statement, Washington Secretary of State Steven Hobbs, who is responsible for overseeing the state's elections, said: \"We take the safety of our election workers seriously and will not tolerate threats or acts of violence that seek to undermine the democratic process.\"Police said they are seeking a dark-colored Volvo S60, of model year 2001-2004, in connection with the Oregon and Washington attacks. Patrols have been stepped up around ballot box sites to deter further incidents.","summary":"Police have arrested a man in connection with the Arizona arson, and believe the Oregon and Washington attacks are linked.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-locations-where-ballot-boxes-have-been-set-fire-1976975","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2507306/ballot-boxes-voting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:05:09","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.594},{"id":261595720,"title":"FBI suspects China-linked hackers accessed officials’ call logs and SMS messages, report says","text":"Late last week, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed they were investigating “the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.” At the same time, The New York Times reported that phones used by Donald Trump, JD Vance and Kamala Harris’ campaign staff were among the targets, though it was unclear what data the group may have been able to access.\n\nNow, The New York Times has new details about the extent of the hack, which is reportedly linked to a Chinese group known as “Salt Typhoon.” According to The Times, aides to President Joe Biden, as well as Trump’s family members were also targeted, in addition to diplomats and other government officials.

The Conference Board report showed that recession fears fell sharply in October, with the perceived likelihood of a contraction over the coming year dropping to a record low.\n\n“The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months dropped to its lowest level since the question was first asked in July 2022, as did the percentage of consumers believing the economy was already in recession,” Peterson said.\n\nForward-looking assessments also generally improved. A measure of consumers’ short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions jumped to 89.1 in October, higher than the threshold of 80 that typically signals an incoming economic downturn.\n\nAlso, consumers’ intentions to buy homes and new cars increased, as did plans to dine out, stay in hotels, and enjoy entertainment outside the home.\n\n“Compared to last month, consumers were substantially more optimistic about future business conditions and remained positive about future income,“ Peterson said. ”Also, for the first time since July 2023, they showed some cautious optimism about future job availability.”\n\nHowever, despite the uptick in consumer optimism about employment, a new government report released on Oct. 29 shows that more employers have put their hiring plans on hold—and workers are hanging onto their jobs.\n\nInflation fears persist among consumers, however, with The Conference Board report indicating that mentions of high prices and inflation continued to top write-in responses in October.\n\nEven though inflation has slowed considerably from its peak of 9 percent in June 2022, consumers’ expectations for inflation one year ahead rose to 5.3 percent from 5.2 percent in the prior month.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September, citing falling inflation and a growing risk that high rates could damage the economy. Some business leaders have expressed concern about the persistence or possible revival of inflationary pressures.\n\nMorgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said during an Oct. 29 panel of finance CEOs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that the era of near-zero interest rates and ultra-low inflation “is over,” predicting that central banks would hold rates at higher levels than many people expect.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed a similar view, saying that he believes the level of “embedded” inflation has become greater than ever and that government policies continue to fan the inflationary flames.\n\n“Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary and with that being said, I think we’re not going to see interest rates as low as people are forecasting,” Fink said.\n\nWhere inflation goes post-election is unclear, with both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris expressing support for policies to boost growth, which some economists believe have the potential to be inflationary.","summary":"Sentiment strengthened in October, buoyed by brighter labor market expectations and renewed optimism about the direction of the economy post-election.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/consumer-confidence-surges-ahead-of-election-5749972","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/06/id5719102-GettyImages-2166779968-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:03:24","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":261594650,"title":"Kamala Harris Washington Ellipse rally: Vice president reminds voters of Capitol riots","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has reminded voters of the atrocities and violence of the January 6 Capitol riots, holding a rally in the exact location where then-President Donald Trump first encouraged a mob.\n\nMs Harris stepped out in front of 20,000 Americans at the Ellipse, a park near the White House where on January 6, 2021, then-President Donald Trump urged supporters to “fight like hell” and march to the US Capitol, where congressmen were certifying his loss.\n\n“We know who Donald Trump is,” Ms Harris said.\n\n“He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.\n\n“An election that he knew he lost.\n\n“Americans died as a result of that attack.”\n\n“America this is not a candidate who is thinking about how to make your life better.”\n\n“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power.\n\nThe vice president acknowledged that this has not been a normal campaign.\n\nMs Harris spoke about the “honour” of working with US President Joe Biden but wanted to explain what kind of president she would be.\n\n“I’ll be honest with you, I’m not perfect. I make mistakes, but here’s what I promise you,” she said.\n\n“I will always listen to you. Even if you don’t vote for me.\n\n“I will always tell you the truth, even if it is hard to hear.”\n\nHarris then pointed to The White House behind her, saying: “In less than 90 days either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office”.\n\nThe Democratic crowd erupted chanting “Kamala”.\n\nMs Harris continued to paint the picture of two different versions of America that hinge on the result of the election.\n\n“On day one, if elected, Donald Trump will walk into the Oval Office with an enemy list,” Ms Harris said.\n\n“I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities of what I will get done for the American people.”\n\nMs Harris worked her way through a list of issues from cost of living, home ownership, reproductive rights and immigration.\n\nThe vice president said her “presidency will be different” than Mr Biden’s.\n\n“We have different priorities now,” she said.\n\nSpeaking about national defence, Ms Harris is preparing to be “lethal”.\n\n“As commander in chief, I will ensure we have the most powerful and lethal force in the world,” MS Harris said.\n\n“I will strengthen, not surrender, America’s global leadership.“\n\nThe crowd appeared to react more positively to a stronger version of Ms Harris at the rally compared to recent events.\n\nHarris chooses Capitol Riot birthplace for rally \n\nFour people died in the ensuing riot, and one police officer who defended the Capitol died the following day. Mr Trump has said, if he is re-elected, he will pardon the more than 1500 participants who have been charged with crimes.\n\nAhead of the rally being held on Tuesday local time, Mr Trump falsely said Democrats had staged a “coup” to force Mr Biden to drop his re-election bid.\n\nAt an event at his Florida estate one week before the November 5 election, Mr Trump said Ms Harris would be too dangerous to serve as president, pointing to foreign wars and high levels of immigration that have occurred during her tenure as vice president.\n\nHis accusation that Democrats had unfairly forced Mr Biden out of the race recalled Mr Trump’s false claims that he had lost the 2020 election due to fraud.\n\n“They stole the presidency of the United States. You can call it a coup, you can call it whatever. But they stole it,” he told supporters.\n\n“The way they took that away from him was not right.”\n\nMr Biden, 81, abandoned his re-election bid in July after weeks of pressure from fellow Democrats who worried he was too old for a rematch with Mr Trump, 78.\n\nCrowds flooded to the park almost five hours ahead of Ms Harris’ speech.\n\nHer lead over Mr Trump has dwindled in the final weeks of the campaign to a single percentage point, and she now leads 44 per cent to 43 per cent among registered voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.\n\nMs Harris has led Mr Trump in every Reuters/Ipsos poll since she entered the race in July, but her advantage has steadily shrunk since late September.\n\nThroughout her campaign, Ms Harris has tried to paint Mr Trump as a threat to democracy who will infringe on the rights of Americans, including on the reproductive rights of women.\n\nFor his part, Mr Trump has sought to tie Ms Harris to Biden’s handling of the economy - a top issue for voters, and one which voters have consistently given him an edge.\n\nHigh prices of food, utilities and housing have roiled voters, though the US economy has outperformed the rest of the developed world since the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nMr Trump has also made his opposition to illegal immigration a central theme of his bid.\n\nAt his event on Tuesday, which started over an hour late, he played a video highlighting a 12-year-old girl who was killed in Houston, allegedly by two Venezuelan men in the US illegally.\n\n“In less than four years Kamala Harris has obliterated our borders,” he said.\n\nMr Trump is due later in the day to visit a heavily Hispanic city in Pennsylvania, two days after his rally in New York drew outrage because of an ally’s vulgar and racist remarks.\n\nComedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who opened for Trump, called the Caribbean US territory of Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and disparaged black Americans, Jewish people and Latinos.\n\n- With Reuters","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has reminded voters of the atrocities and violence of the January 6 Capitol riots, holding a rally in the exact location where then-President Donald Trump first encouraged a mob. ","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/us-election/kamala-harris-washington-ellipse-rally-vice-president-reminds-voters-of-capitol-riots--c-16572991","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16572991/7f3c1497a0451201334a49323c9c14d944a4aeb4-16x9-x0y529w5086h2861.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:02:00","author":"Max Corstorphan","authors":["Max Corstorphan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":261593404,"title":"Trump's Next Favorite Child, As Per Body Language Reader—Now That Ivanka Has Backed Out of Politics","text":"Donald Trump appears to have chosen a favorite child after his eldest daughter Ivanka Trump stepped away from politics. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner were Donald's senior advisors during his tenure as the President of the United States. Ivanka was also the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship. Her absence has now left a void for the real estate mogul to fill, and it seems like Barron Trump could fit the bill.\n\nAccording to Irish Star, a body language reader, Judi James, shared, \"On his first run-up to the White House and for most of the time as President, it was Ivanka who was looking like the chosen one, with her husband Jared very much up there as main support and ambassador.\" Notably, Ivanka was always in the picture next to her dad so much so that it was assumed she would be the next political figure in the Trump family. But in 2022, she confirmed that she wouldn't make a comeback in Donald's team if he wins the upcoming presidential election. Taking a cue from it, James claimed to know who had now grabbed the ex-president's attention.\n\nJames shared that Barron fits the future void of the Trump dynasty perfectly. \"Barron was always there but with Melania tending to use some very territorial rituals like hand or shoulder-holding to suggest it would not be a given that he would be sucked into his dad's firmament,\" James shared talking about the dynamics shared between Barron and Melania Trump.\n\nThe former FLOTUS has a strong bond with her son who is also nicknamed after his father: 'mini Donald.' Furthermore, if certain reports are to be believed, the youngest child of the businessman-turned-politician has turned out to be a confident young boy over the years. At present, Barron is pursuing management and finance at New York University. \n\nExplaining why she thinks Barron is the next favorite child, James elaborated, \"Trump's maxi-me (he's now inches taller than his father) is currently looking like the heir to the throne.\" Pointing out the GOP leader's affection for his youngest son, she added, \"Trump's admiration signals for his son are played out publicly and his potential as next-generation dynastic leader appears to be growing more obvious, making it look like it's down to his call and his mother's choice.\" \n\nEarlier this year, Donald had expressed his amusement over his son, Barron's height. According to Metro, during his victory speech in January 2024 for winning the Iowa Republican caucus by 51%, he thanked his mother-in-law Amalija Knavs. \"Boy, did she take care of Barron? That’s how he got so tall – he only ate her food,\" Donald said as his words drew laughter from the crowd.","summary":"Ivanka Trump was the director of the Office of Economic Initiatives and Entrepreneurship when Donald Trump was the POTUS.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-next-favorite-child-as-per-body-language-reader-now-that-ivanka-has-backed-out-of-politics","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/721749/uploads/0e69f430-92b7-11ef-9e55-e5d075a545c8_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-30 00:00:00","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.317},{"id":261593458,"title":"Which way North Carolina voters are trending in 2024","text":"Which way North Carolina voters are trending in 2024\n Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are appealing to voters in crucial battleground states ahead of the November election.

Several of these profiles – which say they are not connected to official campaigns – have been contacted by US politicians, including congressional candidates, looking for supportive posts.\n\nOn 9 October, X changed its rules so the payments made to eligible accounts with a significant reach are calculated according to the amount of engagement from premium users – likes, shares and comments – rather than the number of ads under their posts.\n\nMany social media sites allow users to make money from their posts or to share sponsored content. But they often have rules which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way.\n\nWhile X has a smaller user base than some sites, it has a significant impact on political discourse. It raises questions about whether X is incentivising users to post provocative claims, whether they’re true or not, at a highly sensitive moment for US politics.\n\nThe BBC compared the approximate earnings reported by some of these X users with the amount they would be expected to earn, based on their number of views, followers and interactions with other profiles, and found them to be credible.\n\nAmong the misleading posts shared by some of these networks of profiles were claims about election fraud which had been rebutted by authorities, and extreme, unfounded allegations of paedophilia and sexual abuse against the presidential and vice-presidential candidates.\n\nSome misleading and false posts that originated on X have also spilled on to other social media sites with a bigger audience, such as Facebook and TikTok.\n\nIn one example, an X user with a small following says he created a doctored image purporting to show Kamala Harris working at McDonald’s as a young woman. Other users then pushed evidence-free claims that the Democratic Party was manipulating images of its candidate.\n\nUnfounded conspiracy theories from X about the July assassination attempt on Donald Trump were also picked up on other social media sites.\n\nX did not respond to questions about whether the site is incentivising users to post like this, nor to requests to interview owner Elon Musk.","summary":"BBC Some users on X who spend their days sharing content that includes election misinformation, AI-generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories say they are being paid &#8220;thousands of dollars&#8221; by the social media site.

Trump has made it clear, time and again, what he thinks of us, and the possibility of him and his administration returning to power is truly worrying. Words carry weight, and as a community, we must not tolerate language that seeks to devalue us. Latinos, inside and outside our homeland, deserve respect and fair representation.”\n\n Omar isn’t the only artist with Puerto Rican ties who have spoken out since Hinchcliffe made his racist comments: Bad Bunny endorsed Harris on Sunday, while Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin doubled down on their support of the Democratic nominee yesterday.\n\n “This is what they think of us,” Martin wrote, sharing the video of Hinchcliffe speaking. Lopez, meanwhile, shared several slides from Harris’ campaign. For his endorsement, Bad Bunny shared a video of Harris outlining her plans to give Puerto Rico more economic opportunities.\n\n “It’s time to turn the page,” Omar wrote in his endorsement, invoking one of the Harris campaign’s phrases about moving on from Trump. “We are not going back.”","summary":"\"Trump has made it clear, time and again, what he thinks of us,\" the Puerto Rican artist writes, days after racist remarks about the country were made at a Trump rally in New York","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/don-omar-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-1235146859/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/don-omar-endorses-kamala-harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-29 23:57:05","author":"Ethan Millman","authors":["Ethan Millman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06}]}
