Europe, he opined, has found a new identity and is moving away from the reigning power, the US and found a convenient expansion of NATO, provoking Russian President Putin into Ukraine. The Hamas attack on Israel, far away from Ukraine shifted the spotlight to the Middle East and there was also the possibility of China having provoked Iran into launching an attack on Israel, he added.Lt Gen Surinder Singh, former GOC-in-C, Western Command, said there was no reason to clearly lay out security plans and aims in the public domain in today’s volatile global security architecture.He said India needs better coordination amongst all its security agencies to tackle emergent threats in an efficient manner. Stating that our responses in a critical situation are narrowing down each time despite spending huge sums on the security set up, he stressed upon the need to audit our security measures and take corrective steps, if required.Laying out the role of the civil services in ensuring overall defence stability of a nation, former Punjab Special Chief Secretary KBS Sidhu, raised the question of whether a democratic set up like India is a hindrance to having a national security policy as China, Pakistan or some other democratic countries have.He called for cohesion amongst different arms of the security establishment to avert the tendency of monopolising intelligence sharing, and said that India needs to make itself more resilient by ramping up the security infrastructure.In a session on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, Lt Gen KJ Singh, Lt Gen IS Singha and Air Marshal Anil Chopra discussed the historical linkages between these geographical areas and highlighted the existing security challenges along these routes and future prospects and trade benefits.Emerging alliances can reshape world order: TewariRussia–Ukraine has thrown up several alliances that have the potential to reshape the post-Cold War world order, which has very serious implications for India, Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, Manish Tewari said during a session on the implication of the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea (CRINK) axis at the Military Literature Festival here.He pointed out that Russia and China signed an agreement in 2022 to transform their bilateral relations. Russia also has long standing relations with North Korea, which has sent troops to fight against Ukraine. North Korea has good relations with China, which in turn is close to Pakistan. Russia also has good relations with Iran and courting Pakistan. All these countries are nuclear powers or close to becoming one, making the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty questionable.He added that with Russia, with whom India has had historic defence relations, getting weakened due to its war economy and Donald Trump coming into power in the US creating uncertainty over American policy, India is really on its own.Maj Gen Mandeep Singh (retd), a strategic analyst, said that CRINK carries a lot of weight by virtue of being nuclear powers, oil produces and large economies. With China having a significant influence in South America and Africa, there is a sway towards CRINK by some countries.Trade corridorsIn a session on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, Lt Gen KJ Singh, Lt Gen IS Singha and Air Marshal Anil Chopra discussed the historical linkages between these geographical areas and highlighted the existing security challenges along these routes and future prospects and trade benefits.Another session focused on turbulence in Bangladesh and Myanmar and its impact on security in the North-East, where the role of insurgent groups and ethnic issues was discussed.","url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/defence/muddy-waters-of-geopolitics-require-dynamic-approach-2/","image":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9tZWRpYThjNTU1MDgwLWFmODQtMTFlZi1iNzgzLTI3YTljZjkzNmFhMy5qcGc=","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 01:35:31","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.174},{"id":269313884,"title":"Donald Trump Warns Brics Nations Says They Will Face 100 Per Cent Tariffs If 2826458","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump warned the BRICS nations including India of imposing 100 per cent tariffs.

It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him.\n\nPatel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Patel could be confirmed, even by a Republican-led Senate, though Trump has also raised the prospect of using recess appointments to push his selections through.\n\nPatel would replace Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 but quickly fell out of favor with the president and his allies. Though the position carries a 10-year term, Wray’s removal was not unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, including after a search of his Florida’s property for classified documents and two investigations that resulted in his indictment.\n\nPatel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats.\n\nHe’s called for dramatically reducing the FBI’s footprint, a perspective that dramatically sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau’s headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump’s pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAnd though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters’ phone records during leak investigation, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists.\n\nDuring an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.”\n\n“We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”\n\nThe child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, Patel spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration’s attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nTrump also announced Saturday that he will nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\n“As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social announcing the pick.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-11-30/trump-names-kash-patel-fbi-director-16017440.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/9ux1oc-ap24335863862915.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP24335863862915.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 01:34:30","author":"Eric Tucker","authors":["Eric Tucker"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":269313960,"title":"Donald Trump Picks Indian-American Kash Patel As New FBI Director","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump has announced Indian-American Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel, his loyalist, as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, describing him as an “America First fighter”.\n“I am proud to announce that Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel will serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” Trump posted on Saturday night on Truth Social.\n“Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American People,” he wrote.\n(This is a breaking story… More details to follow…)","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/donald-trump-picks-indian-american-kash-patel-as-new-fbi-director-9141160.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/07/1627642197_news18_breaking_news-1600x900.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 01:33:19","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.617},{"id":269313936,"title":"US wine merchants urge exclusions from blanket tariffs","text":"As President-elect Donald Trump vows sweeping tariffs on even America's close partners once in office, US wine merchants and restaurateurs are watching with trepidation -- and pushing for exclusions they say will protect small businesses.\n\n\"A lot of our concern is that he could flip the switch on EU tariffs. They were suspended, but not eliminated,\" said chef DeWayne Schaaf, owner of Celebrations Restaurant in Missouri.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump threatened blanket tariffs of at least 10 percent on all imports, but the shadow of even higher levies from US-Europe disputes during his first term hangs over businesses.\n\nEither scenario would likely thin their profits and force them to raise prices.\n\nIn 2019, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on popular European food, drinks and other products as Washington and Brussels clashed over European Union subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus.\n\n\"We were absolutely shocked,\" US Wine Trade Alliance president Ben Aneff told AFP.\n\nThe tariffs were suspended after President Joe Biden and the EU in 2021 reached a five-year truce.\n\nEU Ambassador to the US Jovita Neliupsiene told reporters this month that she did not see interest from the bloc in threatening this truce, and that its future is very much in the US's hands.\n\nNow, US wine traders and restaurant owners are waiting with bated breath for Trump's new plans.\n\n\"We hope that there would be exclusions for products that are especially important to American small businesses,\" Aneff said.\n\n 'Crippling' \n\nBusinesses say a 10 percent universal tariff could be absorbed by industries initially, but would eventually increase consumer prices and weigh heavily on smaller establishments, including many restaurants.\n\nIf across-the-board tariffs on imports were imposed over a long period, Schaaf anticipates having to cut staff hours, pull back on wine offerings, or reduce business hours.\n\nShould Washington reintroduce 25 percent levies on European food and wines, the situation would be \"crippling to many, myself included,\" added the chef, who employs two dozen staff.\n\nNoah Bush, proprietor of GB Provisions in Oklahoma, told AFP: \"Eventually, in order to stay open, those tariffs are going to have to move on to the guests.\"\n\nFor now, he said he would stock up on European wines.\n\nSchaaf said one of his business partners bought 10 containers of wine in anticipation of Trump's possible tariffs -- hoping to get them to US shores before new levies hit.\n\n\"Wine and alcohol are big, big moneymakers in the restaurant business,\" Bush said.\n\nDue to 2019 tariffs, he lost some 10 percent in European wine sales and reduced staff hours to sustain operations.\n\nSchaaf said restaurants like his had no involvement in the trade dispute that triggered duties -- \"yet we were the ones who bore the brunt.\"\n\n 'Ineffective' \n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump took aim at US-EU trade imbalances, particularly in autos and agriculture.\n\n\"They don't take our cars. They don't take our farm products. They sell millions and millions of cars in the United States,\" he said, warning that the bloc would \"have to pay a big price.\"\n\nAnalysts expect the eurozone would be hit hard if Trump followed through on sweeping tariff hikes.\n\nAneff, who is also managing partner of retailer Tribeca Wine Merchants, argues that targeting imported wine would be an \"incredibly ineffective way\" to remedy trade with Europe.\n\nHe said tariffs on wine imports do more harm to US firms, impacting profits along the import and distribution supply chains.\n\nAnd there is \"zero possibility that producers in Europe would offset tariffs\" by lowering prices, he added.\n\nDartmouth College economics professor Douglas Irwin said US president Richard Nixon imposed a 10 percent across-the-board tariff in the 1970s, but it caused little disruption as Japan and Europe were willing to negotiate and did not retaliate.\n\nThis may not be the case for Trump, he added.

The United States and Canada are working to close their doors to Chinese EVs and the European Union recently levied additional tariffs of up to 35 per cent.\nAmid continuing negotiations, the EU has proposed that Chinese EV makers commit to a minimum export price, or price undertaking, in exchange for the EU dropping the countervailing duties. This is reminiscent of the 1980s US-Japan trade war, when the US demanded that the Japanese car industry commit to voluntary export restraints – which the World Trade Organization prohibits.\nRather than a subsidy-induced overcapacity, the success of Chinese EVs is, at its core, due to science and technological advancements. Having learned lessons from the US, China has chosen the challenging path of independent innovation over convenient short cuts such as tech imports and forced technology transfers. For companies like Huawei Technologies that bore the brunt of the US tech war, that determination has hardened.\nChina’s success is also thanks to its entrepreneurship. Over a decade ago, the West initiated a ruthless battle against Chinese solar panel imports, levying anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties. It turned out to be counterproductive, forcing Chinese enterprises to intensify innovation and rise from the ashes, while killing the West’s ailing solar panel industry.\n\nChina’s renewable energy sector is dominated by spirited private companies such as Trina Solar, an innovative solar panel manufacturer, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which makes lithium-ion batteries for EVs, and BYD, a global leader in EVs, hybrid cars and car batteries. Their products help the global decarbonisation movement.\nWhen advances in science and technology lead to greater productivity, it produces overcapacity in any market, even if only temporarily. For example, America’s rapid technological development in the 1920s led to a market oversupply, depressing goods prices and driving many farmers and enterprises into bankruptcy. In the last several years, China’s EV market has also seen fierce competition as a result of rapid innovation, cutting the number of manufacturers from over 400 to around 40, with the number expected to shrink further.\nThe lesson of America’s Great Depression is that president Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to intervene robustly in the market with his New Deal, a set of plans that boosted infrastructure investment, employment and consumption, succeeded in driving up domestic demand and led to an economic recovery.\nSimilarly, China, after wrestling with deflation over the past two years, recently unveiled an unprecedented stimulus package, synergising the three pillars of fiscal, monetary and industrial policies. In particular, the 10 trillion yuan (US$1.38 trillion) debt swap scheme is committed to freeing up local governments’ fiscal space, enabling them to focus on economic growth and social welfare.\nI bought my first home in Beijing recently, more than 10 years after I earned a doctorate, seeing as how home prices are at a low and mortgage rates in decline. It is part of a residential community built almost 30 years ago, now under renovation with a budget of roughly 50,000 yuan per home, all subsidised by the government. With pavements, footbridges among other facilities coming under refurbishment, my neighbours have dubbed the project a “metropolitan upgrade”.\n\nWhen I went shopping for home appliances, I found refrigerators, washing machines, television sets, air conditioners and kitchen devices mostly offered at a discount of 20 per cent or so, depending on their energy efficiency rating. A supermarket saleswoman told me that of the 20 per cent discount, 8 per cent came from a government subsidy while the remaining 12 per cent came from a manufacturers’ subsidy.\nChina’s New Deal is quickly paying off, as October retail sales rose by 4.8 per cent year on year, industrial output by 5.3 per cent and EV production by 48.6 per cent, while the drop in home sales slowed down.\nMeanwhile, the Belt and Road Initiative continues to open up alternative markets, and China is committed to speeding this up. Last September, when I visited Uzbekistan, a local representative of BYD told me its joint venture in Samarkand has been able to produce 50,000 hybrid cars annually, starting last year.\nYang Yang, a classmate of mine and a successful businesswoman, who runs a car company based in Ghana for over 14 years, recently expanded sales into Chinese EVs. Trade and investment in China’s “new trio” of products are flourishing in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America, even as the West turns them down.\nGreat power rivalry is a regrettable reality but the trickling down of tech dividends to peoples in different corners of the world marks a new trend in globalisation. In Chinese parlance, it contributes to a community with a shared future for mankind.","summary":"China’s ‘new trio’ of EVs, lithium-ion batteries and solar panels represents the trickling down of tech dividends to people across the world.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3288259/world-tariff-threats-china-opts-share-green-tech-dividends","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/26/9ae29d87-af03-4616-aa07-d6c1dc91e567_07c3a44a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 01:30:07","author":"Gu Bin","authors":["Gu Bin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.237},{"id":269312466,"title":"Our Biggest Black Friday Sale Ever 74 Off Vip Membership N3797343","text":"With an unprecedented presidential election cycle finally over, there’s much to be thankful for. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is alive and in good health following two assassination attempts on his life.

I’d break that component out of it. I’d shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state,” Patel said in a September interview on the conservative Shawn Ryan Show.\n“And I’d take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You’re cops. Go be cops.”\n\nWith the nomination of Patel, Trump is signalling that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump, whose 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027.\nFBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms to insulate the bureau from politics.\nWray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump’s supporters’ anger. During Wray’s tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents and he has also faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, on Nov. 25 asked the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on Jan. 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.\nWray had previously signalled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nPatel, 44, who previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor, emerged as a controversial figure during Trump’s first term in the White House.\nHe was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans’ investigation into the FBI’s 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia during his stint as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.\nLater, during Trump’s first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned that Patel was secretly serving as a backchannel between Trump and Ukraine without authorisation.\nPatel denied those allegations.\nAfter Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records.

Wray will either need to be fired or resign in order for Patel to take the position. Patel is widely seen as a staunch Trump loyalist who will implement Trump’s desired reforms within the agency. During the first Trump administration, he served as senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council and later as the chief of staff for acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, from 2020-2021.

(AP) — President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100 per cent tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the US dollar.\n\nHis threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRIC alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTurkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members and several other countries have expressed interest in joining.\n\nWhile the US dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America’s dominance of the global financial system.\n\nThe dollar represents roughly 58 per cent of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars. The dollar’s dominance is threatened, however, with BRICS’ growing share of GDP and the alliance’s intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarization.\n\nTrump, in a Truth Social post, said: “We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.”\n\nTrump said there is “no chance” BRIC will replace the US dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen “should wave goodbye to America.”\n\nResearch shows that the US dollar’s role as the primary global reserve currency is not threatened in the near future.\n\nAn Atlantic Council model that assesses the dollar’s place as the primary global reserve currency states the dollar is “secure in the near and medium term” and continues to dominate other currencies.\n\nTrump’s latest tariff threat comes after he threatened to slap 25 per cent tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10 per cent tax on goods from China, as a way to force the countries to do more to halt the flow of illegal immigration and drugs into the US\n\nHe has since held a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who said Thursday she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted.

Go be cops. You're cops. Go be cops.\"\n\nWith the nomination of Patel, Trump is signalling that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump, whose 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027. \n\nFBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms, as a means of insulating the bureau from politics.\n\nWray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump's supporters' ire.\n\nDuring Wray's tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents and he has also faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, on Nov 25 asked the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on Jan 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nWray had previously signalled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n\nPatel, 44, who previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor, emerged as a controversial figure during Trump's first term in the White House.\n\nHe was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans' probe into the FBI's 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his stint as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.\n\nLater, during Trump's first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned that Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine without authorisation.\n\nPatel denied those allegations.\n\nAfter Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records.

It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him.\n\nPatel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Patel could be confirmed, even by a Republican-led Senate, though Trump has also raised the prospect of using recess appointments to push his selections through. \n\nPatel would replace Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 but quickly fell out of favor with the president and his allies. Though the position carries a 10-year term, Wray’s removal was not unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, including after a search of his Florida's property for classified documents and two investigations that resulted in his indictment.\n\nPatel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats. \n\nHe's called for dramatically reducing the FBI's footprint, a perspective that dramatically sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau's headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump's pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAnd though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters' phone records during leak investigation, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists. \n\nDuring an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.”\n\n\"We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”\n\nTrump also announced Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. \n\nChronister is another Florida Republican named to Trump’s administration. He has worked for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office since 1992 and became the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County 2017. He also worked closely with Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi. \n\nPatel, the child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration's attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe panel’s then-chairman, Rep.

When COVID-19 vaccines arrived in Canada, the federation's leader fought to get Métis prioritized with other Indigenous groups to receive them, arguing that they, too, faced higher health risks.\n\nBut he said that never happened because Métis didn't have constitutional protection, and he said the federal and provincial governments argued over who had jurisdiction over them.\n\n\"I still, to this day, will hold a grudge, and I'm one that doesn't, but I'll never forget what they did to us then.

Kash has also tried over 60 jury trials.”\n\n“This FBI will end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border.

The House panel and later special counsel Robert Mueller concluded there was no evidence that Trump conspired with Russians.\n\nIf confirmed, Patel would return to law enforcement, which is what he did before his time on Capitol Hill when he was a terrorism prosecutor at the Justice Department.\n\nWhile at the Justice Department, Patel was also the liaison officer to Joint Special Operations Command, to conduct collaborative targeting operations against high value terrorism targets.\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by The Daily Signal.]","summary":"'This FBI will end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the border'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2024/11/trump-taps-longtime-ally-kash-patel-to-lead-fbi/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kash-patel-video-screenshot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:56:10","author":"The Daily Signal","authors":["The Daily Signal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.287},{"id":269312892,"title":"Trump picks longtime ally Kash Patel to replace current FBI director","text":"President-elect Donald Trump intends to install Kash Patel, a close ally and former national security aide who has berated the Justice Department and the news media, to replace Christopher Wray as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nTrump wrote in a post on social media Saturday that Patel is a \"brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"\n\nPatel came to national attention as a congressional aide investigating the feds who were probing Russian interference in the 2016 election, before he pivoted into roles in Trump's National Security Council and Pentagon.

Mr. Smith’s request was granted by the District Judge hearing the case.\n\nWhat about the other cases?\r\n\nThe DOJ has also filed motions to drop all federal charges against Mr. Trump that relate to the latter’s “mishandling” of classified documents. Two state-level cases against him are also in legal limbo: the election interference case in Georgia has been paused pending a decision by an appeals court; in the business fraud case in New York involving charges against Mr. Trump for paying off an adult film star for her silence over an alleged affair, his conviction has been indefinitely delayed.\n\nScot-free: On a major legal reprieve for Donald Trump\n\nWhile the dropping of these charges marks the official end of Democrats’ hopes to hold Mr. Trump liable for several alleged crimes, it remains to be seen as to whether the 45th President will use this clean slate as a springboard to a bipartisan approach to policymaking, or whether it will merely strengthen his hand towards a second inning of the brand of divisive politics that has polarised the electorate of the country in recent years.\n\nWhat are the specific charges against Mr. Trump that have been dropped?\r\n\nFirstly, regarding the classified documents case, Mr. Trump was first indicted in June 2023 on 37 felony counts “related to mishandling classified documents that he took from the White House to his Florida home.” These charges included wilful retention of national defence information, conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. While a Florida judge had earlier dismissed the case and Mr. Smith’s office had sought an appeal, those charges are all being dropped now.\r\n\nIn August 2023, Mr. Trump was additionally indicted on four felony charges relating to his attempts to reverse the 2020 election results. These charges included conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding (a reference to the process of certification of the election results by Congress), obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights.\n\nWhat view has the U.S. Supreme Court taken on the subject?\r\n\nThe Supreme Court in July 2024 handed down its first ruling on the subject of presidential immunity when it determined, by an expected 6-3 majority, that former Presidents enjoyed broad immunity from prosecution. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority opinion of the court, “Under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles a former president to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority… And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”\r\n\nThe three liberal dissenting judges criticised the ruling as undermining the “core democratic principle that no person is above the law,” with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing that “in every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law” and that the protection afforded to Presidents by the court was “just as bad as it sounds, and it is baseless.”\r\n\nIs Mr. Trump absolved of guilt?\r\n\nNot necessarily. In her latest ruling on the cases, District Judge Tanya Chutkan said that she was dismissing the election interference charges against Mr. Trump “without prejudice,” suggesting that the door to prosecuting Mr. Trump in the future has been left open, specifically after Mr. Trump demits office after his second term, and loses his legal immunity shield. Hinting at the DOJ’s view on the matter, Mr. Smith noted that the charges had been dropped because the DOJ “forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President,” while adding the decision to not proceed with the indictments and trials was “not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant.”\r\n\nThen there are the political views of liberals and progressives, possibly including a majority of the more than 74 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump’s rival, incumbent Vice- President and Democrat candidate Kamala Harris, in the November 5 presidential election. While voter views on Mr. Trump may vary widely in general, polling as recently as six months ago found that nearly three in five Americans (59%) agreed that Mr. Trump was guilty of the 34 felony counts on which he was convicted in the New York case, compared to just 32% who believed he was innocent. Another poll around the same time found that a whopping 50% of respondents thought that Mr. Trump’s guilty verdict on all 34 counts in his hush money trial was correct. Similarly, a poll in April this year found that 53% of respondents believed that Mr. Trump committed “serious federal crimes.”\r\n\nYet the fact that a poll in May 2024 suggested that 67% of voters — including 74% of independents — said that a conviction would make no difference for how they voted in the election offers a deeper insight into the political preferences of voters.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/has-trumps-legal-storm-blown-away/article68932543.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/cn9o0x/article68884435.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Wright_Things_to_Know_48624.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:52:30","author":"Narayan Lakshman","authors":["Narayan Lakshman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":269308762,"title":"Trump picks hardline ‘deep state’ critic Kash Patel as new FBI head","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has said he will appoint Kash Patel, a loyalist and hardline critic of the “deep state”, to lead the FBI, signalling he will seek to remove Christopher Wray as head of the agency.\n\nPatel, who advised the secretary of defence under Trump’s previous administration, has previously suggested removing the FBI’s intelligence-gathering function and purging its ranks of any employees who do not support Trump.\n\n“I am proud to announce that Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel will serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” Trump wrote on his social media website, Truth Social, on Saturday night.\n\n“Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.”\n\n“This FBI will end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border,” Trump added.\n\nA longtime Trump loyalist, Patel has also worked as a federal prosecutor and public defender, but does not have any law enforcement experience.\n\nIn a podcast hosted by Trump ally Stephen Bannon late last year, Patel vowed to investigate and “come after” journalists who “lied” and “helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”\n\n“Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out,” Patel wrote.\n\nIn his book Government Gangsters, Patel outlines a list of “top reforms to defeat the deep state”, which include moving the FBI headquarters out of Washington and shrinking the general counsel’s office within the FBI.\n\nTrump appointed sitting FBI director Christoper Wray in 2017, and his term does not expire until 2027.

It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him.\n\n Patel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night.\n\n It remains unclear whether Patel could be confirmed, even by a Republican-led Senate, though Trump has also raised the prospect of using recess appointments to push his selections through.\n\n Patel would replace Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 but quickly fell out of favor with the president and his allies. Though the position carries a 10-year term, Wray’s removal was not unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, including after a search of his Florida's property for classified documents and two investigations that resulted in his indictment.\n\n Patel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats.\n\n He's called for dramatically reducing the FBI's footprint, a perspective that dramatically sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau's headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump's pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy.\n\n And though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters' phone records during leak investigation, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists.\n\n During an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.”\n\n \"We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”\n\n President-elect Donald Trump speaks at meeting of the House GOP conference, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\n Trump also announced Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\n Chronister is another Florida Republican named to Trump’s administration. He has worked for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office since 1992 and became the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County 2017. He also worked closely with Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n\n Patel, the child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration's attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n The panel’s then-chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was a strong Trump ally who tasked Patel with running the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Patel ultimately helped author what became known as the “Nunes Memo,” a four-page report that detailed how it said the Justice Department had erred in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign volunteer. The memo’s release faced vehement opposition from Wray and the Justice Department, who warned that it would be reckless to disclose sensitive information.\n\n Read more of the latest international headlines \n\n A subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe and said there had been a legitimate basis to open the inquiry.\n\n The Russia investigation fueled Patel's suspicions of the FBI, the intelligence community and also the media, which he has called “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen.” Seizing on compliance errors in the FBI’s use of a spy program that officials say is vital for national security, Patel has accused the FBI of having “weaponized” its surveillance powers against innocent Americans.\n\n Patel parlayed that work into influential administration roles on the National Security Council and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.\n\n He continued as a loyal Trump lieutenant even after he left office, accompanying the president-elect into court during his criminal trial in New York and asserting to reporters that Trump was the victim of a “constitutional circus.”\n\n In addition to his 2023 memoir, “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy,” Patel has published two children’s books that lionize Trump. “The Plot Against the King” features a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after “King Donald,” while Kash, a wizard called the Distinguished Discoverer, exposes a nefarious plot.\n\n Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-picks-fierce-ally-kash-patel-as-fbi-director-1.7129543","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/11/30/kash-patel-donald-trump-s-fbi-director-1-7129545-1733013843099.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:49:31","author":"Eric Tucker And Alan Suderman,The Associated Press","authors":["Eric Tucker And Alan Suderman","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":269307728,"title":"Botafogo Wins Its First Copa Libertadores Title 1","text":"Shopping Trends\n\n The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him.Patel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night.It remains unclear whether Patel could be confirmed, even by a Republican-led Senate, though Trump has also raised the prospect of using recess appointments to push his selections through.Patel would replace Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 but quickly fell out of favor with the president and his allies. Though the position carries a 10-year term, Wray’s removal was not unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, including after a search of his Florida’s property for classified documents and two investigations that resulted in his indictment.Patel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats.He’s called for dramatically reducing the FBI’s footprint, a perspective that dramatically sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau’s headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump’s pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy.And though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters’ phone records during leak investigation, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists.During an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.”\"We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”Trump also announced Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.Chronister is another Florida Republican named to Trump’s administration. He has worked for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office since 1992 and became the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County 2017. He also worked closely with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.Patel, the child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration’s attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The panel’s then-chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was a strong Trump ally who tasked Patel with running the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Patel ultimately helped author what became known as the “Nunes Memo,” a four-page report that detailed how it said the Justice Department had erred in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign volunteer. The memo’s release faced vehement opposition from Wray and the Justice Department, who warned that it would be reckless to disclose sensitive information.A subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe and said there had been a legitimate basis to open the inquiry.The Russia investigation fueled Patel’s suspicions of the FBI, the intelligence community and also the media, which he has called “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen.” Seizing on compliance errors in the FBI’s use of a spy program that officials say is vital for national security, Patel has accused the FBI of having “weaponized” its surveillance powers against innocent Americans.Patel parlayed that work into influential administration roles on the National Security Council and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.He continued as a loyal Trump lieutenant even after he left office, accompanying the president-elect into court during his criminal trial in New York and asserting to reporters that Trump was the victim of a “constitutional circus.”In addition to his 2023 memoir, “Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy,” Patel has published two children’s books that lionize Trump. “The Plot Against the King” features a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after “King Donald,” while Kash, a wizard called the Distinguished Discoverer, exposes a nefarious plot.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-president-elect-donald-trump-taps-kash-patel-for-fbi-director-replacing-christopher-wray-11733013425433.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/01/1600x900/USA-TRUMP-FBI-0_1733013624997_1733013644384.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:46:30","author":"Sayantani","authors":["Sayantani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":269307454,"title":"Trump nominates Kash Patel, who has called for shrinking the FBI, as agency's director","text":"U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has picked Kash Patel to serve as FBI director, turning to a fierce loyalist to upend America's premier law enforcement agency and rid the government of perceived \"conspirators.\" It's the latest bombshell Trump has thrown at the Washington establishment and a test for how far Senate Republicans will go in confirming his nominees.\n\n\"I am proud to announce that Kashyap \"Kash\" Patel will serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Trump posted Saturday night on Truth Social, his social media platform. \"Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"\n\nThe selection is in keeping with Trump's view that the government's law enforcement and intelligence agencies require a radical transformation and his stated desire for retribution against supposed adversaries.

Trump announced that Musk will partner with Vivek Ramaswamy to head up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).In a 2021 post on Twitter, made before Musk bought the platform and renamed it X, Musk claimed, \"Eventually, they run out of other people's money and then they come for you.\"Musk made the post in response to engineer and blockchain worker Rick McCraken, who criticized the plan to tax unrealized capital gains, saying the changes would \"slowly make their way down to middle class retirement investments over the next several years.\"\"It will start with billionaires, then eventually millionaires, then the modest investments will get hit possibly within a decade,\" McCraken wrote.Newsweek reached out by email for comment on Saturday evening from Steve Bannon and Trump's transition team.Trump proposed tax cuts on corporations, cutting the tax rate from 21 percent to 15 percent for companies that do not \"outsource, offshore or replace American workers\" and extending his tax cuts from 2017, which remained in effect throughout the Biden administration but are set to expire in 2025.New tax cuts include his now-famous \"no tax on tips\" policy and ending taxes on Social Security benefits.President Joe Biden, however, accused Trump of telling wealthy donors at a closed-door event in April that he would \"give you tax cuts\" by extending his 2017 program.In comments made last year during an episode of War Room, Bannon demanded \"massive tax increases on billionaires,\" drawing a line in the sand between the ultra-rich and the MAGA movement.\"Let's have massive tax increases on billionaires,\" Bannon said. \"The 499 of them are not MAGA, right, not MAGA at all. In fact, the large proportion are radical progressives. They made this mess...why shouldn't they pay for it?\"Bannon's comments followed Biden's announcement that he would seek a 25 percent minimum tax on billionaires, seeking to include taxes on rising value of assets.He also in 2021 insisted that government needed \"to start increasing the marginal tax increases for the wealthy.\"\"This is absurd. This is a scam. You're being scammed, just like you were being scammed on free trade,\" Bannon said after ProPublica's report that found many of the country's most wealthy individuals paid little or no income tax at times over the previous decade.Lindsay Owens, executive director of the left-of-center economic think tank Groundwork Action, wrote in a Rolling Stone op-ed published earlier this month that Trump's return to power would bring \"even bigger handouts to the ultra-wealthy,\" including individual tax cuts to the richest Americas, \"further slashing the corporate tax rate ... reducing taxes on capital gains, and more.\"","summary":"Steve Bannon in an interview with The Times in London reiterated his opposition to billionaire tax cuts, putting him at odds with Elon Musk.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-splits-elon-musk-key-trump-policy-interview-1993742","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2533404/elon-musk-steve-bannon-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:42:54","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":269306174,"title":"Us President Elect Donald Trump Nominates Another Indian American Loyalist Kash Patel To Lead Fbi","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump, on Sunday (Indian time), named his loyalist Kashyap 'Kash' Patel the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Who is Kash Patel?Indian-American Kash Patel briefly served in the Justice Department during the Obama administration After Trump took office, he spent two years as senior counsel to former Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., when he led the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 and 2018, helping with the committee’s widely criticized inquiry into the FBI’s Russia investigation. In 2018, he served as Trump's senior director for counterterrorism on the National Security Council to senior adviser for Trump’s directors of national intelligence, and then finally being promoted to chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during Trump’s final months in office.Patel has openly discussed retaliation against Trump's political enemies in government and media, and wrote in his book: \"[T]he FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"However, Patel has invited controversy throughout his career.

But yeah, we're putting you all on notice.\"\n\nThe child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, Patel spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration's attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nTrump also announced Saturday that he will nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\n\"As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social announcing the pick.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kash Patel to serve as FBI director, turning to a fierce loyalist to upend America's premier law enforcement agency and rid the government of perceived \"conspirators.\" It's the latest bombshell Trump has thrown at the Washington establishment and a test for how far Senate Republicans will go in confirming his nominees.","url":"https://abc13.com/post/trump-names-loyalist-kash-patel-serve-fbi-director/15607640/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15607651_113024-kash-patel.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:28:31","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":269305018,"title":"Trump intends to name former aide Kash Patel as FBI director","text":"President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans to name Kash Patel as FBI director, who would replace the current FBI chief Chris Wray.In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"For Patel to take the post, current FBI Director Chris Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027. One source previously told CBS News the Trump team was aware of the complexities involved in ousting Wray. Trump nominated Wray in 2017 for the 10-year term after firing James Comey.Patel served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense. Wray and the FBI's leadership became targets of Trump's enduring ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, ultimately charged Trump with dozens of counts, including the illegal retention of national defense information and obstruction, as a result of the investigation. All the charges were dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from the president-elect and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement about replacing Wray before his 10-year term was to end is sure to reverberate throughout the bureau's rank-and-file. Presidents, however, have the power to force them out of the role and many previous directors have not served their full terms. Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States — Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The president-elect announced her nomination after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination because his confirmation prospects looked dim as a bipartisan group of senators raised concerns about his past conduct and a Congressional ethics report. Gaetz — a staunch critic of the Justice Department and FBI — has denied wrongdoing. Trump's pick for Attorney General and FBI Director are likely to be tasked with potential reforms and mass policy overhauls of the agencies that have long been targets of the president-elect. This is a developing story and will be updated.","summary":"To do so, current FBI Director Chris Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by President-elect Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-to-name-kash-patel-as-fbi-director/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/01/6c4d27ee-c98e-4af7-b4ff-8e725e30441b/thumbnail/1200x630/24d37e1744175e1ec2bde4fec959e6e9/gettyimages-1431862330.jpg?v=e3aa8b4a58817620ee227c79202c9709","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3371561_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:26:33","author":"Robert Legare","authors":["Robert Legare"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":269311332,"title":"Trump picks loyalist Kash Patel for FBI director","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has picked MAGA loyalist Kash Patel as FBI director, signaling his intention to overhaul the intelligence agency he has long criticized.

Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that “migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.”\n\nMigrant rights activist Luis García Villagrán said the breaking-up of the two caravans appeared to be part of “an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States.”\n\nThe first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on Nov. 5, the day Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca.\n\nIn Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central Mexico.\n\n“They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from our group to Oaxaca city,” said Bárbara Rodríguez, an opposition supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country's contested presidential elections earlier this year.\n\nRodríguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to Mexico City.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, the National Immigration Institute said the migrants voluntary accepted bus rides “to various areas where there is medical assistance and where their migratory status will be reviewed,” and said “upon accepting (the rides), they said they no longer wanted to face the risks along their way.” \n\nThe second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on Nov. 20 and made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that allows travel across Mexico for 20 days.\n\nSheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what.\n\nApart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it.\n\nFor years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.\n\nFollow AP migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration","summary":"Some migrants were bused to southern Mexico, and others offered transit papers.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/activists-mexican-authorities-broken-2-migrant-caravans-heading-116340685","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f0870719-04e9-47d6-91b8-6b34bd9f5859/wirestory_c4611c47fc53e2c494545a7cef194e88_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:22:27","author":"Edgar H.

This is a bad moment for democracy in Nigeria.\n\nBy the umpire’s account, voter turnout in general elections has been in steady decline since the 2007 elections. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission, 57.54 per cent of voter turnout was recorded in 2007, 53.68 per cent in 2011, 43.65 per cent in 2015, 34.75 per cent in 2019 and 26.72 per cent in 2023.\n\nThis is proof that the politicians are making a mockery of democracy.\n\nThe United Kingdom general election of 2024, won by Keir Starmer of Labour, recorded a turnout of 59.7 per cent. Out of the 244 million eligible voters in the November 2024 American election won by Donald Trump of the Republican party, 150 million cast their ballots, a turnout of 64 per cent. This is far better than in Nigeria, where the minority elects the presidents, governors, and lawmakers.\n\nDataphyte, a Nigerian data platform, says that of the 93.47 million registered voters in the 2023 general elections, only 24.9 million persons voted in the presidential and National Assembly elections, representing 26.72 per cent voter turnout, the lowest since the return to democracy in 1999.\n\nIndeed, the words of a former United States president, Franklin Roosevelt, touch home poignantly in Nigeria’s elections: “The greatest threat to democracy is indifference.”\n\nThe November 16 Ondo governorship election corroborated the worrisome low voter turnout at elections since 2007.\n\nVoter turnout was put at 24.8 per cent, the lowest in the governorship elections in the state since 1999.\n\nData from INEC says Ondo recorded 42.4 per cent in the governorship election in 2007, 38.1 per cent in 2012, 35.3 per cent in 2016, and 32.6 per cent in 2020.\n\nMedia and observers’ reports indicate that vote-buying was carried to the most ridiculous level, with politicians doling out N10,000 to voters with impunity at polling units.\n\nIn the Edo governorship election held two months before Ondo’s, low voter turnout was also evident. The election recorded 22 per cent in 2024, the lowest turnout in the state since 2016. The electoral umpire’s account says 32 per cent was recorded in 2016 and 25 per cent in 2020.\n\nDataphyte says that Anambra State recorded the same trend: 68 per cent voter turnout in 2007, 16.33 per cent in 2010, 24.98 per cent in 2013, 21.74 per cent in 2017 and 10.38 per cent in 2021, the worst in the state since 1999.\n\nDespite 25 unbroken years of democracy, hardship is snowballing. Poverty is chronic. Nigeria overtook India as the global poverty capital with 86.7 million citizens in 2018. A 2022 survey by the NBS revealed that 133 million Nigerians lived in multidimensional poverty. The World Bank added 7.0 million citizens to that in 2023 after the petrol subsidies were cancelled and the naira floated.\n\nAt 33.88 per cent in October, inflation climbed to the highest point in 27 years. Food inflation is worse at 39.16 per cent. The jobless rate, especially among the youth, is alarming.\n\nViolence is unabating. Under Muhammadu Buhari, 63,111 persons died in violence. The bloodshed is unabating under his successor, Bola Tinubu, who assumed office in May 2023. Boko Haram, ISWAP, Ansaru, violent Fulani herdsmen, Lakurawa, militants, bandits and IPOB separatists are all carving up and taking territories at will.\n\nDemocracy is not delivering for the majority; only the tiny band of crooked politicians and their acolytes are basking in luxury. For the majority, there is no hope of a good future.\n\nConsequently, the people are lethargic about elections and turning their back on democracy, their tool to choose their elected leaders. The signs are ominous. Democracy is under siege and the elected leaders should live up to their expectations to save Nigeria’s tenuous, hard-earned civil rule.\n\nAs can be gleaned from the general and off-cycle election results under reference, voter turnout during the elections held in the past two years was the worst in recent years. The outcome was the same countrywide. Low voter turnout has worn a national outlook, proof that bad governance is entrenching voter apathy and undermining democracy.\n\nThe people are disenchanted with elections because they believe that their votes do not count and that their leaders are not providing service. The government’s primary purpose of welfare and security has been shifted to the people.\n\nThey generate their electricity, send their children to private schools for good education, provide their security, pay exorbitantly to get health facilities and revel in the throes of hunger. Consequently, the people do not see the essence of elections and stay away on election days.\n\nPoliticians are content with the status quo that puts them perpetually in government and power. They engage in all manner of strategies including sponsoring violence; hiring thugs to snatch or vandalise election boxes and materials; buying up PVCs; bribing INEC officials, ad hoc staff, and security agencies among other crimes to compromise election results, undermining democracy to stay in power.\n\nThe elected leaders deliberately pauperise the people to make them vulnerable to vote-buying to vote for them on election days and to circumvent BVAS and other technological tools introduced by INEC to strengthen the integrity of elections.\n\nSince elections are hardly free and fair, the contest shifts to the court and the judiciary has been roped into the executive conspiracy. A former Justice of the Supreme Court, Kayode Eso, raised the alarm over “billionaire judges” after the highly fractious general elections in 2007.\n\nA former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Joseph Daudu (SAN), said, “There is a growing perception backed by empirical evidence that justice is purchasable and that it has been purchased on several occasions in Nigeria.”\n\nIn a rare admission of the collective failure of the politicians, Ondo Governor-elect, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, canvassed awareness to boost voter participation. This is scratching the surface. The political class is ensconced in infernal practices to win office. “Go to court” is a sick but popular refrain in their midst. Maybe the awareness campaign should start among the political elite.\n\nPolitical participation gives politics and government life. Good governance makes political life tick; bad governance drives it into extinction. Elected leaders must fix politics and enthrone good governance to continue to be relevant. Leadership is everything. Politicians must show leadership and direction to wrest democracy from extinction and make votes count.","summary":"THERE can be no further proof that all is not well with the Fourth Republic and that the country’s democracy needs urgent help than the apathy that has dogged elections in Nigeria since 2007.

It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him.\n\nPatel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night in a social media post.\n\nPatel’s nomination sets up what’s likely to be an explosive confirmation battle in the Senate just days after Trump’s first pick to lead the Justice Department, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his nomination amid intense scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations.\n\nPatel is a lesser-known figure, but his nomination was still expected to cause shockwaves. He's embraced Trump’s rhetoric about a “deep state,” called for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of government workers who are disloyal to Trump and has referred to journalists as traitors, promising to try to prosecute some reporters.\n\nTrump’s nominees will have allies in what will be a Republican-controlled Senate next year, but his picks are not certain of confirmation. With a slim majority, Republicans can only lose a few defectors in the face of expected Democratic opposition — though as vice president, JD Vance would be able to break any tie votes.\n\nBut the president-elect had also raised the prospect of pushing his selections through without Senate approval using a congressional loophole that allows him to make appointments when the Senate is not in session.\n\nPatel would replace Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 but quickly fell out of favor with the president and his allies. FBI directors have 10-year terms that are meant to inoculate them from political influence.\n\nHis removal isn’t unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, particularly in the aftermath of federal investigations — and an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents two years ago — that resulted in indictments that are now poised to evaporate.\n\nIn his final months in office, Trump unsuccessfully pushed the idea of installing Patel as the deputy director at either the FBI or CIA in an effort to strengthen the president’s control of the intelligence community. William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, wrote in his memoir that he told then-chief of staff Mark Meadows that an appointment to Patel as deputy FBI director would happen “over my dead body.”\n\n“Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world’s preeminent law enforcement agency,” Barr wrote.\n\nPatel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats.\n\nHe's called for dramatically reducing the agency's footprint, a perspective that dramatically sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau's headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump's pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy.\n\nAnd though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters' phone records during leak investigation, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists.\n\nDuring an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.”\n\n\"We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.”\n\nTrump also announced Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nChronister is another Florida Republican named to Trump’s administration. He has worked for the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office since 1992 and became the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County 2017. He also worked closely with Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n\nPatel, the child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration's attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe panel’s then-chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was a strong Trump ally who tasked Patel with running the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Patel ultimately helped author what became known as the “Nunes Memo,” a four-page report that detailed how it said the Justice Department had erred in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign volunteer. The memo’s release faced vehement opposition from Wray and the Justice Department, who warned that it would be reckless to disclose sensitive information.\n\nA subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe and said there had been a legitimate basis to open the inquiry.\n\nThe Russia investigation fueled Patel's suspicions of the FBI, the intelligence community and also the media, which he has called “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen.” Seizing on compliance errors in the FBI’s use of a spy program that officials say is vital for national security, Patel has accused the FBI of having “weaponized” its surveillance powers against innocent Americans.\n\nPatel parlayed that work into influential administration roles on the National Security Council and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.\n\nHe continued as a loyal Trump lieutenant even after he left office, accompanying the president-elect into court during his criminal trial in New York and asserting to reporters that Trump was the victim of a “constitutional circus.”\n\nSince leaving government, Patel has found himself entangled in Trump’s legal woes, appearing two years ago before a federal grand jury that investigated Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida — a matter for which Trump was subsequently indicted.\n\nTypically though not always, presidents retain the director they’ve inherited: President Joe Biden, for instance, kept Wray in place even though the director was named by Trump, and former President Barack Obama even asked Robert Mueller to stay on an extra two years even though Mueller was tapped by Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nTrump had openly flirted with firing Wray during his first term, taking issue with Wray’s emphasis on the election interference threat from Russia at a time when Trump was focusing on China. He also described antifa, an umbrella term for leftist militants, as an ideology rather than an organization, contradicting Trump, who wants to designate it as a terror group.\n\nThe low-key Wray had been determined to bring stability to an institution riven by turbulence following the May 2017 firing of James Comey by Trump amid an FBI investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign.\n\nWray sought to turn the page on some of the controversies of Comey’s tenure. The FBI, for instance, fired a lead agent from the Russia investigation who sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the course of the inquiry and sidelined a deputy director under Comey who was a key figure in the probe. Wray also announced dozens of corrective actions meant to prevent some of the surveillance abuses that tainted the Russia investigation.\n\nThe FBI has worked to protect Trump this year following multiple assassination attempts and disrupted an Iranian murder-for-hire plot targeting the president-elect that resulted in criminal charges unsealed in November.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York and Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-names-loyalist-kash-patel-000445057.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u_KtHLKe2ccueCM8dvHYTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/791b3c2ab60dc9f20eb457c17fb037b7","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-01 00:04:45","author":"Eric Tucker And Alan Suderman","authors":["Eric Tucker And Alan Suderman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":269307612,"title":"Trump taps Kash Patel for FBI director, a loyalist who would aid effort to upend law enforcement","text":"By ERIC TUCKER and ALAN SUDERMAN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has nominated Kash Patel to serve as FBI director, turning to a fierce ally to upend America’s premier law enforcement agency and rid the government of perceived “conspirators.” It’s the latest bombshell Trump has thrown at the Washington establishment and a test for how far Senate Republicans will go in confirming his nominees.\n\n“I am proud to announce that Kashyap ‘Kash’ Patel will serve as the next Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” Trump posted Saturday night on Truth Social. “Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.”\n\nThe selection is in keeping with Trump’s view that the government’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies require a radical transformation and his stated desire for retribution against supposed adversaries.
