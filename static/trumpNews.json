Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:30 GMT, 10 March 2025 |Updated:01:02 GMT, 10 March 2025 \n\nAnnie Kilner has given a surprise nod to loverat husband Kyle Walker despite being 'far from happy' after he was seen partying with two models in Milan - just hours after his estranged wife and kids flew home to the UK. \nThe WAG, 31, who shares four sons with the AC Milan player, 34, used her married name for the first time professionally on Saturday, despite her marital woes, as she promoted her jewellery collection on Instagram. \nTaking to her Stories Annie modelled a dazzling diamond bracelet with a caption which read: 'Demure. Founded by Annie Walker & Sophie Haynes'.\nAccording to The Sun the move is a significant thawing in relations between the pair, despite Kyle's most recent shenanigans with the pair 'working through their issues'. \nA source told the publication: 'Annie was far from happy and made her feelings clear. Kyle denies anything went on and says he was asked to give the girls a lift.\n'He's clearly put himself in a difficult situation given his reputation. It's the lack of thought for Annie and how it might look that has caused the upset.'\n\nAnnie Kilner has given a surprise nod to loverat husband Kyle Walker despite being 'far from happy' after he was seen partying with two models in Milan\n\nThe WAG, who shares four sons with the footballer, 34, used her married name for the first time professionally on Saturday as she promoted her jewellery collection on Instagram.\n\nTaking to her Stories Annie modelled a dazzling diamond bracelet with a caption which read: 'Demure. Founded by Annie Walker & Sophie Haynes'\nMailOnline have contacted Annie's representatives for comment. \nAnnie has reportedly set a new relationship rule and told Kyle to be 'incredibly careful' as she sticks by him once again.\nA source told OK Magazine: 'Annie has decided she's going to give it another go but he needs to realise he has to be incredibly careful because even the most innocent things can come back to bite him.' \nThey added: 'Annie isn't a walkover, and she's got a lot to think about. \n'Her boys are her priority so she's prepared to see what can happen with their family, but it won't be at any cost or at the expense of her own happiness.'\nAnnie had flown out to Milan with their sons, Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and nine-month-old baby Rezon, after Kyle's exchange to play for AC Milan. \nThey were pictured playing happy families strolling through the Italian fashion capital on a shopping trip in what looked an apparent attempt at patching up their stormy marriage.\nBut within hours of Annie heading back to Cheshire, Kyle was on the town with his Italian agent Dario Ristori and striking Marijana and Dragana - who both run their own fashion labels.\n\nAccording to reports the move is a significant thawing in relations between the pair, despite Kyle's most recent shenanigans with the pair 'working through their issues' \n\nA source told the publication: 'Annie was far from happy and made her feelings clear. Kyle denies anything went on and says he was asked to give the girls a lift' \n\nMailOnline exclusively revealed the stunners as Serbian model Dragana Draca (L) and Marijana Vidovic (R)\nAt 2am on February 26, he was seen leaving the five-star hotel Casa Cipriani in Milan city centre with the two brunettes - who both bear a striking resemblance to Annie.\nAs they walked towards his waiting car Kyle put his arm around Marijana and she flirtingly flicked her hair back, which he reached over to touch.\n\n Annie Kilner 'issues husband Kyle Walker with new relationship rule' \nOne onlooker said: 'Kyle certainly looked like he was enjoying himself, he wasn't ready for the night to finish after dinner, that's for sure.'\nMarijana's Instagram account reveals she is the founder of a fashion outfit bran based in Serbia called 9am and she can be seen posing in various outfits in exotic locations across the world.\nFrom Mexico, to Paris, Mykonos, and Marbella, Marijana certainly seems to live the high life as she cuts a stunning image in her thigh slashed outfits and revealing tops.\nBelieved to be in her late 30s Marijana has lived in Milan for more than 15 years and started out working for late designer Roberto Cavalli.\nShe was starred in Serbia's version of reality TV show The Farm, where one producer told MailOnline: 'She was an instant hit with viewers because she is so attractive and with some of her male co-stars as well.'\nDragana, who is thought to be a similar age, is also a model and has been based in Dubai since 2020 where she runs two fashion labels called Summervie and Maison D'Vie.\nLike her friend her social media is full of racy pictures of her modelling the latest designs and enjoying a glamorous party lifestyle.\nAnnie KilnerKyle Walker\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAnnie Kilner gives surprise nod to loverat husband Kyle Walker despite being 'far from happy' after he was seen partying with two models\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mr Khalil was not in that group.\n\nHe later told the BBC he had been temporarily suspended by the university, where he is a graduate student at the School of International and Public Affairs.\n\nMr Khalil's detention follows President Donald Trump's executive order in January warning anyone involved in \"pro-jihadist protests\" and \"all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses\" would be deported.\n\nSome Jewish students at Columbia have said that rhetoric at the demonstrations at times crossed the line into antisemitism. Other Jewish students on campus have joined the pro-Palestinian protests. \n\nThe Trump administration last week announced it was revoking $400m (£310m) in federal grants to Columbia, accusing it of failing to fight antisemitism on campus.\n\nColumbia interim president Katrina Armstrong said in a campus-wide email on Friday that \"the cancellation of these funds will immediately impact research and other critical functions of the University\".\n\nThe Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage.\n\nMore than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1pl1eldno","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9dfa/live/e1403fc0-fd2b-11ef-8c03-7dfdbeeb2526.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:46:27","author":"Nomia Iqbal","authors":["Nomia Iqbal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.596},{"id":298445222,"title":"Mark Carney, next PM of Canada, warns of existential crisis, says US wants 'our country'","text":"Canada's Liberal Party on Sunday (Mar 9) elected Mark Carney as the country's next prime minister.

Ukrainian troops are using the service to guide drone and artillery strikes, among other tasks on the battlefield.\n\nOn Sunday, Musk, an adviser to US President Donald Trump, renewed his call for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, describing his Starlink system as “the backbone of the Ukrainian army.\n\n“Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off. What I am sickened by is years of slaughter in a stalemate that Ukraine will inevitably lose,” he wrote on X.\n\nSikorski responded to Musk’s post, saying that “Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year.\n\n“The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers,” the minister added.\n\n“Be quiet, small man,” Musk replied. “You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink,” he wrote.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Sikorski was “just making things up.”\n\n“No one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink,” Rubio stressed. “And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago, and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now.”\n\nLast week, Trump suspended the delivery of weapons to Ukraine and restricted intelligence sharing, arguing that Kiev should be more receptive to his efforts to broker a peace deal.","summary":"Elon Musk has lashed out at Poland’s foreign minister during an argument over his Starlink service in Ukraine \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/613957-be-quiet-small-man-musk/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67ce33812030272b4016d9d3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:37:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":298442010,"title":"Former central banker Mark Carney to become Canada’s new prime minister, replacing Justin Trudeau following his victory in the Liberal Party vote","text":"Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada’s next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days. Carney won in a landslide, winning 85.9% of the vote.\n\n“There is someone who is trying to weaken our economy,” Carney said. “Donald Trump, as we know, has put unjustified tariffs on what we build, on what we sell and how we make a living. He’s attacking Canadian families, workers and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won’t.”\n\nCarney said Canada will keep retaliatory tariffs in place until “the Americans show us respect.”\n\nCarney navigated crises when he was the head of the Bank of Canada and when in 2013 he became the first noncitizen to run the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694. His appointment won bipartisan praise in the U.K. after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries.\n\nThe opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged.\n\nTrump’s trade war and his talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, who are booing the American anthem at NHL and NBA games. Some are canceling trips south of the border, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.\n\nThe surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberal Party’s chances in a parliamentary election expected within days or weeks, and Liberal showings have been improving steadily in opinion polls.\n\n“We have made this the greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,” Carney said earlier.\n\nAfter decades of bilateral stability, the vote on Canada’s next leader now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with the United States.\n\nCarney has picked up one endorsement after another from Cabinet ministers and members of Parliament since declaring his candidacy in January. He is a highly educated economist with Wall Street experience who has long been interested in entering politics and becoming prime minister, but he lacks political experience.\n\nThe other top Liberal leadership candidate was former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Trudeau told Freeland in December that he no longer wanted her as finance minister, but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after, releasing a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for Trudeau.\n\nCarney is expected to trigger an election shortly afterward. Either Carney will call one, or the opposition parties in Parliament could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer central banker Mark Carney will become Canada&#8217;s next prime minister after&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former central banker Mark Carney to become Canada&#8217;s new prime minister, replacing Justin Trudeau following his victory in the Liberal Party vote first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/former-central-banker-mark-carney-to-become-canadas-new-prime-minister-replacing-justin-trudeau-following-his-victory-in-the-liberal-party-vote/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Ex-central-banker-Mark-Carney-to-replace-Justin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:30:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.328},{"id":298445786,"title":"Dancing On Ice 'could be AXED just DAYS after 2025 final' as Holly Willoughby turns down lucrative ITV deal and staff are warned 'tired' show 'is over' amid plummeting ratings","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustin Trudeau weeps as he gives emotional farewell speech in front of his family and makes one FINAL dig at Donald Trump - before his successor as Canadian PM continues war of words with fresh jibe at the US president\n\nDanny Jones' wife Georgia 'issues final warning in crisis talks amid fears of another video leak' after his kiss with Maura Higgins at the BRIT Awards\n\nWoke RAF is running out of gun pilots!

There's no denying, though, that the format has become tired and they're not getting the big names they once did'.\n'Changes are needed and it's likely it'll be rested and given a new lease of life' but said staff were 'not holding out much hope'.\n\nDancing On Ice could reportedly be axed just days after Corrie actor Sam Aston was crowed the 2025 champion on Sunday (pictured with partner Molly Beth Lanaghan)\n\nThe series, which is hosted by Holly Willoughby and Stephen Mulhern, has lost over a million viewers in the last two years with staff told the 'tired' show which launched in 2006 is 'over'. \nBefore adding: 'The show's future hinges on the meetings that follow last night's finale. Dancing On Ice is an expensive production and there are questions over whether ITV is getting bang for its buck'.\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Dancing On Ice for comment. \nLast week source told The Mirror: 'There are very real fears this is the end of the road for Dancing on Ice. It's had a good run for nearly 20 years and has a very loyal set of viewers who really love it but the sad truth is there's just not enough of them. \n'We need bums on seats but the ratings have dropped to a point where it's difficult to justify the cost. \nThe future of Dancing On Ice was thrown into doubt ahead of this series after the head judges Torvill and Dean revealed they are ready to hang up their skates and they performed one last time on Sunday. \nAn ITV spokeswoman told the publication: 'The Dancing on Ice team is fully concentrating on the much anticipated series finale this coming Sunday and therefore no decision has been made.'\nMeanwhile ITV insiders said that Holly is 'busy with other commitments', which meant she was unable to return to the game show she hosted a two part special last year alongside Stephen.\nWhile it is not yet known what her other role is, she recently found global fame on Netflix's Celebrity Bear Hunt - her first big role away from ITV.\n\nAccording to reports the series could be rested, before being revamped and relaunched at a later date, similar to when the show was axed in 2014 and brought back four years later \n\n'Changes are needed and it's likely it'll be rested and given a new lease of life' but said staff were 'not holding out much hope' \n\nIt comes after MailOnline revealed Holly had turned down a deal with ITV to front a new series of the game show You Bet!

with Beijing’s tariffs to take effect","text":"BEIJING: Trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies are set to escalate on Monday, as Beijing begins levying tariffs on certain US agricultural goods in retaliation for President Donald Trump’s latest hike on Chinese imports.\n\nSince retaking office in January, Trump has unleashed a barrage of tariffs on major US trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico, citing their failure to stop illegal immigration and flows of deadly fentanyl.\n\nAfter imposing a blanket 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods in early February, Trump hiked the rate to 20 percent last week.\n\nBeijing reacted quickly, its finance ministry accusing Washington of “undermining” the multilateral trading system and announcing fresh measures of its own.\n\nThe moves will see fresh tariffs of 10 and 15 percent imposed on several US farm products, starting on Monday.\n\nChicken, wheat, corn and cotton from the United States will now be subject to the higher charge while soybeans, sorghum, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruit, vegetables and dairy will face the slightly lower rate.\n\nAnalysts say Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs are designed to hurt Trump’s voter base while remaining restrained enough to allow room to hash out a trade deal.\n\nThe increasing trade headwinds add to difficulties faced by Chinese leaders currently seeking to stabilise the country’s wavering economy.\n\nSluggish consumer spending, a prolonged debt crisis in the vast property sector and high youth unemployment are among the issues now facing policymakers.\n\nChina’s exports — which last year reached record highs — might not provide the same economic lifeline for Beijing as its trade war with Washington intensifies.\n\nExperts say the full effects of the recent wave of tariffs have yet to be fully felt, though early signs already indicate a downturn in shipments.\n\nChina’s exports grew 2.3 percent year-on-year during the first two months of 2025, official data showed Friday, missing expectations and slowing significantly from the 10.7 percent growth recorded in December.\n\n“As exports face downside risk with trade war looming, the fiscal policy needs to become more proactive,” wrote Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\nThe latest trade data came as Chinese officials congregated in Beijing for the country’s largest annual political gathering, known as the “Two Sessions”.\n\nDuring a speech to delegates on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang laid out the government’s economic strategy for the year ahead, acknowledging “an increasingly complex and severe external environment”.\n\nLi also announced that the government’s official growth target for the year ahead would be “around five percent” — the same as 2024.\n\nBut many economists consider that goal to be ambitious, considering the hurdles facing China’s economy.\n\n“If fiscal spending starts to ramp up again soon then that could more than offset the near-term hit to growth from tariffs,” wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.\n\n“However, given the wider headwinds… we still aren’t convinced that fiscal support will be sufficient to deliver anything more than a short-lived boost,” he added.","summary":"BEIJING: Trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies are set to

looming federal election.\n\nHundreds of Conservative backers filed into RBC Place for a rally on Sunday dubbed \"Bring It Home,\" Poilievre's first in the southwestern Ontario city since late 2023.\n\nThe mid-day rally, which drew a lineup that snaked around the block, comes as the party's comfortable polling lead over the Liberals has shrunk following the return of U.S. President Donald Trump to office and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation announcement.\n\nDespite that, supporters waiting to get into the rally expressed no concern about Poilievre's chances in the next federal election, whenever it may be called.\n\n\"I'm hoping it's a guarantee. But, you know, if for some reason we lose, we lose. That's part of democracy,\" London resident Jordon Chortos said. \"The Liberal Party needs to understand that it's up to the people. You don't just get to stay in power forever, unless the people allow you to.\"\n\nPoilievre was preceded on stage by Andrew Lawton, the party's candidate in Elgin—Middlesex—London, and was introduced by his wife, Anaida Poilievre.\n\nCarney is Poilievre's new opponent\n\nThe rally came mere hours before the Liberals announced the election of Mark Carney as the party's new leader — and, by extension, Poilievre's new election opponent. It remains to be seen whether Carney, who is prime minister-designate until Trudeau tenders his resignation to the Governor General, will call an election now or wait until Parliament returns on March 24.\n\nCarney was mentioned at least a dozen times by the Conservative leader, who has dubbed him \"Carbon Tax Carney\" for the last several months. During the rally, Poilievre claimed without proof that the new Liberal leader was lying about his promise to scrap the tax.\n\n\"Careful everybody, because sneaky Mark Carney's going to try and pull a fast one on you. Here's what he's got planned, I'm making a prediction,\" he told the crowd.\n\nPoilievre suggested Carney would tell his environment minister to stop collecting the tax until after the election and would then bring in an \"even bigger shadow carbon tax.\"\n\nAs he did last week, he also accused Carney of having financial interests in conflict with Canada's national interests, which he said Trump could exploit to attack Canadian jobs.\n\n\"We will put Canada first by bringing it home,\" he said, promising to bolster the working class and bring the resource sector \"roaring back to life,\" while cracking down on drugs and crime — comments similar to ones he made during a \"Canada First\" rally last month in Ottawa.\n\nSupporters outside rally want election\n\nOutside RBC Place, supporters were largely unified, saying that an election should be called immediately.\n\n\"Sooner the better,\" said Robert Wood, who was in line with his wife, Joyce Wood. For him, the only competitor for Carney was Ruby Dhalla, adding that the Liberals \"cut her off at the knees.\"\n\n\"The debates were a farcical back-slapping congratulatory message to the Canadian public, and it didn't represent what the majority of Canadians think,\" Wood said.\n\nDhalla was kicked out of the leadership race after the Liberal Party's vote committee said she had violated multiple rules, including alleged violations of the Canada Elections Act and inaccurate financial reporting. Dhalla has called the allegations \"false\" and \"fabricated.\"\n\n\"Monday would be perfect. We need change in Canada,\" London resident Jennifer Stoskopf said of when an election should be called.\n\nStoskopf said it was important that Canada have a strong leader to fight against Trump, who has been threatening punishing tariffs and making remarks about Canada becoming the 51st state.\n\nAcross the street, a smaller crowd of demonstrators waved signs in opposition to Poilievre, some likening him to a Canadian Trump. \"It's not true at all,\" Stoskopf said.\n\n\"God bless this country, that we can have protesters and counter-protesters. That's the great thing about Canada, free speech.\"\n\nAny election call should be made in a month or two, said Will Rogers, a local post-secondary student in line to hear Poilievre.\n\n\"I'd like to see what the Liberals have to offer for their new leader. If we have a little bit more time, we get basically a free trial into seeing how they manage,\" he said.\n\nRogers admitted he wasn't deeply familiar with Poilievre's platform, and was hoping to learn more at the rally about his positions on housing and trade amid the U.S. tariff threats.\n\n\"I'm curious about what he might have planned for trade with Europe, replacing certain things that we might be moving on from with the U.S.\"","summary":"Hundreds of Conservative backers filed into RBC Place for a rally on Sunday dubbed \"Bring It Home,\" Poilievre's first in the southwestern Ontario city since late 2023.","url":"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/poilievre-conservative-leader-rally-1.7479051?cmp=rss","image":"https://i.cbc.ca/1.7479070.1741561897!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/poilievre-london-rally-speaking-to-crowd.jpg?im=Resize%3D620","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:20:36","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":298441462,"title":"Has Elon Musk lost the X factor? The proof is in the protest","text":"What do you do when your best asset turns into your greatest liability?\n\nThat's the conundrum suddenly facing Tesla investors following a global backlash against the antics of its chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nFrom protests at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the United States last weekend, and bumper stickers on Australian Teslas from embarrassed owners, to cheeky UK bus stop advertisements critical of Musk — the criticism and condemnation appears to be gathering pace.\n\nOrdinarily, for someone so cosseted by fame and fortune, criticism from the masses wouldn't be worth worrying about.\n\nBut in this case, the global pushback is starting to directly impact the Tesla business — and, by extension, Musk's individual net worth.\n\nTesla's share price has plummeted in the past few weeks as the company's sales have slumped in Europe and Australia, while shipments from China have taken a massive dive.\n\nHe is still officially be the richest man on the planet by a huge margin.\n\nBut Musk's personal wealth has suffered a $US120 billion hit from the mid-December share price peak.\n\nTesla share price takes a U-turn\n\nBetween election day on November 5 and the peak in the middle of December, Tesla stock soared an incredible 91 per cent.\n\nThe rally was propelled by what many believed would be the opportunities Musk's perceived influence over incoming president Donald Trump would present the business.\n\nSince then, the gains have all but evaporated.\n\nTesla and Musk are back to square one, except he now is caught in a pincer movement — between an increasingly hostile customer base, and a sudden lift in competition from Chinese and European rivals.\n\nNo longer number one\n\nHow much of the sudden reversal of fortunes is down to operational issues, and how much is the result of reputational damage is difficult to calibrate at this early stage.\n\nBut, according to Morningstar's American based auto analyst Seth Goldstein, there's no doubt Musk's political posturing has become an issue.\n\n\"Musk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn't think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\" he told the Associated Press this week.\n\nDomestically, the Tesla boss's zeal in slashing America's government spending, in the process sacking thousands of public servants, has created a furore.\n\nBut his incursion into ultra-right wing politics and his dabbling in European election campaigns has caused offence in Europe and a backlash across the globe.\n\nCustomers are abandoning the brand.\n\nIn Germany, where Nazi-style salutes are considered particularly abhorrent, sales dropped 76 per cent in February, adding to a disastrous 60 per cent plunge in January.\n\nWhile not quite of the same magnitude, the dire performance was replicated across the Continent, with thumping sales drops in The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal.\n\nShipments from China were almost as bad, down 49 per cent in February from the previous year, a sharp drop from January.\n\nHere in Australia, Tesla's sales performance was abysmal, dropping 72 per cent in February from the same month last year.\n\nWhile the company has partly blamed the Lunar New Year falling over January and February and retooling for model upgrades, it has begun to feel the squeeze from rivals such as China's BYD.\n\nBYD is rapidly expanding its sales globally and has just overtaken Tesla as the world's biggest producer of electric vehicles.\n\nUntil now, Tesla was seen as the undisputed leader and its extreme market valuation — which even in its infancy was higher than that of a combined Ford, General Motors, Chrysler and Toyota — seemed destined to be forever locked into place.\n\nThat's no longer the case. It now has to compete, just like an ordinary car manufacturer rather than a conduit to the future.\n\nFor the past two years, Tesla has been trying to maintain market dominance by continually cutting the price of new vehicles.\n\nWhile that strategy initially spurred demand, it last year began to weigh on potential owners who fretted about resale values and held back.\n\nNow they appear to be looking for alternatives.\n\nAlienation in an alien nation\n\nA UK activist group called Everyone Hates Elon has owned up as the force behind the bus shelter posters, depicting Musk as a throwback to 1939.\n\nOperating under the mantra of \"Let's Make Billionaires Losers Again\", the group has struck a chord with many in the community.\n\nMany major industrialists, at some time in their career, have been the subject of ridicule and protest from groups such as the Occupy movement.\n\nWhile made to briefly feel uncomfortable, most weathered the storm with their business and wealth intact, as the protesters were ideologically and socially in a separate universe.\n\nThis time around, the protests look to be gaining traction among the mainstream.\n\nMusk's customers generally have been well off but left-leaning.\n\nTesla was positioned as a revolutionary champion in the corporate march for a clean and green planet with Musk as a visionary leader in the quest for lower carbon emissions.\n\nNot only were Tesla cars high performance, quality vehicles, their owners saw themselves as early adopters of the push towards electrification and a rejection of a fossil fuelled past.\n\nMusk's emergence as a right-wing warrior has alienated many of his loyal customers, to the point that even investment bankers, like Saxo Bank's global head of investment strategy Jacob Falkencrone, are wondering how much more damage he will do to the company.\n\n\"Investors are asking whether Musk's personal brand is starting to weigh on Tesla's business,\" Falkencrone said.\n\nThen there is his relationship with Trump.\n\nOn the surface, the pair appear to have little in common — Trump doesn't believe in climate change, has no time for electric vehicles and is completely opposed to American industry manufacturing offshore, and particularly in China.\n\nMusk caters to a world that sees climate change as an existential threat and produces electric vehicles in Texas, Nevada, Shanghai, Berlin and Mexico.\n\nWho is selling out?\n\nTesla has a strong connection to Australia — or, at least, to an Australian.\n\nThe company's chair is Robyn Denholm, once a senior executive of the similarly named Telstra.\n\nIn the past few months, she has been dumping Tesla shares by the electric truckload.\n\nAs of Friday, she has offloaded more than $US117 million worth of Tesla stock, adding to the woes brought on by the onslaught of poor sales and production announcements, and Musk's self-inflicted damage.\n\nShe was already under pressure.\n\nA director for more than decade, she has chaired the company since 2018 and served on the company's compensation committee which, controversially, granted Musk a $US56 billion pay deal shortly after she ascended to the top.\n\nLast year, a Delaware court judge ruled against the pay deal and questioned the independence of the board.","summary":"From protests at more than 50 Tesla showrooms across the US, and bumper stickers on

Mar-a-Lago\n\nPODCAST: Trump’s tariff whiplash, Trudeau’s tears, and Hunter Biden’s ‘sugar brother’ – on the latest episode of Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy RACHEL BOWMAN FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:14 GMT, 10 March 2025 | Updated: 00:16 GMT, 10 March 2025\n\nAir Force fighter jets intercepted an unauthorized aircraft that entered the no-fly zone over Donald Trump's Florida home while he played golf at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\nNorth American Aerospace Defense Command said F-16 fighter jets fired off flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot while the president finished a round of golf at his West Palm Beach golf course. \n\nThe intrusion did not alter Trump's schedule or impact his security, according to officials.\n\nNORAD said the flares may have been visible from the ground but that they burn out quickly and don't pose danger.\n\n'Adherence to TFR procedures is essential to ensure flight safety, national security, and the security of the President,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORAD and US Northern Command said in a statement. \n\n'The procedures are not optional, and the excessive number of recent TFR violations indicates many civil aviators are not reading Notice to Airmen, or NOTAMS, before each flight as required by the FAA, and has resulted in multiple responses by NORAD fighter aircraft to guide offending aircraft out of the TFR.' \n\nJets also conducted an intercept on Saturday morning shortly after Trump arrived at the course from his private Mar-a-Lago club and residence.\n\nViolations, and intercepts, are relatively routine, but NORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Trump's inauguration.\n\nAir Force fighter jets intercepted an unauthorized aircraft that entered the no-fly zone over Donald Trump's Florida home while he played golf. Pictured: Trump arriving on Saturday\n\nF-16 fighter jets fired off flares to get the attention of the civilian pilot while the president finished a round of golf (Pictured: An F-16 on October 31, 2020)\n\nThe intrusion did not alter Trump's schedule or impact his security at Mar-a-Lago (pictured)\n\nThe agency said it has responded to more than 20 incidents and blames civilian pilots for not following regulations requiring them to check for airspace restrictions before taking off.\n\nFederal officials maintain a permanent flight restriction over Trump's club that expands to a radius of 30 nautical miles when the president is in residence.\n\nOn March 1, three aircraft reportedly violated the airspace above Mar-a-Lago between 11:05am, 12:10pm and 12:50pm, according to Newsmax's Todd Starnes.\n\nDuring two of the intercepts, the fighter jets reportedly had to deploy flares. However, all three civilian fliers were safely nudged out of Palm Beach airspace.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post reported on February 20 that there were three airspace violations over the coastal city during Trump's six-day visit to Mar-a-Lago that month.\n\nTwo of the violations occurred on February 15 and one happened on Presidents Day, February 17.\n\nA NORAD spokesperson did not reveal where the planes were exactly over Palm Beach, but there were reports of F-16's responding to the violations over Wellington, which is a more inland community.\n\nNORAD reported yet another civilian aircraft improperly flying over Palm Beach on February 18 at approximately 10:49 am.\n\nNORAD is raising alarm over the frequency of the intrusions since Trump's inauguration\n\nA civilian recorded this video of an F-16 flying over the Palm Beach area on February 18. That day, there was another civilian aircraft flying improperly in the airspace\n\nAgain, the agency scrambled fighter jets which also used flares to communicate with the civilian pilot.\n\nNORAD explained that flares are 'employed with the highest regard for safety, burn out quickly and completely, and pose no danger to people on the ground.'\n\nA civilian recorded one of the fighter jets that was deployed that day and submitted the video to WPTV, an NBC affiliate in West Palm Beach. The video was taken when the jet was over Boynton Beach, which is slightly south of Palm Beach.\n\nDonald TrumpFlorida\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nF-16 fighter jets fire flares to intercept unauthorized aircraft that entered no-fly zone over Trump's Mar-a-Lago\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Air Force fighter jets intercepted an unauthorized aircraft that entered the no-fly zone over Donald Trump's Florida home while he played golf at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14479977/F-16-fighter-jets-fire-flares-unauthorized-aircraft-Trump-Mar-Lago.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/09/23/95728987-0-Pictured_President_Donald_Trump_s_Mar_a_Lago_resort_in_Palm_Beac-a-16_1741564470853.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:16:42","author":"Editor,Rachel Bowman","authors":["Editor","Rachel Bowman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":298442254,"title":"Marco Rubio Joins Elon Musk In Polish Minister Smackdown Amid Talk of Feud","text":"Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio took to X, formerly Twitter, to shutdown a Polish minister's claims about Starlink in Ukraine amid a report that the duo clashed just days ago.Why It MattersThe New York Times last week reported that Rubio and Musk clashed at a cabinet meeting over the billionaire's effort to cut down on federal spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an unofficial agency created through executive order.President Donald Trump and the White House have denied the report, saying there was \"no clash. I was there,\" and accusing the reporter who asked him about the topic of being \"a troublemaker.\"Trump insisted that \"Elon gets along great with Marco\" and that they're \"both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.\"What To KnowAny signs of tension between Musk and Rubio would appear to be unlikely to derail Trump's agenda, for now, as both men responded along similar lines to Polish minister Radoslaw Sikorski on X.Sikorski responded to a post by Musk, in which the X owner and CEO said that \"my Starlink system is the backbone of the Ukrainian army. Their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.\"The minister wrote that \"Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year. The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers.\"Musk responded a few hours later, writing: \"Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.\"Rubio then piled in, writing that Sikorski was \"just making things up,\" and \"no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink.\"\"And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,\" Rubio wrote.Sikorski directly responded to Rubio, diplomatically saying, \"Thank you, Marco, for confirming that the brave soldiers of Ukraine can count on the vital internet service provided jointly by [USA] and [Poland]. Together, Europe and the United States can help [Ukraine] to achieve a just peace.\"Sikorski's fellow minister Witold Zembaczynski backed up his colleague by writing, \"Thank you. It's so simple #standwithukraine not with war criminalist #Putin.\"Ukraine has tens of thousands of terminals set up throughout the country, including up to 500 units purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense in June 2023, according to the BBC.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump in a Truth Social post last week about the meeting said: \"We just had a meeting with most of the Secretaries, Elon, and others, and it was a very positive one. It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people. We're going to have these meetings every two weeks until that aspect of this very necessary job is done. The relationships between everybody in that room are extraordinary. They all want to get to the exact same place, which is, simply, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"Political scientist and podcaster Ian Bremmer in a reply to Musk's insult to Sikorski wrote: \"Don't see what benefits the us government gets from insulting allies (or adversaries, for that matter, though it appears to be limited to allies).\"Charlie Kirk, founder and CEO of conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA posted to X on Friday: \"President Trump SLAMS an NBC reporter for ginning up the 'clash' between Elon and Marco Rubio story: 'No clash. I was there. You're just a troublemaker' Musk vs Rubio JD vs Don Jr. Pay attention. MSM wants us divided. Too bad!!\"What Happens NextTrump during a press gaggle on Air Force One on Sunday evening said that the U.S. \"just about\" lifted a pause on military intelligence sharing with Ukraine as the two nations plan to meet in Saudi Arabia with Russian counterparts to discuss a peace deal.

The development not only reflects a new chapter for the Liberal Party but could also imply the imminent beginning of a federal election, as reported by CBC News.\nAlso Read | Elon Musk's DOGE Rolling Out GSAi Custom AI Chatbot To Automate Some Government Tasks for Federal Employees.\nThe leadership race began in Canada's Liberal Party after Trudeau, in early January, announced his intention to step down after a mounting caucus revolt and the resignation of Freeland from cabinet.\nAt the time, the Liberal Party was behind Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives by over 20 points. Recent polling has indicated that Liberals are bouncing back. Whoever secures a win will face pressure to sustain that momentum, according to CBC News. Also Read | US: Armed Man Shot by Secret Service Near White House While Donald Trump out of Town, Say Authorities.\nNotably, after the Liberals trailed for months behind the opposition Conservative Party by a wide margin, recent polls show the Liberals are now riding a wave of political momentum, in part due to Trudeau's resignation and fears of a trade war with Washington, according to Al Jazeera. The federal election must be held by October 20, but it could be called sooner.\nTrudeau led the party for over a decade. Leading the Liberals to power in 2015, promising \"sunny ways\" for Canada, Trudeau was elected two more times since then, most recently in 2021, when he remained in power but lost his governing majority.\nHe championed progressive issues like combating climate change and addressing historic abuses against Indigenous peoples, but the latter years of his premiership have been marked by rising economic discontent. His administration was also rocked last year by the surprise resignation of Freeland, who was then deputy prime minister and finance minister, just hours before she was due to deliver her annual fiscal update, as reported by CNN. However, throughout the campaign, candidates have moved away from policies implemented by Trudeau, like the carbon tax and changes to the capital gains tax, while putting their own spin on how to handle the housing crisis and make life more affordable for the people of Canada.\nAfter nearly two months of campaign and two debates, thousands of registered Liberals will now take a decision on the party leader. Eligible voters have been able to vote for over a week and have until 3 pm ET to cast their ballot, CBC News reported. Those in the leadership race are former central banker Mark Carney, former finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, former House leader and current MP Karina Gould, and Montreal business leader and former MP Frank Baylis, as reported by CBC News. Carney, 59, who is being considered the frontrunner by many, has tried to portray himself as a political outsider, putting distance between himself and the widely unpopular Trudeau.\nThe economist previously served as governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, and he acted as an economic adviser to Trudeau's government. He also served as a United Nations special envoy on climate action and finance, as reported by Al Jazeera. Another big name in the race is Chrystia Freeland, who has been a key member of Trudeau's inner circle. Since then, she has held various high-profile government portfolios, including as deputy prime minister and finance minister.\nIn a surprise move, Freeland resigned from Trudeau's cabinet saying she and Trudeau were \"at odds about the best path forward\" for Canada in the face of a threat from Trump to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods. This setback played a huge role in Trudeau finally deciding to step down. Karina Gould, the 37-year-old MP from Burlington, Ontario, has held various positions within the Liberal government since she was elected to Parliament in 2015.\nOver her time in office, she has served as the minister of democratic institutions, minister for international development, and minister of families, children and social development. In the latter role, she helped implement a national childcare programme that cut daycare costs for Canadians.\nFrank Baylis, the other candidate in the race, was elected to the House of Commons in the Montreal-area riding of Pierrefonds-Dollard in 2015. He held the seat until the next election in 2019, when he chose not to run again.\nAn entrepreneur, he also has touted his business experience over the past decades and said he intends to help tackle Canada's affordability crisis.\nThe leadership contest comes in the backdrop of the ongoing tariff row between Washington and Ottawa. Relations with the US have soured under the Trump administration, as reported by CNN. The past three months have seen US President Donald Trump blame Canada for illegal immigration into the US, threaten to turn Canada into the US's \"51st state\", and impose steep tariffs on Canadian imports, which the White House says is necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\nAs a result, Canada's internal issues have been overshadowed by the threat posed by US President Donald Trump. The race for Liberal Party leader largely became a question of who would be best able to handle Trump's tariffs and threats, as per CBC News.\nOne of the first questions for the new leader will be whether they plan to immediately trigger an election or wait till parliament returns on March 24. The event on Sunday (local time) is being held in Ottawa, where Trudeau and Canada's former PM Jean Chretien are slated to address the crowd.

In a post on X, Mr Yermak said that they “exchanged views on key issues on the path to achieving peace”.\n\nMr Trump told reporters “we’re going to make a lot of progress” during the talks.\n\nAttacks on Ukraine by Russia continued through the weekend, with Mr Zelensky claiming that there have been “hundreds” throughout the week.\n\nThe diplomatic push on securing a peace deal in the war between Russia and Ukraine will continue this week, as the Ukrainian president is due to fly out to Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with the country’s crown prince, and his team will stay on for talks with US officials.\n\nMeanwhile, European defence ministers including John Healey are expected to meet in Paris later in the week.\n\nLast week, Mr Zelensky said that he is “ready to work” under the US president’s leadership, but Mr Trump continued his criticisms of the Ukrainian leader on Sunday, saying that Ukraine was able to take money out of the US “under Biden like candy from a baby”.\n\nHe also suggested Mr Zelensky is not grateful for US help.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News in an interview on Sunday and referring to Mr Zelensky, the US president said: “It was like taking candy from a baby what he did.\n\n“He’s a smart guy and he’s a tough guy and he took money out of this country under Biden like candy from a baby. It was so easy.”\n\nMr Trump added: “I just don’t think he’s grateful.”\n\nAmid the talks elsewhere, the UK and France have been leading efforts to get countries to sign up to a so-called “coalition of the willing” peacekeeping force.\n\nA senior minister said on Sunday that countries cannot be “dragooned” into the group, and would have to “step forward themselves” if they want to be a part of it.\n\nNot all the countries interested in the plan would necessarily provide troops to a peacekeeping force, it is understood, but they could potentially contribute in other ways.\n\nAsked on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg how many countries have said they would be willing to take part, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden said: “These discussions are going on, I think it’s important to have European countries involved in this.\n\n“The phrase ‘step up’ has been used quite a lot in recent weeks. The UK is stepping up.\n\n“The Prime Minister certainly stepped up and other countries have indicated that they want to do that.\n\n“Of course, coalition of the willing means people have to be up for it. They have to step forward themselves, they can’t be dragooned by us.\n\n“But the UK and the Prime Minister is playing an important role in those discussions, and will continue to do that.”","summary":"It comes as the UK’s national security adviser has been in Kyiv for talks over the weekend.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-kyiv-pat-mcfadden-b1215647.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/10/00/a4dfd9d16b8ef99aff3e0ff0b8f41479Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQxNjQ5MjUy-2.79248633.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:13:39","author":"Caitlin Doherty","authors":["Caitlin Doherty"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.107},{"id":298439904,"title":"China’s Retaliatory Tariffs on US Farm Goods Take Effect Monday","text":"Beijing’s move came after the Trump administration doubled a blanket tariff on all Chinese exports. China’s measures hit goods the Asian nation can source from other countries, shielding the domestic economy from blowback.\n\nChinese officials have signaled confidence they can navigate trade tensions with President Donald Trump. Last week, Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said on the sidelines of an annual legislative session in Beijing that central government has ample fiscal policy tools and space to respond to possible domestic and external challenges\n\nThe Chinese retaliation appeared calibrated to avoid any escalation after Trump kicked off a global trade war, leaving room for talks between the two sides. Though the US leader has signaled a willingness to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so far no discussions have been announced.\n\nThe new Chinese tariffs come as the Asian nation’s lawmakers gather for the National People’s Congress in Beijing. At the meeting last week, Premier Li Qiang set a growth goal of about 5%, an ambitious target given the trade uncertainties, a lingering property crisis and deflation dogging the economy.\n\nOn Sunday, official data showed consumer inflation dropped far more than expected to fall below zero for the first time in 13 months.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, decreased for the first time since 2021 with a drop of 0.1% — only the second time the gauge has contracted over more than 15 years.\n\nIn an effort to ramp up spending and counter US tariffs, Li also said China was raising its general budget deficit to the highest level in more than three decades.","summary":"Chinese tariffs as high as 15% on a range of US agricultural goods take effect Monday, potentially exacerbating a trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies.","url":"https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/chinas-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-farm-goods-take-effect-monday","image":"https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/775571455.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:13:07","author":"Bloomberg News","authors":["Bloomberg News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"CA","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":298443934,"title":"Former prime minister Jean ChrÃ©tien tells Trump to 'stop this nonsense' (Canada)","text":"Moments before the new Liberal leader was announced on Sunday, former prime minister Jean Chrétien took to the stage to reprimand U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs and threats to Canada's sovereignty.\n\nChrétien warned a crowd of Liberals gathered in Ottawa that Canada’s “long and fruitful” relationship with Americans was falling apart with continued hostility coming from the Trump administration.\n\nThe former prime minister applauded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government and Canada’s premiers for their leadership in the last few weeks standing up to Trump’s threats.\n\nHe said the government is right to retaliate and said Canadian governments could go even further, hitting Americans \"where it really hurts\" by imposing an export tax on oil and gas, potash, steel, aluminum and electricity. The money could be used to build up infrastructure, he suggested\n\nChrétien said the \"unjustified\" duties will be a lose-lose situation for both Canadians and Americans but that, for Canada, this is about “more than money.”\n\nHe urged Canadians to stand up for the country, adding that while Canada is a good neighbour, it’s also a proud and independent country.\n\n“From one old guy to another old guy, stop this nonsense,” Chrétien told the crowd. “Canada will never join the United States.”\n\nChrétien said Canada will remain “the best country in the world.” He thanked Trump for uniting Canadians \"as never before\" and joked that he should receive the Order of Canada.\n\n“Historically, despite our friendship, we have had problems but we always found a way to solve them,” he said. “We have worked with and collaborated with the U.S. in the past and I’m telling you we will do so in the future.”\n\n“We are going to be living very difficult times but I’m confident, I’m very confident that the next prime minister will work with the premiers, the leaders of all the political parties in the House of Commons and allies around the world to stand together to meet the challenges that Mr. Trump is creating for the whole world.”\n\nTrump has threatened Canada with tariffs and \"economic force\" to make it the 51st state.\n\nAfter imposing and then quickly pausing 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that sent markets tumbling over concerns of a trade war, Trump said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures\" that his plans for broader \"reciprocal\" tariffs will go into effect April 2.","summary":"Moments before the new Liberal leader was announced on Sunday, former prime minister Jean Chr&amp;eacute;tien took to the stage to reprimand U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs and threats to Canada&amp;#39;s sovereignty.

This year, it has been upped to eight ministers alongside both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Simon Harris. \n\nThe key message they will be delivering: Ireland is a great place to do business.\n\nThe Taoiseach will spend a day and a half in Austin before flying across to Washington DC to meet with US President Donald Trump. \n\nHere is everything you need to know about the Taoiseach’s trip. \n\nSt Patrick's Day Covid-style: Martin and Biden in 2022Alamy\n\nWhat’s on the agenda in Austin? \n\nThe Taoiseach arrived in Austin, the capital of Texas, late last night.\n\nToday he will pay a visit to the city’s popular South By Southwest Festival (SXSW), where he will participate in a fireside chat about Ireland’s relationship with the US and our innovation and creativity industry.\n\nHe is the only head of state to be interviewed at this year’s festival. \n\nThe festival has been the source of some controversy in the past. Last year, all ten acts from the island of Ireland who were scheduled to perform at the festival pulled out in protest over the fact it was sponsored by the US army.\n\nThen Arts Minister Catherine Martin received criticism for speaking at the festival as a result. \n\nIn response to the boycott by Irish artists, Texas Governor Greg Abbott told them: “Don’t come back… We are proud of the US military in Texas. If you don’t like it, don’t come here.”\n\nThe Taoiseach will meet with Abbott ahead of his fireside chat later today.\n\nTop of the agenda will be building and maintaining the two-way economic links between Texas and Ireland, with a focus on companies like Dell, which has its EU headquarters in Ireland and its US headquarters in Texas. \n\nLeo Varadkar meeting Greg Abbott in 2018Alamy\n\nWhile in Austin, the Taoiseach will also pay Dell HQ a visit and US software firm Tricentis, which is set to announce investment in Ireland. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a quick visit to the Texas State Legislature on Tuesday morning, he will then make his way to Washington. \n\nWhen does the bowl of shamrock get handed over? \n\nWednesday is the day most of the action will be happening for the Taoiseach this week, with the White House reception and shamrock ceremony taking place. \n\nIn the morning, he will start the day with a breakfast meeting with US Vice President JD Vance at the Naval Observatory before heading across to the White House for the bilateral meeting with President Trump. \n\nThe Taoiseach will be doing everything in his power to keep the public element of the meeting in the Oval Office focused on the positives.\n\nHis approach to Trump 2.0 has been to place greater weight on his actions, not his words – this will be tested in a room full of journalists. \n\nEveryone will be hoping to avoid a scene similar to the Zelenskyy visit two weeks ago.\n\nLater on Wednesday evening, the Taoiseach will return to the White House for the traditional shamrock ceremony and presentation. \n\nVaradkar and Trump in 2020Alamy\n\nWhat else will he be up to?\n\nA large portion of the Taoiseach’s trip to the States this year will be focused on business and enterprise.\n\nAs one Government source put it: “That’s the real meat of this trip for us.” \n\nAs well as the now traditional Ireland Funds Gala on Thursday evening, the Taoiseach will also be meeting with a variety of US firms operating in Ireland and Irish firms doing business in the States.\n\nDonald Trump and Enda Kenny in 2017Alamy\n\nOn top of this, he will be doing a run of US media while there, with interviews on Fox and BBC International expected. \n\nThe Taoiseach has also set some time aside on his final day to meet with high level representatives of the US Jewish community. \n\nThis meeting will be focused on discussing the rise of global antisemitism and actions by Ireland to combat antisemitism, both at home and internationally.\n\nAre there any banana skins?\n\nGovernment sources have projected an air of confidence about this trip, but behind the scenes, Trump’s propensity to shock has Ireland nervous.\n\nRecent weeks have shown just how quickly global norms can change and Micheál Martin will have the difficult task of trying to promote Ireland’s best interest while also delivering Ireland’s message on international issues like Gaza, Ukraine and European security.\n\nIf there is one thing we know for sure about Donald Trump and MAGA 2.0 it is to expect the unexpected.\n\nThe Taoiseach’s team will be hoping they have him prepped for every eventuality. \n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nJane Matthews\n\nView 7 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Taoiseach has landed in the US for perhaps the most high stakes St Patrick's Day visit yet”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Taoiseach has landed in the US for perhaps the most high stakes St Patrick's Day visit yet”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

This guy who has done nothing but talk smack about the president since day one,” the musician said. \n\nDuring an episode of “The Glenn Beck Podcast,” which aired Mar. 8, Rock (real name Robert James Ritchie) told host Glenn Beck that he first thought of setting up the dinner with Trump and Maher, who has been vocal about his distaste for the Republican president, when he recently stopped by the comedian’s “Club Random” podcast.\n\nThe “Cowboy” singer, an ardent Trump supporter, said he feels he could find “common ground” and “break bread” with the political commentator, calling Maher “actually more reasonable than a lot of people on the right would think.” \n\nAs much as Maher has dug his heels into Trump, he has also sounded off over his gripes about liberals and the overall current state of America’s political climate. \n\n“I was doing [Maher’s] podcast, I said, if I could hook you guys up…and trust me, there’s a lot more people deserving at that table for dinner so it’s a big deal to me to bring [Maher] there and to even have the president be like, ‘yeah, do it, let’s do it,’ Rock said. “I go, man, what would it say to this country?”\n\nRock continued, “Let’s start at the top with [two] very public figures — a television comedian and president of the free world — and we can just break bread, have some laughs, take a picture and be like, ‘hey, you know, we don’t agree on everything, but we got along.’” \n\nThe “Joe Dirt” actor went on to claim the president dining with such a vocal critic like Maher could possibly spark opposing political sides to come together despite their differing opinions. \n\n“Does that start to send a message to people...I think we just gotta start somewhere,” Rock added. “Maybe [it will inspire someone] to call that family member that you got into it with over politics.” \n\nWatch Rock’s appearance on “The Glenn Beck Podcast” below.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/kid-rock-says-bringing-infamous-000340272.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/194b42fb939c02ec1ba0cf66dd58b993","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:03:40","author":"Jazmin Tolliver","authors":["Jazmin Tolliver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":298438502,"title":"Team Trump’s crackdown on campus hate is a defense of decency and a push against perverted privilege","text":"With the reported arrest and likely deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a noncitizen ringleader of antisemitic protests at Columbia and Barnard, ICE has put fresh teeth on President Donald Trump’s crackdown on campus hate.

He also slammed Mr Trump’s tariff policies.\n\n“We didn’t ask for this fight,” he stressed.\n\n“We are facing the greatest crisis of our lifetimes. We have to do extraordinary things. We have to build things we never imagined we would have to, at a pace we never imagined we would have to.\n\n“Who’s ready to stand up for Canada with me?”\n\nAs you would expect, that got a cheer. There has been a surge in defiant national pride among the usually mild Canadians since Mr Trump took office.\n\nThe exact timing of the handover has yet to be finalised; Mr Carney and Mr Trudeau will work that out in the coming days.\n\n“This is a nation-defining moment,” Mr Trudeau told the convention.\n\n“Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given.”\n\nWho is Mark Carney?\n\nMr Carney, who was the overwhelming frontrunner throughout the leadership campaign, previously served as governor of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.\n\nHe was endorsed by a long list of senior Liberal Party politicians, including much of Mr Trudeau’s cabinet.\n\nBut his elevation is unusual in one sense: he will be only the second Canadian prime minister ever to take office without holding a seat in parliament.\n\nMr Carney made a fortune as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before entering the Canadian civil service.\n\nSince leaving the Bank of England in 2020, he has served as a United Nations envoy working to get the private sector to invest in climate-friendly technology, and has held other private sector roles.\n\nHe has never served in parliament or held an elected public office. Analysts say his untested campaign skills could prove a liability against a Conservative Party which is already running attack ads accusing him of shifting positions and misrepresenting his experience.\n\nThe 59-year-old has positioned himself as a new voice untainted by Mr Trudeau, who he has said did not devote enough attention to building Canada’s economy.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Carney said Canadians “from coast to coast” wanted change, and referred to himself as a political outsider.\n\n“It’s getting to the point where, after two months, I may have to start calling myself a politician,” he joked.\n\nElection looms\n\nThe new prime minister will soon face an election. Polls currently show the Conservatives are slight favourites to win.\n\nMr Carney spent the leadership campaign arguing he was the best candidate to defend Canada against Mr Trump’s attacks.\n\nThe US President has repeatedly spoken about annexing Canada and thrown bilateral trade, the lifeblood of the Canadian economy, into chaos with dizzying tariff actions that have veered in various directions since he took office.\n\nMr Trudeau announced his resignation in January after taking time to “reflect over the holidays”.\n\n“This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it’s become clear to me that if I’m having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,” he said outside Rideau Cottage, his residence.\n\nMr Trudeau said he was a “fighter” but added parliament had been “paralysed for months”.\n\n“It’s time for a reset”, he added, and for the “temperature to come down” in Canadian politics.\n\nMr Trudeau has since faced further pressure from Mr Trump.\n\nReacting to Mr Trudeau’s resignation back in January, Mr Trump shared a post on Truth Social suggesting the Canada should merge with the US to form a “great nation”.\n\n“Many people in Canada LOVE being the 51st State,” Mr Trump wrote.\n\n“The United States can no longer suffer the massive Trade Deficits and Subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this, and resigned.\n\n“If Canada merged with the US, there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them. Together, what a great Nation it would be!!!”\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland quit in December after disagreeing with Mr Trudeau over how to respond to Mr Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nData released from the Angus Reid polling firm on Wednesday showed Canadians deemed Mr Carney as the favourite choice to face off against Mr Trump, potentially offering the Liberals a boost over the opposition Conservatives.\n\nForty-three per cent of respondents said they trusted Mr Carney the most to deal with Mr Trump, with 34 per cent backing Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nBefore Mr Trudeau announced his plans to resign in January, the Liberals were heading for a dramatic electoral wipe-out, but the leadership change and Mr Trump’s hectoring have tightened the race.\n\nIn the coming days, Mr Trudeau and the new Liberal leader will visit Canada’s Governor-General Mary Simon – King Charles III’s official representative in Canada – who will task the leader with forming a government.\n\nSon of former PM\n\nThe eldest son of the charismatic former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who died in 2000, Mr Trudeau came late to politics after working as a snowboard instructor, bartender, bouncer and teacher.\n\nHe was first elected to the House of Commons in 2008 to represent a working-class Montreal neighbourhood.\n\nHe brought in Senate reforms, signed a new trade deal with the United States and introduced a carbon tax to reduce Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions during his first two terms as prime minister.\n\nThe father of three also legalised cannabis, held a public inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and passed legislation permitting medically assisted suicide.\n\nIn 2023, Mr Trudeau separated from his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau after 18 years of marriage.\n\nThey were wed in Montreal in 2005 but made fewer public appearances together in recent years.\n\nThey announced their separation on social media saying the decision followed “meaningful and difficult conversations”.\n\n“We remain a close family with deep love and respect for each other and for everything we have built and will continue to build,” a statement said.\n\nThe couple share three children, Xavier, 17, Ella-Grace 16, and Hadrien, 11.","summary":"Justin Trudeau’s replacement as Canada’s prime minister has been named – and they’ve celebrated with a potshot at Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/mark-carney-chosen-to-replace-justin-trudeau-as-canadas-prime-minister/news-story/f2e31708cd34d5488413b808e561506c?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/45b3810b5d4a3b747da2097d5954b381","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:01:21","author":"Megan Palin,Samuel Clench","authors":["Megan Palin","Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":298438338,"title":"‘Umm’: Trump fans fears of US recession","text":"Donald Trump has declined to rule out the possibility of America entering a recession this year, as the markets continue to fret about his tariffs, and speculation that the US economy will contract in the first quarter keeps mounting.\n\nWeak jobs data, released over the weekend, was not particularly reassuring.\n\n“There are rising worries about a slowdown,” Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo told Mr Trump during a sitdown interview today.\n\n“Are you expecting a recession this year?”\n\n“Umm, I hate to predict things like that,” Mr Trump responded after a pause.\n\n“There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.

He confidently claimed the US would endure not merely a recession, but a full-blown “depression” if his political opponent won in both 2020 and 2024.\n\nThis did not pan out after the former election; the US economy recorded GDP growth of more than 3 per cent, on average, during Joe Biden’s presidency. Of course, Americans still had to suffer through high inflation, which contributed to Mr Biden’s putrid approval ratings.\n\nBut he’s gone now, reading in some gazebo in Delaware, presumably. The markets have moved on to worrying about Mr Trump’s policies.\n\nThe President has repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to impose blanket “reciprocal tariffs” worldwide at the start of April. That involves adding up any factors the he believes put the US at a disadvantage in trade, such as existing tariffs from other nations, subsidies their governments give to certain industries, value-added taxes (like Australia’s GST), etc, and imposing a tariff to compensate for them.\n\nIt’s a monumental exercise; we’re talking about the calculation of a separate tariff rate for every product from every country. The bureaucratic work required is daunting. And that is without accounting for the effect these tariffs will have on America’s economy.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was more optimistic than the President when pressed about the threat of a recession during his own TV interview today.\n\n“Consumer sentiment is dropping. Inflation has ticked up. Major banks like JP Morgan and Godman Sachs now say a recession in the next 12 months is becoming more likely. Should Americans brace for a recession?” NBC host Kristen Welker asked him.\n\n“Absolutely not,” said Mr Lutnick.\n\n“Anybody who bets against Donald Trump – it’s like, the same people who thought Donald Trump wasn’t a winner a year ago.\n\n“Donald Trump is a winner. He’s going to win for the American people. That’s just the way it’s going to be. There’s going to be no recession in America.\n\n“Donald Trump is bringing growth to America.

Now, she said, the grouping had “got a bit out of control”.\n“Where it’s not helpful is as a coordination of foreign-policy positioning, and that’s where it’s heading,” she said, adding that it would be more useful “if it goes back to being a quiet intelligence-sharing pool”.\nIndeed, the Five Eyes issued a joint statement in 2021 criticising that year’s Legislative Council election in Hong Kong. But such releases were later discontinued in favour of joint communiques between member nations – such as those issued by Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the war in Gaza – according to geopolitical analyst Geoffrey Miller.\nUnder Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, expansion of the alliance’s purview “may well have continued under the surface”, said Miller, who works with the Democracy Project at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.\n\nBut given the deepening rift between the US and Canada over tariffs, and Washington’s differences with the UK and others when it comes to Ukraine, he said that the alliance appeared likely to “remain in more of a holding pattern than expansion mode for now”.\n“This would probably mean the Five Eyes would focus on its original intelligence-sharing function, which has been in the mutual interest of the five countries involved for the best part of 80 years and has survived crises in the past,” Miller said.\nFor the alliance to remain relevant, however, it must also navigate the growing complexities of US-China rivalry and an evolving security landscape.\nStephen Nagy, a professor of international studies at Japan’s International Christian University, warned that Five Eyes’ members such as Australia, which had been pursuing warmer ties with China in recent years, would have to adapt to Washington’s increasingly hawkish stance towards Beijing.\n“If they decide to deviate from the Five Eyes, I think they will not be at the table, but on the menu in terms of how geopolitics reshapes the global economy, security, competition and challenges to the region,” he said.\nIf they decide to deviate from the Five Eyes, I think they will not be at the table, but on the menu\nStephen Nagy, international-relations professor\nThe alliance has faced setbacks before, including the suspension of full intelligence-sharing with New Zealand in the wake of Wellington’s nuclear-free policy in the 1980s. Cooperation was fully restored only in 2009 under then-US president Barack Obama. But the stakes today are higher, with the alliance’s cohesion being tested by everything from trade disputes to disagreements over military aid to Ukraine.\nThe current Five Eyes debate in New Zealand mirrors a larger reckoning over the country’s foreign policy, Miller said. After decades of pursuing a more independent approach, Wellington has been drawing closer to the US and Australia, especially in response to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific.\nStill, “the secrecy of the grouping makes it challenging to make definitive judgments over the exact nature of the cooperation,” he said, while noting that there were signs of increased data sharing on issues like migration.\nNagy said former prime minister Clark’s remarks reflected her track record of being “relatively out of sync” with the rest of the Five Eyes – such as when she declined to send her country’s troops to join US, UK and Australian forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\n“[But] in reality, the New Zealand government has clearly identified the challenge of China in terms of the Indo-Pacific region, its future and what it means for a strong, punitive China to be the regional hegemon,” he said, citing a 2023 defence review in which Wellington explicitly named China as a potential threat.\nAs for Washington’s true thoughts on the alliance, Ian Hall, an international-relations professor at Australia’s Griffith University, said it was “telling” that Navarro had denied commenting on Canada’s membership.\n“The US depends on intelligence collection and analysis done by the other Five Eyes, and it would lose out if serious harm was done to the arrangement,” he told This Week in Asia.\n“That said, we have no idea how much damage President Trump is going to do to this arrangement, among many others. He has already done so many things that will weaken the US, its ability to defend its interests, and its relations with friends and allies.”\nIn recent days, the US president has paused intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, saying he’d had “serious discussions with Russia” about a potential peace deal, following a fiery clash with his Ukrainian counterpart in the Oval Office late last month.\nWhat happens next is uncertain, but one thing is clear: Five Eyes, an intelligence network that for years operated in the shadows, is now firmly in the spotlight.","summary":"With questions being raised about Canada’s continued membership, doubts cloud the integrity of the decades-old intelligence-sharing alliance.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3301537/fractures-threaten-five-eyes-future-trumps-america-first-era-unfolds","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/07/8445f498-70d7-48dd-9212-b358e24d8544_d65d506c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:00:23","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.053},{"id":298444054,"title":"China’s falling arms imports signal massive growth in military self-reliance","text":"China’s arms imports dropped by nearly two-thirds over the past five years as overseas weapons purchases were increasingly substituted with home-grown technology, according to a Swedish think tank.\nIn a report released today, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said there was a 64 per cent fall in deliveries to China between 2020-24, compared with the previous five years.\nThe change was driven by the growth in China’s domestic weapons industry, with locally designed and produced systems replacing equipment that was previously mainly bought from Russia – a trend that was likely to continue, the report said.\nSiemon Wezeman, senior researcher with SIPRI’s arms transfers programme, said it took 30 years for China to successively replace imported hi-tech weapons with locally developed technologies.\n“In the last five years, the biggest things that they still imported from Russia were basically two things, helicopters and engines – they are actually extremely difficult to produce if you don’t have a background in it – and that is where China has broken through,” he said.\n“China [now] makes its own engines for combat aircraft, transport aircraft and ships. The same [goes] with helicopters, where China has developed its own helicopters, completely Chinese, and is phasing out imports of those from Russia and also from European designs.”\nThe decrease in Chinese imports contributed to an overall reduction of 21 per cent in combined weapons shipments to countries in Asia and Oceania. The region’s share of global arms imports also fell from 41 per cent in 2015–19 to 33 per cent.\nEast Asia in particular saw arms imports shrink by 22 per cent, not only because of the fall in demand from mainland China, but also thanks to decreases in Taiwanese and South Korean purchases of 27 and 24 per cent, respectively.\nJapan was the only country in the region to increase its amount of imported weaponry, recording a 93 per cent rise, according to the SIPRI report.\n\nChina also dropped out of the top 10 arms importers for the first time since 1990-94, while four countries from the Asia and Oceania region – India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia – joined the ranks of the world’s largest weapons recipients.\n“While arms imports to Europe and the Middle East continue to grab media attention, Asia and Oceania remained the largest arms-importing region in the world in 2020–24, as it has been almost invariably since the early 1990s,” Wezeman said.\n“Threat perceptions concerning China are behind much of the arms procurement in the region.”\nWith the continuing Russian invasion of Ukraine, Europe more than doubled its imports of arms, with overall growth of 155 per cent in 2020-24. Ukraine was also the only European state to make the top 10 largest importers, according to the report.\nIn fact, Ukraine became the world’s largest recipients of weapons, taking 8.8 per cent of global arms shipments – an increase of 9,627 per cent or nearly 100 times its 2015-2019 deliveries.\nAt least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in 2022, with substantial further deliveries in the pipeline. Most came from the US, with a 45 per cent share, followed by Germany on 12 per cent and Poland with 11 per cent.\nNato’s European members saw a 105 per cent increase – more than doubling on the previous five-year period – with 64 per cent of their arms shipments coming from the US, compared with 2015-19’s 52 per cent.\nOther main suppliers to Nato countries in Europe were France and South Korea, which each accounted for 6.5 per cent, followed by Germany with 4.7 per cent and Israel on 3.9 per cent.\nAccording to the report, the growth in arms imports among the European Nato member states was driven by their response to the Russian war on Ukraine as well as uncertainty over US foreign policy during President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nTurning to arms exports, SIPRI said that 44 states took deliveries of Chinese weapons in 2020-24, most of them in Asia and Oceania which accounted for a 77 per cent share, followed by Africa which received 14 per cent.\nOne customer stood out, with 63 per cent of China’s exported weapons heading to Pakistan.\nChinese arms suppliers have become even more dominant in Islamabad’s acquisition and procurement, accounting for 81 per cent of incoming weapons in 2020-24 compared with 74 per cent in the preceding five years.\nWhile China was the fourth largest arms exporter, there was a 5.4 per cent decrease in its weapons shipments compared with 2015-19, as well as a fall in its share of global weapons sales, from 6.2 per cent to 5.9 per cent.\nDespite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, the report said many large importers were not buying Chinese weapons systems for political reasons.\n\nMajor markets such as India, Japan and the Middle East are not accessible for China’s suppliers because they fear the potential effect on their relations with the US and other Western countries, Wezeman said.\n“Many countries buy weapons, not just because they want weapons but also because they want a relationship with the supplier – an alliance,” he said, citing Middle Eastern countries as an example.\nHe said they hoped these sales would “cement their relations” with Western countries that they hoped would come to the aid if attacked.\n“The US can do that and has a track record of coming to [countries’] aid. China doesn’t have that ability yet, or it hasn’t shown that ability yet, so that is also an issue that plays there,” Wezeman added.\n“That all basically limits Chinese markets to smaller places in Africa, its traditional ally, Pakistan, and a number of states in Asia that are generally quite friendly towards China and over the years have often bought Chinese weapons, like Bangladesh and Myanmar.”\nThe US continues to top the list of the world’s biggest arms suppliers, with the SIPRI report noting a 21 per cent increase in American weapons exports that raised its global share to 43 per cent.\nEurope overtook the Middle East by two per cent to become the United States’ biggest customer by region for the first time in two decades, taking 35 per cent of American arms exports. However, Saudi Arabia was the top single recipient, with a 12 per cent share.\nIn contrast, Russia’s military exports fell by 64 per cent, with its global share tumbling from 21 per cent in 2015-19 to just 7.8 per cent over the following period, putting it in third place behind France, now the world’s second largest with a 9.6 per cent share.","summary":"SIPRI report shows Chinese-developed technologies are replacing imported hi-tech weaponry in several spheres.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3301475/chinas-falling-arms-imports-signal-massive-growth-military-self-reliance","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/07/430e0935-da3f-4df0-90f1-72af290e3703_0ef12405.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 00:00:13","author":"Seong Hyeon Choi","authors":["Seong Hyeon Choi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":298441698,"title":"Canada election results are in.

He is expected to be sworn in early this week.\n\nCarney, 59, whose resume is filled with decades of experience working at the highest levels of global finance but has never been elected to public office, now faces his first major economic reckoning as prime minister – managing Canada's trade relationship with the United States.\n\nTrump's Trade War Boosts Carney's Popularity\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs and controversial comments about Canada becoming the 51st state likely played a role in Carney's win, and could help his party – which was struggling against the conservatives in the polls just two months ago – hold onto power in the next general election.\n\n\"Canadians are really feeling angry, hurt. Canada feels so disrespected in this relationship right now,\" Jamie Tronnes, the executive director of the Center for North American Prosperity and Security told NPR. \"This has led to a resurgent nationalism, which is something that we haven't seen the likes of in a long time in Canada, that has really benefited the Liberal Party.\"\n\nCarney's election makes him only the second prime minister in Canadian history without a seat in parliament. While there is no rule against this, precedent suggests Carney will call federal elections soon after being sworn in as prime minister where he will face off with conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nAs the Liberal party's popularity continues to surge in the polls, many Canadians see Carney as a steady, diplomatic globalist who knows how to navigate international challenges, particularly with the U.S. under Trump's increasingly strongman negotiating tactics.\n\nIn contrast, Poilievre has faced criticism for an alignment with Trump-like rhetoric, including vows to put \"Canada First.\"\n\n\"Progressive voters really respond to [Poilievre] like they would respond to a Trump-type character,\" said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs, a global public opinion research group. \"He's more aggressive than Canadians are comfortable with.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has marched on with threats to impose more tariffs on Canadian goods, which could cripple Canada's economy. The escalating trade tensions come as the two countries remain entangled in an ongoing trade dispute that has already seen tariffs imposed on key sectors such as steel, aluminum, and agriculture.\n\nBut Carney knows what it's weather through tough economic storms. He served as Governor of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis and later became the first non-British person to be appointed as Governor of the Bank of England, where he oversaw the bank's post-Brexit transition.","summary":"Carney, 59, will succeed Justin Trudeau, who announced in January that he would step down amid low approval ratings following a decade in office.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/09/nx-s1-5322459/mark-carney-canada-new-prime-minister","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3427x2285+0+0/resize/3427x2285!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2F5b%2Ff702e8874c4594abc64adb31e0b9%2Fap25066715742925.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:57:40","author":"Rebecca Rosman","authors":["Rebecca Rosman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":298437770,"title":"‘genuinely concerning’: Dutton slammed over Ukraine swipe","text":"The Opposition leader accused Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of “shooting from the hip” following the pledge to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer late last week. \n\nHe urged the PM to “make informed judgments on what’s in the country’s best interest” and described the prospect of Aussie boots on the ground as “unbelievable”. \n\nAsked about the swipe, Mr Marles said support for Ukraine enjoyed bipartisan support and that any request for peacekeepers would be given “due consideration”.\n\n“What has surprised me is that Peter Dutton has sought to politicise this in a way which really beggars belief,” Mr Marles told the ABC.\n\n“All we’re saying we’ll do is give due consideration to the kind of requests ... for that support, which we’ve thought has enjoyed bipartisan support.\n\n“And yet Peter Dutton, on the eve of an election, is out there trying to politicise this, which is genuinely concerning. \n\n“Anybody who thinks that national interest can be compromised in the face of seeking votes, or what seems to be popular, frankly, is not fit to govern. \n\n“It is really important that we stay the course here and that means that we provide our support to Ukraine.”\n\nSupport for Ukraine has gained renewed focus following the disastrous meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Trump had accused Mr Zelensky of “gambling with world war three” and not being interested in peace talks with Russia after its 2022 full-scale invasion.\n\nMr Starmer has since rallied support both in Europe and abroad for a “coalition of the willing” to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia. \n\nMr Albanese said Australia would participate in a meeting of the Chiefs of Defence in Paris on Tuesday, but that it was too early to say what Australia’s contribution would be. \n\n“Both of our nations are very clear about our support for Ukraine and it of course is too early — you can’t have peacekeeping forces without having peace,” he said.\n\n“But I certainly have said, very clearly, publicly, repeatedly, that we would give consideration to participating in any peacekeeping mission in the Ukraine.”\n\nSome of those sentiments were echoed by Mr Dutton in his criticism of the PM’s pledge, stating that “there’s no peace yet” and so “no peace to keep”. \n\n“It’s unbelievable the PM’s talking about moving troops from Australia to … Ukraine when Italy, Germany, France has made no decision yet to base troops there,” he said.\n\nMr Dutton described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on its second anniversary last year as “illegal, immoral, and abominable” and a “cruel reality of history hit home”. \n\n“Within two months of Russia’s invasion, the former Coalition Government delivered a comprehensive $285 million package of support for Ukraine,” he said.\n\n“The Coalition has given bipartisan support to every announcement made subsequent to Australia’s change in government.”","summary":"Peter Dutton has been accused of “politicising” support for Ukraine after he slammed a pledge by the PM to potentially put Aussie boots on the ground.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/deputy-pm-marles-slams-dutton-for-politicising-ukraine-after-albaneses-troops-pledge/news-story/e6708e89208ed59c22766f891b4045af?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/30169f92ea9457fd7cca29580b49ddae","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:56:18","author":"Mr Dutton","authors":["Mr Dutton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":298440636,"title":"US stock futures sink, yen gains on China deflationary pressures, trade war - TradingView","text":"Wall Street futures sank and the safe-haven yen strengthened early on Monday as building deflationary pressures in China added to growth worries from a fading U.S. economy and a simmering global trade war.\n\nU.S. S&P 500 e-mini stock futures ES1!

Trudeau cries during goodbye speech as he steps down as Canadian prime minister and criticizes Donald Trump again – Mark Carney named as his replacement from Bank of England","text":"A weeping Justin Trudeau has taken one last swipe at Donald Trump during his final speech as Prime Minister of Canada. \n\nTrudeau, who was forced to resign following a wave of resignations from his cabinet in the final months of 2024, was seen dabbing his eyes with a tissue during a conference to his Liberal party tonight. \n\nThe 53-year-old leader will be replaced by former Bank of England boss Mark Carney, who tonight won his party’s leadership race and accused Trump of ‘attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses.’\n\nTrudeau said: ‘Don’t get me wrong, I’m damn proud of what we’ve done over these past 10 years. But tonight is about our future as a party, as a country.’\n\nReferencing the ongoing threat of massive economic tariffs from US president Donald Trump that could cripple the country’s economy, the outgoing PM said that Canada is ‘a country who will fight when we must, elbows up.’\n\nHe added that Canadians are now showing ‘what makes us… by proudly embracing who we are’ amid existential challenged. \n\nTrudeau then told the gathered members of the Liberal Party conference: ‘Your country needs you maybe more than ever. And I have no doubt that you will answer the call, because you’ve done it before. Liberals will meet this moment.’\n\nHe describes the current moment of history as a ‘nation-defining moment’, adding: ‘Democracy is not a given, freedom is not a given, even Canada is not a given.’\n\nNone of those happened by accident or will continue without effort, Trudeau said, adding: ‘It takes courage, it takes sacrifice, it takes hope and hard work’.\n\nCarney’s first speech as the incoming PM saw him accuse Trump of seeking to control Canada by force. \n\nHe said: ‘The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country.’\n\nCarney added that Trump is ‘attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses. We cannot let him succeed.’\n\nThe former Bank of England leader will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United States and must hold a general election soon.\n\nCarney, 59, took 86% of votes cast to beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland in a contest in which just under 152,000 party members voted.\n\nThe political novice argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canada’s export-dependent economy.\n\nCarney was the front-runner, with the most endorsements from party members and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates.\n\nCarney’s win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks – Canada and England – meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump.\n\nDuring the campaign, Carney said he supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs against the United States and a coordinated strategy to boost investment. He has repeatedly complained that Canada’s growth under Trudeau was not good enough.\n\nThe prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump’s tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes.\n\nAt the start of 2025, the party trailed by 20 or more points but is now statistically tied with the official opposition Conservatives led by career politician Pierre Poilievre in several polls.\n\nAt a protest outside Canada’s Parliament building in Ottawa on Sunday, dozens of Canadians held up signs protesting Trump with no reference to domestic politics.\n\n‘There is a rallying-around-the-flag moment that we would never have predicted a year ago,’ said University of British Columbia politics professor Richard Johnston. ‘I think it’s probably true as we speak that the Liberals have been saved from oblivion.’\n\nTwo Liberal Party sources said Carney would call an election in coming weeks.\n\nPolls though indicate that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives would be able to form a majority government. An election must be held by October 20.\n\nCarney could legally serve as prime minister without a seat in the House of Commons but tradition dictates that he should seek to win one as soon as possible.\n\nIn 1984, John Turner was not a legislator when he became prime minister after winning a Liberal leadership race.\n\nLiberals sought to compare Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday.\n\nThe Liberals ‘are going to pull a sneaky trick tonight,’ Poilievre said at a campaign rally. ‘They’re going to try to get elected for a fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser, Mark Carney. … Donald Trump will have a big smile on his face.’\n\nCarney has played down any role in advising Trudeau, noting his many global obligations left him with little time. Carney resigned all commercial posts after he launched his leadership bid in January.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA weeping Justin Trudeau has taken one last swipe at Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Justin Trudeau cries during goodbye speech as he steps down as Canadian prime minister and criticizes Donald Trump again – Mark Carney named as his replacement from Bank of England first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/justin-trudeau-cries-during-goodbye-speech-as-he-steps-down-as-canadian-prime-minister-and-criticizes-donald-trump-again-mark-carney-named-as-his-replacement-from-bank-of-england/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Justin-Trudeau-sheds-tears-in-farewell-speech.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:43:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":298441404,"title":"Ex-central banker Mark Carney to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister after winning","text":"Former central banker Mark Carney will become Canada's next prime minister after the governing Liberal Party elected him its leader Sunday as the country deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and annexation threat, and a federal election looms.\n\nCarney, 59, replaces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remains prime minister until his successor is sworn in in the coming days.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SONIA HORON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:20 GMT, 9 March 2025 |Updated:23:30 GMT, 9 March 2025 \n\nHailey Bieber dismissed claims that she 'liked' a shady social media post mocking Selena Gomez and her fiancé Benny Blanco.\nTikTok user Courtney Presto has claimed that the Rhode founder, 28, reacted to a clip she posted on February 14, regarding Selena, 32, and Benny's, 37, photo shoot with Interview magazine, in which she made fun of some of the images featuring the pair. \nHowever, a representative for Hailey has refuted the claims on Sunday. 'This never happened,' her spokesperson told Us Weekly.\n'This entire story has been fabricated by a content creator looking to capitalize off of an old, tired narrative,' Hailey's rep added. \nGomez and Hailey's husband, Justin Bieber, 31, had an on-again, off-again relationship from 2009 to 2018. \nHailey began dating him shortly after his final split with Gomez. Both Justin and Hailey have denied any overlap in their relationships. \n\nHailey Bieber, 28, dismissed claims that she 'liked' a social media post mocking Selena Gomez, 32, and her fiancé Benny Blanco; 37; Hailey pictured March 2 at Vanity Fair Oscar Party in LA\n\nA representative for Justin Bieber's wife has refuted the claims on Sunday. 'This never happened,' her spokesperson told Us Weekly; Selena and Benny seen at the Oscars in March\nIn the seven-second video, TikTok creator Courtney appeared to be mocking some of the images - which included a rather bizarre snap of Selena's feet resting on Benny's cheeks.\n'This is the WORST,' Courtney captioned the post, and told her followers: 'Sorry to do this to everyone but I had to look at these photos so you do too.'\n\n Selena Gomez pens tribute to Benny Blanco after Hailey Bieber made 'dig' at their relationship \nShe added: 'I genuinely can't decide which is the worst.'\nAccording to Courtney, Hailey liked the video - and it didn't go unnoticed by other TikTok users either.\n'Hailey Bieber why are you liking this,' one person commented, while another said: 'Hailey Bieber is so obsessed with Selena like girl??? CMON LEAVE HER ALONE.'\nA third person pointed out: 'This only having 5k likes and it STILL landed on Hailey's fyp.. oh she's obsessed.'\nAnd a fourth person asked: 'How did this even come up on your fyp Hailey? I literally told y'all the girl will forever hate Selena.'\nMeanwhile Selena has brushed off the drama and reshared an Instagram video posted by a fan of her and Benny cruising in a pink convertible on Sunday.\nThe singer was seen behind the wheel, with Benny in the passenger seat, as they chatted together while enjoying a sunny drive.\nShe also shared a video of herself discussing her and Benny's new album, titled 'I Said I Love You First', set to be released on March 21.\n\n'This entire story has been fabricated by a content creator looking to capitalize off of an old, tired narrative,' Hailey's rep added.

She then shared that in honor of the album she will be giving away some 'rare memories'\n\nSelena then posted an image calendar titled '12 Days of Really Rare Stuff' that kicks off on Monday, Match 10th\n\nSelena said the album is about 'past, present, and future.'\nShe then shared that in honor of the album she will be giving away some 'rare memories.'\nSelena then posted an image calendar titled '12 Days of Really Rare Stuff' that kicks off on Monday, Match 10th.\nThe day prior, she shared a gushing birthday tribute to Benny with an Instagram post as he celebrated turning 37 on Saturday.\nThe Emilia Perez actress uploaded an assortment of adorable snaps of the pair alongside a sweet caption.\n'I'm not sure what I did to deserve you but d**n am I glad you were born.. happy birthday baby,' Gomez typed out.\nThe Eastside hitmaker shared a response to the birthday post in the comment section and wrote, 'i love u wifey.'\nLate last year in December, the former Disney channel actress announced that Blanco had popped the big question and showcased her eye-catching marquise diamond ring.\nIt comes after DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Selena went out of her way to avoid Hailey at the Vanity Fair Oscars party last weekend.\nBoth ladies were in attendance at the star-studded bash in Beverly Hills, and both looked stunning in black gowns.\nA source told DailyMail.com: 'There was no way Selena wanted an awkward photo and for everyone to write about it the next day.'\n\nSelena apparently 'avoided' her ex's wife Hailey at the Vanity Fair Oscar party on March 2 \n\n'Selena took a picture with Hailey in the past and it didn't feel right,' a source told DailyMail.com; pictured in 2022 \n\nJustin and Selena, seen here in 2010, were together on and off for several years and split for good in 2018\n\n'It was her night, she was a presenter at the Oscars for Emilia Perez, a film she is proud of, so she wanted the focus on that,' added the insider.\nBut it was also claimed the Good For You singer would have been fine saying hello to the Vogue supermodel.\n'If they ran into each other, she would say hello of course, because Selena is a friendly person. She just wanted to avoid being photographed with her or near her because then 100 stories are born.'\n'Selena took a picture with Hailey in the past and it didn't feel right.'\nJustin and Hailey Bieber married in September 2018, followed by a larger vow renewal ceremony a year later. During their newlywed period they faced frequent criticism from Gomez's fanbase.\nIn 2022, Hailey set the record straight regarding the timeline of her and Justin's relationship after years of fan-driven speculation that she 'stole' him from Selena.\nDuring her appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, the model insisted to host Alexis Cooper that Justin had not cheated on Gomez with her.\n'No, not once,' she stated, adding that she and Justin began 'hooking up' after he'd already split from his former on/off girlfriend in early 2018.\n'When him and I started hooking up, or anything of that sort, he was not in any relationship, It's not my character to mess with someone's relationship, I was raised better than that,' Hailey stressed.\nHowever, in February 2023, rumors that Hailey and Selena were fighting started to spread once again after Hailey shared a TikTok video in which some believed she was making fun of Selena.\nJoined by close friends Kendall Jenner and Justine Skye, the ladies lip-synced along to the words: 'I’m not saying she deserves it, but God’s timing is always right.'\nThe clip was shared right around the time that Selena was receiving a lot of negative attention over a set of unflattering paparazzi photos that were taken of her during a trip to Mexico - and based on the suspicious timing of Hailey's post, many were convinced that she was shading Selena.\n\nJustin and Hailey, seen here in 2022, have been married since 2018 and now share a son named Jack\n\nThe TikTok was swiftly deleted, and Hailey insisted in a comment that the video had nothing to do with her husband's ex.\nHowever, the drama didn't end there. Fans then became convinced that Hailey's pal Kylie Jenner was mocking Selena days later.\nThe actress had shared a post to TikTok admitting that she had 'accidentally laminated' her brows too much.\nTaking to Instagram, Kylie posted a snap in a very similar pose along with the accompanying caption: 'This was an accident?'\nThe reality star appeared to add even more fuel to the fire by sharing a screenshot from a recent FaceTime call with Hailey right after - during which they both zoomed in on their eyebrows.\nHowever, Kylie denied that she was bashing Selena in a comment, stating, 'This is reaching.'\nInstagramBenny BlancoSelena Gomez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHailey Bieber breaks silence on Selena Gomez 'dig' after claims Justin Bieber's wife 'liked' shady video\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 22\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

In his acceptance speech, Carney reassured his supporters that Canada will retain its independence and not merge with the United States in any way.\n\nCarney garnered an impressive 86% of the vote, equivalent to 131,764 votes out of the 151,899 ballots cast by the nearly 400,000 registered party members who took part in the leadership election.\n\nThe newly elected Liberal leader urged his party members to gear up for what he termed as “the most crucial election of our generation,” stressing that the upcoming challenges are of paramount significance.\n\nHe said, Canada is the “greatest country in the world and now our neighbors want to take us. No way,” said the incoming Canadian prime minister referring to President Donald Trump’s repeated desire for the U.S. to annex Canada as the “51st state.”\n\nBut regardless of the Liberals having a new leader with some momentum in the polls, Canada’s Conservatives under their leader Pierre Poilievre are ready for a “change election,” said Laura Kurkimaki, who served as deputy national campaign manager for the Conservative Party during the last federal election in 2021.\n\n“We’ve had 10 years of a Liberal government and Canadians are tired of that,” said Kurkimaki, who also served as principal secretary to former Conservative official opposition leader Erin O’Toole whose party won the popular vote but not enough House seats to win the 2021 election.\n\nFurthermore, she said the new Liberal leader would be running on “Trudeau’s record,” and while Carney wasn’t a member of the prime minister’s government, he was appointed last September by the Liberal Party to chair a task force on economic growth for Trudeau.\n\n“The next election will be about who is going to make life more affordable for Canadians,” said Kurkimaki. “What’s going on in the U.S. impacts that, of course, and creates economic uncertainty in Canada.”\n\nShe added that the longer Carney waits to call an election, the Conservatives get more time to launch their attack-ads against him.\n\nDuring an election, parties face spending limits. But before the writ is dropped to launch the election period, parties can spend as much as they want on advertising, and the Conservatives raised more than double (about $29 million) last year than the Liberals, at about $11 million.\n\nIn an interview with The Spectator, President Trump, commenting on the Conservative party leader, said Poilievre’s “biggest problem is he’s not a MAGA guy … He’s not a Trump guy at all.”\n\nThe Canadian Conservative leader replied on X, stating: “Mr. President, it is true. I am not MAGA.”\n\n“I am for Canada First. Always,” Poilievre posted. “Canada has always been America’s best friend & ally. But we will NEVER be the 51st state.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMark Carney, the former Governor of the Central Bank of Canada, has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Mark Carney becomes the Liberal Party&#8217;s chosen candidate to succeed Trudeau as the next Prime Minister of Canada first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/mark-carney-becomes-the-liberal-partys-chosen-candidate-to-succeed-trudeau-as-the-next-prime-minister-of-canada/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump-critic-Mark-Carney-poised-to-replace-Trudeau-as-Canadas.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:29:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.096},{"id":298434598,"title":"Mark Carney wins race to replace Canada’s Trudeau","text":"OTTAWA, (Reuters) – Former central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canada’s ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed today.\n\nCarney will take over at a tumultuous time in Canada, which is in the midst of a trade war with longtime ally the United States and must hold a general election soon.\n\nCarney, 59, took 86% of votes cast to beat former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland in a contest in which just under 152,000 party members voted.\n\nTrudeau announced in January that he would step down after more than nine years in power as his approval rating plummeted, forcing the ruling Liberal Party to run a quick contest to replace him.\n\n“Make no mistake, this is a nation-defining moment. Democracy is not a given. Freedom is not a given. Even Canada is not a given,” Trudeau said.\n\n“Now, as Canadians face, from our neighbour, an existential challenge, an economic crisis, Canadians are showing exactly what we are made of.”\n\nCarney, a political novice, argued that he was best placed to revive the party and to oversee trade negotiations with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is threatening additional tariffs that could cripple Canada’s export-dependent economy.\n\nCarney was the front-runner, with the most endorsements from party members and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates.\n\nCarney’s win marks the first time an outsider with no real political background has become Canadian prime minister. He has said his experience as the first person to serve as the governor of two G7 central banks – Canada and England – meant he was the best candidate to deal with Trump.\n\nDuring the campaign, Carney said he supported dollar-for-dollar retaliatory tariffs against the United States and a coordinated strategy to boost investment. He has repeatedly complained that Canada’s growth under Trudeau was not good enough.\n\nThe prospect of a fresh start for the Liberal Party under Carney, combined with Trump’s tariffs and his repeated taunts to annex Canada as the 51st U.S. state, led to a remarkable revival of Liberal fortunes.\n\nRALLY-AROUND-THE-FLAG MOMENT\n\nAt the start of 2025 the party trailed by 20 or more points but is now statistically tied with the official opposition Conservatives led by career politician Pierre Poilievre in several polls.\n\nAt a protest outside Canada’s Parliament building in Ottawa on Sunday, dozens of Canadians held up signs protesting Trump with no reference to domestic politics.\n\n“There is a rallying-around-the-flag moment that we would never have predicted a year ago,” said University of British Columbia politics professor Richard Johnston. “I think it’s probably true as we speak that the Liberals have been saved from oblivion.”\n\nTwo Liberal Party sources said Carney would call an election in coming weeks.\n\nPolls though indicate that neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives would be able to form a majority government. An election must be held by October 20.\n\nCarney could legally serve as prime minister without a seat in the House of Commons but tradition dictates that he should seek to win one as soon as possible.\n\nIn 1984, John Turner was not a legislator when he became prime minister after winning a Liberal leadership race.\n\nLiberals sought to compare Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to Trump in a recent advertisement. Poilievre in turn ramped up attacks on Carney on Sunday.\n\nThe Liberals “are going to pull a sneaky trick tonight,” Poilievre said at a campaign rally. “They’re going to try to get elected for a fourth term by replacing Justin Trudeau with his economic adviser, Mark Carney. … Donald Trump will have a big smile on his face.”\n\nCarney has played down any role in advising Trudeau, noting his many global obligations left him with little time. Carney resigned all commercial posts after he launched his leadership bid in January.","summary":"OTTAWA, (Reuters) &#8211; Former central banker Mark Carney won the race to become leader of Canada&#8217;s ruling Liberal Party and will succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister, official results showed today.\n\n\nThe article Mark Carney wins race to replace Canada&#8217;s Trudeau appeared first on Stabroek News.","url":"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/03/09/news/world/mark-carney-wins-race-to-replace-canadas-trudeau/","image":"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2025/03/mark-carney.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:28:22","author":"Staff Editor","authors":["Staff Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":0.092},{"id":298436444,"title":"Health and Human Services Department offers $25,000 buyout to majority of employees","text":"WASHINGTON — Most of the 80,000 federal workers responsible for researching diseases, inspecting food and administering Medicare and Medicaid under the auspices of the Health and Human Services Department were emailed an offer to leave their job for as much as a $25,000 payment as part of President Donald Trump’s government cuts.\n\nWorkers cannot start opting in until Monday and have until 5 p.m. on Friday to submit a response for the so-called voluntary separation offer. The email was sent to staff across the department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and the National Institutes of Health as well as the Food and Drug Administration, both in Maryland.\n\nThe mass email went out to a “broad population of HHS employees,” landing in their inboxes days before agency heads are due to offer plans for shrinking their workforces. HHS is one of the government’s costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe agency oversees health insurance for roughly half the country through Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for disabled and poor Americans.\n\nThere was no immediate comment Sunday from HHS.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s health secretary, has hinted at plans at deep cuts to the staff. Last year, he promised to immediately clear out 600 employees at the NIH, the nation’s biomedical research arm. He has not gone that far, but in an interview last month shortly after being sworn in last month, Kennedy said he wanted to remove some workers from the public health agencies.\n\n“I have a list in my head,” Kennedy said of potential firings at the agency. He said some workers “made really bad decisions” on nutrition guidelines.\n\nThe Trump administration, with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, has been trying to push out federal workers in an effort to cut costs.

Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.\n\nThe arrest appeared to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump's pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.\n\nWhen ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil's wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.\n\nThe were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when his wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he not there - and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.\n\n\"We have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\" Greer told the AP. \"This is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\"\n\nA Columbia spokesperson said law enforcement agents must produce a warrant before entering university property, but declined to say if the school had received one ahead of Khalil's arrest. The spokesperson also declined to comment on Khalil's detention.\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.\n\nIn a message shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone's permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.\n\n\"This has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn't like,\" Mackler said.\n\nKhalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.\n\nHe was also among those under investigation by a new Columbia University office that has brought disciplinary charges against dozens of students for their pro-Palestinian activism, according to records shared with the AP.\n\nThe investigations come as the Trump administration has followed through on its threat to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to Columbia because of what the government describes as the Ivy League school's failure to squelch antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe university's allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \"unauthorized marching event\" in which participants glorified Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \"substantial role\" in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.\n\n\"I have around 13 allegations against me, most of them are social media posts that I had nothing to do with,\" Khalil told the AP last week.\n\n\"They just want to show Congress and right-wing politicians that they're doing something, regardless of the stakes for students,\" he added. \"It's mainly an office to chill pro-Palestine speech.\"","summary":"The Trump administration has claimed participants in protests against Israel's war in Gaza forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-arrests-palestinian-activist-green-card-mahmoud-khalil-helped-lead-columbia-university-nyc-protests-lawyer-says/15998411/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15997517_030925-wabc-mahmoud-khalil-columbia-protests-AP-img.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wabc/030925-wabc-rincon-columbia-ice-arrests-6pm-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:25:58","author":"Jake Offenhartz","authors":["Jake Offenhartz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":298436374,"title":"Mark Carney, crisis-fighting central banker, to lead Canada through US trade war","text":"Mark Carney, soon to become Canada’s new prime minister, is a two-time central banker and crisis fighter about to face his biggest challenge of all: steering Canada through Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nThe Liberals announced Carney as Justin Trudeau’s successor on Sunday after party members voted in a nominating contest. Trudeau resigned in January, facing low approval ratings after nearly a decade in office.\nThe 59-year-old Carney is a political outsider who has never held office, which would in normal times have killed his candidacy in Canada. But distance from Trudeau and a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, and Carney argues he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.\n“I know how to manage crises … in a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,” Carney said during a leadership debate late last month.\nCarney was born in Fort Smith in the remote Northwest Territories. He attended Harvard University where he played college-level ice hockey, starring as a goalkeeper.\nCarney, who garnered the most party endorsements and the most money raised among the four Liberal candidates, will soon be the first person to become Canadian prime minister without being a legislator and without having had any cabinet experience.\nHe argues Canada must fight Trump’s tariffs with dollar for dollar retaliation and diversify trading relations in the medium term.\nIn the next election, which must be held by October 20, the Liberals will face off against the official opposition Conservatives, whose leader Pierre Poilievre is a career politician with little international exposure.\nBy contrast, Carney is a globetrotter who spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs before being named deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He left in November 2004 for a top finance ministry job and returned to become governor of the central bank in 2008 at the age of just 42.\n\nCarney won praise for his handling of the financial crisis, when he created new emergency loan facilities and gave unusually explicit guidance on keeping rates at record low levels for a specific period of time.\nEven at that stage, rumours swirled that he would seek a career in politics with the Liberals, prompting him to respond with a prickliness that is still sometimes evident.\n“Why don’t I become a circus clown?” he said to a reporter in 2012 when asked about possible political ambitions.\nThe Bank of England was impressed enough though to poach him in 2013, making him the first non-British governor in the central bank’s three-century history, and the first person to ever head two G7 (group of seven major advanced economies) central banks. Britain’s finance minister at the time, George Osborne, called Carney the “outstanding central bank governor of his generation”.\nCarney, though, had a challenging time, forced to face zero inflation and the political chaos of Brexit.\nHe struggled to deploy his trademark policy of signalling the likely path of interest rates. The bank said its guidance came with caveats but media often interpreted it as more of a guarantee, with Labour legislator Pat McFadden dubbing the bank under Carney as an “unreliable boyfriend.”\nWhen sterling tumbled in the hours after the Brexit referendum result in 2016, Carney delivered a televised address to reassure markets that the bank would turn on the liquidity taps if needed.\n“Mark has a rare ability to combine a central banker’s steady hand, with a political reformer’s eye to the future,” said Ana Botin, Santander’s executive chairman, in a written comment to Reuters. She said Carney “steadied the ship” in the UK after Brexit.\n\nBut he infuriated Brexit supporters by talking about the economic damage that he said was likely to be caused by leaving the European Union. Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg called him the “high priest of project fear” but Carney said it was his duty to talk about such risks.\nCarney also showed irritation with his predecessor in the job, Mervyn King, whom he said had not spotted the risks building in the financial sector before the 2007-08 financial crisis.\nFrom 2011 to 2018 Carney also headed the Financial Stability Board, which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 economies.\nAfter leaving the Bank of England in 2020, Carney served as a United Nations envoy on finance and climate change.\nAfter launching the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in 2021 to act as an umbrella group for financial sector efforts to get to net-zero emissions, Carney oversaw a surge in membership as boards rushed to signal a willingness to act.\nAs the implications of moving to renewable energy began to filter down to the real economy, though, a political backlash from some Republican states accusing companies of breaching antitrust rules ultimately led a number of large US companies to drop their membership.\nHe also served on the board of Brookfield Asset Management and was chairman of the Bloomberg board but resigned as the UN special envoy and left all commercial posts after he launched his bid for the Liberal leadership on January 16.\nCarney’s lack of political experience showed when the Conservatives pressed him over a decision by Brookfield to move its headquarters from Canada to the United States. Carney said the move took place after he resigned in January but the Conservatives found a letter he wrote to shareholders in December 2024 recommending the move.\n“Sometimes I answer questions that go into details when I should keep it at a higher level. That’s part of the problem with not being a politician,” he told reporters when asked about Conservative allegations he had lied.","summary":"Carney, soon to become Canada’s PM, is first person to have headed two G7 central banks – and a political outsider who has never held office.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3301715/mark-carney-crisis-fighting-central-banker-lead-canada-through-us-trade-war","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/10/26507bf8-7dbf-4b8b-a58a-42868be4c63b_f187d89d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:25:21","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.12},{"id":298436770,"title":"Trump admitted the US is in a 'period of transition' but didn't rule out the possibility of a recession","text":"President Donald Trump downplayed economic uncertainty over his tariffs, saying a \"period of transition\" is headed for the US economy as it adjusts. But he notably did not rule out a recession in the near future.Trump paused his 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada earlier this week, just after they went into effect. In an interview on the Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Trump said he paused his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada to help American car manufacturers and \"to a certain extent,\" to help both countries. Trump paused the tariffs until April 2.\"I wanted to help the American car makers until April 2,\" Trump said on Fox. \"April 2, it becomes all reciprocal. What they charge us, we charge them.\"After a strong start to the year, the stock market has seen significant volatility in recent weeks. This week, the market saw considerable uncertainty, with the S&P 500 down as much as 2% on Thursday following tariff concerns.Still, Trump downplayed fears over a possible recession in the Fox interview. When asked if he expected a recession in 2025, Trump responded: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America.\"\"It takes a little time,\" he added.Trump also avoided questions about providing clarity for publicly owned businesses about how his tariffs could disrupt the economy.\"They have plenty of clarity,\" he said. \"They just use that. That's like, almost a sound bite. They always say that, 'we want clarity,'\" Trump told Fox about business asking for economic clarity.Trump paused tariffs impacting US auto manufacturers on March 5 after Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors called the president requesting a reprieve. When pressed by Fox about what \"automakers are going to do for a month\" while the tariffs are paused, Trump said that this is a \"transition period.\"\"I said, 'look, I'm going to do it this one time, but after that, I'm not doing it,'\" Trump told Fox. \"They called me and they wanted help during this little transition period, and I gave it to them.\"Economists are still grappling with the impact of Trump's tariffs, which some economists say will increase inflation. Some analysts say that Trump's tariffs will not help increase manufacturing in the United States.\"Tariffs will not increase US manufacturing: technology, rather than trade, has been primarily responsible for the fifty-year decline in manufacturing jobs,\" John Veroneau, a former deputy US trade representative, wrote in a February 11 post on the Council on Foreign Relations website.","summary":"President Trump addressed economic uncertainty on Fox News, admitting the US is in a \"period of transition.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-us-transition-period-does-not-rule-out-recession-2025-3","image":"https://i.insider.com/67ce1b56b8b41a9673fa1daa?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:24:21","author":"Kenneth Niemeyer","authors":["Kenneth Niemeyer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":298433504,"title":"Justin Trudeau sheds tears in farewell speech as departing Canadian prime minister takes ANOTHER swipe at Donald Trump - as former Bank of England boss Mark Carney is confirmed as his successor","text":"Justin Trudeau sheds tears in farewell speech as departing Canadian prime minister takes ANOTHER swipe at Donald Trump - as former Bank of England boss Mark Carney is confirmed as his successor\n\nPODCAST: Trump’s tariff whiplash, Trudeau’s tears, and Hunter Biden’s ‘sugar brother’ – on the latest episode of Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy PERKIN AMALARAJ\n\nPublished: 23:17 GMT, 9 March 2025 | Updated: 23:17 GMT, 9 March 2025\n\nA weeping Justin Trudeau has taken one last swipe at Donald Trump during his final speech as Prime Minister of Canada. \n\nTrudeau, who was forced to resign following a wave of resignations from his cabinet in the final months of 2024, was seen dabbing his eyes with a tissue during a conference to his Liberal party tonight. \n\nThe 53-year-old leader will be replaced by former Bank of England boss Mark Carney, who tonight won his party's leadership race. \n\nTrudeau said: 'Don't get me wrong, I'm damn proud of what we've done over these past 10 years.

The world's largest crypto did manage the most modest of bounces from there, trading at $80,700 at press time. Ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) were lower by similar amounts, while cardano (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) had plunged closer to 12%.\n\n\"There could be a little disruption,\" said U.S. President Donald Trump in a Fox News appearance on Sunday when asked about the impact of his tariff and budget-cutting policies. \"If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective … we go by quarters,\" he continued. \"What we’re doing is building a foundation for the future.\"\n\nTrump's comments were dubbed \"Volckering\" by some on social media — a reference to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Shortly after being appointed to the position by Jimmy Carter in 1979, Volcker moved to break the back of a decade-long inflation by jacking up short term rates to unheard of levels, knowing that by doing so, the U.S. would surely have to experience a brutal recession.\n\nBy the time Volcker had finished tightening policy roughly 18 months later, the Fed funds rate had hit 20% and the economy indeed had gone through a difficult contraction. Inflation, however, was broken and the stage was set for growth throughout most of the following decade.\n\nIn early Sunday evening action, U.S. stock index futures were lower by about 0.85% across the board.","summary":"President Trump acknowledged that some of his policies will cause pain in the short term.","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/09/sunday-blues-for-bitcoin-as-it-tumbles-below-usd80k","image":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/88596186e49bd02ce58b5666fe58575a5446eb97-5568x3712.jpg?auto=format","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-09 23:20:56","author":"Stephen Alpher","authors":["Stephen Alpher"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.323}]}
