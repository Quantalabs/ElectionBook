The video, published Sunday, comes just days before the House is scheduled to vote on a bill compelling the full release of Justice Department documents related to Epstein.The PSA features 11 women holding photos of themselves at the ages they first encountered Epstein. Several wipe away tears or struggle through their lines as they recount their stories.“There’s about a thousand of us,” one woman says.“It’s time to bring the secrets out of the shadows.”The video repeats a collective message:“It’s time to bring the secrets out of the shadows.It’s time to shine a light into the darkness.”The PSA ends with an on-screen message: “Five administrations and we’re still in the dark.”It is followed by a call for viewers to contact Congress and demand the files’ release.The campaign directs the public to a link that sends automated letters of support to lawmakers.Political pressure intensifiesThe PSA arrives as Congress prepares for a high-stakes vote. The House will consider legislation to force the disclosure of the full cache of DOJ documents tied to Epstein, years after the disgraced financier died by suicide in federal custody in 2019.Recently, President Donald Trump abruptly reversed his opposition to releasing the files.Trump previously dismissed the release of Epstein-related emails as a Democratic “hoax,” claiming “some stupid” and “foolish” Republicans had fallen for it.His sudden shift marks a significant political moment, as Trump had long resisted additional disclosures.White House pushes back on accusationsLast week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump amid renewed scrutiny sparked by the release of emails mentioning him.The emails “prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong,” Leavitt told reporters.Trump has repeatedly denied any involvement in Epstein’s crimes. Epstein associated with numerous wealthy and politically connected figures prior to his arrest.Ongoing investigationsEpstein died in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted in 2022 and is reportedly seeking to have her sentence reduced.Last Friday, Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s ties with political figures and financial institutions, while also targeting Democrats.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/epstein-survivors-demand-release-of-all-files-in-emotional-video-it-s-time-to-bring-the-secrets-out-of-the-shadows-11763405211883.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/17/1600x900/logo/survivors_1763406321683_1763406324645.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 19:06:18","author":"Ravi Hari","authors":["Ravi Hari"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.574},{"id":379993970,"title":"Trump’s Frankenstein? Maga meltdown tests its creator","text":"WASHINGTON – Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement is showing the first signs of turning on its creator. Could it be a Frankenstein moment for the US president?\n\nDuring the course of one frenetic weekend, Mr Trump \n\nMr Trump’s meltdown underscores the cracks that have opened in between the right-wing movement and the billionaire founder who has for years ruled it with an iron fist.\n\nThe turmoil has also punctured the aura of invincibility that Mr Trump and the White House have sought to cultivate since his return to power – raising questions about whether Mr Trump has created a Frankenstein-like monster he can no longer control.\n\n“Maga was my idea,” he protested in an interview with Fox News last week – itself notable as normally pro-Trump host Laura Ingraham confronted him on whether visas for foreign students were “pro-Maga.”\n\n“I know what Maga wants better than anybody else.” \n\n‘Not America First’\n\nNot long ago, Ms Marjorie Taylor Greene was perhaps Mr Trump’s biggest booster.\n\nAs recently as March, the Republican firebrand from Georgia was pictured sporting a red a “Trump Was Right About Everything” baseball cap as the president addressed Congress.\n\nBut fast-forward eight months, and Mr Trump raged that he was no longer backing his once diehard supporter, dubbing her “Marjorie Traitor Greene”.\n\nThe split came after Ms Greene distanced herself on a host of issues that she shares with other discontented Maga faithful: affordability, healthcare, Israel, visas for foreign workers and students, and Mr Trump’s focus on foreign policy.\n\nMs Greene hit back, saying on Nov 16 that \n\nShe also highlighted another key issue. “Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files, and that is shocking,” she told CNN.\n\n‘Nothing to hide’\n\nThe scandal over the disgraced financier’s sexual abuse has become a seismic fault line for the Maga movement.\n\nIn an astonishing reversal on Nov 16, Mr Trump suddenly called on Republicans to support a vote in the US House to release files from the investigation into Epstein, saying “we have nothing to hide”.\n\nHe had previously called on rebels like Ms Greene and fellow Maga lawmaker Lauren Boebert not to fall into the “trap” of voting for it.\n\nFar from any change of heart, however, Mr Trump’s turnaround appeared to be a way of avoiding what would have been the biggest political defeat of his second term so far.\n\nYet the pressure from the issue – which distracted from Mr Trump’s victory lap in ending a record US government shutdown – is unlikely to go away. \n\nAnger had already been brewing in the Maga ranks for months.\n\nConspiracy-minded Maga faithful were long told by Mr Trump’s supporters that the scandal was a Democratic cover-up – only for Mr Trump’s Justice Department to say in July that effectively there was nothing new in the files.\n\nRumbles of Maga discontent have been growing on other subjects too. The loudest complaints came after Republicans were hammered on the cost of living in off-year elections earlier in November.\n\nSensing trouble, Mr Trump has responded by planning a series of speeches about the economy, including one to a \n\nMaga ranks have also been split over US media star Tucker Carlson interviewing open white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Key right-wingers were outraged – even as Mr Trump insisted on Nov 16 that “you can’t tell him who to interview”.\n\nWhile Mr Trump still commands fierce loyalty among many supporters, the splits are only likely to deepen as he enters the lame duck phase of his final term.\n\nEyes are already turning to 2028 – and the battle to be Mr Trump’s true Maga political heir.\n\nMr Trump’s vice-president J.D. Vance is widely considered the frontrunner, but is viewed in parts of the US right as insufficiently committed to the movement.\n\nCould it leave an opportunity for Ms Greene? She has denied any thought of a presidential run – but stranger things have happened in US politics.

According to People, Mark Epstein, the convicted sex offender’s brother, recently offered some clarification after his email mentioning “Trump blowing Bubba” went viral.In a story published on Sunday, November 16, 2025, Mark told The Advocate that remarks about photos of Donald Trump “blowing Bubba” had nothing to do with Bill Clinton, the former President of the United States. He said:“For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”While “Bubba” is reportedly a nickname of Bill Clinton, Ali Clark, a spokesperson for Mark, told The Advocate that:“[‘Bubba’ is a] private individual who is not a public figure.”Explaining that the attention surrounding the newly released emails is unwarranted, the spokesperson explained:“They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks.”Meanwhile, Mark’s March 2018 email included an exchange in which he asked his late brother to ask the 79-year-old politician’s former chief strategist, Steven Bannon, if Russian President Vladimir Putin has “the photos of Trump blowing Bubba.” The exchange read:“You and your boy Donnie can make a remake of the movie Get Hard.”What did Donald Trump say about releasing Epstein files?Trump, Knauss, Epstein, Maxwell At Mar-A-Lago (Image via Getty)After the House Oversight Committee released the documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate last Wednesday, Donald Trump is reportedly being scrutinized once again over his relationship with the late New York-based financier.In contrast to his earlier opposition, United States President Donald Trump has reportedly called on Congress to make public the additional files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. On Sunday, the politician wrote on his Truth Social platform:“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party.”This move comes after the US President demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI investigate the sex offender’s links to a number of his critics, including former US President Bill Clinton and ex-Harvard University President and one-time Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. On Friday, November 14, he wrote on Truth Social:“Now that the Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures. I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein’s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him.”For the unversed, many of Epstein’s associates maintained close contact with him even after he was registered as a sex offender in 2008. While he was convicted on two counts of soliciting prostitution, including from a minor, Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on August 10, 2019.","summary":"The mention of US President Donald Trump in the newly released Epstein files by the House Oversight Committee has reportedly caused quite a stir.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/jeffrey-epstein-s-brother-mark-clarifies-identity-bubba-leaked-lewd-email-featuring-trump-putin","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/11/74c7b-17633831687214-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 01:12:11","author":"Afreen Shaikh","authors":["Afreen Shaikh"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":379951996,"title":"New study to be released on impact of US tariffs on region","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC, United States — US President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled Make America Wealthy Again at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. . \n\n Latest News, Regional \n\nNovember 17, 2025\n\n\n\n\n New study to be released on impact of US tariffs on region \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSANTIAGO, Chile (CMC) — The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) says it will on Wednesday release a study examining the impact of the United States’ tariff policy on Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).\n\nECLAC said that the document, which will provide a special analysis of the effects that the United States’ new tariff policy has had on the region, forms part of its annual report entitled “International Trade Outlook for Latin America and the Caribbean 2025: International trade in a new era of weaponised interdependence”.\n\nUnited States (US) President Donald Trump introduced tariffs on goods reaching the country from around the world, arguing that the move will boost American manufacturing and create jobs, but critics warn of higher prices and damage to the global economy.\n\nThe US Supreme Court is considering whether the tariffs are illegal, and last weekend, President Trump announced that he was scrapping US tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices.\n\nAccording to ECLAC, the document addresses the recent trade situation and its prospects at a global and regional level; analyses the position of Latin America and the Caribbean vis-à-vis the new US trade policy, as well as examines the intensity of technology and advanced human capital in the region’s goods-and-services exports.\n\nAccording to the report, global and regional trade will remain dynamic in 2025, but prospects worsen in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: ECLAC Jamaica \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mt Pleasant FA maintain number one spot in Concacaf club ranks \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Concacaf Caribbean Cup finalists Mt Pleasant Football Association (FA) retained their number one ranking in the Caribbean section ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WHO chief urges clampdown on nicotine products aimed at kids \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n GENEVA, Switzerland (AFP)—Sleek-looking disposable e-cigarettes and candy-flavoured nicotine pouches are among a range of new products targeting young... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n VCB Foundation launches hurricane relief initiative, commits to educational recovery effort for girls \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n The Veronica Campbell Brown Foundation has mobilised an emergency response effort to support communities devastated by Hurricane Melissa, with a parti... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Amazon founder Bezos returns to CEO role with AI startup \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is returning to an operational leadership role for the first time in four years, taking th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Digicel says vandalism on Catherine Hall site delays restoration work \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n Communications company Digicel is reporting that critical batteries were discovered to be stolen at one of its network sites in Catherine Hall, Monteg... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Just like us in ’97’: Former Reggae Boyz inspire Jamaicans ahead of World Cup decider \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 17, 2025 \n\n\n “Just like us in ’97.

The raid was part of a joint operation between the Texas Department of Public Safety and federal and local authorities, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott said. On Monday, a regional Homeland Security Task Force was created to combat transnational criminal organizations. The aim of the task force is to dismantle drug cartels, foreign terrorist organizations, and criminal networks responsible for crimes like human trafficking, drug smuggling, and money laundering.

More than 140 illegal immigrants from Venezuela, Honduras, Mexico and other South American countries were taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The raid involved multiple federal agencies. \"The Homeland Security Task Force enables the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to bring its sophisticated investigative techniques to the table, which have been instrumental in capturing the most violent drug trafficking organizations in the United States and worldwide,\" said the Houston Field Division Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Pullen.

Grocery prices rose 1.4 percent between January and September, and consumer prices overall have climbed an average of 1.7 percent during Trump’s second term. Inflation may have cooled from its peak, but prices themselves have not fallen. They’re simply rising more slowly.\n\nStill, Trump isn’t entirely wrong to point out that some prices have dipped. A complicated web of supply, demand, commodity costs, labor shortages and global conflict influences what Americans pay, and Trump’s own decisions have played a noticeable role, for better and worse.\n\nPharmaceuticals are one of the clearest examples of prices dropping under pressure from the White House, according to CNN. Trump has leaned heavily on drugmakers to bring down the cost of high-priced medications. His administration recently touted deals that would make certain blockbuster obesity drugs available for as little as $149 a month, far below list prices that often top $1,000. He has also announced pricing agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and others pegging new drug prices to “Most Favored Nation” levels.\n\nWhen Trump took office, the country was in the middle of an avian flu outbreak that wiped out millions of egg-laying hens, pushing prices above $8 a dozen. Within weeks, his USDA announced a plan to increase farm biosecurity, provide emergency support to farmers who lost flocks and temporarily ease restrictions on egg imports. The measures helped stabilize supply, and prices have since dropped to just over $2 a dozen.\n\nTrump dismantled several drilling regulations he claimed were holding back U.S. production, though those rollbacks have not yet translated into meaningful gains. What did move the market was his very public pressure campaign on OPEC+. Although the cartel denied responding to him, the group increased output several times this year. U.S. oil eventually fell below $60 a barrel, down from $75 when Trump took office, though global conflicts and fluctuating demand continue to drive volatility.\n\nAt the same time, many of Trump’s other economic moves have pushed prices higher. His tariffs on foreign goods have raised the effective U.S. tariff rate to 13.6 percent, a tenfold increase from 2024. Importers have passed those costs along to consumers, raising the average household’s expenses by about $1,200 this year. Analysts expect families to pay roughly $1,600 more next year as businesses warn they can no longer absorb the added cost.\n\nCuts to major safety-net programs, including Medicaid and food stamps, have also left low-income households paying more out of pocket. The administration’s tax and spending bill trimmed or eliminated several popular credits, including the $7,500 electric vehicle incentive.\n\nDespite the mounting evidence, Trump continues to describe the affordability crisis as a fiction. He recently called complaints about high prices a “lie” and a “complete con job.” The White House echoed that line on Friday, claiming that “high prices that resulted from Democrat policies” were already being brought under control and promising “the best is yet to come.”","summary":"Trump insists prices are falling, but federal data shows Americans are still paying more.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-misleads-again-on-affordability-crisis-falsely-claims-prices-are-falling","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 01:00:45","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":379992096,"title":"Gavin Newsom declared as the Democratic Party's 2028 'frontrunner' by Politico","text":"California Gov. Gavin Newsom was declared the Democratic frontrunner to win back the White House in 2028 by a column in Politico on Saturday. Politico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote that Newsom has positioned himself over the past two years as the most viable Democratic contender for the presidency. \"No Democrat has had a better two years than Gavin Newsom and because of it, the California governor — a national figure since he was a 36-year-old boy mayor — has claimed a new title: front-runner,\" Martin wrote. NEWSOM REBUKES WHITE HOUSE DEFENSE OF PRAYER AFTER SHOOTING: KIDS WERE 'LITERALLY PRAYING AS THEY GOT SHOT AT' Martin argued that Newsom combines traditional political experience with a strong grasp of social media and the ability to connect with younger voters, making him a promising candidate. \"By the old rules of Democratic nominations, Newsom fits neatly in the tradition of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama: younger, outsider candidates who could credibly run fresh campaigns against the Washington status quo of both parties while claiming enough insider credentials to reassure party mandarins who care about such things,\" he wrote. \"Newsom is also the best-positioned Democrat according to the new rules of politics — namely, whether you are or can become famous by breaking through on social media.\" Martin also noted Newsom’s centrist and inclusive stance within the party as another advantage for the governor.

I want it to be inclusive,’ the governor told me last week,\" Martin said, adding \"that Newsom isn’t fully comfortable in either faction\" of his party.

And then Trump elevated the governor further by deploying the National Guard and active-duty Marines into the city by the summer,\" Martin wrote. After those clashes with Trump, Newsom opposed the president in a redistricting fight that Martin credited for making the governor an early leader in the 2028 Democratic primary. Martin also stated how Newsom’s willingness to mock Trump and his supporters online \"has endeared him to the sprawling anti-Trump coalition, even the Newsom skeptics among them.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"A new Politico column argued that Gov.

Still, he has conceded of late that it could take time for those measures to kick in.\n\n“As president, I’m fighting every day to support small businesses like yours,” Mr Trump told the group. “There’s still a lot of work to do, and we’re making tremendous progress.\n\nCosts have continued to rise in the US, not least because of sweeping tariffs Mr Trump has imposed against nearly every country. Inflation worries fuelled Democratic victories in state and local elections in November. Mr Trump’s approval ratings have continued to languish amid Americans’ frustration over persistently high prices.\n\nOn Nov 17, Mr Trump appealed directly to the nation’s largest fast-food chain in a speech that offered no new initiatives but touched on military attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities to his personal devotion to McDonald’s products and his renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHe peppered his remarks with false and misleading claims about the economy’s performance under his stewardship.\n\nTrump says working to lower inflation\n\nMcDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski in November warned that low-income consumers were having to absorb “some significant inflation”.\n\nThe company, keenly aware of how resistant low-income earners are to higher prices, has been offering a US$5 (S$6.50) value meal for more than a year now.\n\nMr Trump reminisced about serving french fries during a campaign stop at a Philadelphia-area McDonald’s in 2024, telling the chain’s bipartisan “Impact Summit” in Washington on Nov 17 his administration was working to reduce inflation.\n\n“We’re going to get it a little bit lower,” he said, without providing any details.\n\nMr Trump, who has long argued that his tariffs are not fuelling price increases, reversed course on Nov 14 when he announced the elimination of duties on \n\nMr Trump has already floated the idea of a US$2,000 tariff-funded check for lower- and middle-income Americans, although such a measure would require congressional approval. He also suggested 50-year mortgages as a way to make houses more affordable, although homeowners would pay more in interest.\n\nTrump plans rallies focused on economy in coming months\n\nMr Trump plans to hold rallies around the United States in coming months in battleground states to tout his economic agenda, two administration officials said, ahead of midterm elections next November.\n\nMr Trump insists that inflation is far lower now than during former Democratic President Joe Biden’s term, when consumer prices spiked up to around 9 per cent. But Americans remain sceptical.\n\nThe Economist’s longtime “Big Mac” index, which measures the cost of the famous double-decker hamburger across numerous countries, shows that a Big Mac cost on average US$6.01 as of July, up from US$5.69 a year ago and US$5.15 three years ago.\n\nMeat costs have remained a sore point. A pound of ground chuck beef cost consumers about US$6.33 in September, up 13.5 per cent from a year earlier, according to US government data.\n\nThe most commonly cited measure of US inflation, the Consumer Price Index, was 3 per cent higher year over year in September, its highest since January, with more than half of line items tracked showing gains that topped the 3 per cent overall rate.\n\nConsumers remain frustrated with high prices, a fact corporate executives frequently noted during third-quarter earnings calls. They said lower- and middle-income earners were bearing the brunt of higher costs on food, rent and other costs.\n\nCompanies like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and Colgate-Palmolive all cited concerns about rising costs and a widening gap between low- and higher-income consumers.\n\nMcDonald’s, keenly aware of how resistant low-income earners are to higher prices, has been offering a US$5 value meal for more than a year now.

Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza - a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal - but the UN resolution is seen as vital to legitimizing a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Trump-chaired Board of Peace envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. It also authorizes the international stabilization force, which would ensure a process of demilitarizing Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.Hamas, in a statement, reiterated that it will not disarm and argued that its fight against Israel is legitimate resistance, potentially pitting the militant group against the international force authorized by the resolution.\"The resolution imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,\" Hamas said in its statement, issued after the adoption of the resolution.Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the resolution, which includes Trump's 20-point plan as an annex, \"charts a possible pathway for Palestinian self-determination ... where rockets will give way to olive branches and there is a chance to agree on a political horizon.\"Live Events\"It dismantles Hamas' grip, it ensures Gaza rises free from terror's shadow, prosperous and secure,\" Waltz told the council ahead of the vote.Russia, which holds a veto on the Security Council, earlier signaled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass.The UN ambassadors of Russia and China, which also abstained, complained that the resolution does not give the UN a clear role in the future of Gaza.\"In essence, the council is giving its blessing to a U.S. initiative on the basis of Washington's promises, giving complete control over the Gaza Strip to the Board of Peace and the ISF (international stabilization force), the modalities of which we know nothing about so far,\" Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzya told the council following the vote.The Palestinian Authority issued a statement welcoming the resolution, and said it is ready to take part in its implementation. Diplomats said the authority's endorsement of the resolution last week was key to preventing a Russian veto.Trump celebrated the vote as \"a moment of true Historic proportion\" in a social media post. \"The members of the Board, and many more exciting announcements, will be made in the coming weeks,\" Trump wrote.'PATHWAY' TO STATEHOODThe resolution has proven controversial in Israel because it references a future possibility of statehood for the Palestinians.The resolution's text says that \"conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\" once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform program and Gaza's redevelopment has advanced.\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it says.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from right-wing members of his government, said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to a Palestinian state and pledged to demilitarize Gaza \"the easy way or the hard way.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onUN Security CouncilTrump Gaza plangazagaza ceasefireisrael warisf\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

So he touched his hat,' Harpole continued. \n\n'There were a line of people in the front and other people that did all kinda things, everybody's subject to that.' \n\nHarpole was bewildered by the number of conspiracies he's seen, including an especially bizarre one that claimed Kirk's wife Erika was responsible. \n\n'I get it, I'm not a conspiracy guy but I do believe that there are things out here bigger than you and I that are in operations,' he said. \n\nOn theories related Erika, Harpole said: 'She's a victim, that's her husband. How people without any proof are saying she's responsible, that's what makes me lose faith.' \n\nHowever, Harpole said he held his own suspicions about the Kirk shooting, as he said he 'did not trust my own eyes, ears, what I was reading, what I was watching. \n\n'A lot of people have sensationalized this, and that is a real shame… it makes it impossible to find the truth,' he added. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to Turning Point USA for comment.\n\nThe 31-year-old conservative activist and media personality was shot in the neck while speaking at an outdoor event on September 10, just after beginning a Q&A session in front of thousands of students and supporters. \n\nSecurity rushed him from the stage, and he was transported to Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, where he was later pronounced dead. \n\nWithin hours of the shooting, videos, photos, and eyewitness accounts began circulating on social media, with users rushing to dissect every frame for clues. \n\nSome of the most extreme posts suggest everything from suspicious private jets to hand signals and even claims that the gunshot was actually an explosion. \n\nConspiracy theorists have seized on brief clips and images, spinning intricate narratives despite investigators' warning that no verified evidence supports these claims. \n\nLaw enforcement agencies have also urged the public to rely on official updates rather than online posts. \n\nHowever, it has not stopped a flurry of online debate, as conservatives scrambled to make sense of a shocking attack.\n\nA post on X questioned: '…and why are these two guys giving hand signals immediately before the shot? Both standing perfectly to the side of the bullet track.' \n\nIn the clip, two men can be seen standing behind Kirk. One appears to be adjusting his hat while holding a phone, while the other moves his arms and glances around.\n\nObservers on social media have speculated that the gestures could be signals related to the shooting. \n\nInvestigators have not confirmed any connection, and neither man has been named by authorities as having any involvement in the shooting. \n\nTyler Robinson, 22, was later arrested and charged with the murder of Kirk.\n\nThe assassination of Kirk, a close ally of Donald Trump who worked to steer young voters toward conservatism, has galvanized Republicans who have vowed to carry on Kirk’s mission of moving American politics further right.\n\nThe President has declared Kirk a 'martyr' for freedom and threatened to crack down on what he called the 'radical left.'\n\nHe presented Kirk's widow, Erika, with the Medal of Freedom in honor of her late husband in October.","summary":"Brian Harpole - who was the lead on the fateful day in Utah when Kirk was killed by a single bullet - was asked by podcaster Shawn Ryan about the use of hand signals in the leadup to the shooting.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15300035/Charlie-Kirk-security-guard-hand-signals.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/18/00/103959489-0-image-m-13_1763426307169.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/11/4448639835094273893/1024x576_MP4_4448639835094273893.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:47:49","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Lepore"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":379989650,"title":"Fan favourite history hunk is back","text":"The king of historical fiction is back, with a supersized serving of good news for his followers (who are legion – he has sold an estimated 30 million books globally).\n\nFirstly, Cornwell is reviving one of his most beloved characters: Uhtred of Bebbanburg, the Saxon warlord who carves a bloody path through Viking-era Britain in The Last Kingdom novels and in the long-running hit Netflix adaptation, played by Alexander Dreymon. \n\n“I’m going back to the middle of Uhtred’s career,” says Cornwell, who is right at the start of the writing process. “I can’t say much more, other than that he goes abroad.” \n\nThe energetic Brit then reveals another golden nugget: he wants fan favourite Thomas of Hookton to ride – and fight – again. \n\n“I’m very tempted by that,” Cornwell says of the medieval English longbowman who faces foes in France – and now, perhaps, beyond.\n\n“After the Battle of Poitiers (covered in the last Hookton book, 1346), a lot of the English soldiers turned mercenary and went south into Italy, because it was an unholy mess,” Cornwell explains, musing a potential plot outline. “And the longbow tended to cut through the chaos.”\n\nSo far, so thrilling – and the optimism keeps coming. The 81-year-old author warned earlier this year that his newest book, the just-published Sharpe’s Storm, would likely be the last outing for its titular character: gutter-born Napoleonic Wars hardman Richard Sharpe, memorably brought to life on screen by Sean Bean.\n\nIn our conversation, however – carried out by phone as Cornwell heads back to his US home after a visit to London – he has second thoughts.\n\n“Yeah, I don’t know how true that is,” he says of retiring the rough diamond rifleman, with whom he began his writing career four decades ago. “I mean, I have a suspicion that about two years from now I’ll think ‘Oh, it would be nice to go back to Sharpe’, but I don’t know. I can’t promise it, but it’s a definite maybe.”\n\nThat seems a safe bet, considering this has happened before, in reverse – in a 2019 interview Cornwell told me would be retiring Uhtred and bringing back Sharpe after a gap of 15 years, which he duly did.\n\nHe is excited about the new Sharpe book, set two years before Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, not least because Cornwell’s trademark painstaking research led him to a little-known diary account of a British-French confrontation, the Battle of St Pierre, said to be “the worst day of the whole war. It was so nasty, that battle. And I thought, ‘Oh well, if it was that bad, Sharpe has to be there’.”\n\nCornwell’s penchant for historical accuracy meant he had to entirely redo a significant portion of Sharpe’s Storm after realising to his horror, halfway through, that the plot timeline clashed with another Sharpe novel, written 38 years earlier.\n\nThat delay, added to his wife Judy’s battle with leukaemia – “It’s been a horrible couple of years, but Judy’s doing wonderfully well” – and the author’s own health travails (a lengthy skirmish with dental experts) meant 2024 was that rare thing: a year with no new Bernard Cornwell release. \n\nIt was not all gloom, however. Cornwell maintained his annual acting sideline at the Shakespeare Festival in Cape Cod, where he and Judy live, and he seizes joy from sport, sailing and gardening. Indeed, he is adamant about the importance of staying upbeat in 2025 America.\n\nOf the festival, he says, “The nice thing about it is that we draw our cast from theatre students all across America and I get to spend the last chunk of my summer with these very bright, very enthusiastic young people. A change from my normal working environment.”\n\nAnd a change from the Trump-dominated daily news cycle which Cornwell, as a former BBC head of current affairs, can only avoid so much.\n\n“America is a mess. You either love Donald or you hate him. I’m one of the haters. Judy and I almost dare not turn on the news every day to see what idiotic thing the moron has just done.\n\n“I think the only way to cope with it is with what (former Prime Minister) Horace Walpole said: that to those who feel, the world is a tragedy, to those that think it’s a comedy. I regard Donald Trump as a huge comedy. A sad comedy, if there is such a thing. He just has to be endured.” \n\nAsked what the suffer-no-fools Sharpe and Uhtred would make of modern politics’ more ludicrous elements, he is grimly amusing. \n\n“I mean, they had opportunities to do things that we don’t – both would be inclined to turn Washington or Westminster or even Canberra into a bloodbath, which is not really a solution.”\n\nBest that Cornwell’s witty, tough protagonists stay on the page and screen, then; and with their adventures and attitude, long may they continue to provide the vicarious escape routes we all need to endure tough times, whatever our political leanings.\n\nSharpe’s Storm by Bernard Cornwell is out now, published by HarperCollins.

It was not clear when the operation in the southern city would end.\n\nCharlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, said that the constitutional rights and protections of every person in Charlotte, regardless of their immigration status, must be upheld, and said that city officials were working to support the impacted people and communities \"while working within complicated legal boundaries.\"\n\n\"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone,\" Lyles wrote on social media. \"Your city stands with you.\"\n\nCharlotte has seen peaceful protests in response to the crackdown, including a walkout on Nov. 17 by the students of East Mecklenburg High School, and videos of arrests have been posted across social media, including one showing masked agents smashing a pickup window and dragging a man out.\n\nSome Latino-run businesses closed over the weekend and remained shuttered Monday in Charlotte, a city of 943,000 people and one of the fastest-growing areas in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Many people are drawn to higher-paying jobs in the growing finance, tech, and logistics sectors.\n\nMass deportation and strict enforcement of immigration laws have been a key part of Trump’s domestic policy agenda. Since Trump, a Republican, took office in January, federal immigration agents have carried out raids in largely Democratic-run cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, and in more conservative rural areas.\n\nThe aggressive immigration enforcement by federal agents has led to some large protests across the country and confrontations between federal agents and ordinary citizens, many of whom take video of the operations as they play out in their neighborhoods.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, sharply criticized the operation in Charlotte over the weekend, saying in a video address that \"we’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has said that the raids in Charlotte were a response to the refusal of local officials to comply with almost 1,400 requests by immigration officials to hold suspects for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily be released, so that immigration agents could take the suspects into custody as they are released.\n\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks in Colorado; Additional reporting by Jasper Ward in Washington; editing by Donna Bryson)","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/17/charlotte-north-carolina-immigration-operation-arrests/87327662007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/18/USAT/87327940007-20251117-t-203904-z-1678661039-rc-2-gyhaod-9-ac-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpcharlotte.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5499,3093,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:46:58","author":"Brad Brooks, Usa Today","authors":["Brad Brooks, Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":379993618,"title":"World Cup ticket holders can get priority visa interviews - ESPN","text":"FIFA World Cup ticket holders will be able to receive prioritized visa interviews in advance of coming to the United States for the tournament,\n\nThe announcement came Monday after a meeting between U.S. president Donald Trump, the White House Task Force and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.\n\nThe FIFA Priority Appointment Scheduling System, or FIFA PASS, is meant to help the Trump administration balance a strict immigration system while ensuring that visitors for the global soccer tournament can enter the United States without issue.\n\n\"America welcomes the world,\" Infantino said in a statement. \"We have always said that this will be the greatest and most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history -- and the FIFA PASS service is a very concrete example of that.\"\n\nEleven U.S. cities will host 78 matches during the 48-team tournament, while three cities in Mexico and two in Canada will also host games.\n\nWeeks after tickets went on sale in October, FIFA announced it had already surpassed the 1 million tickets sold mark, and announced that phase 2 of sales had begun in late October for the next million tickets.\n\nTeams from around the world are in the final stages of qualification to round out the 48-team field, with hosts the U.S., Mexico and Canada already guaranteed spots.

Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza - a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal - but the UN resolution is seen as vital to legitimizing a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza.The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Trump-led Board of Peace envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. It also authorizes the international stabilization force, which would ensure a process of demilitarizing Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.Hamas, in a statement, reiterated that it will not disarm and argued that its fight against Israel is legitimate resistance, potentially pitting the militant group against the international force authorized by the resolution.Live Events\"The resolution imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,\" Hamas said in its statement, issued after the adoption of the resolution.Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the resolution, which includes Trump's 20-point plan as an annex, \"charts a possible pathway for Palestinian self-determination ... where rockets will give way to olive branches and there is a chance to agree on a political horizon.\"\"It dismantles Hamas' grip, it ensures Gaza rises free from terror's shadow, prosperous and secure,\" Waltz told the council ahead of the vote.Russia, which holds a veto on the Security Council, earlier signaled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass. China also abstained.The Palestinian Authority issued a statement welcoming the resolution, and said it is ready to take part in its implementation. Diplomats said the authority's endorsement of the resolution last week was key to preventing a Russian veto.'PATHWAY' TO STATEHOODThe resolution has proven controversial in Israel because it references a future possibility of statehood for the Palestinians.The resolution's text says that \"conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\" once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform program and Gaza's redevelopment has advanced.\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it says.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from right-wing members of his government, said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to a Palestinian state and pledged to demilitarize Gaza \"the easy way or the hard way.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onHamasUN Security CouncilGaza resolutionTrump Gaza planIsraelgaza ceasefire\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

His daughter has been on ‘The View.’ He has been on ‘The View’ many times. Ted Cruz has been on. So I mean, really – wait till the next time they want to hawk a book and pick a fight here on ‘The View.’ I’m sure they’ll be knocking down our doors.”\n\nShe added later: “The Republican primary basically decides who wins. And if Donald Trump decides to primary her, which he may, she could very well lose her congressional seat.”\n\nOver the weekend, the president and Greene had a public professional breakup. Trump took to Truth Social and took the Georgia Representative to task and even suggested that she be primaried.\n\n“I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia,” he wrote to his followers. “Over the past few weeks, despite my creating record achievements for our country including, a total and complete victory on the shutdown, closed borders, low taxes, no men in women’s sports or transgender for everyone, ending DEI, stopping Biden’s record setting inflation, biggest regulation cuts in history, stopping EIGHT WARS, rebuilding our military, being RESPECTED by every country in the world (as opposed to being the laughingstock that we were just 12 months ago!), having trillions of dollars (record setting!) INVESTED in the U.S.A., and having created the “HOTTEST” country anywhere in the world from being a DEAD country just 12 months ago (and so much more!), all I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!”\n\nHe added with his threat: “I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support. She has gone Far Left, even doing ‘The View,’ with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nTrump’s turn on Greene happened amidst her and others calling for the release of the Epstein Files as he tries to downplay it all as a hoax fabricated by the Democrats. She also posted this weekend about the threats she’s received since Trump’s Truth Social post.\n\n“Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,” Greene wrote. “This time by the President of the United States.

The White House posted on social media, \"The Biden administration started the affordability crisis, but President Trump will end it so all Americans can achieve economic prosperity.\"Affordability is a major issue for Americans, with voters recently showing unhappiness with Trump’s economic policies by supporting Democrats whose campaigns focused on affordability, as per the report by Newsweek. To improve affordability, the Trump administration announced several measures, $2,000 rebates, possible 50-year mortgages, and removing tariffs on staples like beef, coffee, and tea.On Monday, Trump is expected to address the cost of living crisis and speak about tax cuts in his funding bill, including \"No Tax on Tips\". The McDonald’s Impact Summit will include franchise owners, operators, and suppliers. Trump said he almost \"knew I was going to win\" the 2024 election after his positive reception at a McDonald’s campaign stop.Trump’s McDonald’s momentAt the fast-food chain, Trump stood in as a fry cook and served customers at the window. He described the scene,\"Every one of them, the response was incredible. Almost like I knew I was going to win. When I saw that, I knew because the response was love. Some did a double take somewhat like that. Well, but it was, it was sort of an amazing moment\", as stated by Newsweek.During his speech, Trump made a side comment from X, Aaron Rupar, \"I said, 'why is the Gulf of Mexico called the Gulf of Mexico?' I said, 'We're changing the name.' And now it's the Gulf of America. Has nothing to do with McDonald's, but maybe it does\". Trump told the audience that \"prices are coming down\" in America and claimed the country is in the \"Golden Age of America\".Live EventsMcDonald’s 70 yearsTrump said he inherited a \"mess\" from former President Biden, claiming the U.S. had \"highest inflation in the history of our country\", though this is factually incorrect because inflation was higher in the 1920s, 1970s, and 1980s. He added, \"Now we have normal inflation. You are so damn lucky that I won that election\".Trump celebrated 70 years since Ray Kroc opened the first franchised McDonald’s in Des Plaines, Illinois, on April 15, 1955. The original restaurant was founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940 in California, and Kroc turned it into a global franchise, as per the report by Newsweek. Trump called it \"70 years of American greatness\" at the summit.Trump told the audience he is one of McDonald’s \"most loyal customers\".

\n\nWell, then, ask Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHe emailed with former Harvard President Larry Summers, the linguist Noam Chomsky, venture capitalist Boris Nikolic, Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Trump activist Steve Bannon, the journalist Michael Wolff, the artist Andres Serrano, department-store scion Jonathan Farkas and Obama White Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, among others. \n\nIt’s not as though Epstein was particularly insightful, but if he knew so many important people, he must know something — right?\n\nAs for his scrape with the law, clearly that’d been forgotten and forgiven.\n\nIf he was in the good graces of the social wrangler Peggy Siegal, whose job was to get bold-faced names to accept invitations, he must be OK. \n\nFor some of Epstein’s correspondents, it was part of his appeal that he was disreputable.\n\nSummers asked him at one point: “How is life among the lucrative and louche?”\n\nEpstein’s social currency is one reason that he got off so easily the first time he was prosecuted on sex charges — he hired the best, most connected defense attorneys, who intimidated his prosecutors. \n\nAs for Donald Trump, he is guilty of enjoying Epstein’s company a couple of decades ago, presumably for the same reason so many others did. But there was a rupture in his relationship with Epstein long ago.\n\nTrump didn’t have anything to do with Epstein at the time so many others in these emails were socializing with him and confiding in him.\n\nThat’s a scandal, and it’s always been in plain sight. \n\nIn the Epstein story it’s not so much follow the money — although that’s important and still mysterious — but follow the social network.\n\nX: @RichLowry","summary":"This conspiracy wasn’t the work of the Deep State or Israel, but something worse: A criminal's wealth and connections led most of America's upper crust to embrace him. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/17/opinion/epstein-scandal-is-no-mystery-just-an-indictment-of-americas-elites/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-xve01ncnd-1763423677154.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763405914&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:37:55","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.214},{"id":379990608,"title":"Epstein files and affordability concerns threaten to knock Trump's 2nd presidency off course","text":"APPresident Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's veneer of political invulnerability has begun to crack as he struggles to find his footing on Americans' concerns about affordability and fails to extinguish a push by renegade Republicans to release more files from the Jeffrey Epstein case. The twin challenges, coming shortly after Democratic victories in recent elections and before next year's midterm campaigns that will determine control of Congress, represent a sobering situation for a president who has reveled in his unrivaled dominance in Washington.He has overhauled the federal government with brute force, deployed troops in cities around the country, ignored concerns about the legality of military operations and launched remodeling projects like a gilded ballroom attached to the White House.But Trump's aggressive approach to his second term does not undo political realities, such as dissatisfaction with the economy that festers despite inflation that's lower than during President Joe Biden's term. Trump is expected to address the issue at a conference on Monday night. In addition, there's the inescapable fact that the president is a lame duck who is constitutionally prohibited from running again, despite his interest in remaining in office. Live EventsRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has frequently angered Trump, reminded his party about this on Sunday as he urged lawmakers to support legislation that would force the Justice Department to publish documents about Epstein.\"I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote - Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement,\" Massie said on ABC News. \"But in 2030, he's not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles if you don't vote to release these files, and the president can't protect you then.\"The Epstein files have been a pressure pointEpstein, who died by suicide several years ago, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites.Trump has opposed the Epstein bill in the House, describing it as a continuation of investigations that have shadowed him for years, until he abruptly reversed course on Sunday, saying \"it's time to move on\" from the issue by announcing his support for the vote. It was an acknowledgement that Trump had suffered a rare defeat in the Republican-controlled Congress, where party members have been reluctant to curtail his authority. Even as he strains to impose his will on Republicans like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, whom he split with over the weekend, Trump also is trying to stave off potential losses in next year's midterms. If Democrats take control of Congress, they will be empowered to block Trump's agenda and investigate his administration.He's been pushing state leaders to redraw congressional districts to improve his party's chances. On Monday, he stewed that Indiana Republicans weren't toeing his line, and he announced that he would endorse primary challenges against any lawmaker who doesn't support redistricting. \"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote on social media. \"Republicans must fight back!\"Voter concerns about the cost of living loom largeHolding the line will most likely require addressing Americans' economic concerns, which have sometimes taken a backseat to Trump's focus on establishing a foreign policy legacy and scaling up immigration enforcement. Trump conceded Sunday night that some consumer costs are \"a little bit higher.\" Addressing affordability has prompted Trump to partially backtrack on tariffs, a core part of his economic agenda. His administration reduced levies on imports of products like coffee, beef and tropical fruit, an implicit concession that tariffs have increased costs despite the president's promises to the contrary. The president has also proposed a $2,000 dividend, funded by tariff revenue, for all Americans except for the rich. But there's no guarantee that Congress will go along with the idea when the federal government continues to struggle with debt, and sending cash to people could increase the inflation that Trump has pledged to eliminate. Democrats swept elections in New Jersey, Virginia and elsewhere this month, a sign of discontent with Trump's handling of the economy. Neil Newhouse, a longtime Republican pollster, said Democratic victories weren't surprising but \"what got our attention was the depth and the breadth of the wins.\"He warned that his party risks making the same mistakes as Democratic President Joe Biden, who oversaw high inflation while attempting to convince voters that the problem would soon pass. \"We can tell them prices are going down until we're blue in the face,\" Newhouse said. \"Unless they're seeing it at the grocery stores, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onEpstein filestrumpdonald trumpepsteinUS inflationUS news\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The meeting reportedly hinges on Trump’s plan for the country to eventually sign on to the Abraham Accords, as others criticize the president’s coziness with the kingdom. \n\nCrown Prince Mohammad bin Salman will meet Trump as he returns to the U.S. for the first time in eight years in anticipation of defense and artificial intelligence deals, according to The Times. Their meeting comes as bin Salman has sought to negotiate more deals with the Trump Organization, the president’s family business, for a $63 billion redevelopment project. \n\nAccording to The Times, the project focuses on Diriyah, a town the Saudi government wants to turn into a mixed-use luxury destination. The Trump Organization has planned a luxury hotel and plaza to anchor the neighborhood.\n\nWhen he returned to the White House in January, Trump announced he wouldn’t control or benefit from his businesses while in office, leaving his children in charge of his companies. But his May trip to Saudi Arabia and his tour of the redevelopment project suggested that his promise may have faltered.\n\n“In each country where Trump has business interests, especially those where he has new properties under development, he will know that decisions he makes as president could impact his bottom line,” Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said in May.\n\nEric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told Reuters last December that he has “no interaction with Washington, D.C.” and that he does not want it.\n\nBeyond the anticipated deals, Trump himself has long been criticized for his close relationships with Saudis and other nations in the Persian Gulf that some have said go against U.S. interests. \n\nTrump vowed nearly 24 hours before the meeting to sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, PBS News reported. He told reporters the Saudis “have been a great ally” after the announcement.\n\nTrump, MBS relationship\n\nThe last time the Saudi crown prince visited the U.S. was in 2018, before his country’s leaders authorized the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, 60, in Turkey, according to a Director of National Intelligence report on the assassination. Khashoggi was known as a strong critic of the Saudi government, and the report said the Saudis have long used violent measures to silence dissidents abroad.\n\nThe prince’s visit came during Trump’s first term as president, and the two are expected to deepen their relationship in the president’s current term. The two reunited as leaders in May, when Trump made his first international trip since his reelection to Saudi Arabia.\n\nTrump praised the country and bin Salman during the meeting, describing Saudi Arabia’s changes to meet the prince’s Vision 2030 plan as a “modern miracle the Arabian way,” wrote Imad Harb, director of research analysis at the Arab Center Washington in May. In November, Trump also lifted sanctions on the newly liberated Syria and removed a $10 million bounty from Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a Saudi ally. \n\nTheir relationship will get tested as Trump has urged bin Salman to sign onto the Abraham Accords, an agreement several Arab nations reached to normalize relations with Israel. So far, Kosovo, Morocco, Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates have signed, according to the Department of State. \n\n“I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly,” Trump told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. \n\nIt’s a tricky situation for Trump, who has aligned the U.S. mostly with Israel. Meanwhile, the crown prince has pledged the country’s “unwavering support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,” according to a Nov. 6 release from the Saudi-operated Saudi Press Agency.\n\nTrump Organization, Saudi hotel\n\nThe Trump Organization announced plans in September for a $1 billion development to complement the Trump Tower Jeddah hotel project. Trump’s company is working with Saudi-based investor DarGlobal for the project. \n\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a frequent Trump critic, posted about the Trump Organization’s deal on X.\n\n“And the Saudis want a mutual defense agreement and access to U.S. nuclear technology,” Schiff wrote. “Looks like Trump and the royal family will both win, with our national security for sale. The only losers? The American people.”\n\nThe Trump Organization said in January that the president would separate himself from the company during his presidency, Reuters reported. He made a similar announcement during his first term, but he reportedly often mixed presidential and business deals.\n\nAccording to Politico in 2020, a Chinese state-owned company secured a contract to develop a Trump golf course in the United Arab Emirates, T-Mobile executives stayed in a Trump hotel while seeking approval for a merger, and an IRS commissioner collected rent from two Hawaii Trump condos. \n\nSeveral years later, the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a report that revealed Trump received at least $7.8 million from 20 governments while in office. \n\n“This staggering figure reflects payments to just four of the more than 500 entities Trump owned while he was in office: Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York, and Trump World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza in New York,” Democrats wrote in 2024.\n\nThe post Trump welcomes Saudi leader to White House with a business deal in the works appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/11/18/trump-welcomes-saudi-leader-to-white-house-with-a-business-deal-in-the-works/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-17T060345Z_121196649_RC2YGEAGAO84_RTRMADP_3_USA-SAUDI-CROWNPRINCE_Bandar_AlgaloudCourtesy_of_Saudi_Royal_CourtHandout_via_Reuters_clean-HjnqMu.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:34:37","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.18},{"id":379993496,"title":"FBI team guards Kash Patel&#039;s girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, after flood of threats","text":"The FBI confirmed Monday that it has assigned a protective security detail to country singer Alexis Wilkins -- the longtime girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel -- after she received hundreds of death threats tied to their relationship.\"Ms. Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years,\" an FBI spokesperson told NBC News. \"Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details.\"MS NOW first reported that Wilkins, 27, had been placed under federal protection.According to reports, Wilkins is being guarded by elite FBI agents typically assigned to a SWAT team in the Bureau’s Nashville field office, where she spends much of her time for her music career. The agents normally respond to high-risk emergencies -- including potential mass shootings and terror threats -- raising questions inside the bureau about resource allocation..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Current and former officials told MS NOW they were not aware of any precedent in which the girlfriends or boyfriends of senior FBI officials were given a government-staffed security detail. Past directors’ spouses have occasionally received protection, but only when travelling with them and while sharing a residence.Patel and Wilkins have been dating since 2023. They do not live together. Patel maintains his legal residence in Las Vegas but frequently travels to Washington for work, while Wilkins splits time between Nashville and her touring schedule. She accompanied Patel earlier this year when he was sworn in as FBI director.CRITICISM OVER RESOURCE USEThe disclosure comes as Patel faces broader criticism over his handling of bureau resources. Last month, Patel was accused by former FBI agent and conservative podcaster Kyle Seraphin of flying on the FBI’s $60 million government jet to watch Wilkins perform the national anthem at a wrestling event at Penn State on October 25. Critics labelled the trip a date night on taxpayer funds.Patel pushed back sharply, calling the allegations disgustingly baseless and politically motivated. In a statement posted on X, he wrote: \"We will not be distracted by baseless rumours or the noise from uninformed internet anarchists and the fake news. Criticize me all you want. But going after my personal life or those around me is a total disgrace.\"He also expressed frustration at allies he said had stayed silent as the accusations spread.WILKINS FIGHTS BACK IN COURTAt the same time, Wilkins is waging her own battles. She has filed a series of $5 million defamation lawsuits against MAGA influencers -- including Seraphin, Sam Parker and Elijah Schaffer -- accusing them of promoting conspiracy theories that she is a Mossad honeypot agent sent to entrap Patel.Wilkins, an American-born performer, says in court filings that the claims are entirely fabricated and have damaged her reputation and career. The lawsuits mark one of the highest-profile defamation pushes in conservative circles since Patel’s rise to FBI leadership under President Donald Trump.- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Nov 18, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/fbi-protects-alexis-wilkins-after-death-threats-tied-to-director-patel-glbs-2821541-2025-11-18","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/fbi-chief-kash-patels-girlfriend-alexis-wilkins-sues-maga-podcasters-125048588-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=16w.2o7kwcIwugkQnAZ2ZyrM1sTclzTX?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:33:42","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":379989190,"title":"WH Meeting Was About FIFA - but Trump Makes News by Saying He's Considering Drug Strikes Inside Mexico","text":"President Donald Trump held a White House meeting Monday to tout the upcoming FIFA (International Federation of Association Football, or soccer as it’s known to us 'Mericans) World Cup and the economic benefits the tournament is expected to bring to our shores. The Cup is coming stateside this June, and matches will be played in 11 cities. The president said it could bring in $30 billion in revenue and create 200,000 jobs in the U.S.\n\nNow that’s big news, of course, but he also talked about his administration’s attempts to stop the flow of illegal drugs like fentanyl into our country, which have killed hundreds of thousands. He said he’s tired of other countries not helping out enough, and would even consider strikes within Mexico’s borders:\n\nPresident Trump on Monday defended his administration’s decision to carry out airstrikes on the boats of alleged drug traffickers — and suggested he was open to doing whatever it takes to stop their trade, including launching attacks on Mexican soil.“Would I launch strikes in Mexico to stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said. “I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. There’s some big problems over there.”“Every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives,” he boasted of the strikes on suspected Venezuelan narco-terrorists, during a White House task force meeting on the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe above tweet continues:\n\n\"I didn't say I'm DOING it...but I'd be proud to do it. We'd save millions of lives.\"\"Would I do it on land? I absolutely - look, every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives. Not to mention the DESTRUCTION of families!\"\"Mexico...some big problems over there. If we had to, would we do there, what we did in the waterways? There's almost NO DRUGS coming through the waterways. Down like 85%. I don't know who the 15% are!\"\n\nWith his recent moves, including 22 strikes on suspected drug-running boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific Ocean, we’ve been seeing that Trump is not fooling around in his efforts to end the scourge.\n\nREAD MORE: US Forces Eliminate 3 More Narco-Terrorists in Pacific Drug Strike\n\nSecWar Pete Hegseth Announces 'Operation Southern Spear' As US Carrier Strike Group Enters the Caribbean\n\nTrump continued, vowing to continue speaking with authorities in other countries, but also making it clear that they know he intends to stop the smuggling with or without their help. \n\n“I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand. We’re losing hundreds of thousands of people to drugs,” he said. “So now we’ve stopped the waterways, but we know every route.”“We know every route, we know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address; we know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war,” he said.\n\nHe concluded that he would “probably go into Congress” if he were to ramp up military action. “Let me just put it this way: I am not happy with Mexico.”\n\nAs we reported, violence erupted in our southern neighbor over the weekend as protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against corruption and safety issues.\n\nSEE: What's Going on in Mexico City? Over 100 Officers Injured During Breach at National Palace\n\nTensions have also been on the rise with Venezuela and its dictator, Nicolás Maduro, and the administration has sent the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group into the region’s waters in a powerful show of force aimed at enforcing Trump's directive “to dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and counter narco-terrorism in defense of the Homeland.”\n\nSeems like it's going to be a lot harder to be a drug dealer in the future.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

The protesters should have understood what Turning Point was up to and remained entirely peaceful. I think this portends much more than that.\n\nCal is home to the Free Speech Movement, and its students generally hold the conservative views of Turning Point in disdain. But its very bright students, who are supposed to hold free speech in such high esteem, made a choice to ignore that right and impose a heckler’s veto because of their inability to tolerate a conservative point of view.\n\nIf these intelligent people are able to abandon their core beliefs because they dislike conservatives speaking their minds, how much chance does free speech have in our society?\n\nDaniel Mauthe\n\nClean air is costly\nbut worth it\n\nRe: “Newsom gas crusade flips to keeping refineries open” (Page A8, Nov. 16).\n\nIn his column, Dan Walters says California’s high gasoline prices are caused by taxes and fees and the “mystery charge.” Most of the cause is really our clean air. Growing up in SoCal, I choked on car smog. Now, even with tremendously more cars, there’s tremendously less smog. Cleaner gas is why.\n\nThe mystery charge is not a mystery. Indeed, the charge exists, and it’s big. Walters says it’s 41¢ a gallon, and it cost us $59 billion between 2015 and 2024. However, the report he mentions, and gets those figures from, is from California’s Division of Petroleum Market Oversight, and they attribute the charge to “higher gross gasoline industry margins.” No mystery, and no surprise either.\n\nWe pay a lot for gas, and we know why.\n\nDoug McKenzie\n\nBay Farm safety at stake\nwith redevelopment\n\nI am concerned about the Harbor Bay Landing Redevelopment plan. I have lived in Bay Farm for over 40 years and have witnessed its growth and challenges.\n\nTrue Life Companies wants to build 305 units at Harbor Bay Landing Shopping Center.\n\nThe city of Alameda will get additional funding from property sales and meet the SB 79 requirements of the state.\n\nHowever, it will destroy the existing city planning. Demolishing the only grocery store and pharmacy will turn Bay Farm into a food and pharmacy desert. This is a nightmare for seniors who do not own a car or who are not computer-literate.\n\nBay Farm Island has a population of 13,359, and the redevelopment will worsen transportation problems and further jeopardize safety. Traffic congestion is a significant problem. If there is flash flooding from thunderstorms, fires or tsunamis, the citizens will be doomed due to poor traffic.\n\nDon’t think Trump\nwon’t try for third term\n\nIf you think Donald Trump can’t be president after 2028, think again.\n\nHow about this scenario: The MAGA party nominates J.D. Vance for president in 2028. J.D. selects Trump as his VP. They win the election and are sworn in on Jan. 20. The next day, J.D. resigns and Trump becomes president. Voila! Trump is president without having been elected. And it’s all perfectly legal.\n\nIf you think the MAGA party isn’t corrupt enough to allow this, wake up. They are.\n\nMike Krausnick\n\nDemand that reps speak\nout on maritime killings\n\nRe: “U.S. strikes another alleged drug boat, killing two” (Page A4, Oct. 23).\n\nAmong the tidal wave of illegal and unethical actions being taken by our current administration, the murder of more than 80 foreign nationals by the U.S. military is one that damages America’s standing in the world.\n\nOur armed forces have long-established tactics for interdicting drug runners, which include arrest and confiscation of drugs. However, just like the legal sleight of hand used to justify the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison during the Gulf War, the legal justifications being presented for executing these boat crews are flimsy at best, according to legal experts quoted in the New York Times.\n\nWith the Supreme Court granting Trump immunity while in office, these killings are just one more spectacle he and his inner circle delight in. Where is the outrage? Please write to your elected leaders and urge them to publicly speak out to oppose these unnecessary and immoral executions.\n\nKeith Hatschek\n\nBudget threatens state\nof U.S. health care\n\nRe: “Health care cuts will push ERs to the brink” (Page A7, Oct. 21).\n\nThis retired RN would like to thank Dr. Eric Snoey for his excellent opinion piece on what the state of health care will be like in this country with the upcoming proposed federal cuts to health care.\n\nHe got it exactly right.

Stacey Plaskett (D-U.S. Virgin Islands) solicited (and was given) $30,000 from Epstein for the DCCC after he was already a convicted sex offender?” they begin. “Or the fact that Plaskett herself accepted maxed out donations from Epstein for her own campaign? Or the fact that the wife of the former Democrat governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands told Epstein 'we would have a friend in Stacey' if he made said donations? Or the fact that Plaskett was literally texting Epstein during a committee hearing?”\n\nThen there’s Bill Clinton, who traveled on Epstein’s aircraft 26 times, according to reports. Democrats sure don’t want to talk about how one of Epstein’s victims said she saw Clinton on Epstein’s island with two young women, and how that visit was corroborated by one of Clinton’s former top aides. The Clinton Foundation initially claimed that the former president took only four trips on Epstein’s plane, but flight logs tell a different story.\n\nThe questions continued: “Why aren’t Democrats talking about the 'long relationship' and storied friendship that Larry Summers — ex-Harvard President, Clinton Treasury Secretary, and prominent Democrat — had with Epstein, who described himself as Summers’ 'wing man'?”\n\nICYMI: Democrats Doctored Epstein Evidence, and the GOP Has the Receipts\n\nOr how about how Katie Couric attended a dinner at Epstein’s residence after he was already a convicted sex offender who had served jail time. The dinner was supposedly in honor of Prince Andrew, but the bottom line is that these people had no problem associating with a known predator. Another person Democrats aren’t talking about is Reid Hoffman, the billionaire Democrat megadonor, who visited Epstein’s island, attended a dinner with him, and planned to stay at his New York mansion.\n\nAnother question: “Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that the Democrat National Committee refused to return $32,000 in donations from Epstein?” Of course, we know Democrats would never part with their dirty Epstein money. In fact, former DNC chairman Don Fowler dismissed the idea of returning the donations, asking reporters, “Are you nuts?” when questioned about it.\n\nAnd the final question: “Why aren’t Democrats talking about the fact that Michael Wolff 'encouraged Jeffrey Epstein to blackmail then-presidential candidate Donald Trump — insisting the convicted pedophile could generate a ‘debt’ from him'?\"\n\nThe White House is clearly no longer interested in playing defense on this issue.\n\n“It’s time for Democrats to answer for their longstanding ties to Epstein,” the White House said. “Then, we can get back to what matters to the American people.”\n\nBut Democrats seem awfully quiet when it comes to their own connections, even as they try to selectively leak documents to create narratives about Trump. The double standard couldn’t be more obvious, and the White House just called them out on it in spectacular fashion.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

The left wing leader had accused previous governments of committing “war crimes” when it was found that minors died in airstrikes against rebel groups.\n\nBut airstrikes against Colombian rebels resumed last year, as the Petro administration struggles to contain the expansion of groups that are fighting to take over territory abandoned by the FARC, the guerrilla group that made peace with the Colombian government in 2016.\n\nPetro has argued that he is not hiding the deaths of children in airstrikes against the rebel groups, unlike the previous government, and says he has approved the strikes in order to save the lives of soldiers.\n\nThe Colombian president has been an outspoke critic of U.S. President Donald Trump’s drone strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean, which he has described as extrajudicial executions.\n\nPetro argues his government’s strikes are different.\n\n“Those who are falling in the bombardments of Colombian forces have machine guns, explosives, and have declared themselves members of an armed group,” Petro wrote on X Friday. “They are trying to eliminate government forces and civilians with their lethal weapons.”","url":"https://apnews.com/article/colombia-airstrikes-minors-killed-suspension-petro-7ed1bffaf66479b524475c2444b92c8f","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/3a1cb52/2147483647/strip/false/crop/700x450+0+0/resize/700x450!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F90%2F29%2F4e3c1cc7446089a9101a7bdff4c8%2Fdefaultshareimage-copy.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:26:07","author":"Manuel Rueda","authors":["Manuel Rueda"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":379994162,"title":"Chicago museum leaders — likening the moment to active shooter drills — practice what to do if ICE shows up","text":"In July, a swarm of unmarked cars bearing agents from the Department of Homeland Security suddenly appeared in the lot of the National Museum of Puerto Rican Art and Culture in Humboldt Park.\n\nLocal elected officials and community members called the visit a scare tactic; President Donald Trump’s officials said they’d been staging an operation related to a narcotics investigation.\n\nBut the agents’ presence outside a Chicago cultural institution sparked a panic that spread across city museums and event spaces as they weighed how to protect their staff and audiences.\n\nOn Friday, a group of museum leaders met for a two-hour training at the Puerto Rican museum hosted by the nonprofit Latinos Progresando. While reports indicate that senior U.S. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino left Chicago last week, with plans to scale back the number of federal immigration agents in the city throughout the winter, a source with the Homeland Security department has signaled that 1,000 agents could return in March.\n\nLatinos Progresando said it is seizing the opportunity now to train event organizers and museum leaders. “Although there may be a little bit of a sigh of relief, I think it’s very important that we take this opportunity to prepare ourselves for what’s coming,” said Luis Gutiérrez, founder of Latinos Progresando.\n\nThat’s what drove just under two dozen representatives from the Shedd Aquarium, Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago History Museum, Chicago Park District and other organizations to attend the Friday workshop, where they received advice such as appointing a designated representative onsite to deal with agents.\n\nHomero Tristan, a founding partner at Tristan & Cervantes, told the group it’s rare for ICE to get warrants signed by judges to carry out immigration enforcement. However, all cultural institutions should familiarize themselves with I-9 audits, he said: They are used to verify whether an individual is authorized to work in the U.S.\n\nThomas Henkey, who works as VP of emergency management at Marksman-Titan Security Group in Downtown Chicago, said he attended the training on behalf of his organization.\n\nMarksman-Titan provides security to various institutions across a large part of Chicago’s cultural and nonprofit sectors — many of which were also in the room on Friday.\n\n“We have an ethical and moral obligation to protect people and property. That’s why we do what we do,” Henkey said.\n\nSecurity professionals at museums, theaters and similar places are most likely to be the first point of contact with ICE agents, he said. Consequently, clients of Marksman-Titan have approached Henkey and his colleagues to ask: ‘“Hey, what is security going to do if ICE shows up at our building?’”\n\nHenkey said he’d be going back to his colleagues and clients to share all that he learned at the Friday workshop. And the organizations that Marksman-Titan works with have been resilient to challenges of the last five years, he said.\n\n“These folks have been through the pandemic. They’ve been through massive funding cuts. They’ve been through staffing challenges,” he said. “When they get punched, they get back up again.”\n\nThe National Museum of Mexican Art in Pilsen, a co-host of Friday’s workshop, experienced its own scare with federal agents earlier this year, according to José Ochoa, the museum’s president and CEO.\n\nOn July 3, an agent with the U.S. Marshals Service entered the Pilsen museum, he said. Ochoa considers that visit an “unwelcome dress rehearsal” for what was to come. After that incident, the museum implemented strict guidelines, including clearly marked badges for all employees and a prepared response for federal agents.\n\n“But the goal line keeps moving,” he said, referring to the constantly changing political landscape, which makes it hard to stay up-to-date with the correct information. “We’re definitely stronger, we’re definitely more organized, we’re definitely more knowledgeable, but the situation is going to continue to change.”\n\nOchoa said the NMMA hasn’t seen a decline in attendees since “Operation Midway Blitz” kicked off in September — in fact, it’s been the “opposite,” he said. More allies have come out to support the museum, but there have been fewer visits by undocumented neighbors.\n\nOchoa likened the cultural groups’ preparedness to active shooter drills that take place in most schools across the country. When something happens, all kids “know what to do,” he said. “It’s in their bodies, because they practice it all the time. And I realized [when the U.S. Marshal showed up] that we had not practiced.”\n\nSpeakers also included Ald. Jessie Fuentes (26th), who was handcuffed by federal agents in October at a Humboldt Park hospital after asking officers to show a warrant. The detainment was caught on video and shared widely.\n\n“What we are watching right now, in this moment in our country,” she warned the museum leaders, “is racism turned into policy.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/museums-zoos/2025/11/17/chicago-museum-leaders-federal-immigration-ice-rights-responsibilities-culture-events","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c46d176/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7839x5229+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fe0%2F59ab73db46b0a48d158b3e65e74a%2Fartsi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:25:53","author":"Ambar Colón","authors":["Ambar Colón"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.179},{"id":379990064,"title":"Trump: For tens of millions, the road to the American dream starts beneath the golden arches","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics November 17, 2025 24:22 \n\n Trump: For tens of millions, the road to the American dream starts beneath the golden arches \n President Donald Trump speaks at the McDonald's Impact Summit about the economy and the American dream in Washington.\n\nTags POLITICSWHAT TO WATCHSHOWS","summary":"President Donald Trump speaks at the McDonald&apos;s Impact Summit about the economy and the American dream in Washington.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6385225395112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/07c9156b-30cd-440b-9bf5-c4ae8643f884/920ab285-becf-4baa-9d3f-8a5fd35a65ab/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=854081161001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:24:54","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.555},{"id":379991878,"title":"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor accused of 'hiding' from Epstein inquiry","text":"A US congressman has accused Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of “hiding” from a government committee seeking to question him over an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSuhas Subramanyam, one of the Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee, also warned the former prince that the panel he sits on will “continue to pursue” the matter.\n\n The committee wrote to Mountbatten-Windsor earlier in November, requesting he sit for a “transcribed interview” in connection with his “long-standing friendship” with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe letter, signed by 16 members of Congress, said the committee had identified “financial records containing notations such as ‘massage for Andrew’ that raise serious questions”.\n\nIt has requested that he responds by this Thursday, 20 November.\n\nSubramanyam told The Guardian that the former duke “has been hiding from us, and I think he will continue to try to hide from people doing meaningful investigations of this matter”.\n\n“It seems like every time we find more evidence, [former] prince Andrew seems to be in the documents,” he added.\n\n“And so I think if he is hoping that the story will just go away by ignoring us and being silent, he will be sorely disappointed, as we continue to pursue this over the next year and beyond.”\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump said House Republicans should vote to release the files in the Epstein case, reversing his previous vow to fight the proposal.\n\n“We have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax,” Trump posted on social media on Sunday.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have been pushing for a measure that would force the US Justice Department to make more documents from the case public.\n\nAll files and communications related to Epstein could be made public, as well as information about the investigation into his suicide in prison in 2019.\n\nThe oversight committee in the House of Representatives asked Mountbatten-Windsor to sit for a deposition as part of its investigation into Epstein and how the government handled his case.\n\nIt has called for him to say what he knew about the actions of the convicted sex trafficker.\n\nAndrew, who was stripped of his prince and Duke of York titles earlier this month, strenuously denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHe had previously agreed to stop using his titles but had expected to remain a prince and retain his dukedom, ahead of the publication of the memoirs of the late Virginia Giuffre, who had accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.

It also authorizes the international stabilization force, which would ensure a process of demilitarizing Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.\n\nHamas, in a statement, reiterated that it will not disarm and argued that its fight against Israel is legitimate resistance, potentially pitting the militant group against the international force authorized by the resolution.\n\n\"The resolution imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,\" Hamas said in its statement, issued after the adoption of the resolution.\n\nMike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, said the resolution, which includes Trump's 20-point plan as an annex, \"charts a possible pathway for Palestinian self-determination ... where rockets will give way to olive branches and there is a chance to agree on a political horizon.\"\n\n\"It dismantles Hamas' grip, it ensures Gaza rises free from terror's shadow, prosperous and secure,\" Waltz told the council ahead of the vote.\n\nRussia, which holds a veto on the Security Council, earlier signaled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass. China also abstained.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority issued a statement welcoming the resolution, and said it is ready to take part in its implementation. Diplomats said the authority's endorsement of the resolution last week was key to preventing a Russian veto.\n\nThe resolution has proven controversial in Israel because it references a future possibility of statehood for the Palestinians.\n\nThe resolution's text says that \"conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood\" once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform program and Gaza's redevelopment has advanced.\n\n\"The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence,\" it says.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from right-wing members of his government, said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to a Palestinian state and pledged to demilitarize Gaza \"the easy way or the hard way.\" - Reuters \n\n(Reporting by Simon Lewis in Washington; Additional reporting by Nidal Al-Mughrabi in Cairo; Editing by Bill Berkrot, Rod Nickel and Matthew Lewis)","url":"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/11/18/un-security-council-adopts-us-resolution-on-trump039s-gaza-plan","image":"https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/11/18/3627289.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:22:00","author":"The Star Online","authors":["The Star Online"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.068},{"id":379990574,"title":"Five Republicans Defy Party, Join Democrats To Roll Back Trump Rule","text":"A few Republicans are bucking President Donald Trump on bargaining rights for federal workers.\n\nFive House Republicans have signed a discharge petition to force a vote on overturning a Trump administration order and restoring unionization rights for thousands of federal employees.

It authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force, or ISF, which the US said that several unnamed countries have expressed willingness to join. The force would be tasked with entering Gaza, overseeing demilitarisation, securing key areas and supporting the delivery of humanitarian assistance. It would also coordinate its operations with Israel and Egypt, Gaza’s southern neighbour.However, Hamas has rejected the resolution, arguing that it does not address Palestinian rights and imposes an unwanted external authority on the territory. In a statement on Telegram, the group said the plan “imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,” and added that giving the stabilisation force a mandate to disarm resistance groups “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”, news agency Reuters reported.The draft resolution states that the ISF would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” including Hamas, which would be required to surrender its weapons under Trump’s proposal. The draft also calls for the creation of a newly trained Palestinian police force to eventually take over policing responsibilities in Gaza, replacing the Hamas-run force currently in place.US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the council that the stabilisation force would be “tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians.” He described the initial ceasefire phase, which began on 10 October with the exchange of hostages and detainees, as a “fragile, fragile first step.”The plan also proposes the establishment of a Board of Peace, which Trump is expected to head, and a World Bank-supported trust fund to support Gaza’s reconstruction. The vote took place as global actors sought to maintain the fragile ceasefire following the war that began with Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people. Israel’s subsequent offensive has killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-gaza-peace-plan-unsc-approves-us-drafted-resolution-hamas-rejects-proposal/articleshow/125398562.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-125398595/125398595.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:20:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":379990092,"title":"Trump says US will sell F-35 stealth jets to Saudi Arabia","text":"President Donald Trump said Monday (Nov 17) the United States would sell F-35 stealth fighters to Saudi Arabia, a day before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House for talks.\n\n\"We will be doing that.

It comes just six months after Richardson took the job and while the Atlantic hurricane season is still under way.\n\nRichardson, a former Marine Corps officer, is the second FEMA head to leave or be fired since May. He departs amid criticism that he kept a low profile during the deadly Texas floods in July that killed 130 people and baffled staff in June when he said he was unaware the country had a hurricane season.\n\nA DHS spokesperson gave no reasons for why the FEMA chief was departing. The Washington Post was the first to report that Richardson was leaving.\n\nThe DHS spokesperson said in a statement that FEMA chief of staff Karen Evans will replace Richardson, and that FEMA and DHS appreciate Richardson’s service.\n\nRichardson’s predecessor, Cameron Hamilton, was fired in May, after pushing back against efforts under President Donald Trump to dismantle the agency.\n\nPresident Trump has said he wants to greatly reduce the size of FEMA — the federal agency responsible for preparing for and responding to natural disasters — saying state governments can handle many of its functions.\n\nFEMA plays a central role in the US response to major disasters, including hurricanes. The Atlantic hurricane season is due to end this month.\n\nRichardson kept a low public profile compared with FEMA leaders under previous presidents, appearing rarely in public. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has served as the face of the administration’s response to natural disasters during Trump’s second term.\n\nRichardson’s abrupt departure is an ignominious end for an official who told staff when he first arrived in May that he would “run right over” anyone who resists changes and that all decisions must now go through him.\n\n“I, and I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA,” he said at the time.\n\nFEMA has lost about 2,500 employees since January through buyouts, firings and other incentives for staff to quit, reducing its overall size to about 23,350, according to a September Government Accountability Office report.\n\nThe cuts are part of Trump’s broader push to cut the cost and size of the federal civilian workforce.","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/acting-fema-head-david-richardson-steps-down-after-troubled-tenure/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-17T193243Z_1546576557_RC2GSFAKYO50_RTRMADP_3_USA-FEMA-1763412093-UowByt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-18 00:14:06","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"lu","sentiment":-0.332}]}
