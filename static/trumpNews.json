The clip featured an apparently AI-generated segment of dancing primates with the Obamas' faces superimposed.OutrageThe post on Trump's Truth Social platform quickly sparked condemnation from leading political figures, including Republican Senator Tim Scott, a Black ally of Trump.Senator Tim Scott wrote on X, “Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House, “The President should remove it.” Republican Representative Mike Lawler of New York was among many other prominent political figures who called on Trump to apologise and delete the post.Before the clip was taken down, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said it came “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". The video also featured a song from the musical.For centuries, white supremacists have portrayed people of African descent as monkeys to dehumanise and oppress Black populations, the report noted.\"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our history,\" said Ben Rhodes, a former Obama aide, on X.Trump has a record of promoting racist rhetoric, including the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. In December, he called Somalis \"garbage\" who should be expelled from the country and has referred to that and other developing nations as \"shithole countries.\" He also faced criticism last year for editing an image of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who is Black, with a superimposed handlebar mustache and a sombrero.Civil rights advocates note that Trump's rhetoric has grown increasingly bold, normalised, and politically acceptable.Derrick Johnson, national president of the NAACP, in an emailed statement, said, \"Donald Trump's video is blatantly racist, disgusting, and utterly despicable. Voters are watching and will remember this at the ballot box.\"Last year, Trump shared an artificially generated video depicting Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office and shown behind bars wearing an orange jumpsuit, as per AP.Since his return to the White House, Trump has faced criticism from opponents for spearheading a campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.Federal anti-discrimination programs in the US originated from the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, largely led by Black Americans, seeking equality and justice after centuries of slavery. Following the abolition of slavery in 1865, other institutional forms of racism continued to be enforced.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/white-house-takes-down-trumps-racist-video-depicting-obamas-as-apes-amid-outrage-11770402372604.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/06/1600x900/logo/US_1770402717275_1770402721078.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 18:35:35","author":"Garvit Bhirani","authors":["Garvit Bhirani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":400232468,"title":"Indian firm among 15 entities targeted over oil trade","text":"US sanctions on Irans secret oil network fleet: Indian firm among 15 entities targeted over oil trade\n\nWashington DC: The United States on Friday (local time) imposed fresh sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade.

The decision came hours after talks between both the countries concluded in Oman. The sanctions target 15 entities and 14 vessels linked to Tehran’s “shadow fleet,” which were secretly transporting petroleum, petroleum products, and petrochemicals in violation of international restrictions.\nIn a statement, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said that the measures were part of the Trump administration’s renewed pressure campaign against Tehran.\n“President Donald Trump is committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration’s maximum pressure campaign,” Pigott said.The United States said that the fresh sanctions were aimed at cutting off revenue streams that Tehran uses to fund repression at home and destabilising activities abroad. Pigott accused Tehran of prioritising repression and regional destabilisation over domestic welfare.\nA statement by Tommy Pigott, the Principal Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department, noted, “The Department of State is sanctioning 15 entities, two individuals, and 14 shadow fleet vessels connected to the illicit trade in Iranian petroleum, petroleum products, and petrochemical products. These targets have generated revenue that the regime uses to conduct its malign activities. ”\nAdd India.com as a Preferred Source \nThe statement said, “Instead of investing in the welfare of its own people and crumbling infrastructure, the Iranian regime continues to fund destabilising activities around the world and step up its repression inside Iran.”\n“So long as the Iranian regime attempts to evade sanctions and generate oil and petrochemical revenues to fund such oppressive behaviour and support terrorist activities and proxies, the United States will act to hold both the Iranian regime and its partners accountable.”\nThe statement concluded by saying that Trump is committed to bringing down Iran’s oil exports: “The President is committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the Administration’s maximum pressure campaign.”\nThese sanctions follow the US had imposed sanctions in January on Iran’s Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni and several other officials, citing Tehran’s violent response to recent anti-government protests.\nAnnouncing the measures, the US Treasury Department said Momeni “oversees the murderous Law Enforcement Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran (LEF), a key entity responsible for the deaths of thousands of peaceful protesters.”\nThe sanctions package also targets multiple senior officers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with Iranian investor Babak Morteza Zanjani, who is accused of having “embezzled billions in funds from the Iranian people.\n“In a first-of-its-kind move, Treasury also imposed restrictions on digital currency exchanges connected to Zanjani “that have processed large volumes of funds associated with IRGC-linked counterparties.”\nMeanwhile, Iran’s Foreign Ministry on Friday shared Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi’s remarks on X following the conclusion of talks between the US and Iran.\nIn his remarks, he said that the Iranian viewpoints and concerns were expressed. Calling it a good start, he said there was consensus to continue the consultations.\n“Our interests, the rights of the Iranian people, and all matters that needed to be stated were presented in a very positive atmosphere, and the other side’s views were also heard. Regarding the very principle of continuing the negotiations, there is almost a consensus, and it was agreed that they should continue.”","summary":"Home News US sanctions on Irans secret oil network fleet: Indian firm among 15 entities targeted over oil trade Washington DC: The United States on Friday (local time) imposed fresh sanctions targeting Iran’s oil and petrochemical trade.

The move marks a significant shift in trade relations between Washington and New Delhi after months of economic pressure tied to India’s earlier purchases of Russian oil. Background to the Tariff Decision The extra duty was introduced in August 2025 amid US concerns over Russia’s military actions in Ukraine. At the time, the Trump administration cited India’s continued direct and indirect imports of Russian crude as a key reason for invoking the penalty. The tariff applied broadly across Indian goods entering the US market, adding strain to bilateral trade ties. According to the White House, the tariff was imposed under a national emergency framework established by an earlier executive order addressing threats linked to Russia’s global actions. India’s Commitments Prompt Review The latest decision follows a review conducted by senior US officials, who assessed India’s recent policy steps and strategic commitments. The administration said India has agreed to halt all direct and indirect imports of Russian Federation oil, a move viewed as central to easing Washington’s concerns. In addition, New Delhi has committed to expanding purchases of US energy products and has entered into a long-term framework to deepen defence cooperation with the United States over the next decade. These steps, US officials said, demonstrate closer alignment on security, foreign policy, and economic priorities. White House Justifies Tariff Rollback In the executive order, President Trump stated that India had taken 'significant steps' to address the national emergency cited in the earlier order. He added that removing the tariff was 'necessary and appropriate' given India’s actions and improved alignment with US strategic objectives. As a result, the additional 25 per cent duty will be fully eliminated, and the relevant tariff provisions under the Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States will be terminated. Refunds and Ongoing Monitoring The White House said that, where applicable, refunds for duties already collected will be issued in line with US law and standard procedures of US Customs and Border Protection. The Secretary of State has been authorised to coordinate implementation, while the Department of Homeland Security and the US International Trade Commission may issue technical updates to the tariff schedule. However, the administration stressed that India’s compliance will continue to be closely monitored. Any resumption of Russian oil imports could prompt the US to reconsider and potentially reimpose the additional tariff.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-us-india-relations-trump-signs-executive-order-ending-25-tariff-on-new-delhi-over-russian-oil-imports-3199493","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2026/02/07/2740160-untitled-design-2026-01-09t113853.079.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:44:57","author":"Monica Singh","authors":["Monica Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":400231554,"title":"US plans initial payment towards billions owed to UN-envoy Waltz","text":"WASHINGTON, Feb 6 - The United States will make an initial payment towards the billions of dollars it owes to the United Nations in a matter of weeks, the U.S. ambassador to the world body told Reuters on Friday, while stressing the need for the U.N. to continue reforms.\n\nMike Waltz made the comments in a telephone interview two weeks after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sounded the alarm on U.N. finances and warned that the 193-country organization is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to unpaid fees, the majority of which are owed by Washington.\n\n\"You'll certainly see an initial tranche of money very shortly,\" Waltz said. \"It'll be a significant ... down payment on our annual dues ... I don't believe that the ultimate figure is decided, but it'll be in a matter of weeks.\"\n\nU.N. officials say more than 95 percent of what is owed to the regular U.N. budget is owed by the United States - $2.19 billion by the start of February. The U.S. also owes another $2.4 billion for current and past peace-keeping missions and $43.6 million for U.N. tribunals.\n\nOn December 30, the U.N. General Assembly approved $3.45 billion for the regular U.N. budget for 2026, following weeks of negotiations. This covers costs of running U.N. offices around the world, including the headquarters in New York, staff salaries, meetings and development and human rights work.\n\nThe U.N. funding crisis comes at a time when the United States under President Donald Trump has been retreating from multilateralism on numerous fronts. U.S. arrears to the United Nations have grown substantially during his presidency, even though America’s history of falling behind on its U.N. payments stretches back decades.\n\nU.N. officials say the U.S. did not pay into the regular budget last year and owes $827 million for that, as well as $767 million for 2026.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL SPENDING BILL\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump signed into law a spending bill that includes $3.1 billion for U.S. dues to the U.N. and other international organizations.\n\nAsked if the money he spoke of would go towards last year's dues or those for 2026, or both, Waltz said: \"just in general, towards the arrears, and also in recognition of some of the reforms that we've seen.\"\n\nUnder Trump, as well as refusing to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets, the U.S. has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies with their own budgets, and moved to exit U.N. organizations including the World Health Organization.\n\nWaltz said the United States was very supportive of Guterres' UN80 reform effort and called it an important first step that needed to be continued.\n\n\"It doesn't go far enough, but it's an important step. I wish the secretary-general had made it in year one or two of his tenure, not year nine,\" he said.\n\n\"We're very focused ... on getting back to basics, on peace and security. And ... the president is rightly asking, how can we get the UN back to realizing its full potential?\n\n\"All of those conversations are currently being had and are in play, and we expect to see more reforms coming,\" Waltz said.\n\n'TOUGH LOVE'\n\n\"This is some tough love. The current model is unsustainable for a lot of countries, and we're trying to get the UN back, fit for purpose and focused, and stop trying to do everything for everyone.\"\n\nWaltz said reducing duplication was a key aim, saying that for example, there were seven UN agencies with climate change as their primary mission.\n\n\"Now, regardless of the climate change debate, we don't need seven,\" he said, adding that the U.S. also supported consolidation of logistics and back offices at humanitarian agencies.\n\n\"The UN bureaucracy has grown too large, and needs to be much more efficient and effective,\" he said.\n\nGuterres launched his UN80 reforms last year, seeking to cut costs and improve efficiency. The approved 2026 regular budget is roughly $200 million higher than he proposed, but about 7 per cent lower than the approved 2025 budget.\n\nHe warned last month that the U.N. could run out of cash by July and cited a \"Kafkaesque\" requirement for it to credit back hundreds of millions of dollars in unspent dues to states each year even if it never received the money.\n\nWaltz said member states should change this rule.\n\nHe said U.S. peacekeeping arrears were in part due to a \"statutory disconnect\" between what the U.N. assesses and U.S. law allows to be paid and added: \"That'll be addressed the next time we negotiate our assessments, which I believe is next year.\" REUTERS","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/us-plans-initial-payment-towards-billions-owed-to-un-envoy-waltz","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ee42726780659c9c7bd201e33b99dcd3500e164bbe978db8b0d30470f485ce54","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:44:03","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":400231552,"title":"Trump says he ‘didn't see’ racist Obama monkey video clip posted on his account","text":"WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Feb 6 said he “didn’t see” the part of a video posted on his social media account that \n\n“I just looked at the first part... and I didn’t see the whole thing,” Mr Trump told reporters, adding that he “gave it” to staffers to post and they also didn’t watch the full video.\n\nMr Trump had shared a post with a racist video depicting the Obamas as monkeys, sparking outrage across the US political spectrum on Feb 6 before deleting it in a rare backtrack.\n\nThe White House initially rejected “fake outrage” over the video shared on Mr Trump’s Truth Social account late on Feb 5 night, only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member.\n\nDemocrats slammed Mr Trump as “vile” over the post about the Obamas – the first Black president and first lady in US history – while a senior Republican senator said the video was blatantly racist.\n\nNear the end of the one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Republican Trump’s 2020 election loss to Mr Joe Biden, the Obamas were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.\n\nThe song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background when the Obamas appear.\n\nThe video, uploaded at 11.44pm on Feb 5 US time (12.45pm Feb 6 Singapore time) amid a flurry of other posts, repeated false allegations that ballot-counting company Dominion Voting Systems helped steal the election from Mr Trump.\n\nAt first, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt played down the row, saying the images were “from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King”.\n\n“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” Ms Leavitt said in a statement to AFP.\n\nBut almost exactly 12 hours after the post appeared on Mr Trump’s account there was an unusual concession from an administration that normally refuses to admit the slightest mistake.\n\n“A White House staffer erroneously made the post.

Ex-peer's emails to paedophile financier laid bare the jealousy, greed and blazing rows in his 30-year relationship with Reinaldo","text":"Days after his wedding to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Peter Mandelson wrote a heartwarming article for The Times explaining why 'after 27 unmarried years together' they had decided to tie the knot.\n\n'Trying to retain our privacy has been a failure,' he said. 'So I am delighted to make it a glorious failure, by declaring our love publicly through marriage. There is nothing to hide so why create the impression there is?'\n\nIt was October 2023, and the wholesome celebration at Old Marylebone Town Hall, attended by both Tony Blair and Sir Keir Starmer, marked the culmination of a very modern political love story.\n\nMandelson, 72, had met his 52-year-old spouse on a holiday to the Caribbean in the mid-1990s. At the time, he was the 40-something MP for Hartlepool, a blue collar seat where homosexuality remained taboo. Da Silva was a fresh-faced linguistics student in his early 20s who had recently moved to London from his native Brazil.\n\nTheir relationship endured through a tumultuous career, surviving a controversy that saw Mandelson 'outed' as gay by Matthew Parris, journalist and former Tory MP, in 1998 during the early months of the New Labour government, plus each of the grubby scandals that forced his first two resignations.\n\nReinaldo became one of the few constants at the Labour Svengali's side as he gained prominence in public life, serving as EU Commissioner for Trade, before executing a glorious return to the Cabinet under Gordon Brown prior to the 2010 election.\n\nWhile only rarely appearing in public, his presence endured throughout the decade Mandelson then devoted to enriching himself in the grubby worlds of finance and lobbying.\n\nAnd now, as the ink dried on their marriage certificate, he could look forward to a new life in Washington as the official consort of the British Ambassador. The couple's border collie Jock (who had also been at the wedding ceremony) completed the household as they settled into the capital city of Donald Trump's America.\n\nYet in the murky arena of politics, appearances are all too often deceptive. So it has, of course, proven during the Labour power couple's fall from grace, which in September saw them sent home from Washington – and this week resulted in their links to Jeffrey Epstein dominating the news bulletins.\n\nIf recent days have demonstrated anything it is that – contrary to the 'glorious' picture he painted for readers of The Times – Mandelson and his husband have for years had an awful lot to hide. The Epstein Files, published just over a week ago, have placed the couple at the centre of the most explosive political scandal since Profumo.\n\nWhat emerges – when it comes to personal matters – feels strangely tragic.\n\nMandelson, the Prince Of Darkness famed for his skills as a political manipulator, turns out to be the victim of spectacular emotional manipulation in his private life. \n\nAt home, the swaggering statesman has felt trapped in a relationship that appears to be regularly tumultuous. While outwardly shrewd and self-confident, Mandelson comes across as weak and emotionally vulnerable in his domestic affairs.\n\nAt one point, in 2011, Mandelson went so far as to tell Epstein he was in 'basically an abusive relationship,' mournfully complaining that Reinaldo was 'so volatile in his moods and behaviour'. \n\nDuring another 'real bust up,' when he was Gordon Brown's de facto deputy Prime Minister, Mandelson described his boyfriend as: 'Self-obsessed, absorbed by whatever is absorbing him, unable to accommodate me or anyone else.'\n\nHe confided to Epstein that, during a row, Reinaldo had 'said he needed £500 for household needs. Why doesn't he go out and earn some? Am I going to have to face this for the rest of my life?' \n\nThe picture of Mandelson that emerges, from hundreds of intensely personal emails shared with the billionaire paedophile, is often needy and despairing.\n\nFlashpoints between the couple revolve around two principal bones of contention: money and sexual infidelity. \n\nOn the first front, Mandelson frequently complains that his young Brazilian life partner, who appears to have dropped out of a succession of university courses and professional training programmes, has barely done a day's work in his life. He frets that their relationship hinges on cash rather than romance. \n\n'He [Reinaldo] needs to run something and get some income from it because I do not feel he is a student anymore, if he ever is,' Mandelson told Epstein during one such crisis. 'What to do???'\n\nEpstein seemed to agree: he advised 'Petie' to finally call time on the relationship. 'I'm sorry, but as you enter the springtime of your senility, I think you are in need of a co-pilot to help fly and navigate through ever more uncertain weather, rather than an eternal passenger, who continues to bring on just one more carry-on and complains about the lack of space, quality of the journey, and smell of the loo.'\n\nThe correspondence is meanwhile peppered with references to Reinaldo finding out about various extra-curricular love affairs Mandelson has pursued, or intends to pursue.\n\nIn March 2010, for example, the Labour peer told Epstein: 'I have had v bad setback with R who has somehow got into my texts.' \n\nIn December 2013, Epstein reflects on introducing the British politician to Lars Christiaanse, a 39-year-old property executive, saying: 'I told you you would find him cute... wannabe rich.' Mandelson then asks: 'And trustworthy? He seems a nice guy.'\n\nThe duo then discuss a plan for Mandelson and Christiaanse to visit Epstein in Palm Beach. 'He and I agreed we really want him to drive us both to PB to see you all but I don't think R will wear it.'\n\nSeveral years earlier, meanwhile, Mandelson appears to have enlisted Epstein's help in getting a male acquaintance named Simone a job in London.\n\nThis fascinating exchange began in May 2009, when he asked the paedophile: 'Can you call Simone again and talk to him about work options in London?'\n\nA couple of weeks later, he again contacted Epstein saying: 'I am worried about Simone who is totally despairing about getting to London. I am not sure what else to do. Any ideas?' \n\nThe financier replies that Mandelson ought to come out to New York to see the friend in question. 'Do not lose the opportunity. Coming across people you really enjoy is rare. Don't be lazy, get on a plane.'\n\nIt's unclear whether such a visit occurs. However, the following month, Epstein tells 'Petie' that bringing the young man to the UK would risk a political scandal.\n\n'I'm rethinking the Simone issue,' he writes. 'With your new profile I'm afraid it's asking for serious trouble. It won't be kept quiet. Rinaldo [sic] will go ballistic. Fraught with danger.'\n\nMandelson's apparent dalliances, especially on foreign jaunts, crop up regularly in the Epstein files. 'Waiting to fly to Berlin,' he told Epstein in 2010. 'Upset cos lost the number of the Russian guy I knew there so no fun (again) for Petey [sic].'\n\nA year earlier, Epstein sent Mandelson an email in which he various ethnicities of men who might be available in New York. 'Brown? Cuban-american? Have you made any decisions?' The then Cabinet minister replied that he was 'desp for CuAm'.\n\nThere is further off-colour banter. When a climate protestor threw green slime on Mandelson, Epstein emailed to joke that he had 'goo on your face, again!'\n\nIn truth, Westminster insiders have long known that Mandelson's relationship with Reinaldo has, for a significant portion of their 30 years together, been 'non-exclusive' or 'open'. This means that both parties have agreed to allow each other to enjoy occasional infidelities, provided they don't form emotional bonds.\n\nThe couple's relationship began via infidelity, acquaintances recall. For when they met, in 1996, Reinaldo was going out with another holidaymaker: Howell James, John Major's political secretary.\n\nJames, who is the same age as Mandelson, was heartbroken to be dumped by the handsome young South American.\n\n'It was brutally cynical' recalls an associate. 'Reinaldo jumped from the bed of the right hand man of a Tory Prime Minister, who everyone knew was going down to heavy defeat, into the bed of a rising star of the next Labour government. It felt so opportunistic.'\n\nReinaldo's existence in Mandelson's life became public in 1998, when he was named as 'Peter's friend' by The Sunday Express.\n\nBut they weren't pictured in public together until 2000, when they attended a West End stage adaptation of The Graduate.\n\nBy then, Reinaldo had reportedly met The Queen, backstage at the Millennium Dome on New Year's Eve, and been referred to in Parliament, where Tory leader William Hague once made a jibe about 'Lord Mandelson of Rio'.\n\nHe'd also stayed at Chequers, where he was hosted by Cherie Blair on the night of Mandelson's first departure from the Cabinet over an undeclared £373,000 home loan from Geoffrey Robinson, the Paymaster General.\n\nNot long afterwards, Epstein came into their life. In 2002 he invited Mandelson to an intimate dinner party at his New York home alongside a motley collection of guests including Donald Trump, magician David Blaine and Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google.\n\nMandelson and his boyfriend then holidayed on Little Saint James, Epstein's private island. Epstein's former housekeeper, Cathy Alexander, once recalled that Reinaldo had got sunburnt 'and whined about it like a baby'.\n\nAnd in 2005, Mandelson was photographed in a Caribbean boutique with Epstein, wearing a Patek Philippe watch worth £21,000 and jovially trying on a white leather belt.\n\nBy now, the relationship with Epstein had become financial.\n\nIn 2003/04, documents in the Epstein files reveal that three payments totalling $75,000 (£55,000) had been sent to accounts linked to both Reinaldo and Mandelson.\n\nAround this time, the couple sold a home in West Kensington – estate agent's particulars revealed that they used separate bedrooms, with Reinaldo's containing a large goldfish tank and Mandelson's a 13ft walk-in wardrobe – and moved to an expensive property just off Trafalgar Square.\n\nMandelson's career continued to flourish. After resigning a second time – amid claims he had tried to procure a British passport for the billionaire Hinduja brothers – Blair gave him a job as the EU's Trade Commissioner. But Reinaldo remained an eternal student.\n\nIn 2005 he took British citizenship and enrolled on a three-year course at London's Florence Nightingale School of Nursing, though again seems not to have completed it.\n\nRelationship troubles briefly reared their head in 2005, when a Brazilian friend of Reinaldo named Sergio briefly joined them in the Trafalgar Square property in a curious menage a trois.\n\nThey spilled over again in 2007, when Reinaldo for a time moved to a rented flat near Covent Garden and was reported to have grown close to Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP.\n\nThen, we now know, came Simone, who appeared on the scene in early 2009. It's unclear what happened to him. But by that summer, around the time Epstein was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor, things between Mandelson and da Silva appear to have been back on track.\n\nThat August, Mandelson messaged the paedophile from Buckinghamshire where he, Reinaldo and Reinaldo's mother Edmea were staying in a stately home belonging to member of the Rothschild banking dynasty. 'It's brilliant to be here and makes all the difference to me and R,' he said.\n\nEpstein responded by asking about their sex life. 'Does the noise carry throughout the house? Where do you have a strictly private moment?'\n\nIn the ensuing days, there was a minor crisis: Reinaldo, who has an interest in spiritualism (he and Peter once took part in a voodoo ceremony in Brazil during which a chicken was sacrificed, allegedly to put a curse on Gordon Brown's spin-doctor Charlie Whelan) had cooked up a scheme for a sort of alternative medicine and massage centre in London's Farringdon. The prospect terrified Mandelson, who feared losing hundreds of thousands of pounds if the business failed.\n\nHe enlisted Epstein to phone Reinaldo and persuade him to abandon the scheme and instead train as an osteopath.\n\nAs part of that conversation, the paedophile agreed to pay da Silva's tuition fees, too. \n\n'I talked him back from the edge. You owe me,' Epstein wrote to Mandelson on August 24. 'Osteopath school it is.' \n\nIn September, at least £10,000 was sent to Reinaldo's personal bank account (Mandelson intervened to insist it is treated as a 'loan' to minimise taxes). But by the following March it had gone.\n\nShamelessly, Reinaldo then contacted Epstein asking for another cash handout. 'I find it very difficult to be financially independent while doing the Osteopathy course as it demands really full-time dedication,' read his message.\n\n'So, some months ago, I had to start asking Peter for money again for my own expenses which really is not easy for me! I woke up today and felt I could say this to you. I hope you don't mind me coming back to you for some extra financial help.'\n\nEpstein responded by putting the Cabinet minister's boyfriend on a monthly stipend of $4,000 (£2,950), sent directly to his personal bank account. Police are now investigating this and other financial arrangements.\n\nJust two months later, circumstances changed significantly when Labour lost the general election (on polling day, Mandelson had emailed Epstein saying, 'We are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man').\n\nThat development freed Mandelson to seek his fortune in the private sector. With cash soon rolling in, Mandelson could afford to indulge Reinaldo's status as a kept man.\n\nDa Silva became intimately involved in the interior decoration of his £8million, four-storey townhouse near Regent's Park, and never did qualify as an osteopath. It's unclear whether he's had a paid job since.\n\nThe couple also took steps to buy a £700,000 flat in Rio de Janeiro, not far from Reinaldo's childhood home.\n\nDubbing Epstein his 'chief life adviser,' Mandelson emailed about the Brazilian transaction saying: 'I am minded to place ownership, once secure, in Reinaldo's name and advice on this would be welcome.'\n\nEpstein responded that he should take steps to clarify what would happen to the investment 'if something happens to renaldo' [sic] asking 'do you get it or does his family?'\n\nThere are further messages in which the Labour peer discusses trying to dodge property taxes by setting up holding companies in Panama.\n\nIn October 2010, Epstein learned that Mandelson was at a reception in China, emailing to say: 'After dancing with everyone at the party, hopefully you'll take someone home.\n\n'STAY. You should move there for two years.'\n\nMandelson replied: 'And meet a rich nice chinaman and live happily ever after... talking of which, have you permanently stopped the Reinaldo sub?! I may have to put him out to work on the streets.'\n\nThe Labour peer of course never did put Reinaldo out to work – on the streets or anywhere else. Instead, he ended up marrying him.","summary":"Days after his wedding (pictured) to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Peter Mandelson wrote an article for The Times explaining why 'after 27 unmarried years together' they decided to tie the knot.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15536855/Peter-Mandelson-marriage-survive-Epstein-Files-emails-paedophile-financier-jealousy-greed-blazing-rows-Reinaldo.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/06/23/106180785-0-image-m-15_1770419887137.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:36:23","author":"Andrew Pierce,Editor,Guy Adams","authors":["Andrew Pierce","Editor","Guy Adams"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.35},{"id":400231246,"title":"Donald Trump REFUSES to apologize for sharing racist video of Barack and Michelle Obama and claims he 'didn't see it'","text":"CONTAINS OFFENSIVE CONTENT \n\nBy STEPHEN M.

Picture American opposition leaders traveling to Moscow, praising Vladimir Putin, and applauding the removal or arrest of a sitting US president. Then imagine them standing before Russian media, thanking the Kremlin for “helping restore democracy” in the USA. Such an act would not be celebrated as dissent. It would be condemned as criminal, as treasonous, as an open assault on the constitutional order and sovereignty of the nation itself.\n\nIn this context, Maria Corina Machado’s public gesture toward Donald Trump— offered in appreciation for the economic and financial strangulation of her own country and the abduction of a sitting Venezuelan president by US power during the dark hours of January 3— strikes many as more than political theatre. To her critics, it appears as an act of high treason: the symbolic selling of national sovereignty to a foreign power in exchange for political backing to ascend to office.\n\nHistory’s judgment on such alliances is rarely kind. Nations may survive bad governments. They rarely emerge whole when their sovereignty becomes a bargaining chip in someone else’s strategic game. The ultimate right to shape a country’s future, this argument insists, must remain in the hands of its own people— not in the applause of foreign leaders, and not in the shadow of global power\n\nWhat makes the moment even more charged is the shadow of the Nobel Prize itself. Donald Trump, once an aspirant for the award and denied by the Nobel Committee, now stands publicly “honoured” by a political figure whose rise is seen by some as inseparable from US intervention. To them, this exchange feels less like recognition and more like a taunt— an implicit rebuke of the institution’s decision and a politicization of one of the world’s most revered symbols of peace.\n\nOthers interpret it more starkly: as the trading of national dignity for foreign endorsement, a calculated wager that power can be gained without the organic consent of the Venezuelan people. Beneath this view lies an even darker implication— that refusal to comply with Washington’s strategic and economic demands, including Trump’s openly declared ambition to seize Venezuela’s oil wealth for US gain, could invite the same fate that befell Maduro.\n\nShe perhaps put the exalted concept as a backburner that democracies breathe through dissent. From mass protests in Israel demanding accountability from Benjamin Netanyahu, to parliamentary resistance in Pakistan, to congressional scrutiny in Washington, internal struggle is the engine of reform. But there is a line— that line is crossed when a political movement steps outside its national ecosystem and invites a foreign state to intervene directly in the destiny of its own people.\n\nThis is why the language of treason enters the conversation. To challenge one’s own government is a political right. To applaud a foreign power for economically suffocating one’s own society is, in the eyes of many, a moral rupture. Sanctions do not fall on presidents alone. They fall on hospitals that cannot import medicine, on families whose wages collapse under inflation, on children whose futures are narrowed by scarcity. To praise these tools as instruments of “liberation” is, for critics, to sever political ambition from national responsibility.\n\nThe same pattern, many argue, is now being traced in Iran. For decades, Iranians have demonstrated that organic struggle is not only possible but powerful. In 1979, a mass popular movement overthrew one of the most entrenched, Western-backed monarchies in the region. That transformation, whatever its later consequences, was not engineered in foreign capitals. It was carried by millions in the streets of Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. It was internal, national, and unmistakably indigenous.\n\nYet today, critics point to the re-emergence of Reza Pahlavi— who left Iran as a child more than four decades ago and has lived his adult life in the West— as a symbol of what they describe as “exiled leadership” being elevated by foreign powers. To them, the idea that someone disconnected from the daily realities of Iranian society can be positioned as a national alternative, while US and Israeli leaders openly signal support for regime change, contaminates the authenticity of domestic protest.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump issues statements hinting at military action “in support of protesters,” critics argue that the organic nature of Iranian dissent is immediately compromised. What may begin as a homegrown demand for reform becomes vulnerable to being branded— internally and internationally— as a foreign-engineered project. The protester in the street is no longer just a citizen with a grievance. He or she becomes, in the narrative of the state, a potential proxy of external power.\n\nThis is not merely a theoretical concern. History is crowded with examples where foreign intervention discredited legitimate internal movements by attaching them to geopolitical agendas. In 1953, Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh was overthrown in a covert U.S.-British operation after nationalizing the country’s oil industry. The Shah who replaced him ruled for more than two decades with Western backing, until a revolution erupted that reshaped the region and locked Iran and the USA into a cycle of hostility that continues to this day.\n\nFor those who view Venezuela and Iran through this historical lens, the pattern appears consistent. Sovereignty is tolerated when it aligns with great-power interests and challenged when it does not. Venezuela’s vast oil reserves— estimated at over 300 billion barrels, the largest proven reserves in the world— are not an abstract statistic. They represent strategic leverage in a global energy system where access to supply shapes diplomacy, alliances, and conflict.\n\nThis is why the charge of unpatriotism carries such emotional weight. To fight your own government is a political act. To fight your own society’s economic survival by endorsing foreign coercion is, for critics, something far more severe. It is seen as stepping outside the national tent and inviting an overwhelming external force inside— one that may crush institutions, fracture unity, and redraw the country’s future according to interests that are not its own.\n\nEven the Arctic has entered this conversation. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that consistently ranks among the world’s strongest regions for governance, transparency, and human rights, has become a subject of geopolitical attention because of its rare earth minerals, strategic location, and emerging shipping routes. The implication is stark: in an era of intensifying global rivalry, even the most stable and democratic societies can become strategic assets rather than simply sovereign communities.\n\nAt its core, this controversy is not about medals, exiles, or speeches. It is about a red line between internal reform and external allegiance. It is about whether political ambition remains rooted in the will of the people or becomes dependent on the pressure of foreign capitals.\n\nOrganic struggle carries legitimacy because it is earned at home. It rises from neighbourhoods, workplaces, universities, and streets. It persuades before it compels. It mobilizes before it conquers. Imported struggle arrives differently— through sanctions, asset seizures, diplomatic isolation, and military signaling.\n\nHistory’s judgment on such alliances is rarely kind. Nations may survive bad governments. They rarely emerge whole when their sovereignty becomes a bargaining chip in someone else’s strategic game. The ultimate right to shape a country’s future, this argument insists, must remain in the hands of its own people— not in the applause of foreign leaders, and not in the shadow of global power.","summary":"i enjoy reading your article, such a great piece, keep up the good work, webdesign freelancer deutschland is the best webdesign freelacing service in Germany, you can check it out.

The War Department is not.” The decision marks a sharp break in long-standing academic ties between the U.S. military and Harvard, and comes as President Donald Trump’s administration steps up pressure on elite universities over campus protests, diversity policies and foreign partnerships.Hegseth said the move would take effect from the 2026–2027 academic year, ending graduate-level professional military education programmes at Harvard.

George Washington took command of the Continental Army in Harvard Yard,” Hegseth said. “Through the Korean War, military service was commonplace at Harvard. There are more Medal of Honor recipients from Harvard than any other civilian institution.”He argued, however, that Harvard today is no longer welcoming to military personnel or aligned with US values.“Campus research programmes have partnered with the Chinese Communist Party,” Hegseth said.

The pact limited the number of nuclear warheads the two countries could deploy on missiles, submarines and bombers. On Friday, in a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, on the subject, US Undersecretary of State Thomas G. DiNanno revealed that China conducted a nuclear weapons test in 2020. In the posts, DiNanno sharply criticized the conduct of Beijing and Moscow. “New START was signed in 2010 and its limits on warheads and launchers are no longer relevant in 2026 when one nuclear power is expanding its arsenal at a scale and pace not seen in over half a century and another continues to maintain and develop a vast range of nuclear systems unconstrained by New START’s terms,” he wrote. According to DiNanno, “Almost all of the U.S. deployed nuclear forces were subject to New START while only a fraction of Russia's much larger stockpile was…exactly zero Chinese nuclear weapons were covered by New START.” He also issued a warning: “No longer constrained by the political-military circumstances of 2010 and the treaty they yielded and in response to the destabilizing behavior of these other countries, the United States can now finally take steps…to strengthen deterrence on behalf of the American people and our allies.” DiNanno detailed the alleged Chinese nuclear test, which he said took place in 2020. “China has conducted nuclear explosive tests, including preparing for tests with designated yields in the hundreds of tons… China has used decoupling – a method to decrease the effectiveness of seismic monitoring – to hide its activities from the world. China conducted one such yield producing nuclear test on June 22, 2020,” he said. At the time, countries around the world were grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, which broke out in China and spread globally. He added that “this confluence of factors – serial Russian violations, growth of worldwide stockpiles, and flaws in New START’s design and implementation – gives the United States a clear imperative to call for a new architecture that addresses the threats of today, not those of a bygone era. As throughout our history, the United States has maintained a willingness to seek strategic stability and arms control arrangements that are verifiable, enforceable, and contribute to the security of the United States and her allies. What we are proposing is not talks for the sake of talks—with this effort, the United States is looking for meaningful progress based in concrete actions.” The executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which monitors nuclear activity worldwide, told CNN that no incident matching the profile of a nuclear test was identified on June 22, 2020, contradicting the US official’s claim. The organization’s head, Robert Floyd, said later analyses also did not determine that such a test took place. Pentagon: China to reach 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030 New START was signed in 2010 and capped the number of nuclear warheads that Russia and the United States were allowed to deploy operationally at 1,550, out of more than 5,000 each possessed, and limited their missiles and bombers to 800. Another provision allowed short-notice inspections at the powers’ bases to verify compliance, but those inspections stopped after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and were never resumed. Russia announced in 2023 that it was ending inspections entirely, amid rising tensions with the United States and the West over the war in Ukraine, though it pledged to continue complying with the treaty’s limits. The treaty’s restrictions were widely seen as a critical confidence-building measure between the nuclear powers and as a safeguard against a dangerous arms race. The agreement was originally set to expire in 2021, but when President Joe Biden entered the White House, he quickly reached an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend it by five years. Last month, President Donald Trump addressed the issue in comments that appeared to downplay its urgency, telling The New York Times that if the treaty were to lapse, it would do so, adding that a better agreement could be reached. Some have defended Trump’s call for a new treaty. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told The New York Times that the existing treaty does not address emerging technologies, including hypersonic missiles, underwater nuclear weapons and potential space-based arms. During his first term, Trump also demanded that any new agreement replacing New START include limits on China, which is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal. Estimates put China’s stockpile at about 600 nuclear warheads, and the Pentagon assesses that the number will grow to 1,000 by 2030. China’s arsenal remains far smaller than those of Russia and the United States, a disparity Beijing has cited in calling efforts to include it in such limits unreasonable. Still, the pace of China’s nuclear buildup has drawn Washington’s attention.

Under the order, beginning on its effective date, the United States may impose an additional ad valorem duty-for example, up to 25 per cent- on goods imported into the US from any country that directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires goods or services from Iran. The move is aimed at protecting US national security, foreign policy and economic interests.

The administration accused Iran of backing proxy militant groups across the Middle East, repressing its own population, and diverting resources toward nuclear and missile programmes instead of domestic needs.\nThe White House said these actions constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States, its allies and interests, requiring a sustained and intensified response. The order builds on President Trump's long-standing hardline approach toward Iran. During his first term, Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, reinstated \"maximum pressure\" sanctions and designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation. After returning to the office, Trump restored maximum pressure policies to deny Iran any path to a nuclear weapon. The White House also pointed to recent US military and diplomatic actions, including operations targeting Iran's nuclear infrastructure and the deployment of additional US forces to the region, aimed at pressuring Tehran to negotiate a deal that would permanently block its nuclear ambitions.\nSeparately, the US government issued a security alert for Iran, warning of heightened security measures, internet disruptions, flight cancellations, and nationwide restrictions on communications. The advisory urged US citizens to leave Iran immediately if it is safe to do so, avoid demonstrations, maintain a low profile and prepare for prolonged disruptions.\nThe United States currently has no diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. Switzerland, through its embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for US interests in the country, the advisory said.

It allows the United States to impose additional tariffs on imports from any country that “directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran.”\n\nThe White House said the move is part of a broader effort to confront Iran’s actions abroad. It cited Tehran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities, its ballistic missile program, support for terrorism, and activities that destabilize the Middle East.\n\nIn a fact sheet, the White House described Iran as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The fact sheet said Tehran supports proxy groups and militias across the region, including forces that have killed and wounded Americans and that continue to target US troops, partners, and allies.\n\nThe administration also pointed to Iran’s internal conditions. It said the regime has spent national resources on nuclear and missile programs while the country’s infrastructure and population struggle.\n\nThe White House accused Iran of severe repression at home. It said the regime has killed protesters, denied basic human rights and used violence to maintain power. It also accused Tehran of spreading extremism and undermining efforts aimed at peace and regional stability.\n\nThe administration said these actions amount to a continuing and extraordinary threat to the United States. It said that the threat requires a sustained and intensified response to protect Americans and US interests.\n\nThe executive order reinforces President Trump’s long-standing position that Iran must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The White House said he has made that pledge repeatedly, both during his first term and during his campaign.\n\nAccording to the fact sheet, the President is building on actions taken during his earlier presidency. Those included withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, restoring what the administration calls maximum pressure and designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n\nThe White House said that after returning to office, Trump again restored maximum pressure on Iran. The goal, it said, is to deny Tehran any path to a nuclear weapon and to counter its influence beyond its borders.\n\nThe administration also referred to military steps taken last year. It said that in June, after Iran refused to reach a deal with Washington, President Trump authorized an operation that destroyed Iran’s nuclear facilities and significantly set back its nuclear ambitions.\n\nThe fact sheet said the President has recently deployed a large US military force to the region. It said Iran was urged to negotiate a fair deal that would exclude nuclear weapons or face stronger consequences.\n\nThe White House framed the Iran order as part of a wider strategy toward governments it considers hostile. It cited recent actions against Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro and new tariffs imposed on countries that provide oil to Cuba.\n\nThe administration said those steps are meant to send a clear message. Dictators and state sponsors of terrorism, it said, will be held to account. The executive order takes effect early Friday.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Feb 7 (SocialNews.XYZ) US President Donald Trump signed an executive order renewing the national emergency on Iran and creating a new tariff system targeting countries that buy goods or services from Tehran.

According to the White House, the action is part of a broader effort to counter what it described as Iran's \"malign influence,\" including Tehran's pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for terrorism, ballistic missile development and regional destabilisation. The administration accused Iran of backing proxy militant groups across the Middle East, repressing its own population, and diverting resources toward nuclear and missile programmes instead of domestic needs.\n\nThe White House said these actions constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States, its allies and interests, requiring a sustained and intensified response. The order builds on President Trump's long-standing hardline approach toward Iran. During his first term, Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, reinstated \"maximum pressure\" sanctions and designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation. After returning to the office, Trump restored maximum pressure policies to deny Iran any path to a nuclear weapon. The White House also pointed to recent US military and diplomatic actions, including operations targeting Iran's nuclear infrastructure and the deployment of additional US forces to the region, aimed at pressuring Tehran to negotiate a deal that would permanently block its nuclear ambitions.Separately, the US government issued a security alert for Iran, warning of heightened security measures, internet disruptions, flight cancellations, and nationwide restrictions on communications. The advisory urged US citizens to leave Iran immediately if it is safe to do so, avoid demonstrations, maintain a low profile and prepare for prolonged disruptions.The United States currently has no diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. Switzerland, through its embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for US interests in the country, the advisory said.

In exchange, India agreed to stop buying Russian oil and ease several trade restrictions.The implementation of this reduction has yet to take effect.Other provisions of the agreement include the elimination of tariffs on selected aircraft and related components, according to a separate joint statement issued by the White House on Friday.The statement also noted that India plans to purchase $500 billion worth of US energy products, aircraft and parts, precious metals, technology goods, and coking coal over the next five years.This change represents a substantial cut in US tariffs on Indian goods, which stood at 50% late last year.Previously, Trump had consistently accused India of aiding Moscow by continuing its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that this indirectly backed Russia’s military operations in Ukraine.India has been a significant buyer of Russian crude, fulfilling nearly 90% of its oil import requirements through long-term supply agreements.After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the subsequent Western sanctions on its energy exports, India benefited from buying discounted Russian oil, which helped lower its overall import bill. However, India has recently begun scaling back these purchases. A Reuters report said imports from Russia were about 1.2 million barrels per day in January and are projected to decline to roughly 1 million barrels per day in February and around 800,000 barrels per day in March.","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/india/us-lifts-25-penalty-tariff-on-india-over-russian-oil-imports-3014436.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2026/02/07/1901718-mixcollage-07-feb-2026-06-52-am-9536.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:22:36","author":"Zee Media Bureau","authors":["Zee Media Bureau"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":400230982,"title":"Trump says he didn't see Obama clip in video before it was posted","text":"p>US ​President Donald Trump on Friday said he did not ​see the full video ‌clip that ⁠depicted Democratic former ‌President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes before it was ​posted on his social media, adding he did not feel he ‌made ‌a mistake.Trump said he saw the ⁠start of the video, which was focused on alleged voter ⁠fraud, and ⁠gave it to unnamed ‌staffers to ‌post..'Good friend in Washington nearing century but PM Modi silent': Congress as Trump repeats India-Pakistan claim.\"Nobody knew that was in the end, if they ‍would have looked, they would have seen it, and probably they would have the sense to take it down,\" he told reporters ​aboard Air ‌Force One.</p","url":"https://www.deccanherald.com/world/trump-says-he-didnt-see-obama-clip-in-video-before-it-was-posted-3889791","image":"https://media.assettype.com/deccanherald/2026-02-07/17jfalhw/file84gr4o5szk3wdj0q1ht.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:21:20","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.654},{"id":400230040,"title":"Trump Orders Rollback Of 25% Tariff On India Over Russian Oil Imports After Trade Deal","text":"US President Donald Trump on Friday announced the removal of an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods that had been imposed over India’s purchases of Russian oil.

Under Maduro, dissidents were often charged with crimes like treason, terrorism or spreading hate.\n\nThe bill would also lift bans that prevent opposition figures like Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado from running for public office.\n\nBut the amnesty measure would not cover crimes like murder, human rights violations or corruption.\n\nThe second and final vote on the bill is slated to take place on Tuesday. Rodriguez indicated that once the bill was signed into law, the mass release would begin.\n\n“As soon as the law is adopted, they will also be released the same day,” he said on Friday.\n\nThe Maduro government had long been accused of stifling political dissent through arbitrary detention, torture and extrajudicial killing.\n\nOn January 3, however, United States President Donald Trump authorised a military operation to abduct Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, transporting them to New York to face trial on drug trafficking charges.\n\nSince that time, the Trump administration has pressured the interim presidency of Delcy Rodriguez to comply with its demands, particularly on the sale and extraction of Venezuelan oil.\n\nBut administration officials have also repeatedly blasted the Maduro government for its human rights record. This week’s prisoner release deadline, together with the amnesty law, is likely to be hailed as a victory for the Trump White House.\n\nStill, concern abounds over whether human rights commitments will be maintained and justice served to alleged abusers within the government.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has said it has already released as many as 900 political prisoners.\n\nBut human rights groups like Foro Penal have recorded a number far lower, closer to 383.

While many of the things he says on a daily basis would be disqualifying for most other politicians, supporters of the president want Donald Trump to be graded on a curve.\n\nBut thinking people can see that the permission structures built around excusing the president’s often demeaning, often cruel manner of expressing himself have only made American politics more polarized and toxic than they need to be.\n\nA case in point is the president’s Truth Social post on Thursday night: a one-minute video pitching the conspiracy theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Toward the end of the video, the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays and a clip of Barack and Michelle Obama’s faces superimposed onto apes appears.\n\nThe post naturally provoked an uproar about the obvious racism of the depiction, with Gov. Gavin Newsom leading the charge to condemn it. “Disgusting behavior by the President,” the governor posted on X. “Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.”\n\nMost Republican members of Congress, unfortunately, care more about their political careers than the dignity of America, so few spoke up. Even so, the president appeared to have pulled the video. But he did so only after spokesperson Karoline Leavitt offered utterly specious and demonstrably false excuses for the post, calling the responses to the video “fake.”\n\n“This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from ‘The Lion King,’” she told Newsweek. “Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”\n\nThere are some in MAGA world who might find that explanation sufficient, but we suspect most Trump supporters, after even the briefest of introspection, can see the problem with excusing a racist depiction of the Obamas as “fake.”\n\nIn addition to that, Americans across the political spectrum should be troubled by the president’s ongoing fixation with the 2020 presidential election. He lost that election. Every state and local jurisdiction certified their respective election results. No outcome-altering fraud has ever been found. Dozens of lawsuits were tossed, including by Trump-appointed judges.\n\nThe president’s ridiculous and conspiratorial response to the 2020 election no doubt played a role in losing two Republican Senate seats in Georgia in 2021 and then whipped his supporters into enough of a frenzy that they stormed the United States Capitol to disrupt the certification of the electoral votes.\n\nWe say this as an editorial board that remains, as ever, committed to fiscal responsibility, limited government, civil liberties, personal freedom and free markets. Americans must hold the president to a higher standard and stop excusing him like a misbehaving child from a broken home. He is a 79-year-old man and the president of the United States. The failure to do so has only cheapened our nation and risks our future as a beacon for the world.","summary":"Americans have gone numb to the ridiculous statements of the president of the United States","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2026/02/06/editorial-theres-no-excuse-for-trumps-racist-social-media-post/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Trump_40103-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:09:02","author":"The Editorial Board","authors":["The Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":400226712,"title":"Trump refuses to apologize for post depicting Obamas as apes and claims he’s the ‘least racist’ president","text":"President Donald Trump refused to apologize for a video he shared on Truth Social — and later deleted — on Friday that included a racist image depicting former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes. \n\nDuring a press gaggle on Friday night outside Air Force One, reporters asked Trump about the post.

Those talks were launched by President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 13, 2025. The interim deal is designed to deliver early results and support more resilient supply chains, officials said.\n\n“The Interim Agreement between the United States and India will represent a historic milestone in our countries’ partnership, demonstrating a common commitment to reciprocal and balanced trade based on mutual interests and concrete outcomes,” the announcement said.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and wrote on Truth Social that the two countries have agreed on a trade deal. He pointed to reciprocity, expanded market access, and efforts to address long-standing trade imbalances as core goals, while highlighting the broader strategic importance of economic ties with New Delhi.\n\nUnder the framework, India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and on a wide range of US food and agricultural products. These include dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits, and other products.\n\nThe United States will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 per cent on originating goods of India under an executive order aimed at addressing large and persistent US goods trade deficits. The tariff will apply to products such as textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home décor, artisanal products, and certain machinery.\n\nIf the Interim Agreement is successfully concluded, the United States said it will remove the reciprocal tariff on a wide range of goods identified for aligned partners. These include generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.\n\nThe framework also removes US tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts from India that were imposed under national security proclamations covering aluminum, steel, and copper imports. In a related move, and consistent with US national security requirements, India will receive a preferential tariff-rate quota for automotive parts subject to tariffs on automobile and auto parts imports.\n\nIndia will also receive negotiated outcomes on generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. That provision is contingent on the findings of a US Section 232 investigation.\n\nBoth countries agreed to provide each other with preferential market access in sectors of interest and to establish rules of origin. These rules are intended to ensure that the benefits of the agreement accrue mainly to the United States and India.\n\nAs per the joint statement, the framework also addresses non-tariff barriers.

He expressed appreciation for the role played by Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal in pursuing what he described as fair and balanced trade.\n\nThe framework reaffirms the commitment of both countries to negotiations on a broader US-India Bilateral Trade Agreement. Those talks were launched by Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 13, 2025. Officials said the Interim Agreement is meant to deliver early and concrete results while strengthening supply chains.\n\n“The Interim Agreement between the United States and India will represent a historic milestone in our countries’ partnership, demonstrating a common commitment to reciprocal and balanced trade based on mutual interests and concrete outcomes,” the joint announcement said.\n\nUnder the framework, India will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods. It will also cut duties on a wide range of US food and agricultural products. These include dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits, and other products.\n\nThe United States will apply a reciprocal tariff rate of 18 percent on Indian goods under an executive order aimed at addressing large and persistent US goods trade deficits. The tariff will cover products such as textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber, organic chemicals, home décor, artisanal products, and certain machinery.\n\nIf the Interim Agreement is concluded successfully, the United States said it will remove the reciprocal tariff on a range of goods identified for aligned partners. These include generic pharmaceuticals, gems and diamonds, and aircraft parts.\n\nThe framework also calls for removing US tariffs on certain aircraft and aircraft parts from India imposed under national security proclamations on aluminum, steel, and copper imports. In line with US national security requirements, India will receive a preferential tariff-rate quota for automotive parts.\n\nIndia will also receive negotiated outcomes on generic pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients. This will depend on the findings of a US Section 232 investigation.\n\nBoth countries agreed to provide preferential market access in sectors of interest. They will establish rules of origin to ensure the benefits of the agreement accrue mainly to the United States and India. They also committed to addressing non-tariff barriers affecting bilateral trade.\n\nIndia agreed to address long-standing barriers affecting US medical devices. It will eliminate restrictive import licensing procedures that delay access for US information and communication technology goods.\n\nIndia will also decide within six months whether US-developed or international standards are acceptable for exports in identified sectors.

The White House said that, where applicable, refunds of duties already collected will be processed in accordance with US law and standard procedures of US Customs and Border Protection.The order authorises the Secretary of State, in coordination with other senior officials and departments, to take necessary steps to implement the decision, including issuing rules and regulations. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the US International Trade Commission, may also make technical modifications to the tariff schedule by notice in the Federal Register.The White House said the US will continue to monitor India’s compliance, particularly with respect to the import of Russian oil. If India resumes direct or indirect imports of Russian Federation oil, the administration may consider reimposing the additional tariff.US had earlier imposed an additional 25% tariff on goods from India, saying the country directly or indirectly imported Russian oil.

Donald Trump is engaged in imperialism, and in that US foreign policy endeavour, Shannon can be used for all those scenarios.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Transport said: \"Stops at Irish airports by private and commercial charters which are technical stops for non-traffic purposes (ie not picking up or setting down passengers), do not require prior authorisation from the department. \n\n\"Therefore, no further examination of this operation is required under civil aviation legislation.\"\n\nIn a follow-up query, the department said that no authorisation was requested for those on board to carry weapons. Under existing laws, it is illegal for flights to carry weaponry through Irish airspace unless prior consent is provided by the transport minister.\n\nLast year, when the same plane was raised in a parliamentary question by now-President Catherine Connolly, transport minister Darragh O'Brien said that the operator of the flight had a \"US government contract\".\n\n\"The aircraft in question is \"N\" registered, which means it is recorded on the US Federal Aviation Administration registry. \n\nIt has the appropriate safety approval to operate commercial aviation operations within, into or out of the European Union. \n\nIt is understood that the air operator in question holds a US Government contract to carry out domestic and international air services,\" Mr O'Brien's response said.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security told The Guardian: “If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period.”\n\nLast year the same plane stopped in Shannon en route to Djibouti with the US Department of Homeland Security confirming that the aircraft was transporting eight men, which it described as “violent criminals”, to the African country in contravention of a court order blocking the deportations.","summary":"Two passengers on the January 21 flight claimed eight Palestinians on board had their ankles shackled","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41789225.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9920/4960229_11_seoimage1x1_Copy_20of_207a1b2a24-7fea-4cd0-b2f6-3c397fcda439.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 01:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Paul Hosford","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Paul Hosford"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":400229132,"title":"Judge rules Trump administration can&#8217;t withhold child care and social service funds to Illinois and 4 other states","text":"A federal judge ruled Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must keep funds flowing to child care subsidies and other social service programs in five Democratic-controlled states — at least for now.\n\nU.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in New York, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, granted the states’ request for a preliminary injunction and a stay against the administration to bar it from withholding the money while a lawsuit works its way through the courts.\n\nThe states affected include California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. The five states said they receive a total of more than $10 billion a year from the programs.\n\nAttorneys representing the federal government in the case did not immediately return emails seeking comment Friday night. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment.\n\nTwo temporary rulings had been issued in January, when the states sued, that blocked the federal governmentfrom holding back the funding, with the latest set to expire on Friday.\n\nThe programs in question are the Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes child care for 1.3 million children from low-income families nationally; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance and job training; and the Social Services Block Grant, a smaller fund that provides money for a variety of programs.\n\n“Every day, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers rely on these funds to pay for necessities and provide their children a safe place to learn,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “This illegal funding freeze would have caused severe chaos in the lives of some of the most vulnerable families in our state. I am proud to have secured another victory in this case to put a stop to it.”\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta added in a statement, “The Trump Administration’s actions are not only unlawful — they are cruel, targeting the most vulnerable among us.”\n\nThe government’s explanation of its actions has shifted.\n\nWhen the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it was withholding the money, it said there was “reason to believe” the states were granting benefits to people in the country illegally. It did not initially explain where the information came from. But in a court hearing, a federal government lawyer said it was largely in reaction to news reports about possible fraud.\n\nHHS did not immediately return an email request for comment.\n\nAnd while the government’s initial news release said it “froze” access to money, federal lawyers told the judge that wasn’t what was happening. Rather, they said, the Trump administration was requiring more information from those states.\n\nThe government says it wants more records from the group of states, including names and Social Security numbers for beneficiaries of some of the programs.\n\nAdvocates warn that cutting off the child care subsidies could have deep impacts. Day cares that accept the subsidies could face the risk of layoffs or closures. And that would affect both the lower-income families who receive the subsidies and families who don’t. And for many families, losing child care can make it hard or impossible to work.\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted multiple programs in Minnesota due to previous fraud cases and new allegations, mostly involving members of the state’s Somali community.\n\nBesides the heightened requirements for the four other Democratic-led states, the administration also has required all states to submit more information about how they’re using money in the child care program before they can draw down the funds.\n\nAssociated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/02/06/illinois-child-care-federal-funding-ruling/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-FUNDING-FREEZE-DAYCARES01_257408076.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 00:59:51","author":"Geoff Mulvihill","authors":["Geoff Mulvihill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":400227884,"title":"US lifts 25% penalty tariff on India over Russian oil imports","text":"Washington DC [US], February 7 (ANI): US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order revoking the additional 25 per cent tariff imposed on all imports from India over New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil, the White House said.United States announced the termination of the additional tariff imposed in August 2025 on Indian imports, citing concerns about Russia's actions against Ukraine and India's then-imports of Russian oil.According to the White House, the decision follows a review of additional information and recommendations from senior US officials regarding India's recent actions to address the national emergency declared under an executive order.The administration said India has committed to stop directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil, pledged to purchase US energy products, and entered into a framework with Washington to expand defence cooperation over the next 10 years.\"After considering the information and recommendations these officials have provided to me, among other things, I have determined that India has taken significant steps to address the national emergency described in Executive Order 14066 and to align sufficiently with the United States on national security, foreign policy, and economic matters,\" the executive order said, adding that the tariff modification was \"necessary and appropriate\" to deal with the ongoing national emergency.As a result, the additional 25 per cent duty imposed under a particular executive order will be eliminated, and related tariff provisions under the Harmonised Tariff Schedule of the United States will be terminated.

Zelensky has long argued that holding elections is impossible under martial law, but said in December 2025 that national legislation could be amended to allow them.\n\nThe American team, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, urged Ukrainian officials during recent meetings in Abu Dhabi and Miami to organize the vote “soon,” Reuters said, citing three sources.\n\nUS and Ukrainian officials have also discussed the possibility of holding elections alongside a referendum on a potential peace deal with Russia in May, the news agency reported. Several sources, however, dismissed the US-proposed timeline as “fanciful.”\n\n“The Americans are in a hurry,” one source told Reuters.\n\nAnother source said there was “still no progress” on territorial issues, which remain the main point of contention between Moscow and Kiev.\n\nRussia has said that it no longer views Zelensky as the legitimate leader of Ukraine and that his status could complicate the signing of a peace agreement. President Vladimir Putin said in December that Moscow was prepared to consider refraining from “deep strikes” on Ukrainian territory on the day of an election.\n\nZelensky said the same month that Ukraine would need up to three months to organize a vote, citing the need for US security guarantees.\n\nZelensky’s standing has also been affected by a series of high-profile corruption scandals that led to the resignation of two government ministers and his longtime chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. Recent polling shows Zelensky at 62%, trailing former top military commander Valery Zaluzhny at 72% and Kirill Budanov at 70%. Budanov, a former military intelligence chief, replaced Yermak as head of the presidential office last month.","summary":"The US is pushing Ukraine to hold national election as Vladimir Zelensky’s presidential term expired in 2024 \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/632137-us-ukraine-hold-election/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2026.02/article/69868cca85f5403d202899f8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-07 00:55:54","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.256}]}
