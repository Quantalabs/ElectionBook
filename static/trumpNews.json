Both of the riders have been detained by police as the officers are treated by medical personnel on the scene. \n\nElsewhere, officers were reportedly struck by fireworks as they worked to break up a violent crowd, while protesters were filmed brandishing 3D creations of Trump's severed head on a pole.\n\nExtraordinary footage shows at least five Waymo self-driving cars being set alight and vandalized, prompting an indefinite shutdown of Los Angeles St north of Arcadia, and south of Alameda amid safety concerns about the lithium batteries. \n\nOne protester repeatedly smashed the driver side window of a Waymo which had been surrounded by demonstrators as flames engulfed another car nearby.\n\n'Burn, burn, burn,' the protesters cheered.\n\nAt the Los Angeles City Hall, authorities on horseback were locked in a tense standoff with even more demonstrators, sparking fears from local law enforcement officers that they were in for a 'rough night.'\n\nFurther arrests have been made throughout the Civic Center area of Downtown LA. \n\nProtesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center were warned that the LAPD incident commander had approved the use of 'less lethal munitions' to break up the crowd.\n\nThis came as authorities declared the area an 'unlawful assembly' and warned any protester who chose to stay would be subject to arrest. \n\nThe LAPD began issuing rolling dispersal orders and declaring some of the protests acts of 'unlawful assembly' as violence ramped up on Sunday afternoon. \n\nProtesters within regions now under a dispersal order have been warned to evacuate now or face arrest. \n\nDemonstrations even reached the upscale AC Hotel Pasadena by Sunday afternoon after the arrival of emergency vehicles.\n\nWhile that protest had not descended into violence, those who had gathered chanted 'ICE is not welcome here' and blasted songs in Spanish in a display of solidarity. \n\nAuthorities issued a separate warning that the city has been placed on 'tactical alert', meaning all of the department's officers are now on notice that they could be called up for service at any given moment. \n\nOfficers who are already on duty are not allowed to end their shift until they have been relieved by their commanders, and residents of Los Angeles are warned that low priority calls may go unanswered while the alert is ongoing. \n\nThese officers will now join the 2,000 California National Guard troops Trump earlier deployed to Los Angeles to quell the protests, which he called 'a form of rebellion.'\n\nTrump issued an extraordinary directive on Sunday vowing to 'liberate Los Angeles' from illegal aliens which have 'invaded and occupied a once great American city.'\n\nA combined effort led by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi will restore order, Trump said. \n\nHe has directed his key personnel to 'to take all such action necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.\n\n'Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free,' Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday afternoon.\n\nTrump lamented the current state of the city, expressing concern that 'a once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals. \n\n'Now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our Federal Agents to try and stop our deportation operations.'\n\nBut he vowed 'these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve' as images emerge of troops on the ground in the downtown area of the city ready to defend the city from more violent demonstrations.\n\nThe president congratulated the National Guard on doing a 'great job' in the city in the early hours of Sunday morning, although they hadn't arrived yet. \n\nBut Governor Newsom shared a very different perspective just hours later, revealing he has urged Trump to 'rescind the order [and] return control to California.'\n\n'We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved,' Newsom said in his extraordinary rebuke.\n\n'This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they're actually needed.\n\n'These are the acts of a dictator, not a President.' \n\nMayor Karen Bass echoed those statements, telling CNN: 'This sows chaos that is not warranted nor needed in the city of Los Angeles.\n\n'It's as though troops were rolled out in a provocative manner and I do not see how that is helpful to Los Angeles right now, it's not the type of resources that we need in the city.\n\n'We do not need to have our city under siege.' \n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris joined in on the Democrat pile-on on Sunday, denouncing the ICE raids which sparked the civil unrest.\n\n'Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos,' Harris wrote in a statement on X. \n\n'In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.' \n\nEarly Sunday, the violence was limited to a small area in downtown Los Angeles, with the rest of the city of 4 million people largely unaffected. Since then, pockets of protests have began popping up in broader parts of the community.\n\nThe arrival of the National Guard and federal reinforcements follows days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount and neighboring Compton.\n\nHegseth had warned on Saturday that 'active duty Marines' were on 'high alert' as the riots created havoc on the streets. \n\nOn Sunday, Noem said the National Guard would 'keep peace and allow people to be able to protest but also to keep law and order.'\n\nThe troops included members of the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense that showed dozens of National Guard members with long guns and an armored vehicle.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor´s office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.\n\nNewsom described Trump's decision to call in the National Guard as a 'provocative show of force' that would only escalate tensions. \n\nHe added that Hegseth's threat to deploy Marines on American soil was 'deranged behavior.' \n\nRioters have also been warned that the use of non-lethal munitions has been authorized to maintain order, prompting a warning from the LAPD urging people to 'leave the area' to avoid the 'pain and discomfort' such weapons can bring.\n\nBut the escalation comes in response to rioters using flaming projectiles and throwing rocks at authorities, as they set fire to cars in their path of destruction. \n\nThey were met by federal agents in riot gear and gas masks. The mob was warned to leave in both Spanish and English.\n\nTear gas and smoke filled the air as confrontations between immigration authorities and demonstrators extended into a third day.\n\nThese riots were set against the backdrop of Trump's latest immigration raid, targeting the safe haven of Los Angeles on Friday.\n\nDHS said in a statement that the recent ICE operations resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants.\n\nTrump's border czar Tom Homan said those arrested included child sex offenders, gang members and national security threats.\n\n'They arrested a lot of bad people yesterday and today,' Homan asserted. 'We're making Los Angeles safer.'\n\nHoman also remarked that ICE agents were often wearing masks as they conducted raids because they were worried about their families being doxxed.\n\nBy Saturday night federal agents reported having arrested more than a dozen 'agitators who impeded agents in their ability to conduct law enforcement operations.","summary":"Horrifying scenes of violence have stretched into a third day and sparked a political war of words between Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14792657/los-angeles-anarchy-freeway-101-blocked-violent-clashes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/09/00/99164117-0-image-a-17_1749426479086.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/09/1233893888698203758/1024x576_MP4_1233893888698203758.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-09 01:28:44","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":329427404,"title":"Could California go independent?","text":"Californians are not happy.

His overwhelming victory—securing 76.18% of votes, including 72.37% support from regional member countries—signals Africa’s confidence in his vision for the continent’s financial future.\n\nThe Right Leader at the Right Time: Sidi Ould Tah’s election marks a watershed moment for the African Development Bank. At 60, this distinguished Mauritanian economist brings something unprecedented to the presidency: experience in leading and transforming a Development Finance Institution. His decade-long tenure as President of the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) saw him quadruple the institution’s balance sheet while securing a coveted AAA rating—a testament to his exceptional leadership and strategic acumen.\n\nThis unique credential sets him apart from all previous presidents of the AfDB. While his predecessors brought valuable experience from various sectors—Donald Kaberuka from Rwanda’s Ministry of Finance and Akinwumi Adesina from agricultural development—none had the hands-on experience of actually running and transforming a Development Finance Institution (DFI) before ascending to lead Africa’s premier development institution.\n\nBuilding on Adesina’s Transformational Legacy: Dr. Akinwumi Adesina’s tenure (2015-2025) has been nothing short of revolutionary. His “High 5s” development priorities transformed the AfDB into a powerhouse of African development, achieving remarkable results in infrastructure development, agricultural transformation, energy access, regional integration, and improving the quality of life for Africans. Under his stewardship, the Bank became more relevant, more impactful, and more African-focused than ever before.\n\nTah inherits this transformed institution at a critical juncture. The foundation has been laid; now comes the task of scaling these achievements to meet Africa’s enormous development challenges in an increasingly complex global environment.\n\nThe Five-Pillar Strategic Agenda for President Tah\n\n1. Strengthening the DFI Ecosystem: National and Regional Integration\n\nPresident Tah’s most critical priority must be the systematic strengthening of national and regional Development Finance Institutions across Africa. His proven track record at BADEA positions him uniquely to understand the intricacies of DFI operations, capital optimization, and institutional transformation.\n\nThe strategy should involve:\n\n• Capacity Building Programmes: Establishing comprehensive training and technical assistance programmes for DFI leadership across Africa through the Association of African Development Finance Institutions (AADFI)\n\n• Capital Mobilization Support: Creating innovative financing mechanisms to help national DFIs access long-term capital\n\n• Technology Transfer: Implementing standardized digital platforms and risk management systems across African DFIs\n\n• Regional Coordination: Fostering greater collaboration between regional DFIs to avoid duplication and maximize impact\n\n2. Accelerating Infrastructure Development Through DFI Networks\n\nAfrica’s infrastructure deficit remains staggering, estimated at $130-170 billion annually. President Tah must leverage the expanded DFI network to create an infrastructure financing revolution:\n\n• Infrastructure Bond Markets: Developing local currency bond markets through DFI partnerships\n\n• Blended Finance Mechanisms: Creating innovative public-private partnerships that combine DFI resources with private capital\n\n• Cross-Border Projects: Facilitating regional infrastructure projects through coordinated DFI financing\n\n• Climate-Resilient Infrastructure: Ensuring all infrastructure investments meet climate adaptation and mitigation standards\n\n3. Formalizing Africa’s Informal Economy\n\nWith over 85% of Africa’s workforce operating in the informal sector, President Tah’s vision of formalization represents a massive opportunity for economic transformation:\n\n• Digital Financial Inclusion: Partnering with national DFIs to expand mobile banking and digital payment systems\n\n• MSME Financing: Creating specialized financing windows for micro, small, and medium enterprises\n\n• Skills Development: Investing in vocational training programmes linked to formal sector opportunities\n\n• Regulatory Reform: Supporting governments in creating enabling environments for business formalization\n\n4. Youth Employment and Entrepreneurship\n\nAfrica’s demographic dividend—with 60% of the population under 25—represents both an opportunity and a challenge:\n\n• Youth Entrepreneurship Fund: Establishing dedicated financing facilities for young entrepreneurs across all sectors\n\n• Innovation Hubs: Supporting technology and innovation centers in partnership with national DFIs\n\n• Agricultural Modernization: Creating opportunities for youth in modern, technology-driven agriculture\n\n• Skills-Jobs Matching: Developing programs that align education and training with market demands\n\n5. Climate Finance Leadership\n\nClimate change poses existential threats to African development. President Tah must position the AfDB as the continent’s climate finance leader:\n\n• Climate Adaptation Fund: Mobilizing $50 billion over five years for climate-resilient infrastructure \n\n• Green Bond Program: Expanding the Bank’s green bond issuances to fund renewable energy projects\n\n• Carbon Market Development: Helping African countries monetize their carbon assets\n\n• Climate-Smart Agriculture: Supporting smallholder farmers in adopting climate-resilient farming practices\n\nUnderstanding the AfDB Group Architecture\n\nBefore examining the challenges ahead, it is crucial to understand that President Tah will lead the African Development Bank Group, which comprises three legally and financially independent entities working toward common development goals: the African Development Bank (AfDB), the African Development Fund (ADF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). This tripartite structure presents both opportunities and complexities that the new president must navigate masterfully.\n\nNavigating Global Economic Headwinds and Political Uncertainties\n\nPresident Tah assumes office amid unprecedented challenges that will test his leadership mettle. The global economic environment presents a perfect storm of funding uncertainties, with President Trump’s administration requesting thatCongress end US contributions to the African Development Bank Group’s concessional arm—the very mechanism that supports the continent’s poorest countries through the African Development Fund (ADF).\n\nThis potential loss of American funding comes at a critical time.However, there is a silver lining: Nigeria has just injected an additional $500 million into the Nigeria Trust Fund, demonstrating African commitment to self-reliance in development finance. This contrast between diminishing Western support and increased African investment underscores the urgency of President Tah’s mission. His agenda must include:\n\nStrategic Response to Funding Challenges\n\nThe potential withdrawal of US funding from the ADF, coupled with Nigeria’s $500 million injection into the NTF, presents both crisis and opportunity:\n\n• Maximizing the Nigeria Trust Fund Impact: Leveraging Nigeria’s additional $500 million contribution to catalyze similar commitments from other African nations\n\n• Asian Development Partners: Strengthening relationships with China, Japan, and other Asian economies to fill the funding gap\n\n• Middle Eastern Partnerships: Leveraging his BADEA experience to deepen Arab-African financial cooperation, particularly given the Gulf states’ growing interest in African markets\n\n• African Capital Markets: Accelerating the development of domestic and regional capital markets to reduce dependence on Western funding\n\n• Private Sector Engagement: Creating innovative mechanisms to attract private capital, particularly from African pension funds and sovereign wealth funds\n\n• South-South Cooperation: Expanding partnerships with emerging economies like India, Brazil, and Turkey\n\nInstitutional Resilience\n\n• Risk Management: Implementing robust risk management frameworks across all Bank operations\n\n• Digital Transformation: Accelerating the Bank’s digital transformation to improve efficiency and reach\n\n• Knowledge Management: Establishing the AfDB as Africa’s premier development knowledge hub\n\n• Strategic Partnerships: Building alliances with other multilateral development banks and international financial institutions\n\nThe Imperative for Transformation\n\nThe convergence of Nigeria’s increased commitment to the NTF and America’s potential withdrawal from ADF funding creates a pivotal moment that demands bold leadership. President Tah must work harder than any previous AfDB president to:\n\nReimagine the Group’s Financial Architecture: The three-entity structure of the AfDB Group—comprising the AfDB, ADF, and NTF—must be optimized to maximize synergies while maintaining the legal and financial independence of each entity. This requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms that President Tah’s DFI experience uniquely qualifies him to implement.\n\nLead by Example: Nigeria’s $500 million contribution to the NTF should catalyze other African nations to increase their commitments. President Tah must embark on an intensive diplomatic campaign to secure similar commitments from Nigeria’s peers, including South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Kenya, and Ghana. Incidentally, in the 60 Years of AfDB, only Nigeria has a National Trust Fund.\n\nProve African Self-Reliance: The potential loss of US funding, while challenging, presents an opportunity to demonstrate that Africa can finance its development. Success in this endeavor would fundamentally alter the continent’s relationship with traditional development partners.\n\nThe Path Forward: Rising to the Challenge\n\nPresident Tah’s election represents more than a leadership transition—it is a test of Africa’s resolve to control its development destiny. The convergence of challenges—from Trump’s funding cuts to global economic uncertainties—demands that he works harder and more strategically than any previous president of the AfDB.\n\nHis proven ability to transform financial institutions at BADEA, combined with his deep understanding of African development challenges, positions him to lead the continent toward greater economic autonomy. However, success will require unprecedented coordination across the AfDB Group’s three entities, leveraging Nigeria’s NTF investment as a foundation for broader African financial commitment.\n\nThe success of his presidency will be measured not just by projects financed or infrastructure built, but by his ability to transform Africa’s financial architecture during a period of Western retrenchment. By strengthening national and regional Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) while maximizing coordination between the African Development Bank (AfDB), the African Development Fund (ADF), and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), President Tah can create a self-sustaining ecosystem of development finance that reduces Africa’s dependence on increasingly unreliable external funding.\n\nThe continent stands at a crossroads, with traditional development partners retreating just as African nations,such as Nigeria, step forward with increased commitments. With exemplary leadership, strategic vision, and coordinated action through strengthened DFI networks and optimized Group architecture, Africa can achieve the rapid infrastructure growth and economic transformation it desperately needs.\n\nPresident Sidi Ould Tah has the experience, the mandate, and the opportunity to make this vision a reality. But make no mistake—he will need to work harder than any of his predecessors to succeed in this challenging environment.\n\nThe time for action is now. Africa’s development future depends on it.\n\n• Dr. Ogidan, mni, is a Consultant to the Association of African Development Finance Institutions and a leading expert on African development finance.

Protesters directed chants of shame and go home at members of the National Guard, who stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields.After some protesters closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway.The presence of the Guard was inflaming tensions in the city, according to a letter sent to Trump by Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday afternoon. He formerly requested Trump remove the guard members, which he called a serious breach of state sovereignty. Trump has said the National Guard was necessary because Newsom and other Democrats have failed to stanch recent protests targeting immigration agents.Their deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.Deployment follows days of protest The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighbouring Compton.As federal agents set up a staging area on Saturday near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.Tensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed above 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.The recent protests remain far smaller than past events that have brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.Trump says there will be very strong law and order In a directive on Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States. He said he had authorised the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were violent people in Los Angeles and they're not gonna get away with it. Asked if he planned to send US troops to Los Angeles, Trump replied, We're gonna have troops everywhere. We're not going to let this happen to our country. We're not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden. He did not elaborate.Trump also said that California officials who stand in the way of the deportations could face charges. A Wisconsin judge was arrested last month on accusation that she helped a man evade immigration authorities. If officials stay in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face charges, Trump said.Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.There was some confusion surrounding the exact timing of the guard's arrival. Shortly before midnight local time, Trump congratulated the National Guard on a job well done. But less than an hour later, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said troops had yet to arrive in the city.Defence secretary threatens to deploy active-duty Marines if violence continues In a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California's politicians and protesters of defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans' safety. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer, McLaughlin added.The troops included members of the California Army National Guard's 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense.In a signal of the administration's aggressive approach, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines if violence continues in the region.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism and usurping the powers of the United States Congress. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, said the immigration arrests and Guard deployment were designed as part of a cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division. She said she supports those standing up to protect our most fundamental rights and freedoms. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president's move, doubling down on Republicans' criticisms of California Democrats. Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in, Johnson said.","summary":"In Los Angeles, officers used tear gas on demonstrators protesting President Trump's National Guard deployment.

China has the President right where it wants him - for one devastating reason: DOMINIC LAWSON","text":"Ladies and gentlemen, Britain is back on the world stage.’ This, preposterously, was how Sir Keir Starmer addressed European leaders at an event in London to mark his dismal deal with Brussels last month.\n\nBut today our capital really will be the stage on which global attention is focused: representatives of the governments of China and the US – including Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent – have flown in for negotiations designed to defuse the trade war between the world’s two mightiest economic powers.\n\nThis was started on prime time TV by Trump on April 2 (‘Liberation Day’) when he announced punitive tariffs on imports from China (and indeed about 180 other countries).\n\nLater, he warned: ‘Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded.’\n\nBut Beijing did indeed retaliate, and Trump, after escalating, backed down, to the extent of reducing tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 per cent to 30 per cent, pending negotiations on some sort of final deal. Which is what the meeting in London is designed to sort out.\n\nThis is the result of a 90-minute conversation between China’s President Xi Jinping and Trump last week, which the US President described on his Truth Social platform as ‘a very good phone call’ that ‘resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries’.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry’s account was less ingratiating, pointing out that the call was initiated at Trump’s request.\n\nThese matters are always opaque, so I turned to a vastly experienced ex-Foreign Office hand – John Gerson – who served in Beijing for many years and acted as an adviser and interpreter for Margaret Thatcher during her visits to China. His analysis of the portents of this meeting in London was devastating, at least from the West’s point of view.\n\n‘The US has allowed itself to be the supplicant right from the word go. There would not have been a telephone conversation unless Xi had first been given guarantees that he was going to get more or less what he needed.\n\n‘And this is a step on the way to establishing a geopolitical environment in which Xi can pursue his aims, while the bull Trump goes charging about at a host of imaginary red-flag-waving matadors elsewhere.’\n\nThe most widely cited cause for Trump’s de-escalation of his onslaught on China was the fright taken by international bond markets: if the cost to the US of funding its colossal public debt soars, then economic meltdown comes to America, not China.\n\nBut there is a second reason for Trump’s more conciliatory tone, lying in the physical world rather than that of computer screen transactions. The most deadly part of China’s response was the weaponising of its dominance of the global supply of rare earth metals which are, among other applications, crucial to the tiny yet intensely powerful magnets in the manufacture of modern motor cars – and not just electric vehicles.\n\nAs one expert on this matter explains: ‘They are not only essential for many kinds of electric motors used in the manufacture of EVs, drones, robots, missiles and gasoline-powered cars.\n\n‘These metals are also required for the manufacture of jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs and capacitators which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.’ Important doesn’t begin to encompass it.\n\nAnyway, Beijing’s retaliation was not just to whack up its own tariffs on US goods to 125 per cent: it blocked the export of such magnets containing the rare earth elements.\n\nA month later, a group of the biggest vehicle manufacturers in the US wrote to Trump to say they would soon have to cut back production and even close plants – unless the Chinese began to resupply the vital materials.\n\nFar from Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ achieving its declared purpose of getting more manufacturing of products purchased by Americans back to the US, and thus providing ‘manly’ jobs for what he would see as his core voters, it threatened to have the opposite effect: closing down American factories.\n\nOn the very day that letter from General Motors (among others) was received in the White House, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was prepared to play nice with China and slashed the tariff rate.\n\nIn turn, the Chinese said they would rescind the rare earth export ban: but there still appears to be some sort of go-slow in terms of government approving individual shipments. While, last week, according to the Financial Times, ‘Beijing has agreed to fast-track approvals for rare earth shipments for some European companies’. China is, obviously, attempting a divide-and-rule policy in respect of the EU and the US.\n\nThis, too, is something Trump has foolishly facilitated. As I wrote in the Mail two months ago: ‘If Trump were strategic in his desire to isolate China, he would not simultaneously pick a fight with the EU.\n\n‘When Ursula von der Leyen came in as president of the European Commission, she stated her intention to reduce the risks of dependence on China. But the effect of Trump’s imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on cars and steel from the EU’ – since raised to 50 per cent – ‘is to weaken the hand of European leaders who favour such a realignment.’\n\nIt hardly helped that Trump’s understandable desire to source rare metals from outside China had led him to threaten annexation of Greenland, the territory of an EU nation: Denmark.\n\nAs things stand, the International Energy Agency suggests that evenby 2035, China will still be responsible for 85 per cent of the production of refined rare earth elements.\n\nThe American military historian Phillips O’Brien wrote two months ago: ‘One would have thought that the USA would have, in preparation for Trump’s tariff wars, at least taken the basic precautionary step of stockpiling such metals – or exploring alternative sources – but that seems not to have been the case. If so, it has been a catastrophic oversight.’\n\nIn fact, the military aspect of China’s dominance of rare metals has been displayed with extraordinary impact in Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nThe drones that Moscow has used to terrorise the Ukrainian population – even with a disgusting ‘human safari’ against civilians in Kherson – rely hugely on Chinese supplies of rare earth magnets, at the heart of the electric motors and lithium-ion batteries powering them.\n\nAccording to the Royal United Services Institute, such drones have also accounted for around 70 per cent of the destruction that Ukraine has managed to wreak on Russian equipment.\n\nThis was seen most spectacularly a week ago when, in a brilliantly conceived and executed operation, Kyiv managed to smuggle drones thousands of miles into Russian territory, there to be unleashed on Putin’s air bases, knocking out an estimated 15 per cent of the fleet used to bombard Ukrainian cities.\n\nWhile the Chinese have denied supplying these essential materials for Russia’s drones, this is believed by no one.\n\nAnd when it is was reported last week that the electric motors and lithium-ion batteries used in Ukraine’s drone attack on Russian airfields were ‘sourced online’, that almost certainly can only mean ‘in China’.\n\nSo when it is asked, who is winning the war, Russia or Ukraine, the answer is: China.\n\nThe same goes for the trade war that Donald Trump started.","summary":"London will today be centre of attention, as representatives have flown in for negotiations to defuse the trade war between the world's two mightiest economic powers.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14791895/Trump-bravado-tariffs-China-President-devastating-DOMINIC-LAWSON.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/08/17/99156859-0-image-m-9_1749400047252.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-09 00:39:08","author":"Dominic Lawson,Editor","authors":["Dominic Lawson","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.106},{"id":329426394,"title":"World News | Ukraine Doing Everything to Ensure June Summits Are Not Hollow: Zelenskyy","text":"Kyiv [Ukraine], June 9 (ANI): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that \"language of force\" against Russia must become the working one across all formats of international engagement in the coming months, referring to the upcoming G7 Summit (from June 15 to 17) in Canada and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands running from June 24-26.\nhttps://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1931777356987064389\nAlso Read | Earthquake in Colombia: Quake of Magnitude 6.7 on Richter Scale Hits South American Country, No Casualties Reported.\n\"In the coming weeks, important meetings and negotiations will take place in Ukraine, and we are doing everything to ensure that the June summits--the G7 Summit in Canada and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands--are not hollow,\" he said.\n\"Russia only truly understands one language -- the language of force.

Trump announced on social media the next day that trade talks would be held on Monday in London.\n\nTechnology is a major sticking point\n\nThe latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to “pause” tariffs for 90 days.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That’s because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.\n\nThe Chinese government wasn’t pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.\n\n“The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn’t in Geneva but will join the talks in London. Analysts say that suggests at least a willingness on the U.S. side to hear out China’s concerns on export controls.\n\nChina shows signs of easing up on rare earths\n\nOne area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.\n\nThe Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.\n\nTrump, without mentioning rare earths specifically, took to social media to attack China.\n\n“The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,” Trump posted on May 30.\n\nThe Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and “will continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.”\n\nThe scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.\n\nPlan to revoke student visas adds to tensions\n\nStudent visas don’t normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.\n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry raised the issue when asked last week about the accusation that it had violated the consensus reached in Geneva.\n\nIt replied that the U.S. had undermined the agreement by issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and saying it would revoke Chinese student visas.\n\n“The United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a May 28 statement that the United States would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”\n\nMore than 270,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. in the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nKEN MORITSUGU, BEIJING ,MDT/AP","summary":"U.S.-China trade talks in London this week are expected to take up a series of fresh disputes that have buffeted relations, threatening a fragile truce over tariffs.

Kurla Mother Dairy houses hundred-year-old trees, locals are demanding a botanical garden to protect them, yet it is transferred to Adani for infrastructure purposes at a nominal rate,” she added.\n\nDays ago, the Maharashtra Cabinet’s decision to transfer an 8.05-hectare Mother Dairy land parcel to the DRPPL triggered opposition from locals and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders. Kurla Dairy is among the three dairies of Mumbai, where milk production stopped over the years, and the land was made available for other projects.\n\nMany Congress leaders and party functionaries, including MLA Jyoti Gaikwad, Congress spokesperson Suresh Chandra Rajhans, and Mumbai General Secretary Mahendra Mungekar, along with their supporters and activists, staged the peaceful protest in Kurla.\n\nMs. Gaikwad said, “While we were peacefully protesting, once again the Modani (Modi and Adani) government had sent a large police force to suppress the voice of the people. What justice is it that the police stopped the peaceful protest with the force of police force? The government is providing security to thieves, but we will not be swayed by this oppression. We will continue to fight against this Adani government for the rights of Mumbai.”\n\nShe called the transfer of land a part of a “conspiracy” wherein the plan is to destroy the lives of lakhs of Dharavikars and acquire 600 acres of land in Dharavi, along with Kurla Mother Dairy, saltpans, and Deonar dumping ground land.

'Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will any more, I was surprised,' Trump told reporters.\n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry - not over the bill ballooning the deficit - but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla, and replaced the Musk-approved nominee to lead NASA, which could hinder SpaceX's government contracts.\n\n'And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,' Trump said. 'I know that disturbed him.'\n\nMusk posted to X as Trump's Q&A with reporters was ongoing. 'Whatever,' the billionaire wrote.\n\n'Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,' he advised.\n\n'In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!' Musk continued.\n\n'Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.'\n\nThe spat quickly turned personal with Musk then posting that Trump would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world's richest man - him.\n\nMusk publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured around $290 million into the Republican's campaign. \n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day.\n\nAfter his meeting with Merz, Trump continued to throw punches online. He asserted that he had asked Musk to leave his administration and said he was 'CRAZY!'\n\n'Elon was \"wearing thin,\" I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!' Trump wrote.\n\nIt was after that post that he then threatened to pull SpaceX and Tesla's government contracts.\n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. 'This just gets better and better,' he wrote. 'Go ahead, make my day …'\n\nIn a follow-up post, Musk said he would 'begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.'\n\nTrump continued his 'crazy' remarks on Friday when speaking with CNN Anchor and Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash. \n\nHe said: 'I'm not even thinking about Elon. He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.'\n\nThe tech billionaire also claimed Trump appeared in files relating to disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in a post on his social media platform X as the pair traded blows in a sensational public row. \n\nMusk gave no evidence for the claim, which has since been deleted, and the White House dismissed the allegation. \n\nOn Sunday, Trump said his relationship with Musk was over and rejected the idea of repairing their relationship.","summary":"Musk and Trump's fallout has already led to an ally of the Tesla CEO losing his nomination to run NASA which has remaining DOGE employees sweating.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14792401/DOGE-nerds-reveal-biggest-fear-Musk-Trumps-spectacular-falling-out.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/08/23/99161661-0-image-m-9_1749422480922.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/06/5857904361905016685/1024x576_MP4_5857904361905016685.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-09 00:31:48","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Now, only four of the 10 most recently retired grand champions are still in the JSA.\n\"It's a significant loss of high-level experience and one that hurts sumo's efforts to both find and keep young talent in the sport,\" said The Japan Times. And the resignation of Hakuho – the most decorated wrestler in sumo history \"by a significant margin\", as well as a \"major recruiter of talent\" – is the \"biggest blow of all\".\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

It is widely considered Japan's national sport, with many \"ritual elements\" connected to the indigenous religion, Shinto. Sumo is \"highly regimented\"; many wrestlers live in training facilities where \"food and dress are controlled by ancient traditions\".\n\nSumo \"prides itself on being a repository of the samurai values of courage, determination and loyalty\", said The Times. But that image has been \"sullied\" in recent years. The sport has been \"plagued\" by scandals involving \"violence, match-fixing and mismanagement\". Japan's dramatically falling birth rate has also \"hurt sumo\". According to government data released this week, Japan's birth rate dropped by 5.7% between 2023 and 2024. Last spring only 34 people applied to become wrestlers – known as rikishi – down from 160 at the peak in 1992. To \"lure young recruits\", the governing body relaxed the minimum standards for height and weight.\nOne wrestler's ascendance is seen as a \"chance to increase the sport's popularity\", and distance it from its controversies. Sumo may have its \"smiling 30-stone champion\": Onosato.\nOnosato was promoted to the rank of yokozuna last month, \"completing a meteoric rise to the summit\" of sumo in a record span of just 13 tournaments, said The Guardian. Born Daiki Nakamura, he is the 75th yokozuna in sumo's history, and at age 24 the youngest since 1994. He's also the first Japanese-born sumo wrestler since 2017; in recent years Mongolian-born athletes like Hakuho have \"dominated\". His rise has been \"widely hailed both for its symbolic significance and his calm, composed style\".\n\"I hope he leads by example and lifts the entire world of sumo,\" said Nishonoseki, Onosato's stablemaster, who competed as Kisenosato.\nA few big buts\nBut wrestlers who exert \"total dominance\" inside the ring often struggle with the strict rules and conventions of sumo, said The Japan Times. They are regularly \"chastised\".\nStill, official censure or \"condemnation by the media\" is \"easier to handle when you are top of the world and raking in trophies and prize money\". But \"it's a completely different situation when the limelight and all the perks are suddenly gone\".\nFor wrestlers such as Hakuho, sumo is all they know. There are \"few, if any, opportunities to develop the kind of skills and mechanisms needed to cope with the emotional turmoil that comes from such a sudden shift\".\nWhat makes the adjustment even harder is the \"rigid nature of life\" after retirement from sumo. For those who choose to remain with the JSA as coaches or stablemasters, there is \"still little freedom in how they choose to live their lives day to day\".\nNow, after Hakuho's resignation, the future of his namesake event is unclear. The Hakuho Cup is \"arguably the most important sumo tournament in the world\" for children and adolescents.\nFor Onosato, like numerous current wrestlers, the cup was a \"major milestone and motivator\". It provides \"invaluable experience for children from numerous countries\", and was a link between amateur and professional sumo.\nThe JSA will \"continue to survive and thrive\", but it's hard to argue that \"sumo hasn't been lessened without its most decorated champion\". For the sake of its future, sumo should \"figure out a way to stem the tide of such high-profile departures\".\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHarriet Marsden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nHarriet Marsden is a writer for The Week, mostly covering UK and global news and politics.

Sam Liccardo, D-Palo Alto, gathered local leaders and immigrants’ rights activists outside Palo Alto City Hall on Sunday to denounce what he described as a “reckless misuse” of the military.\n\nTensions between California officials and the Trump administration are reaching a boiling point because of the federal government’s recent immigration enforcement actions. Border czar Tom Homan has threatened to arrest California officials who disrupt Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions.\n\nPeninsula leaders are calling for protesters to remain nonviolent or risk a federal crackdown.\n\n“This administration will look for any excuse to cease control from civilian authorities, and ultimately, to invoke the Insurrection Act and impose martial law,” Liccardo said. “For that, and many other reasons, we encourage all protesters: Do not take the bait.”\n\nPro-immigrant demonstrators rallied outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles following two days of clashes between protesters and federal immigration agents. Emotions had run high in the city leading up to the weekend after a series of ICE immigration enforcement operations led to more than 100 arrests.\n\nFederal agents who set up a staging area near a Home Depot in the heavily-Latino neighborhood of Paramount in Southern California on Saturday were met by demonstrators, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement at Border Patrol vehicles. Immigration agents shot tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls at the crowd of protesters during the conflict.\n\n“This is psychological warfare on the immigrant community,” Ayudando Latinos A Soñar Executive Director Belinda Arriaga said. “People say it’s not happening here yet. But in our minds and in our homes, this is happening every day, every minute that they step out and are scared of what can happen to them.”\n\nTo quell the hostility, Trump invoked a legal provision on Saturday allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”\n\nAround 300 members of the National Guard arrived in Los Angeles early Sunday, part of the first cohort of the 2,000 Trump has ordered to be deployed. The order shocked local officials because the move was done without the request of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deployment marks the first time since the Civil Rights movement that a president has deployed the National Guard without the consent of the state’s governor. President Lyndon B. Johnson used the National Guard in 1965 in Alabama to protect marchers led by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nTrump told reporters that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles and “they’re not gonna get away with it,” as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, on Sunday.\n\n“We’re gonna have troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country. We’re not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden,” Trump said.\n\nTrump said California officials who stand in the way of immigration authorities could face charges, adding to a barrage of escalating threats by Trump administration officials against California leaders.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who is the assistant for public affairs, accused California’s politicians and protesters of “defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans’ safety.”\n\n“Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,” McLaughlin added.\n\nRep. Kevin Mullin, D-San Mateo, warned of the implications of using the military on American citizens. He described the decision in bleak terms.\n\n“These are not American values. They’re the first steps in the authoritarian playbook,” Mullin said. “Donald Trump, Stephen Miller and Pete Hegseth would love nothing more than to see violence break out on our streets, which would give them the excuse they desperately want to send the United States military into American cities.”\n\nSome Bay Area leaders outside the Palo Alto City Hall were cynical about the timing of the conflict, as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans attempted to pass a controversial budget bill. Recent events in Los Angeles, San Mateo County Supervisor Ray Mueller said, were a “distraction” from the president’s legislative goals.\n\n“The president has decided to stage a dangerous sideshow for TV cameras,” Mueller said. “(The administration’s) trying to pass a budget bill that is so bad, even Elon Musk publicly engaged in a verbal war with the president this week.”\n\nFor a presidential administration that has pushed the limits of law, with numerous cases being heard before the Supreme Court this year alone, Liccardo said use of the military to enter Los Angeles was an “unprecedented” violation of the president’s authority.\n\n“What I’m really concerned about is the presidential decision to say we’re going to push aside local law enforcement,” Liccardo said. “The insertion of national guardsmen, and, as (Sec. of Defense) Pete Hegseth suggested, other branches of the military into our cities — that is unprecedented and unwarranted.”\n\nThe Associated Press and other news services contributed to this story.","summary":"San Mateo and Santa Clara County representatives met in Palo Alto to denounce the Trump administration’s deployment of the National Guard in

The clashes came on the third day of demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 federal troops spurred anger and fear among some residents. Also Read | Earthquake in Colombia: Quake of Magnitude 6.7 on Richter Scale Hits South American Country, No Casualties Reported. By midday, hundreds had gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Centre in downtown Los Angeles, where people were detained after earlier immigration raids. Protesters directed chants of \"shame\" and \"go home\" at members of the National Guard, who stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields. After some protesters closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street. Also Read | US President Donald Trump Vows To 'Crush Rioters' in Los Angeles, Says Governor and Mayor Can't Do Their Jobs. Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway. The presence of the Guard was \"inflaming tensions\" in the city, according to a letter sent to Trump by Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday afternoon. He formerly requested Trump remove the guard members, which he called a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" Trump has said the National Guard was necessary because Newsom and other Democrats have failed to stanch recent protests targeting immigration agents. Their deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts. Deployment follows days of protest The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighbouring Compton. As federal agents set up a staging area on Saturday near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls. Tensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed above 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement. The recent protests remain far smaller than past events that have brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops. The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Trump says there will be very strong law and order In a directive on Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is \"a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\" He said he had authorised the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard. Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were \"violent people\" in Los Angeles \"and they're not gonna get away with it.\" Asked if he planned to send US troops to Los Angeles, Trump replied, \"We're gonna have troops everywhere. We're not going to let this happen to our country. We're not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden.\" He did not elaborate. Trump also said that California officials who stand in the way of the deportations could face charges. A Wisconsin judge was arrested last month on accusation that she helped a man evade immigration authorities. \"If officials stay in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face charges,\" Trump said. Newsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor's office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday. There was some confusion surrounding the exact timing of the guard's arrival. Shortly before midnight local time, Trump congratulated the National Guard on a \"job well done.\" But less than an hour later, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said troops had yet to arrive in the city. Defence secretary threatens to deploy active-duty Marines if violence continues In a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California's politicians and protesters of \"defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans' safety.\" \"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,\" McLaughlin added. The troops included members of the California Army National Guard's 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense. In a signal of the administration's aggressive approach, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines \"if violence continues\" in the region. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected \"a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism\" and \"usurping the powers of the United States Congress.\" Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, said the immigration arrests and Guard deployment were designed as part of a \"cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.\" She said she supports those \"standing up to protect our most fundamental rights and freedoms.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president's move, doubling down on Republicans' criticisms of California Democrats. \"Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,\" Johnson said.

Protesters directed chants of “shame” and “go home” at members of the National Guard, who stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields.\n\nAfter some protesters closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.\n\nMinutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway.\n\nThe presence of the Guard was “inflaming tensions\" in the city, according to a letter sent to Trump by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday afternoon. He formerly requested Trump remove the guard members, which he called a “serious breach of state sovereignty.”\n\nTrump has said the National Guard was necessary because Newsom and other Democrats have failed to stanch recent protests targeting immigration agents.\n\nTheir deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nUPDATE: 1:55 p.m\n\nMembers of the National Guard faced off with protesters in Los Angeles on Sunday, and tear gas was fired at a growing crowd that gathered outside a federal complex hours after the federal troops arrived in the city on President Donald Trump's orders.\n\nThe confrontation broke out in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, as a group of demonstrators shouted insults at members of the guard lined shoulder to shoulder behind plastic riot shields.\n\nThere did not appear to be any arrests.\n\nAround members 300 National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles early Sunday following clashes in recent days between protesters and federal immigration agents.\n\nThe deployment followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.\n\nAs federal agents set up a staging area Saturday near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.\n\nTensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed above 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe deployment of the National Guard came over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of a “complete overreaction” designed to create a spectacle of force.\n\nThe recent protests have drawn hundreds of participants but remain far smaller than other mass demonstrations, including the 2020 protests against police violence that spurred Newsom to request assistance from the National Guard.\n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nTrump has framed the move as a necessary response to Newsom's and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass's failure to swiftly contain the unrest.\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”\n\nHe said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.\n\nNewsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor’s office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.\n\nThere was some confusion surrounding the exact timing of the guard's arrival. Shortly before midnight local time, Trump congratulated the National Guard on a “job well done.\" But less than an hour later, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said troops had yet to arrive in the city.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California's politicians and protesters of “defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans' safety.”\n\n\"Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,\" McLaughlin added.\n\nThe troops included members of the California Army National Guard's 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense.\n\nIn a signal of the administration’s aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region.\n\nVermont Sen.

Gavin Newsom.\n\nConfrontations broke out on Saturday near a Home Depot in the heavily Latino city of Paramount, south of Los Angeles, where federal agents were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office nearby. Agents unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls, and protesters hurled rocks and cement at Border Patrol vehicles. Smoke wafted from small piles of burning refuse in the streets.\n\nTensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, including in LA’s fashion district and at a Home Depot, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed past 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe White House announced that Trump would deploy the Guard to “address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.”\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, said in a post on the social platform X that it was “purposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.” He later said the federal government wants a spectacle and urged people not to give them one by becoming violent.\n\nIn a signal of the administration’s aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened to deploy the U.S. military.\n\n“If violence continues, active-duty Marines at Camp Pendleton will also be mobilized — they are on high alert,” Hegseth said on X.\n\nTrump’s order came after clashes in Paramount and neighboring Compton, where a car was set on fire. Protests continued into the evening in Paramount, with several hundred demonstrators gathered near a doughnut shop, and authorities holding up barbed wire to keep the crowd back.\n\nCrowds also gathered again outside federal buildings in downtown Los Angeles, including a detention center, where local police declared an unlawful assembly and began to arrest people.\n\nORIGINAL: 6:25 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom after a second day of clashes between hundreds of protesters and federal immigration authorities in riot gear.\n\nConfrontations broke out on Saturday near a Home Depot in the heavily Latino city of Paramount, south of Los Angeles, where federal agents were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office nearby. Agents unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls, and protesters hurled rocks and cement at Border Patrol vehicles.

They set off fireworks and pulled shopping carts into the street, broke up cinder blocks and pelted a procession of Border Patrol vans as they departed and careened down a boulevard.\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said federal agents made more arrests of people with deportation orders on Saturday, but none at the Home Depot. The Department of Homeland Security has a building next door and agents were staging there as they prepared to carry out operations, he said on Fox11 Los Angeles. He didn't say how many people were arrested Saturday or where.\n\nParamount Mayor Peggy Lemons told multiple news outlets that community members showed up in response because people are fearful about activity by immigration agents.\n\n“When you handle things the way that this appears to be handled, it’s not a surprise that chaos would follow,” Lemons said.\n\nSome demonstrators jeered at officers while recording the events on smartphones.\n\n“ICE out of Paramount. We see you for what you are,” a woman said through a megaphone. “You are not welcome here.”\n\nMore than a dozen people were arrested and accused of impeding immigration agents, Essayli posted on X, including the names and mug shots of some of those arrested. He didn't say where they were protesting.\n\nTrump calls up the Guard\n\nTrump federalized part of California's National Guard under what is known as Title 10 authority, which places him, not the governor, atop the chain of command, according to Newsom's office.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the work the immigration authorities were doing when met with protests is “essential to halting and reversing the invasion of illegal criminals into the United States. In the wake of this violence, California’s feckless Democrat leaders have completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens.”\n\nThe president’s move came shortly after he issued a threat on his social media network saying that if Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass did not “do their jobs,” then “the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!”\n\nTrump signed the order shortly before he went to attend a UFC fight in New Jersey, where he sat ringside with boxer Mike Tyson.\n\nNewsom said in his statement that local authorities “are able to access law enforcement assistance at a moment’s notice,” and “there is currently no unmet need.”\n\nThe California Highway Patrol said Newsom directed it to deploy additional officers to “maintain public safety.”\n\nSpeaking on ABC7, Bass said that “we certainly want to make the opportunities available for people to exercise their First Amendment rights, but the minute that things turn to violence ... that is not acceptable and people are going to be held accountable.”\n\nShe said she had spoken with members of the Trump administration and insisted that she and Newsom were in control and there was no need for the National Guard to be deployed.\n\nIn 2020, Trump asked governors of several states to deploy their National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to quell protests after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police. Many agreed and sent troops.\n\nTrump also threatened at the time to invoke the Insurrection Act for those protests — an intervention rarely seen in modern American history. But then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper pushed back, saying the law should be invoked “only in the most urgent and dire of situations.”\n\nTrump did not invoke the act during his first term, and he did not do so Saturday, according to Leavitt and Newsom.\n\nArrests in Los Angeles\n\nProtests kicked off a day earlier in Los Angeles after federal authorities arrested 44 people for violating immigration law Friday.\n\nDHS later said recent ICE operations in Los Angeles resulted in the arrest of 118 immigrants, including five people linked to criminal organizations and people with prior criminal histories.\n\nDavid Huerta, regional president of the Service Employees International Union, was also arrested Friday while protesting. The Justice Department confirmed that he was being held Saturday at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles ahead of a scheduled Monday court appearance.\n\nDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for his immediate release, warning of a “disturbing pattern of arresting and detaining American citizens for exercising their right to free speech.”","summary":"UPDATE 5:00 p.m. \n\nLaw enforcement officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters in Los Angeles on Sunday as they gathered downtown in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard over the objections of the governor and mayor.\n\nThe clashes came o...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/555032/Protests-intensify-in-Los-Angeles-after-Trump-deploys-hundreds-of-National-Guard-troops","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/6/cbed06b077c91e3caf3ad76e8b944b7d572ff48d7241402ddef02b5d3ef9eba4_p4211728_p4211975.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:59:00","author":"Michelle L.

The move came despite Gov. Gavin Newsom objecting to the activation of the National Guard.\n\n“President Trump’s move to deploy California’s National Guard is an alarming abuse of power,” the Democratic governors said in a joint statement.\n\n“Governors are the commanders in chief of their National Guard, and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state’s governor is ineffective and dangerous,” the statement continued.\n\n“It’s important we respect the executive authority of our country’s governors to manage their National Guards — and we stand with Gov. Newsom who has made it clear that violence is unacceptable and that local authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.”\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom on Sunday formally requested that the Trump administration return the command of the National Guard back to him.\n\n“At present, law enforcement authorities from the city and county of Los Angeles are safeguarding public safety, and, as demonstrated by the robust law enforcement response yesterday evening to protect federal facilities, local law enforcement resources are sufficient to maintain order,” David Sapp, the legal affairs secretary to Newsom, said in the letter addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, state and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property,” Sapp said. “Indeed, the decision to deploy the National Guard without appropriate training or orders risks seriously escalating the situation.”\n\nTrump, however, has said he needed to federalize California’s National Guard to “address the lawlessness” in California.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social account Sunday afternoon, Trump alleged that “violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming and attacking our federal agents to try and stop our deportation operations.”\n\n“But these lawless riots only strengthen our resolve,” Trump’s post said.","summary":"Protests continue in LA, and Trump has said he had to federalize California's National Guard to \"address the lawlessness.\"","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/08/as-president-trump-deploys-national-guard-in-california-every-democratic-governor-expresses-concern/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LDN-L-FIRE-TRUMP-VISIT-0125-14.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:52:09","author":"Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":329421372,"title":"Trump orders federal agencies to ‘liberate Los Angeles’ (VIDEOS)","text":"President Donald Trump has directed top federal officials to take “all such action necessary” to end days of violent unrest in Los Angeles, ordering the deployment of National Guard troops and vowing to “liberate” the city from what he described as an “invasion” by criminal migrants.\n\n“A once great American City, Los Angeles, has been invaded and occupied by Illegal Aliens and Criminals,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Sunday. “Order will be restored, the Illegals will be expelled, and Los Angeles will be set free.”\n\nThe president said he instructed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with federal agencies to quell the unrest.\n\nTrump's comments follow two days of clashes between protesters and federal immigration agents, prompting Trump to authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops.\n\nTensions peaked Sunday afternoon as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Video footage showed National Guard troops facing off with protesters behind riot shields. At one point tear gas was fired, but authorities have not confirmed which agency used force or what triggered the escalation.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom condemned the federal “takeover” of California’s National Guard as unconstitutional and politically motivated, formally demanding that President Trump withdraw the order and return control of the troops to the state.\n\n“We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,” he claimed in a on X. “This is a serious breach of state sovereignty – inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed.”\n\nThe unrest began Friday and intensified Saturday in the cities of Paramount and Compton, following multiple immigration raids in which over 100 people were arrested. Demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, and some threw rocks and debris at officers. Federal agents responded with tear gas, pepper balls and flash-bang grenades.\n\nHomeland Security officials accused local politicians of failing to uphold public safety. “Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.\n\nCritics say Trump’s move bypasses constitutional norms. Senator Bernie Sanders described the deployment as “a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, by contrast, defended the order, blaming California’s Democratic leadership for the disorder.\n\nWhile previous National Guard deployments in Los Angeles were initiated by state officials, this marks the first federal override since the 1960s civil rights era. It remains unclear how long the troops will remain in the city. Defense Secretary Hegseth warned that active-duty Marines could be deployed next if the violence continues.","summary":"President Donald Trump has directed top federal officials to take “all such action necessary” to end days of violent unrest in California \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/618821-trump-liberate-california-national-guard/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.06/article/684621c985f54025da283107.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:50:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":329424392,"title":"LA protest LIVE: Trump deploys National Guard troops in Los Angeles (Video)","text":"International\n\nSouth Cinema\n\nSocial News XYZ Reviews\n\nMovie Schedules\n\nMovies News\n\nLive Events\n\nMotorsports\n\nOther Sports\n\nScience/Tech\n\nBusiness Wire India\n\nEnvironment\n\nHome » Videos » LA protest LIVE: Trump deploys National Guard troops in Los Angeles (Video) \n\nLA protest LIVE: Trump deploys National Guard troops in Los Angeles (Video)\n\nPosted By: Social News XYZ\nJune 8, 2025\n\nLive from Los Angeles as President Donald Trump says hes deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to respond to immigration protests.\n\n#losangeles #nationalguard #trump\n\nFacebook Comments\n\nAbout SocialNewsXYZ\nAn Indo-American News website.It covers Gossips, Politics, Movies, Technolgy, and Sports News and Photo Galleries and Live Coverage of Events via Youtube.\nThe website is established in 2015 and is owned by AGK FIRE INC.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nLA protest LIVE: Trump deploys National Guard troops in Los Angeles (Video)\nDescription\n\nLive from Los Angeles as President Donald Trump says hes deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to respond to immigration protests.\n#losangeles #nationalguard #trump\n\nPrevious post\n\nFollow Us \n\nPune Hosts 13th Annual Pride March #Gallery\n\nRekha Gupta Attends a Public Meeting in New Delhi #Gallery\n\nStudents Protest against Tree Cutting for Flyover in Guwahati #Gallery\n\nHiren Gohain Speaks Out Against Tree Cutting in Guwahati #Gallery\n\nManipur: Security Tightened after overnight violence #Gallery\n\nA fire breaks out at a Paint Factory in Amritsar #Gallery\n\nManipur MLAs meet Governor Ajay Bhalla over recent violence #Gallery\n\nAmit Shah Addresses BJP Tamil Nadu Office Bearers in Madurai #Gallery\n\nOdisha Youth Congress Protests Against Sambit Patra #Gallery\n\nKathua: J&K LG Manoj Sinha Inaugurates Waterfront Development #Gallery\n\nTop Stories\n\nVote for ‘Viksit Bharat, Viksit Ludhiana’, says Union Minister Bittu; slams CM Mann\n\nStrengthening frontier villages: Army chief Gen Dwivedi inaugurates community radio Ibex Tarana\n\nGovt took stampede incident seriously, Oppn making politically motivated allegations: K’taka CM\n\nSand artist Sudarsan Pattnaik congratulates PM Modi for completing 11 years in office\n\nWorld’s largest container ship MSC IRINA to make historic debut at Vizhinjam Seaport\n\nMaharashtra, Karnataka lead India’s record FDI growth in FY25\n\nTN: HM Amit Shah says BJP-AIADMK alliance will form govt in 2026\n\nPakistani army acts as custodian of ideologies, religion: Former diplomat DP Srivastava (IANS Interview)\n\nSri Sri Ravi Shankar praises Modi govt, terms J&K’s rail connectivity a joyous moment\n\nTN: HM Amit Shah slams DMK over corruption, reviews BJP’s poll preparedness\n\nArchives Archives\n\nCopyright 2025 | AGK FIRE INC|\nTerms of Service / Privacy Policy | Contact Us","summary":"Live from Los Angeles as President Donald Trump says hes deploying 2,000 California National Guard troops to respond to immigration protests. #losangeles #nationalguard #trump\n\n\nThe post LA protest LIVE: Trump deploys National Guard troops in Los Angeles (Video) appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/06/08/la-protest-live-trump-deploys-national-guard-troops-in-los-angeles-video/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/09/maxresdefault_live.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1749428223","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:47:03","author":"Social News XYZ","authors":["Social News XYZ"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.06},{"id":329426568,"title":"Zelensky fears image disaster if bodies of dead soldiers returned to Ukraine — analyst","text":"MOSCOW, June 9. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky’s refusal to accept the bodies of 6,000 dead Ukrainian servicemen stems from his fear of political and reputational fallout, military analyst and editor-in-chief of National Defense magazine Igor Korotchenko told TASS.\n\n\"The total number [of bodies] is 6,000. However, we see that Kiev is criminally neglecting its obligation to receive the fallen Ukrainian soldiers and is deliberately stalling the process. Clearly, Zelensky fears that accepting the remains would trigger a political and image disaster,\" the expert said.\n\nAccording to Korotchenko, Zelensky’s hesitation may be linked to concerns that a single-stage transfer of such a large number of bodies would confirm the extent of the Ukrainian army’s losses in the special military operation zone. \"From the perspective of the internal political landscape in Kiev, this could have disastrous consequences,\" he noted.\n\nKorotchenko argued that Zelensky is under increasing time pressure. \"He does not want to accept the bodies of his dead soldiers, especially now that international media have begun covering the situation. In this context, Zelensky risks being portrayed as an international terrorist - one who disregards international conventions, refuses to bury his fallen troops, and avoids making the necessary compensation payments to their families,\" he said.\n\nGiven the current media attention, Korotchenko emphasized the importance of engaging human rights advocates, humanitarian organizations, and international institutions capable of addressing the issue at a global level.\n\n\"We hope that the 47th US president, Donald Trump, will not remain silent or overlook this outrageous situation, but will urge the Kiev regime to carry out its final duty toward the Ukrainian soldiers who died as a result of Zelensky’s decisions. We also expect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, and other respected international and public figures to speak out on this issue, compelling Zelensky to cease the appalling behavior he is currently displaying,\" Korotchenko concluded.\n\nOn Sunday, Lieutenant-General Alexander Zorin, a representative of the Russian negotiating group, announced that trains carrying the bodies of Ukrainian servicemen would soon begin moving toward the border to fulfill Moscow’s commitment to \"return more than 6,000 bodies of the dead.\" He added that the humanitarian handover operation could take place next week, and Russia was awaiting an official notification from Kiev on the matter.","summary":"According to military analyst and editor-in-chief of National Defense magazine Igor Korotchenko, Zelensky’s hesitation may be linked to concerns that a single-stage transfer of such a large number of bodies would confirm the extent of the Ukrainian army’s losses","url":"https://tass.com/defense/1970533","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:45:26","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":329422942,"title":"Democratic governors sign joint letter condemning Trump’s ‘abuse of power’ in LA","text":"“President Trump’s move to deploy California’s National Guard is an alarming abuse of power,” the letter said. “Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state’s governor is ineffective and dangerous.”\n\nEvery single Democratic Governor agrees:Donald Trump’s attempts to militarize California are an alarming abuse of power. pic.twitter.com/gmHuZpxWdc— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) June 8, 2025\n\nThe letter also said Newsom has “made it clear” that violence is “unacceptable” in response to the riots, and that local law enforcement should be allowed to fulfill its duties without “federal interference and intimidation.”\n\nGov.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHRISTINE RENDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:16 BST, 8 June 2025 |Updated:00:41 BST, 9 June 2025 \n\nDemi Moore has three new furry family members - adorable orphaned ducklings.\nThe actress, 62, has rescued baby mallards and is now caring for them with the assistance of her local veterinarian until they are ready to return to the wild.\n'Duck, duck... Pilaf!' Demi announced to her followers as she introduced her feathered friends last week. 'We rescued three orphaned baby mallard ducklings! With the help and guidance of my local vet we are working to nurture them until they are old enough to be reintroduced to their natural habitat. It has been a messy joy, but Pilaf is loving her new friends.'\nThe post included an array of photos of the tiny siblings with Demi, including two of the babies hanging out with her ever-present dog Pilaf.\nThe three ducklings have clearly bonded with Demi, as they were even seen lining up and dutifully following her about.\nWhile the majority of the comments were positive, a few were critical of Demi's decision to take in the animals, insisting they should be cared for by a professional. \n\nDemi Moore has three new furry family members - adorable orphaned ducklings\nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Demi for comment about the criticism but did not immediately hear back. \nThe ducklings sparked quite a debate amongst a few commenters who were angered by Demi taking in the babies.\n\n Taut Demi Moore, 62, sparks fresh plastic surgery rumors as fans spot shock detail at Time100 Gala \n'This is not ok . Wild mallards should be rehabbed by wildlife rehabber. Her vet should have known that. Sorry.. cute but imprinted,' one posted.\n'Exactly,' another replied in agreement. 'Not a good practice. They won't be successful as wild ducks.'\nAnother said: 'Yeah this is messed up, these ducks need to go to a wildlife rehab.'\nA Demi defended stepped in: 'Easy tiger, we don't know the exact story, just a few pics...'\n'not much more of that story.. its simple these are now imprinted ducks. Just because a celebrity thinks its cute doesn’t make it right and like i said her vet should have known better. Find a licensed rehabber end of story.'\n'What happened to mom! If they imprint to you- there is no way you should release them. That will work against them in the wild as they follow humans around and then fish and wildlife unalives them for that very reason. Talk to a wildlife rehab facility,' another said. \nThe majority of the comments, however, were positive and besotted by the sight of the tiny ducks.\nParis Hilton dropped a heart-eyes emoji to the comments section, while Jennifer Garner shared a few sweet emojis as well.\n\nThe baby ducklings have already made friends with Moore's dog Pilaf\n\nThe tiny Chihuahua inspects her new siblings\n\nThe post contained photos of the young ducks being cared for by Moore at her Idaho home\n\nThey are now living in the lap of luxury\n\nMoore's daughter Tallulah is also getting to know the ducks\nTom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson gushed, 'Oh my goodness! How sweet is this?'\nThe post also showed her daughter Tallulah getting to know the ducks and her granddaughter Louetta fawning over one in her lap. \nThe ducklings aren't the only animals in Demi's life, as the actress famously has an ever-present companion - her tiny fluffy chihuahua Pilaf. \n'The truth is, I am her accessory,' Demi gushed to American TV host Stephen Colbert on The Late Show earlier this year.\n\nA few followers were critical of Moore's decision to care for the ducklings\n\nA few fans defended her from the criticism\n\nSeveral celebrities gushed about the animals\n\nDemi's granddaughter Louetta fawned over one of the ducklings sitting on her lap\n\nThe ducks lined up to follow Moore \nShe explained how she tried to secure her treasured pup a Guinness World Record for her minuscule stature.\n'We looked into this because she literally is the size of a guinea pig,' the actress said. Sadly, Pilaf's legs were too long.\nOn top of her fur babies, she also has three children with her ex-husband Bruce Willis - daughters Rumer, 36, Tallulah, 31, and Scout, 33.\nDemi and Bruce became grandparents in 2023 after Rumer welcomed her first child, daughter Louetta, with her now ex-boyfriend Derek Richard Thomas. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDemi Moore divides followers after rescuing orphaned ducklings\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 33\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Users with the Paramount+ Essential subscription will have the option to begin watching the show on the following day. \nThis year features major star power in the lead actor and actress categories. \nGeorge Clooney is competing for his massively successful play Good Night, And Good Luck — an adaptation of the film of the same name that he directed, co-wrote and costarred in — for the lead actor in a play category, while acting legend Mia Farrow is competing against Succession star Sarah Snook and Stranger Things star Sadie Sink in the lead actress in a play category. \nDarren Criss and Jonathan Groff are adding some star power to the lead actor in a musical category, while Megan Hilty, Nicole Scherzinger and Broadway legend Audra McDonald are some of the biggest names in the lead actress in a musical category. \nBob Odenkirk is best known for his film and television work, including his acclaimed run on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, but he's now nominated in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play category for his turn in the revival of David Mamet's iconic drama of desperation, Glengarry Glen Ross. \nPresenters this year include Charli D'Amelio, Michelle Williams, Hacks' Jean Smart, LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Lea Salonga, all of whom are currently appearing on Broadway. \nThe stage icon Kristin Chenoweth will also be presenting, while Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter will have a Bill and Ted reunion on stage ahead of their upcoming production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting For Godot.

Jackson, Katie Holmes, Jesse Eisenberg, Allison Janney, Ariana DeBose, Adam Lambert, Carrie Preston, Danielle Brooks and Sara Bareilles.\nGoing into the 2025 ceremony, three musicals are leading the pack with 10 nominations each: Buena Vista Social Club, Death Becomes Her and Maybe Happy.\nBuena Vista Social Club is inspired by the beloved Cuban ensemble of the same name, which recorded a hit eponymous album in 1997 and was documented in Wim Wenders' acclaimed documentary (also of the same name) in 1999.\nDeath Becomes Her is based on the Robert Zemeckis fantastical black comedy from 1992, which starred Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis.\nUnlike those musicals, which are adapted from existing music and films, Maybe Happy is a science fiction–romance that originated in South Korea. It follows two android helper-bots who develop feelings for each other, despite the fact that their short life spans threaten any future plans. \nDead Outlaw, John Proctor Is The Villain, Sunset Blvd. and The Hills Of California are all tied for seven Tony nominations, while Floyd Collins, Justin In Time, Purpose and The Picture Of Dorian Gray are tied for six. \nDead Outlaw and Operation Mincemeat: A New Musical are also competing in the Best Musical category, while English, The Hills Of California, John Proctor Is The Villain, Oh, Mary! and Purpose are vying for Best Play.\nPurpose and English have already been honored with Pulitzer Prizes. \n\nStranger Things star Sadie Sink is nominated for John Proctor Is The Villain; pictured April 14 in NYC\n\nBob Odenkirk is best known for Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, but he's now nominated in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role in a Play category for Glengarry Glen Ross; Odenkirk (R) is pictured with costars Bill Burr (L) and Kieran Culkin (center)\nThis year's nominated revivals include Eureka Day, Romeo + Juliet, Thornton Wilder's Our Town and David Henry Hwang's Yellow Face in the play category, while Floyd Collins, Gypsy, Pirates!

Some protesters and journalists were hit during the confrontation.\n\n\"We want to protest peacefully. However, the Trump administration just sent soldiers to fight against us. Is it necessary?\" one protester said.\n\nShortly after the clash, California Governor Gavin Newsom urged protesters to remain peaceful.\n\n\"California -- Don't give Donald Trump what he wants. Speak up. Stay peaceful. Stay calm,\" Newsom wrote in an online post. \"Do not use violence and respect the law enforcement officers that are trying their best to keep the peace.\"\n\nEarlier National guard troops sent by the Trump administration arrived in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, footage broadcast by local news channel ABC 7 showed.\n\nIt is the first time since 1965 that a president has activated a state's National Guard force without a request from that state's governor, Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, an independent law and policy organisation, told The New York Times.\n\nThe ABC 7's footage showed the troops were deployed in the downtown area near City Hall, City of Paramount and Compton, where protesters have been clashing with federal agents and local policemen since Friday noon.\n\nThe clashes came after agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal law enforcement agencies raided several locations in southern California from Friday, which sparked mass protests. But Washington vowed Saturday to continue the raids despite opposition from local communities and officials.\n\nThe two-days raids resulted in more than 100 arrests, drawing angry protesters who confronted agents with tear gas, flash-bang grenades and rocks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump took extraordinary action on Saturday by calling up 2,000 National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles region, making rare use of federal powers and bypassing the authority of the state's governor, Gavin Newsom.\n\nThe governor and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass were leading the opposition Sunday to Trump's decision.\n\nNewsom blasted the move in a fund-raising email sent out Sunday morning, according to media reports.\n\n\"Last night, President Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, using the excuse of protests against his immigration raids... The president is attempting to inflame passions and provoke a response,\" Newsom wrote.\n\nNewsom said Trump just wanted show of force, warning this move and the Pentagon's threat to deploy United States Marines on American soil would escalate tensions and incite violence.\n\nBass echoed some of those thoughts in an interview, saying she felt very disappointed that Trump chose to deploy the National Guard troops since it was totally unnecessary.\n\n\"There were protests last night in Los Angeles -- my understanding is that there were about 120 protesters. Several of them did commit acts of vandalism, but there was nothing that was happening in downtown Los Angeles that the Los Angeles Police Department could not manage to deal with, so to me, this is completely unnecessary,\" she said.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Los Angeles, June 9 (SocialNews.XYZ) More than 200 protesters clashed with National Guard troops in downtown Los Angeles during the latest demonstrations against immigration raids that swept across California over the weekend.

The AP video shows uniformed officers shooting smoke-filled canisters as they advanced into the street, forcing protesters to retreat. The National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder behind plastic riot shields.\n\nWithout the governor’s request\n\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to halt Trump’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom called the decision “purposefully inflammatory.” He posted on X that Trump was deploying the National Guard “not because there is a shortage of law enforcement, but because they want a spectacle,” adding: “Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully.” The governor also wrote that Trump’s attempts to militarise California “are an alarming abuse of power.” Newsom also said Hegseth’s threats to send active duty personnel were “deranged behaviour.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s proposal to defund California, Newsom said his state will stop paying federal taxes. Californians pay the bills for the federal government. \n\n“We pay over $80 billion more in taxes than we get back. Maybe it’s time to cut that off, @realDonaldTrump. Californians pay the bills for the federal government,” he stated on X. \n\n2,000 more National Guard troops\n\nThe continuation of intense protests prompted the Trump Administration to threaten sending 2,000 more National Guard troops and Hetseth saying he was prepared to mobilise active duty troops “if violence continues”, Reuters said. \n\nThe three-day protests in Los Angeles are far smaller than past events that have brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the protests against police violence in 2020, when Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops, AP said.\n\nTrump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles, and they’re not gonna get away with it.”\n\nAsked if he would deploy troops to Los Angeles, the president replied, “We’re gonna have troops everywhere. We won’t let this happen to our country. We’re not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden.” He warned that California officials who obstruct deportations will face charges, while apparently forgetting he refused to send troops when a violent mob of protesters raided Congress on January 6th, 2020.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California’s politicians and protesters of “defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans’ safety.”\n\n“Why do Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass care more about violent murderers and sex offenders than they do about protecting their own citizens?” she said. “These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,” McLaughlin.\n\n‘I’m deeply angered,’ says LA Mayor\n\nTelevision news footage on Friday showed unmarked vehicles resembling military transport and vans loaded with uniformed federal agents streaming through Los Angeles streets as part of the immigration enforcement operation.\n\nRaids occurred around Home Depot stores, where street vendors and day labourers were picked up, as well as at a garment factory and a warehouse, Salas of Chirla said.\n\nBass, the mayor of Los Angeles, condemned the immigration raids.\n\n“I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said in a statement. “These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. We will not stand for this.”\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the immigration raids. “I am deeply angered by what has taken place. These tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic principles of safety in our city. We will not stand for this.”\n\nThere is no doubt that this story has not ended yet, and further consequences will surely unfold in the days to come.","summary":"US Federal agents clashed with protesters near a detention centre in downtown Los Angeles, as confrontations stretched into a third [&#8230;]","url":"https://euroweeklynews.com/2025/06/09/tensions-flare-as-federal-agents-clash-with-la-protesters/","image":"https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/An-AFP-photographer-saw-fires-and-fireworks-light-up-the-streets-during-clashes-©-RINGO-CHIU-AFP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:37:50","author":"Olivier Acuña Barba","authors":["Olivier Acuña Barba"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"es","sentiment":-0.492},{"id":329421886,"title":"UFC fans share what they think about Trump ahead of O'Malley-Dvalishvili showdown","text":"UFC fans gathered in Newark, N.J., for the highly anticipated matchup between Merab Dvalishvili and Sean O'Malley.

It used to be standard practice for US firms to pay the full cost of shipping, as they could leverage long-standing relationships with freighters to keep costs in check – according to a sales representative from one of Zhejiang province’s leading garment exporters, Stage Group. Now, the company is paying 60 percent of shipping costs for US-bound freight.\n\nAccording to an editorial from China Daily, US retailers’ behaviour is “unreasonable” because “it is the US’ ill-advised tariff policy that has pushed up their cost.” \n\nWashington’s tariff war on China began in April, when US President Donald Trump made his so-called “Liberation Day” tariff announcement – imposing steep rates on many of the US’ trade partners. \n\n[See more: Presidents Xi and Trump attempt to preserve fragile trade truce with a phone call]\n\nBeijing’s retaliation sparked a rapid escalation, with most Chinese exports to the US ending up slapped with a 145 percent duty rate (US exports to China faced 125 percent). Such rates all but halted trade between the world’s two biggest economies.\n\nWashington quickly backed down and temporarily slashed its tariff rates last month, prompting Beijing to follow suit. But the cost of shipping goods from China to the US climbed significantly as the industry bounced back from limbo. According to Bloomberg, pent-up demand for shipping coupled with the start of the sector’s busy season meant prices were bound to go up.\n\nXeneta chief shipping analyst Peter Sand said that a massive increase in demand for spots on container ships showed businesses were eager to ensure their goods would travel during the 90-day tariff pause negotiated by representatives from Beijing and Washington, CNBC reported. \n\nHowever, he noted that the trend was expected to peak this month because “capacity is heading back to the Transpacific and the desperation of shippers to get supply chains moving again will ease once boxes are on the water and inventories begin to build up.”","summary":"Freight fees have soared following China and the US’ tariff truce last month, reigniting trade between the two countries\n\n\nThe post Hit by rising costs, US retailers are demanding that Chinese firms pay for shipping appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/greater-china/china-us-shipping-costs-trade/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/US-China-Shipping.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:30:00","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.493},{"id":329423044,"title":"Trump’s new travel ban: the countries chosen and how it differs from the last one","text":"Nearly five months into his second term, Donald Trump announced a new sweeping travel ban that could reshape the US’s borders more dramatically than any policy in modern memory. The order, banning citizens of 12 countries, will come into effect at 12am ET in a move Trump said would protect the country from “foreign terrorists”.\n\nThe proclamation represents one of the most ambitious attempts to reshape the US’s approach to global mobility in modern history and potentially affects millions of people coming to the US for relocation, travel, work or school.\n\nWhat is a travel ban?\n\nA travel ban restricts or prohibits citizens of specific countries from entering the US. These restrictions can range from complete visa suspensions to specific limitations on certain visa categories.\n\nTrump’s day one executive order required the state department to identify countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries”.\n\nHis travel ban proclamation, signed 4 June, referenced the previous executive order, as well as the recent attack by an Egyptian national in Boulder, Colorado, upon a group of people demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.\n\nWhat is a presidential proclamation?\n\nA presidential proclamation is a decree that is often ceremonial or can have legal implications when it comes to national emergencies.\n\nUnlike an executive order, which is a directive to heads of agencies in the administration, the proclamation primarily signals a broad change in policy.\n\nWhich countries are listed in the travel ban?\n\nThe following countries were identified for total bans of any nationals seeking to travel to the US for immigration or non-immigration reasons:\n\nAfghanistanMyanmarChadRepublic of the CongoEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLibyaSomaliaSudanYemen\n\nTrump is also partly restricting the travel of people from:\n\nBurundiCubaLaosSierra LeoneTogoTurkmenistanVenezuela\n\nWhy were these countries chosen?\n\nThe proclamation broadly cites national security issues for including the countries, but specifies a few different issues that reach the level of concern for the travel ban.\n\nFor some countries, such as Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Venezuela, the proclamation claims that there is no reliable central authority for issuing passports or screening and vetting nationals traveling out of the country.\n\nFor other countries, such as Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo and Turkmenistan, the proclamation cites a high rate of immigrants overstaying their business, tourist and student visas in the US.\n\nFinally, there are several countries that are included because of terrorist activity or state-sponsored terrorism, including Iran, Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and Cuba.\n\nIn the draft travel ban plans that were leaked in March, the original list contained 43 nations across three tiers of restrictions. Now the ban has been filtered down to 19 countries.\n\nAmong the puzzling inclusions is Venezuela, which the White House says lacks competent document-issuing authorities. Trump has recently pursued a thaw in relations with the country that has proven useful to his deportation initiatives– though the country’s inclusion is likely tied to Venezuelans already in the US who have been a clear target for the White House.\n\nHow does this travel ban differ from the one in 2017?\n\nThe 2017 ban initially targeted seven predominantly Muslim countries before expanding to include North Korea and Venezuela. This new proclamation is broader and also makes the notable addition of Haiti.\n\nDuring his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump amplified false claims made by his running mate, JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the pets of the people that live there”. The proclamation falsely claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden administration” and this “influx harms American communities”. In fact, about 200,000 Haitians were granted temporary protected status, which gives legal residency permits to foreign nationals who are unable to return home safely due to conditions in their home countries.\n\nAlso notable are the restrictions on Afghans, given that many of the Afghans approved to live in the US as refugees were forced to flee their home country as a result of working to support US troops there, before the full withdrawal of US forces in 2021. The agreement with the Taliban to withdraw US troops was negotiated by Trump during his first term.\n\nLast month, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, announced “the termination of temporary protected status for Afghanistan”, effective 20 May.\n\nThe restrictions will be reviewed every 180 days for potential modification.\n\nHow will visa holders be affected?\n\nCurrent visa holders remain largely protected: the restrictions only apply to people outside the US without valid visas as of 9 June. No existing visas will be revoked, the White House said.\n\nBut new visa applications from people from these countries will be suspended or severely limited, with some exceptions for diplomatic visas, immediate family members and cases involving US national interest – one such example being the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics.\n\nFor employers, the ban threatens significant workforce disruptions across the tech, healthcare and education sectors, with companies unable to hire from the 12 countries targeted by a full ban. For the seven countries on a partial ban, employers can still hire on some work visas but cannot sponsor green cards, and visas will have reduced durations.\n\nThe impact could be particularly severe for international Stem talent, medical professionals and academic recruitment.\n\nThe education and health industries alone employ about 5.5 million foreign-born workers.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-travel-ban-countries-affected-012314376.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/f10c4cbae2a98c5bed0b07e81c99c065","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:26:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":329428080,"title":"Gavin Newsom Demands Trump Remove National Guard From LA Immigration Protests: ‘Breach of State Sovereignty’","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom has formally requested that Donald Trump recall the National Guard from Los Angeles and other areas where Californians are protesting the ongoing immigration raids, calling the federal deployment “a serious breach of state sovereignty.”\n\nNewsom shared his official letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday afternoon in an Instagram post, saying, “I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles County and return them to my command. We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved. This is a serious breach of state sovereignty — inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they’re actually needed. Rescind the Order. Return order to California.”\n\nIn a Saturday night memorandum, Trump ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to aid federal law enforcement officers battling growing unrest in downtown L.A. and surrounding areas. Newsom immediately condemned the order, suggesting it would only enflame tensions.\n\nFederal officials told reporters on Sunday that several law enforcement officers had been injured in the skirmishes.\n\nRead the entire text of Newsom’s letter below:\n\nDear Secretary Hegseth:\n\nOn June 7, 2025, President Trump issued a memorandum to your office entitled “Department of Defense Security for the Protection of Department of Homeland Security Functions.” The memorandum purports to invoke 10 U.S.C. § 12406 to “call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard . . . to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property.” The memorandum further directs “actions as necessary for the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with the Governors of the States and the National Guard Bureau in identifying and ordering into Federal service the appropriate members and units of the National Guard under this authority.”\n\nSection 12406 states that “the President may call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary” to (1) repel an invasion of the United States by a foreign nation; (2) suppress a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States; or (3) execute the laws of the United States when the President is unable to do so with regular forces. Section 12406 further states that “[o]rders for these purposes shall be issued through the governors of the States.”\n\nLast night, the Adjutant General of California received a memorandum from your office with the subject line “Calling Members of the California National Guard into Federal Service,” which states that “[t]wo thousand members of the California National Guard will be called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days.” Notably, this directive did not issue “through the governor[] of the State[]” as required by section 12406; the Department of Defense did not transmit this directive to the Office of the Governor, nor was it approved or ordered by the Governor of California. This directive is also inconsistent with the President’s memorandum, which anticipates “coordinat[ion] with the Governors of the States” in identifying and ordering units of the National Guard into federal service.\n\nAt present, law enforcement authorities from the City and County of Los Angeles are safeguarding public safety, and, as demonstrated by the robust law enforcement response yesterday evening to protect federal facilities, local law enforcement resources are sufficient to maintain order. In dynamic and fluid situations such as the one in Los Angeles, State and local authorities are the most appropriate ones to evaluate the need for resources to safeguard life and property. Indeed, the decision to deploy the National Guard, without appropriate training or orders, risks seriously escalating the situation.\n\nThere is currently no need for the National Guard to be deployed in Los Angeles, and to do so in this unlawful manner and for such a lengthy period is a serious breach of state sovereignty that seems intentionally designed to inflame the situation, while simultaneously depriving the State from deploying these personnel and resources where they are truly required. Accordingly, we ask that you immediately rescind your order and return the National Guard to its rightful control by the State of California, to be deployed as appropriate when necessary.\n\nDavid SappLegal Affairs SecretaryOffice of Governor Gavin Newsom","summary":"\"We didn’t have a problem until Trump got involved,\" the governor writes, adding: \"This is a serious breach of state sovereignty\"\n\n\nThe post Gavin Newsom Demands Trump Remove National Guard From LA Immigration Protests: &#8216;Breach of State Sovereignty&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/gavin-newsom-demands-trump-remove-national-guard-from-la-immigration-protests-breach-of-state-sovereignty/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gavin-Newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:25:39","author":"Josh Dickey","authors":["Josh Dickey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":329421366,"title":"World News | Israeli Hostages Highlighted at Boulder Jewish Festival After Attack on Group Urging Their Release","text":"Boulder (Colorado), Jun 9 (AP) For the 611 days since Omri Miran was taken hostage by Hamas, his family has lived in fear, his brother-in-law told those gathered at the Boulder Jewish Festival on Sunday, one week after a man firebombed a group calling for the release of Israeli hostages at the mall where Moshe Lavi now spoke. \"We received only partial, limited and at times horrifying proof of life,\" Lavi said to a hushed crowd. \"We don't know how much he's suffering, deprived of food, water, sunlight, tortured, abused, as I speak to you now.\" Also Read | Earthquake in Colombia: Quake of Magnitude 6.7 on Richter Scale Hits South American Country, No Casualties Reported. For its 30th year, the Jewish cultural festival centred on the stories of Israeli hostages after authorities said a man who yelled \"Free Palestine\" threw Molotov cocktails at Boulder demonstrators calling for their release. Festival organisers said they reimagined it to focus on healing and centre the group's cause — raising awareness of the 55 people believed to still be in captivity in Gaza. Authorities said 15 people and a dog were victims of the attack at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall. They include eight women and seven men, ranging in age from 25 to 88. One is a Holocaust survivor.

Not all were physically injured, and some are considered victims for the legal case because they were present and could potentially have been hurt. Run for Their Lives, the group targeted in the attack, started in October 2023 after Hamas militants from the Gaza Strip stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage. The Boulder chapter, one of 230 worldwide, walks at the mall every weekend for 18 minutes, the numerical value of the Hebrew word 'chai', which means 'life'. Several hundred people joined the Sunday walk that typically draws only a couple dozen. Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper was among the participants. Demonstrators handed out stickers stamped with '611', representing the 611 days since the first Israeli hostages were taken by Hamas militants. On a stage near the site of the attack, hundreds gathered to listen to speakers and songs. Vendors sold traditional Jewish and Israeli cuisine. In tents marked 'Hostage Square', rows of chairs sat empty save for photos of the hostages and the exhortation \"Bring them home now!\" Lavi thanked local demonstrators for their bravery in advocating for his family. He described Miran as a gentle and loving gardener, husband and father to two young children. Merav Tsubely, an Israeli-American who came to the festival from a city north of Boulder, watched as hostages' families thanked those gathered in recorded video messages. One of Miran's children appeared on screen and said in Hebrew, \"When daddy comes back from Gaza, he'll take me to kindergarten.\" \"Just seeing them speaking to us, here, with all they're going through, their supporting us is kind of mind blowing,\" Tsubely said, her eyes welling. \"It just reminds us how connected we all are.\" Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was charged for the attack on Thursday in Colorado state court with 118 counts, including attempted murder, assault, illegal use of explosives and animal cruelty. He was also charged with a hate crime in federal court. Soliman, an Egyptian national who federal authorities say was living in the US illegally, told police he was driven by a desire \"to kill all Zionist people,\" a reference to the movement to establish and sustain a Jewish state in Israel. The violence in downtown Boulder unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which continues to inflame global tensions and has contributed to a spike in anti-semitism in the US. It also came at the start of the holiday of Shavuot, which commemorates God giving the Torah to the Jewish people at Mount Sinai in Egypt. US immigration officials took Soliman's wife and five children, who also are Egyptian, into custody on Tuesday. They have not been charged in the attack. A federal judge on Wednesday granted a request to block their deportation. The Boulder Police Department and the FBI coordinated to provide increased security at the festival as well as local synagogues and the Boulder Jewish Community Centre. Officers guarded the event's entrances, and police Chief Stephen Redfearn said some plainclothes officers would be present in the crowd. On a rooftop near the stage, three held rifles and used binoculars to monitor the crowd as drones buzzed overhead. Matan Gold-Edelstein's father was present last weekend and helped douse the fire that burned an older woman. Gold-Edelstein, a 19-year-old college student, said the well-attended festival was a great show of humanity, regardless of religion or politics. \"We're not here to be in support of a war,\" he said. \"We're here in support of our religion, in support of our people and in support of the innocent people who are still being held hostage.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

ICE denied these allegations, with a spokesperson previously telling Newsweek the agency \"categorically refutes the assertions made by immigration activists in Los Angeles.\"The raids in Paramount, Los Angeles County, followed similar action in locations through other parts of the city on Friday, during which police arrested at least 44 people. Some protesters have thrown rocks at officers, with one allegedly throwing a Molotov cocktail, and burning items in the streets. Police responded with tear gas.The clashes highlight deepening conflicts between sanctuary jurisdictions and federal immigration policy, as Trump has implemented sweeping changes through executive orders and utilized the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expand deportation authority.Why the National Guard Was CalledDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem directly blamed California Governor Gavin Newsom for the federal government's decision to deploy National Guard troops to assist with violent clashes between police and immigration protesters in Los Angeles.The deployment came after reports of significant violence against law enforcement, including officers sustaining injuries from bricks thrown through vehicle windows, vehicles being burned, and Molotov cocktails being thrown at personnel conducting ICE operations.Noem criticized Newsom's handling of the situation during an appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, arguing that proper state-level response could have prevented the escalation. She emphasized that the 2,000 National Guard soldiers are specifically trained for crowd control situations and will provide security around federal buildings while supporting both peaceful protesters and law enforcement officers.The federal intervention represents a sharp disagreement between state and federal authorities over jurisdiction and necessity. Newsom has maintained that local authorities are capable of handling the situation and accused Trump of deliberately inflaming tensions through the deployment.What To KnowThe situation escalated rapidly as LAPD authorized the use of less lethal munitions and issued dispersal orders.Police warned on X, formerly Twitter, that anyone throwing items at officers would be detained and arrested, while also announcing that the city was on tactical alert. Multiple arrests were reported as law enforcement moved to clear protest areas.Trump authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles on Saturday evening, citing violence against law enforcement during immigration protests. The troops arrived Sunday morning and have been positioned at federal buildings, including the Civic Center area, according to LAPD Central Division.The president invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406, a provision within Title 10 that allows federal deployment of National Guard forces when there is \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\" His order stated that violent protests constitute \"a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\"The protests began in response to ICE raids in Paramount and other parts of Los Angeles County, with at least 44 arrests made Friday. Demonstrators have gathered near federal facilities amid reports that detainees were being held in a federal building basement—allegations ICE has categorically denied.When asked on Sunday about potentially invoking the Insurrection Act, Trump indicated current conditions don't meet that threshold but emphasized his administration will not tolerate violence against federal personnel.Police also issued warnings for people to avoid MTA train areas, stating that anyone remaining on the tracks would be subject to arrest. Roads near the federal detention center and federal courts building were closed as demonstrations continued for a third consecutive day.What People Are SayingDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem on Face the Nation on Sunday: \"If he [Newsom] was doing his job, people wouldn't have gotten hurt the last couple of days. We wouldn't have officers with a shattered wrist from bricks thrown through their vehicles, vehicles being burned, flags burned in the street and Molotov cocktails being thrown.\"California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X on Sunday: \"I have formally requested the Trump Administration rescind their unlawful deployment of troops in Los Angeles county and return them to my command. We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved. This is a serious breach of state sovereignty—inflaming tensions while pulling resources from where they're actually needed. Rescind the order. Return control to California.\"Border czar Tom Homan on Fox News on Saturday said: \"We're already mobilizing. We're gonna bring the National Guard in tonight and we're gonna continue doing our job. This is about enforcing the law.\"He added: \"American people, this is about enforcing the law, and again, we're not going to apologize for doing it.\"President Donald Trump on Truth Social wrote on Saturday: \"If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can't do their jobs, which everyone knows they can't, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!\"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on X on Sunday: \"We will always protect the constitutional right for Angelenos to peacefully protest. However, violence, destruction and vandalism will not be tolerated in our City and those responsible will be held fully accountable.\"LAPD Central Division on X on Sunday: \"Officers are reporting that people in the crowd are throwing concrete, bottles and other objects. Arrests are being initiated. A DISPERSAL ORDER has been issued for the area of Alameda and Temple. Those at Alameda and Temple must leave the area.\"What Happens Next?Protesters have gathered for a third day as law enforcement continues to ramp up its operations.","summary":"LAPD declared an unlawful assembly as protests against ICE operations continue as Trump deployed 2,000 National Guard troops Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/unlawful-assembly-declared-amid-los-angeles-ice-protests-2082568","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2658984/national-guard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:24:05","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":329417256,"title":"National Guard Clashes with Protesters Shortly After Arriving in Los Angeles on Trump’s Orders","text":"LOS ANGELES – On Sunday, tear gas was used against protesters in Los Angeles after some of them approached National Guard troops and hurled insults, following President Donald Trump’s controversial military deployment despite opposition from both the governor and the mayor.\n\nThe clash occurred as hundreds gathered in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. There, several newly-deployed National Guard members stood in a line, equipped with plastic riot shields.\n\nFootage captured uniformed officers deploying smoke-filled canisters, advancing towards and pushing back the demonstrators. The reason behind the use of the chemical agents and which agency was responsible remains unclear. \n\nMinutes later, loud popping sounds erupted again, as some protesters chanted “go home” and “shame.” One person was taken to the ground by uniformed officers. Another appeared to be bleeding from their head. \n\nAround 300 National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from Trump, who accused Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats of failing to stanch recent protests targeting immigration agents. \n\nThe move appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts. \n\nDeployment follows days of protest\n\nThe deployment followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.\n\nAs federal agents set up a staging area Saturday near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls. \n\nTensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed above 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement. \n\nThe deployment of the National Guard came over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of a “complete overreaction” designed to create a spectacle of force. \n\nThe recent protests remain far smaller than past events that have brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops. \n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor’s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nTrump says there will be ‘very strong law and order’\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” \n\nHe said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.\n\nTrump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they’re not gonna get away with it.” \n\nAsked if he planned to send U.S. troops to Los Angeles, Trump replied: “We’re gonna have troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country. We’re not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nTrump also said that California officials who stand in the way of the deportations could face charges. A Wisconsin judge was arrested last month on accusations she helped a man evade immigration authorities.\n\n“If officials stay in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face charges,” Trump said.\n\nNewsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor’s office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.\n\nThere was some confusion surrounding the exact timing of the guard’s arrival. Shortly before midnight local time, Trump congratulated the National Guard on a “job well done.” But less than an hour later, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said troops had yet to arrive in the city.\n\nDefense secretary threatens to deploy active-duty Marines ‘if violence continues’\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California’s politicians and protesters of “defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans’ safety.”\n\n“Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,” McLaughlin added.\n\nThe troops included members of the California Army National Guard’s 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense.\n\nIn a signal of the administration’s aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected “a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism” and “usurping the powers of the United States Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president’s move, doubling down on Republicans’ criticisms of California Democrats.\n\n“Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,” Johnson said.\n\nOffenhartz reported from New York.

What I've learned is that a fall isn't the end, but the beginning of an even better journey.'\n\nShakira hasn't held back in creating the biggest show possible, from 14 outfits, to huge visuals and special guests\n\nOpening with the song La Fuerte, she told the crowd: 'Many of you know that the past years haven't been the easiest for me, right?' \n\n Moment Shakira slips and falls on stage - a week after measles scare at concert \nYet Shakira, 48, has no problem keeping her energy up during the two hour set list and revealed she trained to be ready for this set of shows and is constantly working out. \nThe star also tours with two physiotherapists and the backstage catering is full of healthy options including grilled red snapper, Peruvian chicken and cauliflower steak.\nIt comes after Shakira was recently forced to cancel three shows amid the American leg of her tour. \nShe could no longer perform in Washington DC at Nationals Park as part WorldPride's welcome event after city inspectors identifying 'structural elements that were not up to standard,' according to TMZ.\n Nationals Park posted a statement online reading, 'Due to complications with the previous show in Boston, Shakira's full tour production cannot be transported to Washington, D.C. in time for her scheduled performance at Nationals Park on Saturday, May 31.'\nWorldPride is the largest LGBTQ+ festival in the world and will kick off June's internationally recognized Pride Month.\nPer TMZ, Shakira responded by saying, 'I have been counting the days, excited to be reunited with my fans in both Washington and Boston, and my team and I have made every effort to make it happen, but it doesn’t depend on any one of us right now, and I am devastated that these shows were just not possible this time. \n'I promise that I will do everything in my power to be with you as soon as I can.'\nThe ballpark's message to ticketholders continued, 'Refunds will be issued automatically for Ticketmaster and Nationals.com purchases — no further action is required.'\nIt comes after the Whenever, Wherever hitmaker had to cancel two back-to-back shows scheduled last month at Boston's Fenway Park.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nShakira CONFIRMS she is bringing record-breaking tour to the UK as she confesses Beyoncé inspired series of stadium shows\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mark Messmer, R-Ind., talks with reporters to discuss work on President Donald Trump’s bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. (AP)\n\nThe speaker responded with arguments long held by Republicans: They believe that reducing taxes and cutting expenditures would promote economic growth, subsequently decreasing deficits. However, annual deficits and the national debt increased during the tenures of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, as well as during Trump’s initial presidency, even after significant tax reductions.\n\nRussell Vought, who leads the White House Office of Budget and Management, said on Fox News Sunday that CBO analysts base their models of “artificial baselines.” Because the 2017 tax law set the lower rates to expire, CBO’s cost estimates, Vought argued, presuming a return to the higher rates before that law went into effect.\n\nVought acknowledged CBO’s charge from Congress is to analyse legislation and current law as it is written. But he said the office could issue additional analyses, implying it would be friendlier to GOP goals. Asked whether the White House would ask for alternative estimates, Vought again put the burden on CBO, repeating that congressional rules allow the office to publish more analysis.\n\nOther Republicans, meanwhile, approached the Trump-Musk battle cautiously.\n\n“As a former professional fighter, I learned a long time ago, don’t get between two fighters,” said Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\nHe even compared the two billionaire businessmen to a married couple.\n\n“President Trump is a friend of mine but I don’t need to get, I can have friends that have disagreements,” Mullin said. “My wife and I dearly love each other and every now and then, well actually quite often, sometimes she disagrees with me, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t stay focused on what’s best for our family. Right now, there may be a disagreement but we’re laser focused on what is best for the American people.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWith an uncharacteristic feistiness, Speaker Mike Johnson has taken clear sides in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Mike Johnson Minimizes Musk&#8217;s Role, Confident in Trump&#8217;s Tax Bill Passing first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/mike-johnson-minimizes-musks-role-confident-in-trumps-tax-bill-passing/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mike-Johnson-downplays-Musk039s-influence-and-says-Trump039s-tax-bill.au2Ffs2Fb4ce9852-25fc-4275-aa67-c153cfe91d6c.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-08 23:16:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":329420184,"title":"National Guard faces off with protesters hours after arriving in Los Angeles on Trump’s orders","text":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tear gas was fired at protesters in Los Angeles on Sunday when some demonstrators moved close to National Guard troops and shouted insults at them, hours after President Donald Trump’s extraordinary deployment of the military over the objections of the governor and mayor.\n\nThe confrontation broke out as hundreds of people protested in front of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, where several of the newly-arrived National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder behind plastic riot shields.\n\nVideo showed uniformed officers shooting off the smoke-filled canisters as they advanced into the street, forcing protesters to retreat. It was not immediately clear what prompted the use of chemical irritants or which law enforcement agency fired them.\n\nMinutes later, loud popping sounds erupted again, as some protesters chanted “go home” and “shame.” One person was taken to the ground by uniformed officers. Another appeared to be bleeding from their head.\n\nAround 300 National Guard troops arrived in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from Trump, who accused Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats of failing to stanch recent protests targeting immigration agents.\n\nThe move appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts.\n\nDeployment follows days of protest\n\nThe deployment followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.\n\nAs federal agents set up a staging area Saturday near a Home Depot in Paramount, demonstrators attempted to block Border Patrol vehicles, with some hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed tear gas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.\n\nTensions were high after a series of sweeps by immigration authorities the previous day, as the weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the city climbed above 100. A prominent union leader was arrested while protesting and accused of impeding law enforcement.\n\nThe deployment of the National Guard came over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of a “complete overreaction” designed to create a spectacle of force.\n\nThe recent protests remain far smaller than past events that have brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.\n\nThe last time the National Guard was activated without a governor’s permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nTrump says there will be ‘very strong law and order’\n\nIn a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”\n\nHe said he had authorized the deployment of 2,000 members of the National Guard.\n\nTrump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they’re not gonna get away with it.”\n\nAsked if he planned to send U.S. troops to Los Angeles, Trump replied: “We’re gonna have troops everywhere. We’re not going to let this happen to our country. We’re not going to let our country be torn apart like it was under Biden.” He didn’t elaborate.\n\nTrump also said that California officials who stand in the way of the deportations could face charges. A Wisconsin judge was arrested last month on accusations she helped a man evade immigration authorities.\n\n“If officials stay in the way of law and order, yeah, they will face charges,” Trump said.\n\nNewsom called Trump on Friday night and they spoke for about 40 minutes, according to the governor’s office. It was not clear if they spoke Saturday or Sunday.\n\nThere was some confusion surrounding the exact timing of the guard’s arrival. Shortly before midnight local time, Trump congratulated the National Guard on a “job well done.” But less than an hour later, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said troops had yet to arrive in the city.\n\nDefense secretary threatens to deploy active-duty Marines ‘if violence continues’\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused California’s politicians and protesters of “defending heinous illegal alien criminals at the expense of Americans’ safety.”\n\n“Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer,” McLaughlin added.\n\nThe troops included members of the California Army National Guard’s 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, according to a social media post from the Department of Defense.\n\nIn a signal of the administration’s aggressive approach, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also threatened to deploy active-duty Marines “if violence continues” in the region.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said the order by Trump reflected “a president moving this country rapidly into authoritarianism” and “usurping the powers of the United States Congress.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a staunch Trump ally, endorsed the president’s move, doubling down on Republicans’ criticisms of California Democrats.\n\n“Gavin Newsom has shown an inability or an unwillingness to do what is necessary, so the president stepped in,” Johnson said.\n\nOffenhartz reported from New York.

(FOX 5/KUSI) — A protest unfolded Sunday afternoon outside the Main Gate of Camp Pendleton, where demonstrators gathered to denounce the use of the military against civil protests in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth put Camp Pendleton Marines on high alert to be deployed to L.A. if needed in response to the widespread demonstrations, which have led to the use of flash-bangs and tear gas by law enforcement. \n\nAdditionally, President Donald Trump ordered thousands of National Guard troops to be deployed Saturday night after a raid in Paramount earlier in the day. Those troops began arriving Sunday morning, showcasing a heavy military presence ahead of another day of demonstrations.\n\nNorth County protest\n\nBeginning at noon on Sunday, dozens of San Diegans assembled outside Camp Pendleton’s Main Gate to voice opposition to the use of military force on American soil in response to the demonstrations. According to a protest organizer, the gathering is also meant to show support for service members.\n\nDemonstrators held signs reading “Protest is Patriotic,” “Support Our Troops,” and “Save Democracy.\n\nFOX 5/KUSI reached out to Camp Pendleton for comment on the matter.
