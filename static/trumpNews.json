Initial shelling had killed one and damaged several floors of the building, but Russian forces struck again during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, authorities said. At least 22 were reported injured in the attacks. Danielle Bell, head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, said “loitering munitions” – or suicide drones – hit the Saint Panteleimon clinical hospital in two attacks 45 minutes apart. “Most of the fatalities occurred during the second strike, which hit as first responders arrived at the site and patients attempted to evacuate,” she said. Sumy city is located 32 km (20 miles) from the Russian border. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one day after his meeting with Donald Trump in New York, condemned the Sumy attack. “Everyone in the world who speaks about this war must pay attention to what Russia is targeting,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “They are waging war on hospitals, civilian objects, and people’s lives. Only strength can force Russia into peace. Peace through strength is the only right way.” In addition to the ten killed on Saturday, at least seven other civilians were killed throughout Ukraine in the previous 24 hours, authorities said. Four were killed in Kryvyi Rih after a Russian missile struck a five-storey police administration building on Friday – authorities completed rescue efforts there on Saturday. Of the four killed in Kryvyi Rih, three were police officers. Meanwhile, other missile and airstrikes on residential areas of the Kherson, Donetsk and Odesa oblasts left dozens more injured. Russia’s top diplomat warned on Saturday against “trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power”, delivering a UN general assembly speech packed with condemnations of what Russia sees as western machinations in Ukraine and elsewhere – including inside the United Nations itself. Three days after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, aired a shift in his country’s nuclear doctrine, his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the west of using Ukraine as a tool to try “to defeat” Moscow strategically. China’s foreign minister warned fellow leaders on Saturday against an “expansion of the battlefield” in the war and said the Beijing government remained committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end. China, along with Brazil, has proposed new talks involving Kyiv and Moscow and this week gathered Global South countries behind that plan. Zelenskyy dismissed China and Brazil’s efforts, questioning why they were proposing an alternative to his own peace formula. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an interview with Fox News aired on Saturday, said he had received “very direct information” from Donald Trump that the former US president would support Ukraine in the war against Russia if he is reelected in the November presidential election. Zelenskyy said: “I don’t know what will be after elections and who will be the president … But I’ve got from Donald Trump very direct information that he will be on our side, that he will support Ukraine.” Two Russian attacks in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region killed four people on Saturday including a supreme court judge who was delivering aid to local residents in a civilian car, Ukrainian officials said. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said an air attack killed three people and injured at least three others in the village of Slatyne, which lies about 25 km (15 miles) north of the city of Kharkiv – the regional capital. Russia is prepared to go to court over the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, with a foreign ministry spokesperson saying on Saturday that Russia has filed “pre-trial claims” against Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Maria Zakharova accused the west of attempting to “sweep the matter under the carpet”, maintaining that the explosions that ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipeline in September 2022 – seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine – were “an egregious act of international terrorism”. Nato members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will seek EU funding to build a network of bunkers, barriers, distribution lines and military warehouses along their borders with Russia and Belarus, Estonia’s officials have said. The three Baltic countries initially announced the plan for a “Baltic Defence Line” in January. In May, Poland announced a similar project called the “Eastern Shield” with the purpose of strengthening its borders with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus. North Korea, which has been accused of illegally supplying weapons to Russia, said on Sunday that US military aid worth $8bn to Ukraine was “an incredible mistake” and playing with fire against nuclear superpower Russia. “The United States and the west should not dismiss or underestimate Russia’s serious warning,” Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said in a statement published by state news agency KCNA. Vladimir Putin has warned he could use nuclear weapons if Russia were to be hit with missiles. North Korea has shipped at least 16,500 containers of weapons to Russia since September last year and Russia has fired missiles from those shipments against Ukraine, the US has said.","summary":"UN says most fatalities occurred during the second strike as first responders attempted to evacuate patients.

Trump criticized Harris' border visit and Fox News for airing her comments, claiming, \"Everything she says is lies.\"Newsweek reached out to both the Harris and Trump campaigns via email for comment on Saturday's events.Immigration remains a hot-button issue in Wisconsin and other swing states, with the former president hoping to capitalize on voter frustration. Trump reiterated his controversial stance, having previously described illegal border crossers as \"poisoning the blood of the country.\" He also promised to launch the \"largest deportation operation in American history\" if re-elected.The event featured mugshots of individuals in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate. Local Police Chief Kyle Teynor addressed the crowd, confirming that Zarate, arrested on multiple charges including sexual assault, is not a U.S. citizen and possessed fake immigration documents.Recent polls show a tight race in Wisconsin. According to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, Harris leads Trump by a narrow margin of 49 percent to 47 percent among likely voters in the state.The Times/Siena poll, conducted from September 21 to 26, surveyed 680 likely voters and has a margin of error of approximately 4 percentage points. FiveThirtyEight's polling averages for Wisconsin show Harris maintaining a slim lead of 2.1 points over Trump (48.8 percent to 46.7 percent).A recent poll by Redfield and Wilton Strategies reveals that 47 percent of respondents trust Trump on immigration compared to 36 percent who trust Harris. This gap has been narrowing in recent weeks, coinciding with a sharp decline in border crossings following President Joe Biden's executive order limiting asylum claims.Harris' tougher stance on border security reflects Democrats' efforts to close this gap and shifting public attitudes towards immigration. Gallup reports that 55 percent of voters — including nearly 30 percent of Democrats — support new immigration restrictions, the highest recorded figure since 2001.The contrasting approaches to immigration policy between Harris and Trump reflect broader ideological differences between the Democratic and Republican platforms. The GOP ranks immigration as a top priority, promising to secure the border and end what they term an \"invasion.\" In contrast, the Democratic platform emphasizes reforming the asylum system and balancing enforcement with humanitarian considerations.Trump's border policies during his presidency focused on reducing unauthorized immigration, including partial construction of a border wall, expanding enforcement, and introducing stricter asylum rules. His controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy, which resulted in family separations at the southern border, was widely criticized and eventually terminated.Harris supports comprehensive immigration reform, prioritizing humanitarian protections and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including \"Dreamers.\" She advocates for modernizing legal immigration systems and framing immigration as an asset to the American economy and society.Trump and other Republicans have accused Harris of failing to act on these policies as vice president, blaming her for the rise in illegal border crossings and dubbing her Biden's \"border czar.\"During the ABC News presidential debate, Trump made unsubstantiated claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, which have been debunked. He has also promised mass deportations of migrants, a plan that has faced skepticism from Democrats and some Republicans due to logistical challenges.","summary":"The former president leads Harris by 11 points on immigration trust and promises mass deportations amid a tight race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-wisconsin-liberate-mass-migrant-invasion-1960854","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2482999/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 00:45:18","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.021},{"id":257785266,"title":"Trump greeted by chants of ‘USA,’ tosses popcorn to fans as he attends Alabama vs. Georgia football game","text":"Former President Donald Trump was welcomed by cheers from a crowd in the concourse at Bryant-Denny Stadium as he arrived for the Alabama v.

The humiliated former Tory leader, who is now trying to flog his cash-in memoirs, reveals in his new book that he is no longer convinced by what was the leading theory of what caused the pandemic - that it was transmitted from animal to human in a Wuhan wildlife meat market. Johnson, who was ousted by his own party after a series of scandals, failings and lies, is having his memoir, ‘Unleashed’, serialised in the Daily Mail, and a series of headline-grabbing claims are emerging as he tries to line his coffers, And this latest revelation sees him disagree with what he asserted was true when he was PM - that the virus that killed more than seven million people across the globe had ‘jumped species’. The remarks from the clownish failed PM are unlikely to pile any significant pressure on the secretive Chinese government to discuss the origins of the virus any more than they have so far. Johnson writes: “The awful thing about the whole Covid catastrophe is that it appears to have been entirely man-made, in all its aspects. It now looks overwhelmingly likely that the mutation was the result of some botched experiment in a Chinese lab. “Some scientists were clearly splicing bits of virus together like the witches in Macbeth – eye of bat and toe of frog – and oops, the frisky little critter jumped out of the test tube and started replicating all over the world.” Bafoonish and lying Johnson is, unsurprisingly, echoing the similarly idiotic and dishonest world leader, Donald Trump, in rejecting the idea that the Coronavirus was was transmitted 'zoonotically' from infected animals and to endorse the lab theory, which has at times been dismissed as a conspiracy theory but does have some credibility among reasonable thinkers. In previous comments, the then-PM had once said the Covid-19 outbreak was linked to what he called the “demented” belief held in some parts of Asia that “if you grind up the scales of a pangolin you will somehow become more potent”. He now claims he has grown gradually more sceptical as information supposedly emerged about experiments that were being undertaken by scientists in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and refers to the virus as caused or produced by humans. As well as this, Johnson brazenly rows back on the lockdowns he himself imposed on the British people - and then famously broke his own laws around by partying in Downing Street, the ‘ Partygate ’ scandal, that contributed to the end of his political career - after a series of exclusive exposes by the Daily Mirror . The lockdowns Johnson enforced, which are credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the UK but criticised for severely damaging the economy, are now described as “medieval in their savagery and their consequences” by the man himself. He writes that the UK fought the virus “with an ever-growing panoply of restrictions that were literally medieval in their savagery and their consequences.” He adds: “In locking down our societies, we showed that we had barely progressed since early modern England, when Shakespeare and his colleagues were repeatedly compelled by law to shutter the Globe Theatre, and when they had rules on human contact – no more than six to a funeral, for instance – that eerily prefigured some of the arcane stuff we came up with, week after week, in the Cabinet Room.” On September 19, the Mirror reported how a major international study has claimed Coronavirus began life in a \"wet market\" where there were infected animals, with scientists rejecting the populist theory that Covid was leaked from a laboratory. Genetic samples of animals that were sold at the market stalls in 2019 found traces of the Covid virus in some species. Author of the study, Kristian Andersen from Scripps Research, said in the document: \"This adds another layer to the accumulating evidence that all points to the same scenario: that infected animals were introduced into the market in mid to late November 2019, which sparked the pandemic.\" It was reported at the time that Ministers were studying intelligence about an accident at Wuhan's Institute of Virology that was suspected by some to have leaked the virus. Boffins were said to have been conducting potentially risky experiments to manipulate the transmissibility of coronaviruses taken from bats in caves. But despite the media reports, the official line remained that Covid began at the Wuhan animal market and China was never officially blamed for the outbreak. On May 1, 2023, the Mirror reported how the head of the FBI claimed a lab leak of Covid is the \"most likely\" origin of the pandemic virus . Christopher Wray, during an interview, said for the first time Covid may have originated in a \"Chinese government-controlled lab\". He said: \"The FBI has for quite some time now assessed that the origins of the pandemic are most likely a potential lab incident in Wuhan. Here you are talking about a potential leak from a Chinese government-controlled lab.\" However, the White House revealed there is no US consensus on the potential origins of the virus.","summary":"One of - if not the - worst Prime Ministers the UK has ever suffered, Boris Johnson is now trying to cash-in from his pinch-of-salt memoir 'Unleashed', and the latest extract released has the lying Tory claim he now believes Covid-19 did begin in a Chinese laboratory...","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-says-covid-begin-33777027","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32085120.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILES-BRITAIN-HEALTH-VIRUS-INQUIRY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-29 00:06:52","author":"Joseph Wilkes","authors":["Joseph Wilkes"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":257784214,"title":"Trump falsely calls Harris ‘mentally impaired,’ prompting criticism","text":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’s mental capacity Saturday, falsely claiming she was born “mentally impaired” and comparing her actions to that of a “a mentally disabled person.” The remarks prompted criticism from advocates for people with disabilities.

Trump continued to push the idea that if he doesn’t win the election, “you’re gonna lose your culture.” Railing against migrants and the border has been central to Trump’s campaign, though on Saturday he ramped up the rhetoric to focus primarily on tapping into unsubstantiated fears of a “mass migrant invasion.” He appeared before a backdrop that featured the words “Deport Illegals Now” and “End Migrant Crime” emblazoned in several places across it. Trump claimed that President Joe Biden and vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris were both mentally challenged. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired,” he claimed. “Kamala was born that way. And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.” He added under the Biden-Harris administration, there have been more terrorists entering the United States. “We have the some of the greatest terrorists in the world, in our country right now,” he said. This claim has been debunked, however. Trump played on fear-mongering to a small-town crowd in Wisconsin, where he claimed criminal migrants are running rampant. “You’re talking about areas of the Midwest where they’re becoming famous because they’re being occupied, and this is hundreds of little cities and little towns — they’re petrified, and their law enforcement is petrified. You have a sheriff and a deputy, or you have a small group, and you’ll have a group of Venezuelan killers, street gangs occupying the town with MK-47s,” he claimed (he probably meant AK-47s). “I know that gun very well,” he continued. “I got to know it very well. I’ve become an expert on guns quickly.” He also once again brought up Springfield, Ohio, where he and his running mate, J.D. Vance, have for weeks pushed baseless lies about the city’s Haitian immigrants, most of whom are in the United States legally. On Saturday, he claimed: “In Ohio, Springfield, they can’t speak English. They’re taking over the schools. There’s nobody that can speak English, and the mayor is looking for interpreters.” “These are vicious monsters in our government that are also stupid people,” Trump said, referring to the current administration. “They are vicious, but they are stupid, which is a very dangerous combination. Today, I stand before you to make this promise. I will liberate Wisconsin from this mass migrant invasion of murderers, rapists, hoodlums, drug dealers, thugs and vicious gang members. We are going to liberate our country. I will liberate our nation. Our nation will be free again if we win this election,” he said. Wisconsin is a pivotal battleground state in the election and a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll finds Trump and Harris running neck and neck, with Trump garnering 47 percent and Harris winning 49 percent of voters if the election were to be held now. Trump will hold his next rally tomorrow, Sept. 29, in Erie, Pennsylvania.","summary":"The former president claimed areas of the Midwest are being “occupied” by migrants with “MK-47s”","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-harris-mentally-disabled-anti-migrant-rally-rant-1235115667/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DonaldTrumpWisconsin-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 23:51:45","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":257783684,"title":"Adam Boulton: JD Vance v Tim Walz – why the vice presidential debate could sway US election","text":"TV debates have mattered more than ever before in this year’s US presidential election. President Joe Biden’s pitiful performance on 27 June effectively knocked the incumbent out of the race for the White House. Then on 10 September Biden’s replacement, vice president Kamala Harris, proved she is a real contender, baiting her opponent Donald Trump into wild statements such as “they’re eating the pets!”. The Democrats have recovered in the polls since Harris took over the nomination, including in so-called swing states, to the point that she is now narrow favourite to beat Trump, according to some respected analysts. Others still reckon the Republican Trump will be re-elected. Either way, all agree the contest is on a knife edge with voting already under way in a handful of less populated states, and opening next week in Illinois. With things so close, the televised debate next Tuesday could even tip the balance. “All the needle needs to be moved is 0.1% in either direction, and that could be the difference in four or five states,” according to Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist. 👉 Click here to follow the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts👈 Harris and Trump will not be on stage. This latest debate in CBS studios in New York City on 1 October is between their running mates, JD Vance and Tim Walz. In most years vice presidential debates are sideshows which have little impact on the voters. Not this year. The rise of Harris to presidential candidate has shown Americans that VPs are important. Just as Trump had to scramble to find a new running mate following stinging condemnation from Mike Pence, the man who served as his vice president for four years. Adding to the excitement, the two men who will be facing off this week are also the best phrase-makers in this campaign. Vance wrote bestselling book Hillbilly Elegy, based on his rough upbringing in the Appalachians. He likes to launch sweeping attacks on his foes, including dismissing Democratic women as “childless cat ladies”. Taylor Swift embraced this jibe for herself in her recent post endorsing Harris. Walz probably owes his place on the ticket to the single word “weird”, which he spent the summer sticking on Trump and Vance to devastating effect in multiple media interviews on behalf of the Democratic campaign. The confrontation between the two men promises to be spicy. There is a generation gap between them. Walz is 60. Vance is 20 years younger. Walz likes to present himself as a folksy centrist dad. In The Manual, a signature campaign commercial, Walz sets about fixing his old car, “a ’79 International Harvester Scout”, while likening it to creating an opportunity economy for all. He is also a veteran democratic politician having served 12 years in Washington in the US House of Representatives before being elected Governor of Minnesota in 2018, the post he still holds. Vance’s career has been meteoric. Four years in US Marine Corps provided his ladder to university. Then he became a corporate lawyer for investment firms. Following the success of his book, his backers included the controversial tech titans Peter Thiel, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen. After a lightning campaign in 2022, he is currently a first-term Republican US Senator for Ohio. Read more:Who is JD Vance?Analysis: Why Harris picked Walz Both men served in the military in non-combat roles. Vance was a journalist in uniform during his four years which included deployment to Iraq. Walz belonged to the Minnesota National Guard for 24 years. The Harris campaign admitted he “misspoke” when he described assault rifles as “weapons of war that I carried in war”. The two “VP picks” share archetypal middle-American backgrounds, Nebraska and Minnesota for Walz and Kentucky and Ohio for Vance, which were major factors in why they were chosen as running mates. Harris is from California, Trump from New York City and Florida, all of which are regarded as coastal fleshpots by citizens in “flyover states”. Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona; the main candidates are all concentrating their campaigning on the battleground states – those most likely to “flip” decisively for one party or another, delivering a majority in the electoral college. This weekend Walz has set up his debate camp in Michigan. In between mock debates in which the Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg is standing in for Vance, Walz will meet and greet the locals in the bayside resort of Harbor Springs. Conveniently there is a “Festival of the Book” taking place which will allow Walz to strut his stuff as a school teacher. Vance has called up US representative Tom Emmer from Walz’s home state for his prep. The House majority whip should know where his old foe’s vulnerabilities lie. This debate will not be relaxed. Unusually for a vice presidential encounter, the protagonists will not be sitting down, they will be standing at lecterns. The last time that happened was 2008 with Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. As with the other debates this year, the Presidential Debates Commission has not been called upon to organise this one. The two sides agreed their own rules with the broadcaster. This time there will be no studio audience, once again, and two moderators: CBS presenters news anchor Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan of Meet The Press. As Harris continues to challenge Trump to another debate without success, Vance has countered in advance demanding a second debate with Walz on 18 October. The Democrat is acting modest, protesting of Vance “he’s a Yale Law guy. I’m public school teacher”. Walz hopes to play the part of a schoolmaster chiding a tearaway pupil. He will do well if he can emulate Lloyd Bentsen’s crushing put down of the younger Dan Quayle in their 1988 vice presidential debate: “I knew Jack Kennedy. You’re no Jack Kennedy.” Walz has fertile territory to exploit. JD Vance has already had to eat many of his wilder statements. He once likened his boss Trump to “Hitler”. For electoral reasons he has U-turned on his book’s thesis that his fellow poor whites were to blame for their own fecklessness. Republican strategists hope that Vance will counter Walz’s rebukes over sexism and abortion by sticking to mainstream issues such as inflation and immigration. Vance can boast a nuanced personal record on some social issues including healthcare. But he is also pugnacious and may be unable to resist going after Walz aggressively for what Republicans regard as his left-wing voting record. Trump’s groundless claims that Harris is “a communist” seem to be impressing Hispanic voters. Walz has more to lose and Vance has more to prove in the debate. Harris has embraced her choice of Walz, notably by appearing with him for her first major TV interview. Trump barely mentions Vance at his rallies. In opinion polls Walz has net approval ratings of 10%, Vance is at around minus 35%. Debates are proving their value in this election year. Americans are paying increasing attention to them. 51.3 million tuned in to Biden/Trump earlier in the summer, 67.1 million watched Harris/Trump earlier this month. An outcome on Tuesday night as vivid as in the two previous debates this year could well be a defining moment for the next presidency. On the other hand, both veteran Democrats and Republicans will also remember that while Lloyd Bentsen smashed the debate, George H W Bush and Dan Quayle won the election.","summary":"TV debates have mattered more than ever before in this year&#8217;s US presidential election.

Per the tour’s organizers, portraying Trump in the nude “is intentional, serving as a bold statement on transparency, vulnerability, and the public personas of political figures.” They also aim to spark conversation about “transparency—or lack thereof—in politics, challenging viewers to think critically about political influence,” according to press materials. Those who can’t make it to Las Vegas will have opportunity to see it on tour stops at other locations across the United States. Dates and cities for the tour have not yet been announced. We’ll keep you posted. Enjoy — or ‘enjoy’ — some photos of the project below: This isn’t the first time a nude statute of Trump has appeared in public, though it certainly dwarfs its predecessor.

The former president insulted Harris as he ranted about illegal border crossings, describing her as ‘mentally impaired.’ ‘Kamala is mentally impaired. If a Republican did what she did that Republican would be impeached and removed from office and rightfully so for high crimes and misdemeanors,’ Trump began. Trump claimed the Democratic nominee was responsible for migrants who have come into the country illegally and have committed crimes. ‘Think of it – 13,099 convicted murderers. They’re all our country now. And I’ve been saying this for three years. She let in rapists, gang members, drug dealers, child predators and traffickers in women,’ he ranted. ‘Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala was born that way. She was born that way,’ Trump repeated. ‘And if you think about it only a mentally disabled person could have allowed this to happen to our country.’ Trump’s comments come amid a torrent of racist and sexist attacks from him and his allies against Harris, the first woman and first black and South Asian person to serve as U.S. vice president. Trump has called Harris ‘crazy,’ ‘nuts’ and ‘dumb as a rock,’ and claimed that the Jamaican-Indian vice president previously downplayed her black heritage. Last month he came under fire for sharing a post suggesting his opponent was only successful because of a ‘blowjob.’ The original comment was made by another Truth Social media user, who wrote, below a picture of Harris and Trump’s 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton: “Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently…” Trump, meanwhile, inherited significant wealth from his father, Fred Trump, a successful New York real estate developer. While Trump expanded his business, he faced financial challenges, with six of his companies filing for bankruptcy between 1991 and 2009, mainly in the casino industry. The bankruptcies were used to restructure debt, never affecting his personal finances directly. Trump has often claimed success in real estate and branding despite these setbacks while the true extent of his wealth remains a subject of debate. One thing Trump is not short of is insults and nicknames. Last month he took another thinly veiled jab at Harris as he described himself as ‘better looking’. Trump, 78, began musing on Harris’ recent image on the cover of Time magazine, which he has previously compared to his wife Melania. ‘I am much better looking than her,’ Trump said, drawing laughs from the crowd. ‘I’m a better looking person than Kamala.’ During Saturday’s rally Trump added that Harris could never be forgiven for ‘erasing our border.’ ‘She must never be allowed to become president of the United States,’ he went on. ‘She’s letting in people who are going to walk into your house, break into your door,’ he said. Trump also professed to not understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, Trump separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended. The former president is hoping frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as ‘poisoning the blood of the country’ and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. ‘I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,’ he said. ‘We’re going to liberate the country.’ Trump has repeatedly portrayed migrants as criminals and blamed Harris for failing to stem an unprecedented surge in illegal immigration, although border crossings fell since President Joe Biden instituted an executive order limiting asylum claims. Democrats, in turn, have blamed Trump for persuading allies in Congress to kill bipartisan legislation that would have funded more border agents and given the Homeland Security secretary authority to prohibit entry for most people over a daily limit. On the Wisconsin rally stage with Trump were three mugshots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have held up the story of Coronel Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. Police Chief Kyle Teynor posted statements on Facebook saying that Coronel Zarate is not a U.S. citizen and that he had two fake immigration documents, including a fake Social Security card. The chief added that Coronel Zarate’s tattoos indicate he’s affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which started in Venezuelan prisons and is posing a growing threat in the U.S.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump hurled his worst slur yet at Vice President Kamala Harris while&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump, 78, makes offensive remark about Kamala Harris as November election nears first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-78-makes-offensive-remark-about-kamala-harris-as-november-election-nears/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/28/23/90224659-0-image-m-9_1727561907936.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 23:16:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":257782998,"title":"Giant Naked Donald Trump Statue Stands on Las Vegas Freeway at 43 Feet Tall","text":"The 2024 presidential election just gets weirder and weirder … ’cause a statue of Donald Trump is towering over Las Vegas — depicting the former prez in his birthday suit.

It’s the latest of a handful of fake images that Trump has recently shared. The picture claiming to be Diddy, flanked by Harris and another woman, is actually a picture from 2001. And the man in the middle of the real image is talk show host Montel Williams, whom Harris dated at that time. The other woman is Ashley Williams, Montel Williams' daughter. The picture showed up online shortly after Diddy was indicted on a long list of charges, including racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking by force and transportation to engage in prostitution. Trump posted the image Friday on his Truth Social site and wrote: “Kamala, doing the Diddy?” the text read. “Madam Vice President, have you ever been involved with or engaged in one of Puff Daddies freak offs?” Trump later deleted the post. Both candidates have crossed paths with Diddy. In 2020 on her X account, Harris thanked him for hosting a town hall about the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities. \"Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night,” the post read. “There's a lot at stake for our communities right now, and it's critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.\" Trump and Diddy have interacted many times over the years, including Trump attending Diddy’s 29th birthday party in 1998. “Donald Trump is a friend of mine, and he works very hard,” Diddy told the Washington Post in 2015.

The last presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris was marked by numerous arguments and counter-arguments, but much of the discussion focused on economics and how each candidate plans to address the aspirations, ambitions, and dreams of the American people. There is a perception that, because Trump is being funded by major corporations and is supported by the White Protestants and Catholics, he is likely to succeed in this election. Historically, the US business leaders have consistently supported Republicans. Between 2007 and 2017, 57% of the CEOs of S&P 1500 companies contributed politically to the Republican Party, 19% gave to the Democrats, and the rest split their contributions between the two parties. In fact, big businesses support Trump’s plan to cut corporate taxes although are wary of his proposal to increase tariffs. The business group also appears to oppose Harris’s proposal to address price gouging, which seeks to implement a law that would prevent grocery and pharmaceutical companies from raising prices beyond a certain limit. Harris aims to diminish the influence of big businesses backing the Republicans by reaching out to smaller businesses and consumers. For the small businesses she wants to give tax break of $50,000. For the consumers Harris has proposed increasing tax breaks for families with children, providing more affordable care for the elderly, and offering credits to first-time home buyers, among other initiatives. The average cost of childcare is approximately $11,582 per year. The cost of childcare has risen nearly twice as fast as the inflation rate, largely due to a labour shortage in the sector. The higher cost of childcare has implications for inter-regional mobility. Many working families prefer to stay in the same neighbourhood as their parents due to this cost, even if it means passing up better-paid jobs in other states. In this regard, Harris’s promise of a $6,000 tax cut for families with newborns and the assurance that no one earning under $400,000 will face a tax increase will help support the American middle class. Harris also promises to build 3 million new homes over four years and provide up to $25,000 in assistance to first-time buyers. This move is designed to increase housing availability and help contain inflationary pressures in the real estate market. However, historical evidence suggests it is not easy to build houses in the US. The housing market is tightly regulated. Studies pointed out stringent zoning regulations, such as height limitations and historical site preservation, increased housing costs in New York City by an average of 50 percent. In 2021, in the US, there was a shortage of 7.3 million affordable homes and rental units, an increase of 500,000 from just two years earlier. And the situation is deteriorating largely due to a group of “Not in My Backyard (NIMBY)” supporters who believe that increasing residential development will erode the openness, privacy, and exclusivity of their neighbourhoods. NIMBYs are motivated by concerns that kids will no longer be able to play in the streets, that increased traffic will disrupt suburban life, and that schools will become overcrowded with new students. The legislators seem to be yielding to the anxiety of their suburban constituents and a smaller yet vocal group of NIMBYs who oppose development in New York City. This issue regarding residential housing will be a tough challenge to address, even if Harris wins the election. Immigration affects businesses, society, and employment opportunities. Trump has repeatedly pledged that, if re-elected, he will implement “the largest domestic deportation operation in history”. Trump criticized the Biden-Harris administration for being lenient on immigration, claiming that their policies have allowed “terrorists,” “criminals,” and “drug dealers” to enter the US. Additionally, a more liberal approach to immigration contradicts Trump’s own “America First” policy. It may be common perception that the migrants might take away jobs and lead to unemployment issues. However, this may not always be the case. Whether for high-skilled or low-skilled positions, the US has a historical record of effectively utilizing foreign migrant labour without significantly displacing native workers and increasing the wage. A recent analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that employers could add 160,000 to 200,000 jobs per month this year without significantly leading to a rise in wage or price inflation. The June 2024 unemployment rate of 4.5% is considered low by historical standards. Inflation has dropped below 3%, down from a high of 9.1% in mid-2022. A study at the Yale University found that without immigration, the labour force would have decreased by about 1.2 million people from 2019 to the end of 2023 due to population aging. The nation’s aging population are leading to labour shortages in some industries and may result in a smaller workforce paying taxes to support federal programs like Social Security and Medicare. Take for example, the State of Maine in the East Coast. With a median age of 45.1, Maine has the oldest population of any U.S. state. Maine is known for its abundance of lobsters and its large older population, many of whom are increasingly unable or unwilling to catch, clean, and sell these crustaceans, which constitute a $1 billion industry for the state. As a result, companies are turning to foreign-born workers to fill the gap. As the US as a nation ages overall, Maine provides a glimpse into the potential economic impact and highlights the crucial role that low-skilled immigrants are likely to play in filling the labour market gaps created by the retirement of native-born workers. While the influx may present near-term challenges, it is also enhancing the American economy’s potential. Employers are able to hire more quickly, thanks in part to the influx of labour. The Congressional Budget Office has revised its population and economic growth projections for the next decade upward, reflecting the positive impact of this new wave of newcomers. Immigration could help reduce the federal deficit by stimulating economic growth and expanding the working-age tax base. Data suggests that immigration has contributed to a growth of 1 million in the labour force, annually. Job growth has been strongest in childcare, leisure, hospitality, and construction and most part of the labour requirements are complemented by the migrant workers. Slower growth in Japan and Continental Europe can be attributed to an aging population and historically a restrictive immigration policy. As populations in wealthier nations age, GDP growth tends to slow, support costs rise, and government budgets come under increased pressure. Many empirical studies have found that GDP growth slows roughly one to one with declines in labour force and population growth. Viewed through this lens, the US’s openness to labour immigration has helped maintain the US consumption — a key component of GDP.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump meandered Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic opponent to illegal border crossings. A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for “erasing our border.” “I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,” he said. “We’re going to liberate the country.” Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as “poisoning the blood of the country” and vowed to stage the largest deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling immigration. Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris’ father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden’s, and a fly that was buzzing near him. “I wonder where the fly came from,” he said. “Two years ago, I wouldn’t have had a fly up here. You’re changing rapidly. But we can’t take it any longer. We can’t take it any longer.” Trump repeatedly brought up Harris’ Friday event in Douglas, Arizona, where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond Biden’s executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced Trump’s handling of the border while president and his opposing a bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump “prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” “I had to sit there and listen” to Harris last night Trump said, eliciting cheers. “And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be allowed to put it on. It’s all lies. Everything she says is lies.” The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against Harris, insulting her as “mentally impaired” and a “disaster.” Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his administration, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own party. On either side of the stage with Trump were poster-sized mug shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech. Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on Sept. 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment. Police Chief Kyle Teynor posted statements on Facebook saying that Coronel Zarate is not a U.S. citizen and that he had two fake immigration documents, including a fake Social Security card. The chief added that Coronel Zarate’s tattoos indicate he’s affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang, which started in Venezuelan prisons and is posing a growing threat in the U.S. Speaking to the crowd Saturday, Teynor stressed to the crowd that Coronel Zarate is the only Venezuelan gang member his agency has encountered, but the violence his two alleged victims suffered at his hands earlier this month was very real. Republicans including U.S. Sen. Derrick Van Orden, who is from Prairie du Chien, have criticized authorities in both Minneapolis and Madison for letting Coronel Zarate go, saying they essentially allowed him to attack the woman in Prairie du Chien. They have accused both jurisdictions of being sanctuaries for people in the country illegally. Van Orden told the crowd Trump was the only one who could restore order. “You’re going to see the one man who has enough strength and courage of conviction to stand up to anyone up to and including being shot in the head for us,” he said.","summary":"PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wis.

The former president made the false assertions to a room of supporters in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, seemingly as a way to undermine Harris’s leadership on immigration. “Joe Biden became mentally impaired. Kamala, was born that way,” Trump said to the audience, who erupted into laughter. “She was born that way.” The former president continued: “And if you think about it, only a mentally disabled person could’ve allowed this to happen to our country. Anybody would know this.” The “this” Trump was referring to is the influx of migrants who have come into the United States over the last year. A pillar of Trump’s campaign is blaming Harris for migrant crossings by falsely claiming it was her responsibility as vice president to tackle the issue. Multiple Biden administration officials have said that Harris was only tasked with understanding the root cause of mass migration in Central American countries and leading diplomatic efforts to reduce those causes. Maria Town, the president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities, said Trump’s language was “ableist.” \"Donald Trump’s ableist comments today say far more about him and his inaccurate, hateful biases against disabled people than it does about Vice President Harris, or any person with a disability,” she said in a statment. “Trump holds the ableist, false belief that if a person has a disability, they are less human and less worthy of dignity. AAPD continues to call for the leadership of both parties in the 2024 election to condemn the use of ableist language like Trump used today. Town reminded people that multiple former presidents lived or are living with a disability. Franklin Delano Roosevelt survived polio and used a wheelchair. John F. Kennedy had Addison’s disease, ulcerative colitis and chronic pain. Ronald Reagan had a hearing impairment and President Joe Biden has a stutter. “The presence or absence of disability alone is wholly insufficient to determine a person’s fitness to hold elected office,” Town added. The former president spent much of his hour-long rally on Saturday evening insulting Harris – a common occurrence in his recent speeches. He called her “incompetent” and “a bad person” and claimed her speech from the border on Friday evening was “bulls****.” The Independent has asked the Harris campaign for comment.","summary":"Trump attacked Harris for her immigration policies and invoked ‘abelist’ language to do so","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-wisconsin-rally-speech-harris-mentally-impaired-b2620652.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/28/22/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VL7CHLfe-APg7GJgG.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:41:40","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.09},{"id":257781566,"title":"Trump debuts new product line: Watches selling for up to $100,000","text":"Donald Trump announced a new merchandise line on Thursday: A line of watches selling for up to $100,000 each. In a Truth Social post, the former president described the timepieces as “truly special” and suggested one “would make a great Christmas gift.” The bespoke watches are the latest merchandise effort from Trump, who has licensed his name for use with a number of products in recent months, ranging from “Never Surrender High-Tops” for $499 a pair to new “President Donald J. Trump First Edition” silver coins selling for $100 each. The Trump watch line is offering two models, dubbed the Trump Victory Tourbillon and the Fight Fight Fight Watch. The Tourbillon watch is “almost entirely” crafted from 18 carat gold and includes 122 diamonds, according to the Trump watch website. It also includes a tourbillon mechanism, a high-end component that is designed to improve a watch’s accuracy, and carries a $100,000 price tag. The stiff price is in line with the cost of many tourbillon watches, which often fetch six figures and higher. The site says it’s only selling 147 of the Victory Tourbillon model, which has a “Swiss made” stamp on its face. The Fight Fight Fight watch sells for between $500 and $800, depending on the color, and is gold-plated, the site says. “[Y]ou will stand out for all the right reasons” with the Trump Victory Tourbillon watch, the site says. “The Trump Victory Tourbillon is designed to counteract the effect of gravity. You’ll be wearing the absolute statement of success.” It’s unclear where the watches are being manufactured or the maker, with the website only noting that the Trump timepieces “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” A company called TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC, which is licensing Trump’s name for the watches, lists its address as a suite located in a building in Sheridan, Wyoming, the same address as the company selling Trump’s $499 sneakers. The suite is near a Wendy’s fast-food location and Sherwin-Williams paint store. TheBestWatchesonEarth didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

While speaking at an event in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, on Saturday, Trump mentioned Harris’s recent visit near the border in Douglas, Arizona, on Friday. During a speech from Arizona, Harris cast blame on Trump for doing “nothing to fix” the broken immigration system in the U.S. “Last night, after four straight years of obliterating our border, I watched this show that she put on,” Trump said. “Four years of the most incompetent border anywhere in the world in history, Kamala Harris traveled to the scene. In fact, she stood near where I put up border wall, that was her backdrop.” “And, in one of the most heinous crimes ever committed by any administration in American history, that’s what she did by allowing these millions of people. Millions and millions of people to come through our border and make our civilization very unsafe. It’s a civilization, very, very, unsafe. It’s a heritage,” Trump added. “Border czar Harris went to the border to lie in the most shameless and horrible way possible, at the very site where she released so much suffering, misery and death.” While news outlets such as the New York Times have tried to paint Harris as projecting a tough approach to the border, Harris recently released, according to Breitbart’s Neil Munro, an “economic plan that assumes a loose border inflow of low-wage migrant workers, government-aided migrant consumers, and room-sharing migrant renters.” Included in Harris’s 2024 campaign promises were pledges to provide illegal aliens with amnesty, and to increase the flow of migrants into the U.S. As Breitbart News’s John Binder previously reported, during a recent interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, Harris was asked what her administration would do for communities that had “taken in many” migrants. Harris referenced bipartisan legislation from Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) that would increase immigration levels in the U.S., “codify the administration’s parole pipeline for migrants,” and would “expedite work permits” for illegal migrants coming to the southern border. A report released by the House Homeland Security Committee found that under the Biden-Harris administration, nearly eight million migrants had been welcomed in the U.S. The report also found that over 85 percent of migrants who had arrived at the southern border were being released into the U.S.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Vice President Kamala Harris's recent visit to the border, noting that it came after \"four straight years of obliterating\" the United States border.\n\n\nThe post Trump Slams Kamala Harris Visit to Border &#8216;After Four Straight Years of Obliterating&#8217; It appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-slams-kamala-harris-visit-to-border-after-four-straight-years-of-obliterating-it/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Kamala-Harriss-Border-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:30:00","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":257782226,"title":"Megyn Kelly Applauds Donald Trump’s ‘Smart’ Comment About 'Hate' for Taylor Swift","text":"Donald Trump's latest harsh comment regarding Taylor Swift is, according to Megyn Kelly, in line with a strategically astute tactic. During Thursday's broadcast of The Megyn Kelly Show (which aired on September 26), the former Fox News anchor was addressing a fan's criticism; the caller had termed Trump's 'I hate Taylor Swift!' statement on Truth Social as 'childish and petty.' As reported by The Daily Beast, Kelly, while disagreeing, stated, \"You could argue it was actually smart of Trump to attack her. Just telegraph to the MAGA faithful—or adjacent—who hadn’t heard about the endorsement that Taylor sucks. We don’t like Taylor.\" Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris during a presidential debate on September 10 prompted many in the MAGA group, including Kelly, to respond strongly. Swift and her boyfriend Travis Kelce were characterized by Kelly as the 'epitomes of elite snobs' on the September 11 edition of The Megyn Kelly Show, when Kelly maintained her critical diatribe. Kelly added, \"They both have gazillions of dollars. She doesn’t care what happens to these kids, just like he doesn’t give a s**t what happens to all the young men who take the Pfizer booster he’s been pushing on them.\" Kelly also stressed that Republicans should trust Trump's gut when it comes to branding and marketing. For those who may not know, Swift expressed her support for the vice president in an Instagram post that was published soon after the debate between Harris and former president Trump on September 10. Swift declared her allegiance to Harris in an Instagram post, \" I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades. I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice.\" Nevertheless, a recent survey shows that the megastar's right-leaning fan base has drastically diminished since she endorsed Vice President Harris. According to a study that was issued by NBC News, over 47% of Republicans have an unfavorable opinion of Swift. Compared to last November, when 26% of Republicans had a negative impression of Swift, this is an increase of almost 20%. According to NBC, only 12% of Republicans felt the same way about the 34-year-old Grammy Award winner as last year, when 28% said they had a good impression of Swift. Furthermore, according to the poll, Swift's public support for Harris caused Democrats to have somewhat more positive opinions of the singer. Swift's favorability among Democrats increased to 58% in the September survey from 53% in the previous year.","summary":"Following the pop star&#39;s support of Kamala Harris earlier this month, the former Fox News presenter wasted no time in expressing her own contempt.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/megyn-kelly-applauds-donald-trumps-smart-comment-about-hate-for-taylor-swift","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/717838/uploads/2d8ff960-7d84-11ef-b646-83383586a2f8_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:15:16","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.178},{"id":257784138,"title":"VIDEO -- 'She Should Be Prosecuted': Trump Blasts Pelosi over Husband's Visa Stock Trades Prior to DOJ Lawsuit","text":"Former President Donald Trump took a firm stance on Thursday against Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) regarding her husband’s Visa stock trades. Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris (D) for the White House in 2024, said he believes the former House speaker should be prosecuted, the New York Post reported on Friday. His comments came during a press conference at Trump Tower in New York: Nancy Pelosi has a little problem because her husband sold their Visa stock. They had a lot of Visa stock, one day before Visa, it was announced that Visa is being sued by the Department of Justice. Think of that. Nancy Pelosi sold vast amounts of Visa stock one day before the big lawsuit that we all read about a few days ago, was brought against Visa. You think it was luck? … Nancy Pelosi should be prosecuted for that. The Post cited financial disclosures which show that Pelosi’s husband, Paul, “unloaded 2,000 shares of Visa stock worth between $500,000 and $1 million on July 1,” noting that on Tuesday, “less than three months after the massive transaction, Visa was hit with a DOJ lawsuit alleging that the company illegally monopolized the debit card market.” Schweizer and the late Andrew Breitbart worked to ban members of Congress from using nonpublic information to their own profit via the STOCK (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge) Act, Breitbart News reported in March 2012. “The STOCK Act will make it illegal for members of Congress and their staffs to use material, nonpublic information to inform their private investments and will impose more rigorous public disclosure requirements on all trades by lawmakers,” the article said. In March 2024 Breitbart News reported that research showing politicians made trades worth over $1 billion in 2023 bolstered a campaign to ban members of Congress from stock trading. “‘Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,’ a spokesperson for Nancy told The Post earlier this week,” the outlet reported.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump took a firm stance on Thursday against Rep.

There has been reporting from Ecuador to Spain about how migrants will react to the November contest. Trump has been much tougher and outspoke about how he wants to secure the U.S.-Mexico border while Vice President Kamala Harris has just recently proposed support for the wall after previously calling it anti-American. ‘Migrants see risks with Trump’s return’ one Mexican article published September 20 was titled. Another referenced Ecuadorian migrants’ desire to see Vice President Kamala Harris win, who they describe as making them feel more ‘reassured’ they could stay in the U.S. longer. The Mexican outlet El Imparcial wrote: ‘A potential victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump in the race for the presidency of the United States would toughen immigration procedures, said the specialist in Immigration Law and International Law, Josefina Orozco.’ ‘Immigrants who are in the United States with a status that could lead to their deportation’ may then become ‘vulnerable,’ it continued. Harris has supported positions like ignoring deportation requirements and has been against, what she has called, the ‘un-American’ U.S.-Mexico wall. However, during a trip to the border in Arizona Friday the Democratic presidential candidate vowed to spend millions on the barrier if elected. Still, Harris and Biden have overseen the largest influx of illegal immigration in years with some 10 million migrant encounters being expected later this year according to the House Homeland Security Committee. Spanish outlet Diario Publico reported over the summer in Tijuana, Mexico, that migrants there were concerned that Trump would end the Biden-Harris administration’s migrant screening phone app – CBP One – that can help facilitate flights into the U.S. The app has been helpful in facilitating tens of thousands of migrants into the U.S. At times 30,000 migrants a month have been allowed to fly into the U.S. from select countries using the app. ‘Concern grows among migrants on the US-Mexico border over a possible Trump victory,’ the report said. Ecuadorian agency La Republica, wrote on September 1 individuals ‘stranded at the border with the United States and Mexico’ and those migrants who have made it into the U.S. are worried ‘that their trip will be cut short,’ under Trump’s policies. They reported these migrants inside and heading toward the U.S. ‘feel ‘reassured’ that with Harris they could stay in the country a little longer than under the new Trump administration, which ordered the deportation of a million migrants as soon as he steps into the White House.’ Additionally, a July report from the Associated Press uncovered that migrants in Mexico wanting to illegally cross into the U.S. wanted to get there before the election. The sprint was on for these migrants ‘for fear that the border would be closed in the event of a Trump victory,’ it said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNews dispatches from Latin America indicate that migrants who hope to cross&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Migrant Support for Kamala Harris Over Donald Trump Alleged in Latin American Reports first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/migrant-support-for-kamala-harris-over-donald-trump-alleged-in-latin-american-reports/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Migrants-want-Kamala-Harris-to-beat-Donald.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:02:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.019},{"id":257779960,"title":"Dow sets record as Wall Street drifts to the finish of another winning week","text":"NEW YORK (AP) – United States (US) stocks closed another record-setting week with a muted performance on Friday, as hope built on Wall Street that the US economy can manage the rare feat of suppressing high inflation without causing a recession. The S&P 500 edged down by 0.1 per cent from its all-time high set the day before, its 42nd of the year so far. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137 points, or 0.3 per cent, to set its own record, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.4 per cent. Treasury yields eased in the bond market after a report showed inflation slowed in August by a bit more than economists expected. It echoed similar numbers from earlier in the month about inflation, but Friday’s report has resonance because it’s the measure that officials at the Federal Reserve (Fed) prefer to use. For more than a year, the Fed had kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to drive inflation toward its two per cent target. Now that inflation has eased substantially from its peak two summers ago, the Fed has begun cutting rates to ease conditions for the slowing job market and prevent a recession. Of course, the risk of a downturn still looms. US employers have slowed their hiring, and the inflation report on Friday also showed growth in US consumer spending in August fell shy of economists’ expectations. That’s important because consumer spending is the main engine of the economy. Part of the shortfall may have been because incomes for Americans grew less in August than economists expected. As the Fed cuts interest rates, Americans will get lower interest payments on their savings accounts and other similar holdings. The boost that lower interest rates can give to borrowers, meanwhile, can take longer to come to fruition, “so consumption spending will likely get squeezed”, said Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management Brian Jacobsen. More encouraging data arrived later in the morning, when a report said sentiment among US consumers is stronger than economists expected. On Wall Street, Costco Wholesale fell 1.8 per cent after delivering weaker revenue in the latest quarter than analysts expected. That was even though its profit topped expectations. Another company that depends on people spending money, ski-resort operator Vail Resorts, sank 3.9 per cent after reporting a larger loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Scant snowfalls at its Australian resorts hurt its results, and it gave a forecast for profit in its upcoming fiscal year that fell short of forecasts. On the winning side of Wall Street, Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 1.6 per cent after receiving US federal approval for its new approach to treat schizophrenia in adults. Trump Media & Technology Group climbed 5.5 per cent following the first disclosure of a major investor selling its shares now that a restriction for insiders has lifted. A Florida firm owned by former contestants on The Apprentice dumped nearly all of its 5.5 per cent ownership stake in TMTG, which owns former president Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, according to a filing made with US regulators on Thursday. Trump has said he does not plan to sell any of his shares, and he owns more than half of the company, but the stock has been shaky amid speculation about whether he may. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 7.20 points to 5,738.17, but it still closed out a third straight winning week and its sixth in the last seven. The Dow rose 137.89 to 42,313.00, and the Nasdaq composite lost 70.70 to 18,119.59. Markets overseas made bigger moves, as stocks in Shanghai rallied 2.9 per cent to close their best week since 2008. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 3.6 per cent to cap its best week since 1998. They soared following a barrage of announcements through the week from China’s central bank and government in hopes of propping up the world’s second-largest economy. Investors aren’t convinced all the stimulus will ultimately succeed, but they say they’re impressed by the size of it all following earlier piecemeal efforts. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury eased to 3.75 per cent from 3.80 per cent late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for what the Fed will do with short-term rates, fell to 3.56 per cent from 3.63 per cent. Traders are betting on a 55 per cent probability the Fed will cut the federal funds rate by another half of a percentage point at its next meeting in November, according to data from CME Group. It usually moves rates by just a quarter of a percentage point.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/dow-sets-record-as-wall-street-drifts-to-the-finish-of-another-winning-week/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P11-C_29092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 22:02:52","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.093},{"id":257780812,"title":"Paul Feig recalls Donald Trump fueling female “Ghostbusters” hate: 'Everybody went f---ing cannibal'","text":"Paul Feig's 2016 Ghostbusters reboot became the target of one of the most intense misogyny campaigns in movie history — and the filmmaker thinks Donald Trump is partly to blame for it. Feig recently reflected on all the online hatred his action-comedy endured in the mid-2010s. \"The political climate of the time was really weird, with Hillary Clinton running for office in 2016,\" he recalled in a new interview with The Guardian promoting his latest film, Jackpot. \"There were a lot of dudes looking for a fight. When I was getting piled on, on Twitter, I'd go back and see who they were. So many were Trump supporters.\" Feig noted that the man who would become the U.S. president added fuel to the fire. \"Then Trump came out against us,\" he said. \"He was like: 'They're remaking Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. You can't do that. And now they're making Ghostbusters with only women. What's going on?' and got all upset.\" The Bridesmaids director continued, \"Everybody went f---ing cannibal. It turned the movie into a political statement, as if to say: 'If you're pro-women, you're going to go see this. If you're not, then …' I didn't think it mattered at all that the main characters were women, but people brought a lot of baggage.\" Feig's Ghostbusters starred his Bridesmaids collaborators Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy as two new supernatural exterminators in a universe that makes no mention of the 1984 original or its 1989 sequel. Saturday Night Live stars Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon rounded out the phantom-busting quartet, and Chris Hemsworth played their airheaded receptionist, while original Ghostbusters stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Annie Potts all made cameos as new characters. Want more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more. Feig opted to make his entry into the franchise a reboot instead of a sequel because he didn't have the full participation of the original cast. \"Bill [Murray] had publicly said he didn't want to do another Ghostbusters at that point,\" Feig recalled to The Guardian. \"Harold Ramis had died. Dan [Aykroyd] and Ernie [Hudson] were there, but half the team felt weird. It had been 30 years and Bill and the gang were so iconic; I didn't want to do anything that hurt the original movies.\" The 2016 Ghostbusters ultimately grossed around $229 million worldwide on a $144 million budget, and received a 60/100 on Metascore, a 74 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and a B+ Cinemascore. As Sony engineered the future of the franchise, the studio decided the next two installments, 2021's Ghostbusters: Afterlife and 2024's Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, would be direct sequels to the '80s movies instead of reboots or reimaginings. Both of those films made less at the box office than the 2016 version — around $204 million and $201 million, respectively — but they were more profitable due to their smaller budgets.","summary":"&#34;There were a lot of dudes looking for a fight… I&#39;d go back and see who they were.

Tickets for the event start at $500 per person, and rise to $926,300 for those who want to be listed as event chairs. The latter price point includes four tickets, a reception with Harris, a luncheon and a photo for four, according to an invite.

The visit was part of Trump's 10th trip to the battleground state, highlighting the Great Lakes State's importance in his electoral strategy.\"In the 1890s, our country was probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs,\" Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, said. \"We had a president, you know McKinley? Remember Mount McKinley? He was a very good businessman, and he took in billions of dollars at the time. We were a very wealthy country at the time.\" Mount McKinley, now officially known as Denali, was named after the 25th president.Trump's remarks came as part of a broader discussion on manufacturing and job creation in the United States. The former president who has long been an advocate for protectionist trade policies has said that implementing tariffs would help bring manufacturing jobs back to America and boost the economy.\"We need a smart series of tariffs and taxes,\" Trump told the audience, many of whom were autoworkers concerned about job security in the face of industry changes and economic pressures.However, Trump's praise for 19th-century economic policies quickly drew sharp rebuke from various corners of the internet, including historians and economic experts who challenged his characterization of McKinley's economy.Former Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Michael Steele took to X, formerly Twitter, to express his dismay at Trump's comments and wrote: \"I'm sitting here in an airport watching clips from Trump's recent rally. And I am wondering why do we continue to subject ourselves to such ignorant thinking?\"Steele, a Trump critic, also questioned why Americans \"persist in devolving to Trump's retrogressive view of America and its citizens\" and \"make excuses about and for the lies and the liar.\"Newsweek has contacted Trump's spokesperson and Steele's office via email on Saturday for comment.While tariffs can provide short-term protection for specific industries, they can also lead to increased costs for consumers and potential retaliation from trading partners. The Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated that a 20 percent tariff could raise annual costs for the average American family by $2,600 due to higher prices.T.J. Stiles, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian, disputed Trump's claims on X, writing on Friday, \"Trump is no better as a historian of the 1890s than he is of the Civil War. No, it wasn't America's wealthiest time. No, McKinley wasn't a businessman.\"Stiles pointed out that McKinley's first major tariff bill, which he authored while in Congress, \"in part cost Republicans the House & White House.\" The historian referenced the McKinley Tariff Act of 1890, which raised duties on imported goods by about 50 percent and contributed to significant political losses for the Republican Party in subsequent elections.Contrary to Trump's portrayal of the 1890s as an era of unprecedented wealth, the United States experienced a severe economic depression from 1893 to 1897. Journalist Paul Farhi noted on X on Friday that during this period, \"Banks failed; the unemployment rate was more than 10 percent for five years.\"The Depression of 1893 was one of the most severe economic downturns in American history. According to the Economic History Association, unemployment rates exceeded 10 percent for half a decade, a level of sustained high unemployment only seen again during the Great Depression of the 1930s.The economic contraction began in January 1893 and lasted until June 1894, followed by a brief period of growth. However, a second recession hit from December 1895 to June 1897. Real gross national product (GNP) fell approximately 4 percent from 1892 to 1893 and another 6 percent from 1893 to 1894. Despite a recovery in 1895, the economy contracted again by about 2.5 percent from 1895 to 1896.The impact on the average American was significant. Due to population growth of about 2 percent per year, real GNP per person didn't surpass its 1892 level until 1899. Immigration, which had averaged over 500,000 people per year in the 1880s, dropped to an average of only 270,000 from 1894 to 1898.This period was marked by violent strikes, political upheavals, and far-reaching social and intellectual developments, making the Depression of 1893 a watershed event in American history.","summary":"\"Why do we continue to subject ourselves to such ignorant thinking?\" asks ex-RNC chair Michael Steele on X.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mckinley-tariffs-1890s-ignorant-thinking-michael-steele-1960800","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2482977/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:57:54","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.094},{"id":257784036,"title":"Exclusive–Vance Spokesman: Teamsters Rank-and-File Know Workers Were 'Better Off' Under Trump","text":"Rank-and-file Teamsters know that “American workers were safer and better off” under former President Donald Trump’s administration, William Martin, a spokesman for Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), told Breitbart News. Internal polling from the Teamsters shows that he is dominating the presidential race against Vice President Kamala Harris among the rank-and-file members. Nearly 60 percent of Teamsters sampled in a September 9-15 poll support Trump, while a mere 31 percent back Harris. Moreover, Trump leads Harris with Teamsters members in every single state. “It’s no wonder that rank-and-file Teamsters support President Trump – they simply reject Kamala Harris’s policies of crippling inflation, high gas and electricity prices, millions of illegal immigrants coming into our country, and fewer jobs for American workers,” Martin told Breitbart News in a statement. “Pennsylvania suffered the nation’s highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate at 8.2 percent, and Harris’s EV mandates and pro-China trade policies are undercutting workers across the country,” he added. Martin said that Teamsters will vote for Trump in spades because American workers were better off during the first Trump adminsitration than they are now. “American workers were safer and better off when President Trump was in office – rank-and-file workers know it, and that is why they will ignore their union bosses and will vote for the Trump-Vance ticket on November 5,” he said. The Teamsters have opted not to officially endorse a candidate in the race, marking the first time they have not supported a Democrat candidate for president since 1996. This is a major blow to Harris. That year, the union did not endorse anyone, with former President Bill Clinton missing out due to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Clinton had their support in 1992. However, this year’s non-endorsement is more reminiscent of 1988, when they rejected Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. The endorsement instead went to Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush, who would win 41 states in the general election.","summary":"Rank-and-file Teamsters know that \"American workers were safer and better off\" under former President Donald Trump's administration, William Martin, a spokesman for Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sen.

Al Sharpton urges Gov. Hochul not to remove Mayor Adams from office ahead of trial","text":"Rev. Al Sharpton urged Gov. Kathy Hochul Saturday to refrain from using her authority to remove Mayor Eric Adams from office — arguing that such a move would have “no precedent,” days after the governor said she is mulling her “options and obligations” in relation to the mayor’s indictment. Sharpton’s remarks are something of a shift in his recent public tenor on Adams, whose political future has grown more tenuous after the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan unsealed a five-count indictment this week, charging the mayor with bribery and fraud charges. Until Saturday morning he had been relatively quiet in his support for the mayor, whom he has vocally backed in the past as an influential ally. As one of the city's most influential Black leaders, Sharpton's words echoed from City Hall to Albany. “The governor should not be pressured into removing Eric Adams from being the mayor,” Sharpton said on Saturday during his regularly scheduled National Action Network rally. The governor has the power — under the city charter and state law — to remove the mayor, and following the charges against Adams, Hochul said she was weighing all of her options. A spokesperson for Hochul did not immediately return a request for comment. “There is no precedent for that,” Sharpton continued. “We just had a U.S. senator, Menendez, indicted. They found gold bars in his house, Mercedes Benz … He was not forced to resign until he was convicted.” The rarely used gubernatorial authority was invoked by former Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt against Mayor Jimmy Walker, who was also being investigated over corruption allegations, but Walker resigned in 1932 before Roosevelt exercised his power to remove him. Adams’ defiant approach in claiming his innocence has not sat well with some, particularly those taking issue with the mayor’s claims that he is a “target” — and his apparent suggestion, without evidence, that his communications with the federal government on the migrant crisis are to blame. Sharpton on Saturday said he did not believe the Biden administration had targeted Adams, and cautioned anyone against using such rhetoric. Sharpton told the New York Times on Thursday, the day charges were unsealed against the mayor, that he would be convening a meeting of Black leaders to discuss the situation in the coming days but acknowledged the delicate nature of the circumstances. “Does that hurt Vice President Kamala Harris? The head of the Southern District is a Black man that we work with,” Sharpton told the Times. “There’s complexities in this.” But Sharpton had taken a more decisive step toward Adams’ defense by Saturday morning. \"We're going to see where the evidence is, but we are not going to stand by silently and let Governor Hochul not know that some of us are saying: ‘Do not change the process and the precedent,’” Sharpton said. “Let due process take its course.” Sharpton was flanked by civil rights legend Rev. Herbert Daughtry who also appeared with Adams the day he was charged. While insisting Adams be allowed due process, he did briefly raise a question about the leadership ability of City Hall officials who have been buffeted by federal and state investigations. Sharpton joked during his Saturday remarks that former President Donald Trump did Adams no favors when the Republican candidate voiced his support for the mayor this week. “I do not want this to get into a contest that helps [former President Donald] Trump,” Sharpton said. “If I was facing a federal trial, the last person I want to speak up for me is somebody convicted of 34 felonies.”","summary":"A file photo of Mayor Eric Adams, Rev.

Gabbard, who made headlines for endorsing former President Donald Trump in the race against Harris in August, made the fiery X post on Saturday morning: “Shameless. No other way to describe Kamala Harris’ photo op at Southern border, promising to secure it after allowing 10+ million illegal aliens in the past 3.5 years as border czar,” she wrote. “A shameless person feels no shame because they have no conscience. That’s Kamala Harris.” Harris traveled to Douglas, Arizona — her first time at the U.S.-Mexico border in over three years — to criticize former President Donald Trump for going against the bipartisan border bill, ABC News reported. “It was the strongest border security bill we have seen in decades. It was endorsed by the Border Patrol union. And it should be in effect today, producing results in real time, right now, for our country,” she said in her speech in the border town. A closer look at some of what the bill would have done, however, does not make it look strong. As Breitbart News’s John Binder pointed out, it would have: Increased legal immigration to the United States Expedited work permits for migrants arriving at the southern border Permitted tens of thousands of border crossings every week before the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could clamp down on regions between Ports of Entry Codified the Biden-Harris administration’s parole pipeline into federal law Provided taxpayer-funded lawyers to certain Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) and mentally incompetent migrants “But Donald Trump tanked it. He picked up the phone and called some friends in Congress and said, ‘Stop the bill,’” Harris continued. “He prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future.” In a recent appearance on the Shawn Ryan Show, Gabbard lamented over the number of people who have “streamed through our borders illegally.” The illegals pose a “direct threat to us here on our own soil,” the Hawaii politician said of her own visit to the southern border.","summary":"Tulsi Gabbard called Kamala Harris's Friday visit to the southern border \"shameless\" and a \"photo op\" in a flaming social media post.\n\n\nThe post Tulsi Gabbard: Kamala Harris Is &#8216;Shameless&#8217; for Border Trip &#8216;Photo Op&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/28/tulsi-gabbard-kamala-harris-shameless-border-trip-photo-op/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Tulsi-Gabbard-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:32:50","author":"Olivia Rondeau","authors":["Olivia Rondeau"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":257781036,"title":"Video: Footage Resurfaces of Kamala Harris’s Involvement in Michael Jackson’s 2004 Case, Stirring Political Backlash","text":"IN a development that has reignited discussions on the intersection of celebrity, justice, and politics, recently resurfaced footage from a 2004 ABC segment portrays Kamala Harris, then a DA in California, in a contentious light regarding her involvement in the legal proceedings against Michael Jackson. The footage, which has sparked considerable debate across social media and political circles, shows Harris seemingly collaborating with law enforcement against the pop icon, Michael Jackson, during his highly publicized child molestation trial. The footage has been interpreted by some as an attempt by Harris to “destroy” Jackson’s life, a claim that has fueled existing narratives around her prosecutorial past. Critics, including vocal supporters of Donald Trump, who has publicly praised Jackson, have seized on this as evidence of overreach or bias by Harris, suggesting a pattern of targeting high-profile figures. The timing of this revelation could not be more politically charged. With presidential elections on the horizon, this footage has been weaponized by Trump’s campaign, painting Harris’s involvement as an example of unjust prosecution. Trump, known for his admiration of Jackson, has leveraged this incident to bolster his image as a defender of the wrongly accused, contrasting sharply with Harris’s portrayal in the footage. The public’s reaction has been mixed, with some viewing the footage as damning evidence of Harris’s prosecutorial overreach, while others call for caution, noting the complexities of legal proceedings and the need for context. Legal experts have pointed out that Harris’s comments and involvement, as shown, might not be unusual for a prosecutor but highlight the often unseen pressures and tactics employed in high-profile cases. Harris’s team has yet to provide a detailed response to this specific footage. However, her campaign has previously addressed her tenure as a prosecutor, emphasizing her commitment to justice and the rule of law, often in the face of criticism for being either too tough or not tough enough on various issues. This incident underscores the long-lasting impact of a public figure’s past actions, especially when those actions intersect with the lives of cultural icons like Michael Jackson. While Jackson was eventually acquitted of all charges, the shadow of such trials lingers, affecting public perception and political narratives years later. As this story unfolds, it serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between celebrity, justice, and politics in the American landscape. This article aims to present the facts as known from the provided information, reflecting the controversy and political implications without taking a definitive stance on the events’ morality or legality.","summary":"IN a development that has reignited discussions on the intersection of celebrity, justice, and politics, [...]","url":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/entertainment/footage-resurfaces-of-kamala-harriss-involvement-in-michael-jacksons-2004-case-stirring-political-backlash/","image":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala-Harris-comments-on-Michael-Jackson-trial-resurface-amid-Janet-Jackson-mess.jpeg","video":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/fjmpzDKQOPmODzRg.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:19:32","author":"Gdpr Cookie Consent,Staff Reporter","authors":["Gdpr Cookie Consent","Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","source_country":"zw","sentiment":0.229},{"id":257776952,"title":"ICE: More Than 425,000 Criminal Illegal Immigrants Free in US, Including 13,099 Convicted Killers","text":"Federal immigration authorities have revealed that more than 425,000 illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, including more than 13,000 individuals convicted of homicide, are currently roaming free in the United States. “The truth is clear—illegal immigrants with a criminal record are coming into our country,” Gonzales said. “The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing, and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden–Harris administration and cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies.” The letter, sent to Gonzales by ICE deputy director Patrick Lechleitner, confirms that as of July 21, there were 662,566 illegal immigrants with criminal histories on the agency’s national docket. Of these, 435,719 have been convicted of crimes, while another 226,847 face pending criminal charges. Of the total number of convicted criminals, 425,431 of them are not currently detained, meaning they remain in the United States under ICE supervision but are not held in custody. The 425,000-plus individuals on ICE’s so-called “non-detained” docket include 13,099 convicted of homicide, while another 1,845 face homicide charges. The release of the data triggered strong political reactions. Former President Donald Trump took to social media to lambast Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, for what he described as an “unvetted and unchecked” influx of dangerous criminals. If elected in November, Trump has promised to restore the border policies that were in effect under his administration, complete the wall along the southern border, “carry out the largest deportation operation in American history,” and increase penalties for illegal border crossings, among other proposals. Harris, who was tasked by Biden to address the problem of illegal immigration into the United States, has been a frequent target of criticism over her handling of the border crisis. She visited Douglas, Arizona, on Sept. 27, giving a speech in which she called for stricter asylum policies. “Those who cross our borders unlawfully will be apprehended and removed and barred from reentering for five years. We will pursue more severe criminal charges against repeat violators, and if someone does not make an asylum request at a legal point of entry and instead crosses our border unlawfully, they will be barred from receiving asylum,” Harris said, promising to implement this policy if elected. The Biden administration has defended its border policies, arguing that they balance the need for humane treatment of illegal border-crossers with the enforcement of immigration laws. Biden signed a proclamation on June 4 to suspend asylum requests from illegal immigrants once 5,000 per day had crossed the border. However, he also rescinded many of Trump’s immigration policies on his first day in office, including one that forced asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until receiving a court date from U.S. immigration.","summary":"ICE confirmed the criminal illegal immigrants are not being detained in the United States.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/ice-more-than-425000-criminal-illegal-immigrants-free-in-us-including-13099-convicted-killers-5731925","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/02/id5641985-03252024-DSC00443-ICE-DHS-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:17:04","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":257779744,"title":"Donald Trump Very Engrossed by Kennedy's Alleged Affair With Olivia Nuzzi: Report","text":"The alleged sexting between Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a new acquaintance of Donald Trump's, and Olivia Nuzzi, a reporter for a New York magazine, has reportedly become the former president's new obsession. Trump supposedly also reached out to Kennedy to learn of the facts and what went down. Additionally, the Republican nominee was also keen to post online regarding the issue. A source informer Puck News, \"[Kennedy] denied the whole thing to Trump. He said he hardly know[s] her. He said he met her one time.\" The Puck News article also claimed that Trump almost made a post on Truth Social, his social media platform about the same (\"My condolences to Ryan Lizza...'') and that the GOP frontrunner was allegedly on the verge of making a public comment about the alleged online affair. As reported by The Daily Beast, Nuzzi had breached the 'magazine's standards around conflicts of interest and disclosure' accompanied by the news of her 'personal' relationship' with Kennedy, which prompted New York magazine to place her on leave. Additionally, the outlet's statement added that had the magazine known about the connection, she would not have been permitted to continue covering the 2024 presidential race. Previously, Nuzzi told The Daily Beast that she had had 'communication' with a 'former reporting subject turned personal.' However, the relationship was 'never physical,' she said, but she still felt she should have spoken clean about it sooner and was sorry she didn't. On the other hand, Kennedy turned down Fox News' invitation to address rumors about his connection with Nuzzi this week. Nodding to what anchor Martha MacCallum called Nuzzi's 'inappropriate relationship,' she questioned, \"What do you say to your supporters who question your behavior and want to know what's going on?\" Kennedy replied, \"I never comment on those kind[s] of stories.\" Still, additional accounts have emerged suggesting that, before their alleged sexting interaction last year, Kennedy reached out and grabbed reporter Nuzzi's hand while she interviewed him, as per several eyewitnesses who told Vanity Fair that he did so when they were hiking in November 2023 for her New York Magazine article. According to The New York Post, a mutual acquaintance of the politician's claims that Nuzzi 'bombarded' him with naked photos over many months, leading to speculation that the lawyer-turned-politician may sue Nuzzi. According to Jessica Reed Kraus, a friend of Kennedy's who knows both of them, Kennedy has recently engaged security expert Gavin de Becker to probe the scandal, and a possible criminal or civil case is on the horizon. Kraus claimed Kennedy made many attempts to block Nuzzi's phone, but she persisted in sending him explicit images after he would unblock her on occasion, citing 'urgent discussions about an imminent hit piece.' Also, de Becker said, \"This had nothing to do with romance. He was being chased by porn.\"","summary":"A mutual acquaintance of Kennedy&#39;s claimed that Nuzzi &#39;bombarded&#39; him with photos over many months, leading to buzz about a potential lawsuit.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-very-engrossed-by-kennedys-alleged-affair-with-olivia-nuzzi-report","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/717807/uploads/868a53c0-7d76-11ef-9caf-4db8f3ed158c_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":257775046,"title":"Harris walks US-Mexico border as she works to project tougher stance on migration","text":"DOUGLAS (AP) – Vice President Kamala Harris walked a scrubby stretch along the United States (US)-Mexico border on Friday and called for further tightening of asylum restrictions as she sought to project a tougher stance on illegal migration and address one of her biggest vulnerabilities in the November election. Harris’ push to further restrict asylum claims moves beyond President Joe Biden’s policy on an issue where her rival, former President Donald Trump, has an edge with voters. She balanced tough talk on policing the border with calls for a better way to welcome immigrants legally. “I reject the false choice that suggests we must choose either between securing our border and creating a system that is orderly, safe and humane,” Harris said. “We can and we must do both.” In her first trip to the international boundary since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Harris chatted with local Border Patrol leaders as they strode along a rust-coloured stretch of wall built during Obama’s presidency. Later, Harris received a closed-door briefing at the Douglas port of entry on efforts to combat drug trafficking and improve the legal flow of goods and people across the border. Border Patrol agents have “a tough job” and deserve support to do it, she said. Harris’ visit was designed as a rejoinder to Trump and his fellow Republicans, who have pounded her relentlessly over the Biden administration’s record on migration and fault the vice president for spending little time visiting the border during her time in the White House. Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a record influx of asylum seekers last year. Voters favour Trump on migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the issue and defuse a key line of political attack for her opponent.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/harris-walks-us-mexico-border-as-she-works-to-project-tougher-stance-on-migration/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P19-C_29092024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 21:04:59","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.136},{"id":257776882,"title":"Trump takes stage at Wisconsin rally and continues anti-immigrant rhetoric – live","text":"In his speech, Donald Trump shifted briefly from immigration to the economy. “Your towns, your cities, your country, is being destroyed,” Trump said. “This is bigger than inflation, which is killing you all, caused by Biden and Harris with their stupid energy policy.” He shifted again to making anti-immigrant remarks. “The only things that don’t get obsolete are the wheel and the wall,” he said about the barrier he started to build on the border during his presidency, which increased migrant deaths and devastating injuries.","summary":"Former president takes pot shots at Harris and Biden and criticizes vice-president for role in border policies\n\nTim Walz paid a visit to Ann Arbor to watch a football game between the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe Democratic vice-presidential nominee was greeted at the airport by University of Michigan students, who had arrived in a bus donning a banner that read “Put Me In, Coach!”\n\n“I would always tell people in campaigns: If you want a democracy after the election, you have to have an autocracy before the election,” Carville said.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/sep/28/us-election-blog-trump-harris-walz","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9edca2463b8f136c527edc00ef75eef02d7320d4/0_31_5165_3099/master/5165.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 20:59:14","author":"Coral Murphy Marcos,Jason Wilson","authors":["Coral Murphy Marcos","Jason Wilson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":257774828,"title":"Kamala Harris Mocks Trump Again for Skipping Second Debate; Vice President Campaign Focuses on Sports-themed Ad","text":"In the final quarter before Election Day, the Vice President and her running mate are making a play for Americans in two of their favorite places – on the couch and at the big game.

Opening with the sports themed line of “winners never back down from a challenge,” the new 30-second ad calls the ex-POTUS a “loser” and taunts renowned golf cheat Trump for not agreeing to met the VP on October 25 on CNN for a second debate. As well as running the ad nationally Saturday in Week 6 of the well watched 2024 college football season, the increasingly punchy Harris-Walz campaign plan to have a “Trump’s Punting on 2nd Debate” displaying plane fly over Bryant-Denny stadium during the Bulldogs and Crimson Tide game. Trump himself is expected to be among the over 100,000 attendees at the gridiron match-up. Trump isn’t the only candidate at college ball today. Going into a debate with GOP VP nominee Sen J.D. Vance (R-OH) on October 1, Gov. Walz is at the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota face-off in n Ann Arbor Saturday. Set for an event in her old stomping ground of San Francisco,, the Veep will be in LA and Las Vegas tomorrow for an A-list packed fundraiser and a campaign rally respectively This weekend’s games aside, the Democrats hope to gain a yard or two with voters with the help of some sports legends like Magic Johnson, Billie Jean King and Calvin Johnson. Under the “Athletes for Harris” banner, the campaign has a number of initiative and ads planned for the last month of the race. AFH is to be “captained” by NBA superstar Johnson, and tennis and feminist icon King, along with Thomas Booker, Steve Kerr, Ali Krieger, Candace Parker, Doc Rivers, Dawn Staley, Ali Truwit and Chris Paul. The campaign has received endorsements from 15 Pro Football Hall of Famers Including Detroit Lion kingpin Johnson, Pittsburgh Steeler Mel Blount, and Dallas Cowboy Emmitt Smith, as well as 50 big name former HBCU players. With the polls still very close, the sports play is clearly a move right into the heart of MAGAland. Adding to that, and in search of the last bastion of big TV audiences, the well funded campaign say there will be ads and appearances by the athletes on the likes of the NFL‘s and , and the PGA Presidents Cup, and the final slate of MLB regular season games. As well , the sports superstars athletes will be deployed in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. As they say, “Game On!”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn the final quarter before Election Day, the Vice President and her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris Mocks Trump Again for Skipping Second Debate; Vice President Campaign Focuses on Sports-themed Ad first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-mocks-trump-again-for-skipping-second-debate-vice-president-campaign-focuses-on-sports-themed-ad/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-Taunts-Loser-Trump-Again-Over.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 20:55:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.385},{"id":257776784,"title":"Harris' border visit isn't just aimed at Arizona. Immigration will also sway voters in states thousands of miles away.","text":"Immigration is one of the defining issues of the 2024 election.So it was no surprise that Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday visited the US-Mexico border in Arizona, one of the most hotly-contested swing states in the country this year.Harris' visit to Douglas — a border city of about 16,000 people — was notable because it was her first visit to the southern border since the launch of her Democratic presidential campaign in late July.Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are fighting to win Arizona by rallying the state's suburban independents and its large Latino population. Harris is attacking Trump's role in tanking a bipartisan congressional immigration bill that would have overhauled the asylum system and hired more border patrol agents. And Trump wants to tie Harris to the record levels of migrant apprehensions that at various points throughout President Joe Biden's term have severely overwhelmed border patrol agents.But Harris' remarks in Douglas weren't just aimed at winning Arizona.She's out to reassure swing voters and independents across the country that she's the candidate who'll deliver on the issue.\"Stopping transnational criminal organizations and strengthening our border is not new to me, and it is a long standing priority of mine,\" she said during her address in Cochise County, a conservative-leaning jurisdiction where Trump is poised to perform well in November.However, even in battlegrounds like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — far from the southern border — voters cite immigration as a top issue. And in rural and exurban areas where Democratic candidates have to cut into GOP margins to win statewide, Harris' messaging will be crucial as she competes alongside Trump to reach the 270-electoral vote threshold for victory.In the latest New York Times/Siena College poll of likely voters in Michigan, immigration was the third most important issue for respondents, with 14% citing it as their top issue. (The economy was the top issue among likely voters overall, with 24% citing it as their most important issue, followed by abortion at 17%.)Among rural and small town voters, immigration (at 16%) ranked as their second most important issue, with only the economy coming out ahead.And among independents, immigration and abortion were tied (at 13% each) as their second most important issue. The economy was cited by 25% of likely Michigan independents as their top issue.The findings are similar in Wisconsin, where the economy is the top issue (28%) among likely voters, followed by abortion (19%) and immigration (12%).While Harris is poised to perform strongly in the Milwaukee and Detroit metropolitan areas, rural margins in Wisconsin and Michigan will be critical. In these Midwestern states — unlike the South — there remain a sizable contingent of rural voters who continue to vote Democratic on the presidential level.Harris' remarks on border security were very much aimed at these sort of voters, as many would prefer a bipartisan approach to an immigration overhaul while still enforcing existing laws. And by leaning into her experience as California's attorney general and dealing with the prosecution of drug cartels, she is seeking to turn the page from Biden's handling of the issue, which has been widely panned by voters in recent years.\"I reject the false choice that suggests we must either choose between securing our border or creating a system of immigration that is safe, orderly and humane,\" Harris said during her Friday speech. \"We can and we must do both.\"Trump's 2016 candidacy was driven by his hardline stance on immigration and his 2024 campaign has largely stuck to the same messaging.The biggest exception is that Trump used Biden's immigration stumbles to build a significant advantage over the president on the issue. But that was before Biden stepped aside as the presumptive nominee and Harris became the Democratic Party's standard-bearer.Harris has needled Trump on the issue in a way that Biden was not able to do effectively, as the president at the time was also dealing with high apprehensions at the border and migrants being sent by Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott to cities like Chicago and New York.Harris accused Trump on Friday of \"playing political games\" with border security and emphasized her commitment to tackling fentanyl smuggling and human trafficking should she win the White House.Trump has retained a significant polling edge on the issue — but that lead has been narrowing.A newly released NBC News poll showed Trump with a 21-point lead (54% to 33%) over Harris among registered voters regarding border security. It was the former president's biggest advantage on any of the major issues that were polled, including the economy.However, Trump's lead on immigration issues is down from a 35-point advantage that he previously had over Biden in an NBC News survey conducted in late January.Trump has been highly critical of Harris' efforts to blast his border security stances. In advance of the vice president's trip to Arizona, he again sought to tie her to Biden.\"She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border,\" the former president said.With a little over a month before the general election, Trump's advantage appears to be slipping, which could be an enormous boost to Harris in Georgia and North Carolina — where victories by the vice president would very likely send her to the Oval Office.","summary":"Kamala Harris is aiming to reassure swing voters across the US that she's the candidate who'll work to deliver on immigration reform.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-arizona-mexico-border-security-immigration-trump-election-2024-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/66f85fe175c877a99b618cbe?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 20:51:36","author":"John L.

They engaged apsychologist from Arizona State University, along with a renowned political scientist from Stanford, to design a test to understand how 4th and 5th grade students see the 2024 election and the candidates.” The psychologist was Ashley Landrum and the political scientist was Shanto Iyengar. According to the NY Post, Landrum had donated to Harris’ super PAC during the period she was surveying the children. She told the Post she was “happy to disclose” that she was a Harris donor and a registered independent. But, what they found out may not have been exactly what CNN was hoping. Landrum interviewed the 10- and 11-year-old kids in New Jersey, Texas, and Arizona in May and September. “What’s the first word that pops into your head when you hear the name Kamala Harris?” she asked the kids, including one Texas boy: Even the kids know 🤣 pic.twitter.com/a2OicLtJOJ— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 26, 2024 A Texas girl said that, while it might be nice to have a black, woman president, she was still “voting” for former President Donald Trump: Little girl to CNN: “I’d be good for us to have a Black woman as president for the first time in history. But my vote’s kinda still on Trump.”🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/wW4dX0uSVq— David J Harris Jr (@DavidJHarrisJr) September 26, 2024 “Do you think it’s okay for somebody who is a convicted felon to become president of the United States?” the boy who called Harris a “liar” is asked at another point.“Yes,” he replied, without reservation.Others in deep-blue New Jersey described Trump as “brave” for surviving “a gunshot” at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., July 13. One of the biggest findings was that the blue state kids had “more extreme responses” than the red state kids. They were nine times more likely to express negative emotions about Trump than those who expressed negative emotions about Harris: CNN: Researchers found “more extreme responses from the Blue state kids than the Red state kids.”“Democrat-leaning kids were abut nine time more likely to express negative emotions about Donald Trump than Republican-leaning kids were about Kamala Harris.”“Republican-leaning… pic.twitter.com/qRQ8T3eqCK— Breaking911 (@Breaking911) September 26, 2024 One kid says Trump is “like Hitler.” Another says Trump only wanted to be president so he can “control everybody.” A third said he thought people involved in Jan. 6 thought “Trump was a god.” Landrum calls Trump “polarizing” without dealing with the constant negative media attack on him propagandizing out to the American people. She notes that “it’s very possible” the kids were picking up on the feelings of their parents. They also asked the kids about going to the homes of people who supported the other candidate. They found, that “Republican-leaning kids were more open to visiting a Democrat-supporting household. Democrat-leaning kids were about five times more likely to say they would not want to go to a pro-Trump house.” Two Democrat-leaning kids saying their parents probably wouldn’t like that, including one kid who has been told that Trump doesn’t like black people. You can see the difference in the answer of the boy who referred to Kamala Harris as a “liar”; he thought it would be fine, “it’s about the personality of the people.” Kids of course shouldn’t be politicized to begin with; kids shouldn’t be told Trump is “like Hitler.” And ultimately it’s the media behind the propaganda, to adults and kids. But the fact that the “Republican-leaning” kids are more open to difference tells you a lot and tends to blow up that old Democratic mantra of who is really intolerant here.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nI&#8217;m not sure what CNN thought they might prove with a study&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Surprising Findings from CNN&#8217;s Study on Kids&#8217; Opinions of Trump and Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/surprising-findings-from-cnns-study-on-kids-opinions-of-trump-and-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-CNN-Study-Interviewed-Kids-on-Trump-and.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-28 20:51:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.131},{"id":257774826,"title":"Helene aftermath: Duval County schools set to reopen on Monday while JEA works to bring power back to thousands of residents","text":"Home US News Local news World News Business Crime Entertainment Health Guest Post Support Our Cause Brit Awards 2024: Falsely accused subpostmistress Jo Hamilton whose story was told in ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office hits out at ministers on stage at the BRIT Awards – 'Despite what the government says, they're NOT paying the postmasters' March 3, 2024 Akbar V Shares Thoughts on Latto Preferring Lil’ Kim as Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T) Over Nicki Minaj August 15, 2024 Mom, 7-Year-Old Son Dead Fatally Stabbed by Her Brother; 3 More in Critical Condition: Cops – Crime Online April 25, 2022 Ivanka Trump goes to synagogue after dad Donald’s indictment June 10, 2023 Shocking moment California cops tackle teens to the ground during massive 200-person brawl caused by two girls 'fist fighting' as local mall is shut down March 18, 2024 Order Now - 50% Off + Free Shipping Home US News Local news World News Business Crime Entertainment Health Guest Post Support Our Cause Search for: Search HomeNewsHelene aftermath: Duval County schools set to reopen on Monday while JEA works to bring power back to thousands of residents Helene aftermath: Duval County schools set to reopen on Monday while JEA works to bring power back to thousands of residents Up next Barrier Islands in Pinellas County to Reopen with Limited Access Published on 28 September 2024 Author Internewscast Share this @internewscast.com FacebookXRedditPinterest School officials made the announcement Saturday afternoon after the local state of emergency was lifted at 8 a.m. JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Duval County Public Schools will reopen Monday, days after Hurricane Helene forced closures across the First Coast. The school district made the announcement Saturday afternoon after the local state of emergency was lifted at 8 a.m. City officials had previously said DCPS was assessing power and damage at some schools before deciding to reopen Monday. “With appreciation to school and district staff, JEA, and all those who continue to support our recovery efforts, we are pleased to announce that Duval County Public Schools will return to normal operations on Monday, Sept. 30. We look forward to welcoming everyone back to school,” the district said in a social media update. Helene brought rain and strong winds to the First Coast, downing trees and powerlines across the area leaving thousands without power. Since the beginning of the storm, JEA crews have restored power to more than 267,000 customers. Crews will continue to work around the clock until power is restored to all customers, the utility said in an update Saturday morning. Right now, JEA is in Phase 2 of power restoration, which means crews are making repairs to electric circuits that could help restore power to thousands of homes at a time. “Priority is given to making repairs that will restore power to the most customers,” officials said. “We ask customers for patience as we continue our work.” JEA said the final phase of power restoration may continue early next week. Any outages can be reported through jea.com/outage or by calling (904) 665-6000.
