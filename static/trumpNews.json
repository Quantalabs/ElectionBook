Abbas issued his “Declaration of lawfare”, calling\n\nfor the internationalisation of the conflict as a legal, not just a political\n\nmatter. Such lawfare is intended to be an abuse of legal systems and processes generally, and of international legal institutions particularly in regard to Israel.\n\nIn 1982, Abbas was granted a doctorate for his thesis The Relationship Between Zionists and Nazis, 1933-1945 by the Institute of Oriental Studies, a commission of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe warrants of arrest\n\nOn Thursday 21 November 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued warrants of arrest for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant, and Hamas master military strategist Mohammed Deif. Deif was killed by the Israelis in Gaza in July, but the ICC premised his warrant on the belief that his death has not been confirmed.\n\nNetanyahu and Gallant’s warrants accuse them of attempting to orchestrate starvation as a method of warfare.\n\nUS president Joe Biden has called the warrants “outrageous” and said that the US government rejects the ICC decision. Republican leaders of Congress − the Republicans will have the majority in Congress when Donald Trump is sworn in on 20 January − directed very harsh statements at the ICC, implying that there will be repercussions for the ICC as an institution, and for several European countries which have said that Netanyahu and Gallant would be arrested if they landed in their countries. \n\nHausdorff says that the application by Prosecutor Karim Khan to the ICC’s pre-trial chamber was summarised for a press conference which he gave on 20 May. The very public nature of the application, and its being accepted by the court, is very unusual: this type of warrant request is usually made in secret so that the subjects are not aware that they are subject to a warrant of arrest. \n\nKhan also appeared on Amanpour on CNN. His emphasis was principally on the allegation of intentional starvation, which included false allegations that Israel had closed the crossings into Gaza and had deliberately restricted aid into the Gaza Strip. The warrants also allege the targeting of civilians throughout the war against Hamas.\n\nThe organisation which Hausdorff represents, UK Lawyers for Israel, responded to Khan’s press summary line by line, made a submission to the ICC, and wrote a further letter to the prosecutor to establish that every phrase of every sentence was false. An example: the prosecutor relied on a report that suggested that famine might come to parts of the Gaza strip. \n\nKhan’s report of intentional starvation was reviewed by the United Nations Famine Review Committee report which indicated that Khan’s allegations had been based on insufficient or incomplete information, and drew implausible conclusions.\n\nRather than seeking to review his position, Khan told the court to ignore any and all submissions made to it that did not emanate from him on the question of accuracy. \n\nThe overriding impression one receives of the process and the press release that the ICC issued on Thursday 21 November is that the ICC made its determination on the basis of false information.\n\nHistory and role of the ICC\n\nThe ICC was established by the Rome Statute in the late 1990s and started functioning in 2002. It has no formal relationship with the United Nations (UN), save for the provision that the UN Security Council can make referrals to the court. \n\nIronically, both Israel and the US were considerably involved in establishing the notion of the formation of an international criminal court after World War II. The creation of international humanitarian and human rights law, and the notion of having international bodies to monitor them, was a consequence of the Nuremberg Trials. \n\nA permanent body would be created to bring the worst perpetrators of crimes against humanity and war crimes to justice. The ICC acts against individuals, not states; the latter are the purview of the International Court of Justice. \n\nWhile drafting the Rome Statute, a particular political agenda started to creep in which meant that both the US and Israel, which initially signed the Rome Statute, neither joined the court nor ratified the international treaty to become members of the ICC. \n\nOne of the key reasons for their withdrawal was the inclusion in “Article 8 War Crimes” of a provision of Article 49: Deportations, transfers, evacuations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Hausdorff explained that Article 49 of the Convention is often used to claim that the presence of Jews in the West Bank/Judea and Samaria is against international law, and that Israeli settlements were illegal. Contrary to the views of Israel’s detractors, the allegation of illegal occupation of the West Bank is not uncontested, it is disputed. Those who deny that the occupation of these territories is illegal refer to them as “the disputed territories” not “the occupied territories”.\n\nArticle 49 is a provision against state transfer of individuals into an occupied territory, and the Rome Statute drafters introduced key words which directly or indirectly drafted this crime into Statute. The US and Israel saw that the drafters were trying to shoehorn the situation in the disputed territories into this definition of an alleged crime. Thus, it was a clear indication that Israel was going to be a political target of the ICC.\n\nIn Hausdorff’s view, the current frenzied criticism of Israel and so much of the misreporting of the last 13 months is because the court is seeking to rehabilitate itself from accusations of racism and bullying of staff by going after Israel.\n\nIn addition, in October allegations of sexual misconduct perpetrated by Khan became public, which may have contributed to the very public strategy of Khan regarding the warrants.\n\nAbsence of jurisdiction & right of delegation\n\nAt every juncture the ICC has refused to properly engage with the absence of jurisdiction: whether a body has jurisdiction is what distinguishes a judicial body from a political body.\n\nThe ICC simply does not have jurisdiction because Israel is not a party to it. The only other way that the court gets ‘territorial jurisdiction’ to try individuals for crimes committed on a particular territory is if the entity, the state with jurisdiction over that territory, delegates it to the court or accepts the Court’s ad hoc jurisdiction over it.\n\nWhat the court has done is decided that ‘Palestine’ is sufficiently a state to be able to join the court and delegate that jurisdiction. The problem is that Palestine isn’t a state; it is merely the Palestinian Authority (PA) that has purported to join the Rome Statute. The criteria for statehood are very clear in international law. \n\nThe Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, a treaty signed in 1933, contains the criteria for the existence of a state, including a permanent population, a defined territory, and a government with the capacity to enter into international relations. The PA simply does not fulfil those criteria. When the United Nations offered a two-state solution to the conflict in 1948, Israel accepted it, but the Arab countries did not. Israel declared independence and the United Nations recognised Israel as a country. \n\nThe Oslo Accords, a pair of international agreements between Israel and the PA, created areas A, B and C in the West Bank. Area A was designated by Israel as an area where the PA would have both civil authority and security control. Area B was shared, in that the PA has civil control, while Israel maintains security control. Control over Area C is retained by Israel. \n\nThese distinctions are important because the Accords never created a Palestinian territory. There was nothing that granted the PA the right to advance through to statehood, as it didn’t meet the necessary criteria to become a state. Final status negotiations, which were to begin by May 1996, never occurred.\n\n(In 1995 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a negotiator at Oslo, was assassinated by a right-wing Jew. The murder was followed by a series of attacks by Hamas. This undermined the governing Labour Party, and the next election in 1996 saw the election of Likud and Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996. Likud was opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian state. In 1998 US President Bill Clinton hosted Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat at the Wye River Plantation, where they negotiated an agreement calling for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank. Infighting over the implementation of the Wye Memorandum, however, brought down Netanyahu’s government in January 1999. Labour returned to government with Ehud Barak as prime minister. Clinton convened a summit at Camp David in July 2000, where he, Barak, and Arafat attempted to reach a final agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The negotiations failed and Clinton has always blamed Arafat for the failure. The Second Intifada erupted on 28 September 2000 and ended 8 February 2005.) \n\nThe Accords also prevented the PA from having, exercising or seeking to delegate any criminal jurisdiction over Israelis. Thus, the PA has no authority to delegate to the ICC something that it does not have.\n\nComplementarity\n\nThe ICC has also flouted its own rule of ‘complementarity’. The Rome Statute requires the ICC to act in a ‘complementary’ fashion to a state’s jurisdiction. This means that the ICC may not replace a state’s sovereign jurisdiction where a state is willing and able to investigate and try any credible allegations itself. \n\nA state should be afforded the opportunity to exercise its own jurisdiction. Ultimately the jurisdiction rests with the local state. Israel is in the middle of a war, and it is not appropriate at this time for the judicial authorities in Israel to tackle the allegations raised.\n\nThe day that Khan announced his arrest warrant application on 20 May, he was scheduled to meet Israeli officials to facilitate a dialogue about his concerns that would form the basis of the warrants. He failed to meet with the Israelis first or at all.\n\nIsrael’s judicial system is known for its robustness and the efficiency with which the rule of law is upheld. It is utterly inexplicable that the ICC would proceed in the circumstances without any discussion on the matter with the relevant state authorities.\n\nIt’s important to note that there is a chain of command outside of the military chain of command in that, by law, the IDF are answerable to the attorney-general (A-G). The A-G approves or rejects military strikes. The A-G has authority over officers who have a more senior rank than he has.\n\nIsrael has always taken a robust approach to investigating allegations made against soldiers and ensuring that soldiers are properly disciplined. \n\nAt every level, the question of the jurisdiction of the ICC has been ignored. This lack of jurisdiction is a key issue that Netanyahu and Gallant would advance.\n\nSenor raised the breaches of international humanitarian law by other countries, such as President Bashar al-Assad’s prosecution of the civil war in which about 600,000 Syrians died. Al-Assad used chemical weapons and destroyed whole Syrian towns and villages, largely Sunni Muslim areas. According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, 14 million Syrians were displaced by the war and 7.2 million remain displaced. Over 5 million became refugees. Seventy percent remain in need of humanitarian assistance and 90% live below the poverty line. Hausdorff explained that Syria is not a party to the ICC, so the ICC has no jurisdiction over it.\n\n(Other countries that have not recognised the ICC are: Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan, Brunei, China, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niue, North Korea, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Togo, Tonga, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Vatican City, and Vietnam.)\n\nInternational law on determining the borders of states\n\nSettled international law provides that the borders of states come into existence through the application of customary international law called uti possidetis iuris. \n\nUti possidetis iuris provides that new sovereign states should keep the internal borders of their previously dependent area at the time of independence. The principle’s goal is to prevent territorial disputes by establishing the territorial heritage of new states and turning existing lines into internationally-recognised borders.\n\nBefore the creation of Israel on 14 May 1948, the administrative lines of the British mandate included East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nDuring the 1948 war, Jordan occupied (and then annexed) East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza from Israel. This situation applied until the 1967 war when Israel recovered that territory. \n\nIn the West Bank the administration by the PA exists entirely as a consequence of the Oslo Accords. There is no change to the underlying status of the territory from 1948 onwards, and every single international agreement has been clear that a change to borders will be a matter of final status agreements that determine the borders of those States.\n\nSo the ICC, in giving state recognition to the PA, ignored applicable international law. \n\nSince the author began to write this article, the Israeli government has announced that Netanyahu and Gallant will appeal the issuing of the warrants to the ICC.\n\n[Photo: Screenshot/I24 – Netanyahu & Gallant]\n\nThis article first appeared on the Daily Friend.

These minerals are needed for semiconductors, 5G phone tech, defence systems and electric vehicle batteries. Antimony is found in bullets. Nolan described the export ban as a calculated bid for geopolitical leverage.\n\n“China has weaponized the world’s mineral supply chains,” he said in an emailed statement. “We must confront Chinese mineral extortion and recognize that U.S. mining policy is the foundation of our nation’s economic, energy and national security.”\n\nThe trade tension comes amid U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s pledge last month to impose 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on products from China until they clamp down on illegal migrants and cross-border narcotics. Analysts said then a trade war could erupt.\n\nAnd they’ve warned how the West will suffer if China expands its restrictions. A November U.S. Geological Survey report estimated a US$3.4 billion loss to American GDP if Beijing imposes a full ban on gallium and germanium exports.\n\nChina dominates global production and processing of gallium, germanium and antimony. It controls 89.4% of cathodes, 93.5% of anodes and over 80% of key lithium-ion battery components, the USGS report showed. The U.S. imports all its gallium.\n\nJack Lifton, co-chair of the Critical Minerals Institute, a multi-country effort to promote critical minerals, framed the issue as part of a global struggle for power over critical minerals.\n\nLifton stressed that the U.S. can produce these materials. It has the geological resources. But, it lacks the policies to create secure supply chains because some agreements dating from just after World War II, like the dollar-based trade regime created at Bretton Woods, are losing relevance. He questioned whether Washington could effectively challenge Beijing.\n\nTit-for-tat policy\n\nChina’s ban came a day after Washington tightened export controls on advanced chip-making equipment and high-bandwidth memory chips to Chinese firms. China’s Ministry of Commerce justified its response as a necessary step to safeguard its national security.\n\nLike the U.S. miners, it used the word ‘weaponized’ to describe trade relations. The U.S. has been undermining global supply chains with years of restrictions on Chinese companies, ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a Tuesday press briefing.\n\nCalls to cooperate\n\nChina’s ban has reignited calls from miners in the U.S. and Canada to reform their mining policies and reduce dependence on foreign supplies.\n\nCanada-U.S. collaboration is vital to secure critical mineral supply chains, the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) said late Tuesday. In 2022, 52% of Canada’s mineral exports, worth over $80 billion, went to the U.S., according to association data.\n\nMAC president Pierre Gratton called for boosting this partnership. He also noted that imposing Trump’s proposed tariffs on Canadian mineral and metal exports to the U.S. would run counter to the shared goals of secure and reliable supply chains.\n\nSuch measures risk disrupting the essential flow of these resources, undermining the competitiveness of North American industries, and exacerbating vulnerabilities in critical mineral supply chains that both nations are working to address.\n\n“The minerals and metals industry in Canada stands ready to strengthen our partnership with the U.S., ensuring the free flow of these essential resources that drive economic growth and defense capabilities on both sides of the border,” he said.","url":"https://www.northernminer.com/news/china-has-weaponized-global-critical-mineral-supply-chain-us-miners-group-says/1003873741/","image":"https://www.northernminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AdobeStock_982416429-scaled-1.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 01:14:50","author":"Henry Lazenby","authors":["Henry Lazenby"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":270493458,"title":"Dems Check Navels Find Fuzz If Wed Had A Primary N3797590","text":"The finger-pointing and introspective naval gazing have been off-the-charts hilarious these past few weeks.

Pelosi and Obama's coup, with its spectacular flame-out, has left them wandering in the wilderness. Obama's brand, in particular, has lost its luster, and he was never the sort who connected on a personal level with his off-putting manner and superiority complex lurking right below the surface during any encounter.\n\nBut his constant nagging over his disappointment in black men who didn't do as they were told and the high-handed way he went about lecturing adult males concerning their failings as humans in his eyes, well. The Lightbringer's fan club shrank a fair bit during the summer as his appeal to his own authority and the aspersions cast on black men by it rubbed the wrong way. \n\nThese few paragraphs from a left-leaning piece speak to Obama hitting that nerve.\n\n...Obama, while speaking to staffers at a Harris campaign office in Pennsylvania, suggested that misogyny and sexism are the culprits of the lack of Black men’s support for Harris. “Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” said Obama. Obama also spoke about former President Trump’s history with Black men, potentially alluding to past actions such as an ad demanding the “exonerated” Central Park Five be given the death penalty as well as Trump’s federal lawsuit for failing to rent to Black families.Unpacking Obama’s comments, he suggests: Black men are blinded by their gender to see the value of Harris as president. Black men do not understand the impact of another Trump presidency on democracy, crime, family policies, the economy, and health care access.Trump does not respect Black men and will harm Black communities.Among most Black men, there is consensus—Obama went too far and needed to “watch his tone.” The call on the carpet has cracked the privacy screens across Black men’s social networks and brought conversations that normally occur when building “community in the dark” into the light...\n\nThere are no power brokers left to herd the Democratic cats, and now, after realizing there are no immediate consequences for trying to get clear of the wreckage of the campaign while blaming everyone but themselves, the kittehs are getting out of the bag and doing exactly that.\n\nPointing fingers and saying, \"We shoulda/Why didn't we?\"\n\nEven the Harris campaign chairs are out trying to defend themselves - no time, hurricanes, Trump, waah.\n\nIt's not going so well.\n\nThis is why Trump won.

Joe Biden lied in the debate about whether Hunter got money from China. Joe Biden lied about whether he went to meetings with Hunter’s business associates. Joe Biden lied about his family receiving money,” Halperin said. “He chose to run knowing his son had an addiction problem and that this would put the spotlight on his past activities that he knew about and lied about whether he knew about them.”“So you want to talk about culpability and responsibility. You want to talk about loving your son. If my son were an addict and had done what Hunter did and Joe knew he did, I wouldn’t run for president,” he continued. “So if he wants to say who’s responsible for this, he can blame his own Justice Department, he can blame the independent counsel. He can blame the judges. He can blame Donald Trump, but he’s responsible for his surviving son’s plight right now by choosing to run for president.”\n\nDavid Plouffe wasn't quite so harsh, but he's now voicing the opinion that, gosh - it might oughta have been better if they were gonna coup Joe to, like, maybe...have a primary instead of just anointing someone.\n\nDavid Plouffe, a top aide to the Harris campaign, told The Atlantic that the Democratic Party's lack of a primary for the presidential candidate was \"the cardinal sin\" during a discussion about the campaign's loss to President-elect Donald Trump.\"I’m not sure, given the headwinds, any Democrat could have won. But if we had a primary in which a bunch of people ran and auditioned… through that process, whoever emerged… would have been a more fully formed person, would have had more time to mount a general election campaign. [Not having that process] is the cardinal sin,\" Plouffe told The Atlantic.\n\nOh, if only he'd said something sooner!\n\nBut back in the Spring, he'd have lost his head, as would any of the other voices now saying, \"As I've said all along...\"\n\nThe only person I can honestly say I remember objecting to the entire process vociferously and taking his money home in protest has been Florida super lawyer John Morgan.

The president himself, who was intensely focused on his son’s pardon, has not been brought into the broader pardon discussions yet, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nI believe that Joe Biden hasn't been brought into this in the same way I believe Joe Biden decided to pardon Hunter last Sunday, which is to say not at all. This is just more lying politics parading as principle.\n\nNames on the list for such pardons include Adam Schiff, LIz Cheney and Anthony Fauci among others. Sen. Ed Markey has already come out in favor of the idea as have an unknown number of other Democrats in congress.\n\nOther lawmakers, I’m told, have been just as emphatic in private with Biden’s aides in calling for preemptive pardons.\n\nAdam Schiff has said he wouldn't be interested in a pardon, calling it \"defensive and unnecessary.\" That's what he's saying in public but with Adam Schiff you can't assume anything he says is true. \n\nSome senior Democrats I spoke with, however, wonder how many of those facing retribution are adopting a version of the vote-no-hope-yes mantra that often surrounds difficult legislative votes. Which is to say: Some may publicly oppose preemptive pardons, for reasons of innocence or precedence, while privately hoping the president offers legal protection.\n\nThis is the same guy who went on MSNBC and claimed to have seen evidence President Trump was colluding with Russia. He also spent years promoting the bogus Steele Dossier. And don't forget the bogus FISA memo which turned out to be wrong. So take his denials of interest in a pardon with a big grain of salt. What Adam Schiff says in public has very little connection to reality.\n\nAnd on that note, the White House is said to be very concerned that even fighting allegations would be a burden for some Democrats who could face steep legal bills. Yes, the same people who cheered a $450 million verdict against Trump for a paperwork crime in which no one was harmed are worried about financial fairness.\n\nThis looks to me less like a defense of principled people and more like the bugs scattering when their lawfare rock got kicked over by Trump's re-election. They were daydreaming about seeing Trump broke and in prison a few months ago, but now that he's headed back to the Oval Office they're worried the shoe could be on the other foot. \n\nIn any case, it'll be interesting to see how many more blanket pardons Joe Biden is willing to issue. If he stops with Hunter, he appears completely self-interested. If he offers pardons to a bunch of Democrats he looks like he's covering up a crime spree. He and his party wind up looking bad either way.","url":"https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2024/12/04/who-will-joe-biden-pardon-next-n3797602","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2021/209/f660e924-b98b-49f5-a012-3ae3559f3e3b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 01:11:49","author":"John Sexton","authors":["John Sexton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":270493448,"title":"Heh The Winning Has Already Begun N3797586","text":"Under normal circumstances, it takes a year or two before a president can have an impact on the economy or world affairs.

Trump wrote Wednesday in a Truth Social post that Navarro has been treated “horribly by the Deep State” and will help advance his agenda in a second administration.\n\n“The Senior Counselor position leverages Peter’s broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills. His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas,” Trump wrote.\n\n“Peter is not just a superb, Harvard-trained Economist, he is a noted author of more than a dozen bestselling books on strategic business management and unfair Trade.

It deals with the entire country, with the disarmament of all armed groups, both militias and paramilitary groups,” Boulos explained.\n\nHe added that the text is very specific about the application of U.N. resolutions, whether 1701 or 1559. \n\n“Thus, only a certain number of institutions have the right to hold weapons in Lebanon, including the Lebanese Army, Internal Security Forces, customs services and the municipal police,” Boulos went on to say.\n\nAsked how Hezbollah could be prohibited on the ground from possessing arms, the advisor said: “This is a very good question, which is not an easy one. Let me tell you first that according to some estimates, nearly 70% of strategic weapons and missile and drone depots have been destroyed during this war. As for what remains, it is normally the Lebanese state and therefore the Lebanese Army that has the role of disarming the militias and paramilitary groups. Now, we know very well that this process cannot be achieved overnight, and that it will take months, if not longer.”\n\nHe added that the ceasefire agreement adopted by the Lebanese Council of Ministers in any case gives the Lebanese Army full freedom to begin implementing it. \n\n“Under the text, the Lebanese army is also responsible for controlling the flow of weapons from the Syrian border, Beirut airport or the port of the capital, which are now under its control,” Boulos added.\n\nAsked whether the ceasefire agreement still holds after Lebanese authorities denounced numerous violations of the ceasefire by the Israeli army, the advisor said: “Yes, that's true, but we see the same thing on the other side. It's not a surprise. We are currently in a 60-day test period, and the text of the agreement itself talks about the right of each party to defend itself.”\n\nAs for the role that the U.S. will play in monitoring the ceasefire agreement, Boulos said that what is very important in this agreement is the monitoring committee responsible for its implementation. \n\n“Within it, the United States and France must verify that all its details are actually implemented on the ground. Because if Resolution 1701 was not implemented at all when it was adopted in 2006, it was precisely because there was no mechanism at the time to ensure its implementation, an error corrected by this agreement,” Boulos added.\n\nHe also reiterated to Lebanon’s lawmakers that “there is no need to hurry up and elect just anyone” as president. \n\n“On the contrary, we must try to ensure the participation of the absolute majority of the representatives of the Lebanese people and not obtain the election of a president with only 65 votes,” he said.","url":"https://naharnet.com/stories/en/309592-boulos-says-ceasefire-agreement-covers-entire-lebanon-not-only-area-south-of-litani","image":"http://images2.naharnet.com/images/265208/w140.jpg?1733313499","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 01:03:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lb","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":270492774,"title":"309594 Fbi Tells Telecom Firms To Boost Security Following Chinese Hacking Campaign","text":"Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.\n\nThe guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.\n\nIn one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.\n\nDubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.\n\nThe hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.\n\nThe hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.\n\nDespite months of investigation, the true scale of China's operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.\n\nThe FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.\n\nBut on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.\n\nThe suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.\n\n\"We don't have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they're not going to come back,\" Greene said.\n\nSeveral recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.\n\nIn September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.\n\nIn October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nChina has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \"disinformation.\"\n\nChina's government \"firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\" spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \"The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\"","url":"https://naharnet.com/stories/en/309594-fbi-tells-telecom-firms-to-boost-security-following-chinese-hacking-campaign","image":"http://images2.naharnet.com/images/265210/w140.jpg?1733314808","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 01:03:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lb","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":270493768,"title":"Gold's road to $3,000: expert analysis by global broker Octa","text":"Gold's road to $3,000: expert analysis by global broker OctaDecember 5, 2024 - 2:02Media OutReach Newswire\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 5 December 2024 - Gold has been valued for its stability when the financial fires are raging. That stable nature was underscored in 2024 when its price shot upward, gaining over $700 per ounce. This amounted to a 34% increase since January. The vibrant price increase has gotten traders and investors all jazzed up again about gold, with the most pressing question among them being: could gold exceed the $3,000 price point by 2025? Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa broker, delves into the topic.\n\n Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitics\n\nInflation and interest rates influence gold prices. When inflation soars, investors tend to buy gold to protect their purchasing power. They view it as a much safer investment than stocks or bonds because stocks are prone to sudden price drops, and bonds can lose value when interest rates rise due to high inflation. Historically, though, when real interest rates (which are inflation-adjusted) have declined, gold has just soared. As some would say, 'There is no better buy'.\n\nBy 2024, the percentage of overall reserves held in gold by central banks had reached 10%, a significant climb from the 3% level recorded just 10 years earlier. Although we are still in an era where most reserve currencies are fiat (for example, paper with little intrinsic value), an increasing number of central banks seem to believe that holding gold adds an element of prudence to their reserve diversification strategy. Emerging economies, especially in Asia, are seeing their central banks take on an increasingly important role in the gold market. China (which now holds 5% of its reserves in gold), along with India, has emerged as one of the preeminent buyers of gold.\n\nMoreover, the central banks of the emerging economies have, since 2022, stepped up their pace of gold buying. The catalyst for this last development was the unprecedented freezing of Russian assets, which prompted multiple nations to reconsider the makeup of their reserves.\n\nFurthermore, the global shift towards a more sustainable economy, including investment in renewable energy and green technologies, is driving limited demand for certain commodities, such as precious metals that include gold. Gold plays an important role in clean energy technologies, including solar panels and electronics for energy-efficient systems. This increased demand for technological gold is exacerbated by growing concerns about the lack of resources necessary for the green transition.\n\nMoreover, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty further underscore the attractiveness of gold as a safe asset, attracting investors seeking relief amid rapid changes in global markets. The Ukraine conflict, strained US-China relations, and unrest in the Middle East have sent investors scurrying to safe-haven assets. And when it comes to safe havens, gold is a time-tested destination. Its record of price stability in an unstable world at present stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of the stock market and other assets. An instance of this is China's recent accumulation of gold, which now makes up 5% of its foreign exchange reserves. This is yet another sign of a shift towards resilience in a global economy fraught with uncertainty.\n\nTechnical analysis: key levels to watch\n\nAccording to the technical analysis, the asset's price is still in the uptrend, even on a high timeframe. The long-term bullish trend also hasn't changed for a bearish one. The $3,000 target, which aligns with the 4.236 Fibonacci extension level, is pretty real. However, this level may be too ambitious for the moment of publication.\n\nProspects for 2025 - factors shaping gold's future\n\nAccording to the Chief Economists' Survey from the World Economic Forum, economists are uncertain about global economic stability. 54% of respondents forecast a steady outlook and 37% project further deterioration. Future fiscal policies targeting climate adaptation, a shifting demographic landscape, and ramped-up defence spending are set to push inflation upwards. All these look to gold as an inflation hedge; however, it's not just private investors: central banks are in on the gold thing, too. They are expected to keep topping up their gold reserves and, in the face of all these other demands, are likely to maintain long-term demand.\n\nSo will gold hit the $3,000-per-ounce price in 2025? The scenario seems very possible. However, for the asset's price to reach a rather ambitious target, favourable market conditions are required. They include both macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. For example, the re-election of Donald Trump introduces additional variables into the equation. Trump's geopolitical stance, particularly regarding global trade and conflict resolution, could influence investor sentiment and safe-haven demand. If his promises regarding the resolution of numerous conflicts are fulfilled, investors may partially abandon safe-haven assets for the riskier ones.\n\nHashtag: #Octa\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011.

But on Wednesday, Trump announced McGinley would be counsel to the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory body that will work on cutting costs. \n\n“Bill will work with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and their team of incredible pioneers at DOGE, to rebuild a U.S. Government that truly serves the People,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. \n\n“Bill will play a crucial role in liberating our Economy from burdensome Regulations, excess spending, and Government waste,” Trump continued. “He will partner with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to provide advice and guidance to end the bloated Federal Bureaucracy.”\n\nTrump also tapped David A. Warrington to lead the Office of White House Counsel, with the official role of assistant to the president and counsel to the president. Warrington has been Trump’s personal lawyer, and represented the campaign. He is a partner at Dhillon Law Group, and a former president of the Republican National Lawyers Association. \n\nDOJ and Big Tech\n\nTrump also put Big Tech firms on notice by nominating Gail Slater to be the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. \n\n“Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump posted. “I was proud to fight these abuses in my First Term, and our Department of Justice’s antitrust team will continue that work under Gail’s leadership.”\n\nSlater was formerly on the Federal Trade Commission and the White House National Economic Council. She has been an adviser in the Senate office of now Vice President-elect JD Vance. She has also worked for Fox and Roku. \n\n“In her new role, Gail will help ensure that our competition laws are enforced, both vigorously and FAIRLY, with clear rules that facilitate, rather than stifle, the ingenuity of our greatest companies,” Trump added. \n\nSEC and Digital Currency\n\nTrump also announced Paul Atkins to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He will replace the controversial SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, appointed by President Joe Biden. \n\nAtkins, a former SEC commissioner, founded Patomak Global Partners, a risk management consultancy, and has co-chaired the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance since 2017. His work in digital currency could be key as the outgoing Gensler, who is resigning in January, faced congressional Republican accusations of overreach and appeared to be a foe of digital currency.\n\n“Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.”\n\nDuring a House Republican press conference earlier Wednesday, Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said he was counting down to Gensler’s departure in January. \n\n“He’s been an incompetent cop on the beat, pushing American firms into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party and will undoubtedly go down as the worst SEC chair in the history of this country,” Emmer said. \n\n“He wasted a large part of the SEC’s resources to wage war on the crypto industry, a strategy that has proven unsuccessful for him, as the SEC continues to lose again and again in the courts,” Emmer continued. “I look forward to working with President Trump and his new SEC chair to deliver on our America First agenda for the digital asset community.”\n\nNavarro Returns\n\nPeter Navarro will return to the administration as a senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. During Trump’s first term, he directed the White House National Trade Council.\n\nThe Biden administration Justice Department charged Navarro with contempt of Congress for not providing testimony to the partisan House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol. He spent four months in federal prison. \n\n“I am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing,” Trump posted on Truth Social. \n\n“During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American. He helped me renegotiate unfair Trade Deals like NAFTA and the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), and moved every one of my Tariff and Trade actions FAST,” Trump added. \n\nMaking Space Exploration Great Again\n\nTrump said he will nominate former astronaut Jared Isaacman to be the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n“Jared will drive NASA’s mission of discovery and inspiration, paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in Space science, technology, and exploration,” Trump posted of his NASA pick. \n\nIsaacman is the founder of Shift4, a financial technology company. He also co-founded Draken International, a defense aerospace company, Trump noted.\n\n“Jared’s passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,” Trump added. \n\nTreasury, Taxes, and Small Business\n\nTrump said he is nominating Michael William Faulkender to be deputy Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Faulkender will work under Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent to “usher in a new Golden Age for the United States by delivering a Great Economic Boom for all Americans,” Trump said.\n\nFaulkender was previously assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department during Trump’s first term.\n\nTrump announced Wednesday evening that he would nominate former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler to be administrator of the Small Business Administration. \n\n“Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive,” Trump posted. “She will focus on ensuring that SBA is accountable to Taxpayers by cracking down on waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach.”\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, nominated Loeffler to the U.S. Senate in 2019 to fill the seat vacated by former Sen. Johnny Isakson. She lost the seat in an early 2021 runoff against Democrat Raphael Warnock. \n\n“Kelly was a tremendous fighter in the U.S. Senate during the first Trump Administration, including helping to pass the first ever bill to protect Women in Sports. Prior to her tenure in the U.S. Senate, Kelly built a 25 year career in financial services and technology,” Trump continued. \n\nContinuing his slew of nominations, the president-elect named former Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., to run the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n“Billy brings 32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country,” Trump posted. “He then served 12 years in Congress, because he ‘felt it was important for his constituents to have a Representative who has signed the front of a check!’”\n\nNew National Security Picks\n\nTrump announced he would nominate Daniel P. Driscoll to be secretary of the Army. Driscoll is a former Army Ranger who deployed with the 10th Mountain Division as a Cavalry Scout Platoon Leader during the Iraq war. He went on to graduate from Yale Law School. \n\n“As a former Soldier, Investor, and Political Advisor, Dan brings a powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent,” Trump posted. \n\nTrump also announced that Adam Boehler would be his special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, with the personal rank of ambassador. Boehler previously served as the CEO of the U.S. Development Finance Corporation.\n\n“Adam worked for me as a Lead Negotiator on the Abraham Accords team,” Trump posted. “He has negotiated with some of the toughest people in the World, including the Taliban, but Adam knows that NO ONE is tougher than the United States of America, at least when President Trump is its Leader. Adam will work tirelessly to bring our Great American Citizens HOME.”\n\n250th Celebration, Soccer and Olympics\n\nPerhaps the most well-known nominee announced on Wednesday was former Assistant Treasury Secretary Monica Crowley, a former political talk radio host and frequent TV commentator. Now Trump has tapped her to be the “ambassador, assistant secretary of state, and chief of protocol of the United States of America.” \n\nThis means she will be an administration representative for major U.S.-hosted events such as the upcoming U.S. 250th Birthday on July 4, 2026, the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028, Trump explained on Truth Social.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump announced a slew of nominees who will, if confirmed, impact administration policy on Big Tech, space, cryptocurrency, slashing government waste, and the...

Mitch McConnell.Especially after learning what the longtime Senate Republican leader had to say about the leader of his party in a just-published biography.McConnell blamed the president-elect for “urging an insurrection” on January 6, 2021, and for his followers “attacking the Capitol as a direct result.” Speaking later to the Senate, he said: “I’m not at all conflicted about whether what the president did is an impeachable offense.” In his eyes it was “a disgraceful dereliction of duty” and “further evidence of Donald Trump’s complete unfitness for office.” The senator said he hoped Trump would pay a price for January 6, yet he handed him a get-out-of-jail free card.When McConnell could have given substance to his moral outrage, he crumpled and blocked Trump’s removal from office after his second impeachment, thus clearing the way for the political resurrection of the man he called a “dumb son of a bitch” and considered morally unfit to be president.US PRESIDENT Donald Trump celebrates with Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Congressional Republicans after the US Congress passed sweeping tax overhaul legislation in December. (credit: REUTERS)A tumultuous relationshipIn a new biography, The Price of Power by Michael Tackett, McConnell is quoted calling Trump “not very smart, irascible, nasty” and a “despicable human being.”Trump has said the senator “is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling hack.” McConnell has shrugged off such attacks as well as a racist attack on his wife, Elaine Chao, who Trump called his “China-loving wife, Coco Chow.” The Taiwan-born Chao had been Trump’s secretary of transportation until resigning in protest over the January 6 insurrection. McConnell reportedly briefly considered supporting the 2021 impeachment and probably could have corralled enough of his colleagues to make sure Trump could never again be president. Instead, he rescued Trump.Was it a lack of moral courage that led him to protect Trump or a cynical partisan ploy?That shame will help define his legacy as McConnell steps down from his leadership post, but not from the Senate.Trump’s most lasting legacy may be one made possible by McConnell’s legislative slickness, partisan passion, and just plain hypocrisy, and it will endure long after both men are long gone: a further and devastating swing to the Right in the federal courts. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now McConnell, 82, likes to think of himself as an institutionalist, staunchly defending Senate traditions and rules, and he is – sometimes. More often, that’s just a cynical defense employed when it suits him and shoved aside when it doesn’t. He has appropriately called himself the “proud guardian of gridlock.”His service to Trump started before the reality TV performer was elected. It began March 16, 2016, weeks after justice Antonin Scalia died, and president Barack Obama – whom McConnell once vowed to make a “one-term president” – nominated Judge Merrick Garland to succeed him. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, declared it was “too close” to the election, nearly eight months away, and refused even to hold hearings on the nomination.Republicans made the Supreme Court a rallying issue for conservative voters that fall. The newly elected Trump quickly nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy. McConnell conveniently forgot his own rule four years later when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died shortly before the 2020 election. He rammed through the Senate the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett only eight days before the election. In those four years, the Senate GOP leader delivered what Justice Samuel Alito has called “The McConnell Court.” Quality and qualifications were irrelevant; the goal was packing the federal benches with unqualified ideological conservatives and blocking everyone else.He also shares responsibility for the Supreme Court’s low standing in American public opinion by blocking all calls for the Senate to investigate alarming conflict of interest allegations against Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas. Experience suggests that if the alleged offenders were liberals and not the Supreme Court’s two most conservative voices, he would behave differently.Trump may take credit (as he does for everything) for the conservative judges but he is indebted to McConnell for having put more tushes on the benches – in his case, all fervent Republicans – in one term than any president since Jimmy Carter.The foundation of his power in the Senate is built on his skills as a prolific fundraiser, champion of corporate money in politics, and adamant foe of campaign finance reform.What comes next?MCCONNELL IS stepping down from the GOP leadership – the longest run in Senate history – but not quitting. He will be taking on a new role that could clash with Trump’s agenda.He will be chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, giving him a platform to get more engaged in foreign policy. A top priority will be protecting aid to Ukraine against assault by the GOP’s isolationist wing, including incoming vice president JD Vance.McConnell has been a strong and consistent supporter of Israel since coming to the Senate in 1985. Most recently, he praised Israel’s “unshakable resolve” in the war against Hamas and spoke out against efforts to block some arms to Israel. One pro-Israel lobbyist said he has been helpful over the years in providing insights on possible problems among his colleagues though not an out-front advocate.McConnell has told colleagues he felt “liberated” stepping down from the leadership. With two more years remaining in his seventh term, it remains to be seen if he will be liberated enough to challenge the president he once considered unfit for office. It will be seen in his votes on some of Trump’s more questionable cabinet nominees.His replacement, John Thune, 63, of South Dakota, won’t have that liberty.Thune, also an institutionalist, will be tested early on by a president who insists on loyalty to him personally above loyalty to the Senate or the Constitution. One Republican activist friendly with Thune told me he and Trump have a “tenuous” relationship.In addition to rounding up votes for controversial nominees, Thune will face Trump’s demand that the Senate abolish the filibuster and give him latitude for recess appointments to bypass the advise and consent provision of the Constitution. So far he’s been noncommittal.As Senate majority leader, Thune will have to deal with a demanding and vindictive president who thinks the Senate exists only to serve his needs, a growing number of colleagues who agree, and a House of Representative under MAGA leadership that will be the White House’s loyal lap dog.One of his predecessors compared the job of Senate leader to herding cats. Some have very sharp claws.The writer is a Washington-based journalist, consultant, lobbyist, and a former legislative director at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-832031","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/637590","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:45:49","author":"Douglas Bloomfield","authors":["Douglas Bloomfield"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":270490762,"title":"Article 832073","text":"I was viciously attacked at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach while simply working on my laptop, wearing a yarmulke. The attack was extremely dangerous, devastatingly unsettling, terrifying, and entirely unprovoked. It happened solely because I am proudly and unmistakably Jewish.The alleged attacker, Faiz Akbar from Lorton, Virginia - later identified by facial recognition by outstanding online Jewish organizations – confronted me in the hotel lobby, repeatedly threatening me with graphic violence. What was most shocking was the hotel's security response.One staff member actually and sickeningly fist-bumped and hugged the man who was calling me a baby killer and threatening me with his savagery. The video, posted to social media, has now gone viral around the world and has been watched by millions of people, with hundreds of thousands posting comments of disbelief that something like this can happen, not just in the United States, but especially in South Florida where Jews felt so much more safe and at one of the world’s premier hotels. The incident has been reported both to local law enforcement and the FBI. My goal is to ensure the arrest and prosecution of my assailant and, given their shocking behavior since the attack, hold the Fontainebleau Hotel accountable for its failure to protect me and Jewish visitors.Trend of rising antisemitismThis attack is part of a disturbing trend of rising antisemitism that I've personally experienced. As a public Jewish figure, I am often targeted, but I want to be clear: I will never hide my Jewish identity. I am proud to be Jewish and will continue to stand up against hate, even in the face of violent or near-lethal incidents. A woman wrapped in an Israel flag stands outside the place where mayor of Amsterdam Femke Halsema attends a press conference following the violence targeting fans of an Israeli soccer team, in Amsterdam, Netherlands, November 8, 2024. (credit: PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW/REUTERS)I grew up in Miami Beach, a city I love deeply. My mother lived and died here. I attended the Hebrew Academy of Greater Miami. One class below me was Ron Dermer who would later become my student president at Oxford University and is today Israel’s Minister of Strategic Affairs and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s closest aid.Antisemitism was something almost unknown to us as part of daily experience. Indeed, since the COVID epidemic, a dramatic surge of Jews in general and orthodox Jews in particular have made South Florida their home, seeking safer havens than New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania have proven to be. But such safety is an illusion, as anyone who watches the horrific attack against me will conclude. Indeed, this week, my friends Sara and Yair Netanyahu (I have known Prime Minister Netanyahu since I was 22 years old and hosted him for lectures at Oxford University when he was Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister) visited Mar-a-Lago as guests of President Donald Trump and the Israeli media was commenting on how South Florida has become the ultimate safe haven for American Jewry, amid a national spike of murder, intimidation, harassment, and violent attack. Well, watch this and other videos – remember the Nazis outside the Chabad House in Orlando? - of what’s happening in Florida and think again.This is not the first time I was accosted in the lobby of the Fontainebleau. It happened about a year and a half ago when a well-dressed Arab man screamed “Free Palestine” right in my face as I was working and threatened violence. The response of hotel security was pathetic.They came over to me and threatened me as an instigator for simply being a Jewish victim of hate. That video too was watched by millions of people. I contacted the President of the Fontainebleau, Philip Goldfarb, whose daughter, ironically, I had led on a Birthright Trip to Israel about a decade earlier. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now Birthright is uniquely capable of instilling a deep and proud Jewish identity and attachment to Israel in American youth and for that reason I volunteer to lead groups. Philip pleaded with me not to name the Fontainebleau in any of my posts. He promised me that the hotel would take the incident seriously, retrain all their security personnel, provide sensitivity training as to the unique challenges faced by yarmulke and Magen David-wearing Jews, and protect their Jewish guests.I believed him. I left the matter alone. I never mentioned the Fontainebleau.Big mistake. I will not repeat this mistake again. In trying to be the bigger man and forgiving such a famous hotel for their cavalier response to a vicious antisemitic assault, all they learned is that antisemitism rarely has consequences.Since then I have pledged never to allow any attack against innocent people to proceed with a defense.I am grateful to @jewhatedb and @stopantisemitism on Instagram, both of whom identified the Islamist assailant who assaulted me as Faiz Akbar of Lorton, Virginia, who describes himself as a self-made millionaire, decked out in Gucci. I am in regular contact with the FBI about threats against me and my family and we have provided them with all the evidence, as well as to the Miami Beach Police Department, who reached out the very next day.We seek the assailant’s arrest and prosecution. The Fontainebleau has thusfar refused to cooperate with the MBPD and release the surveillance tapes. No matter. They will be subpoenaed. Antisemitism will be granted no quarter, no matter how prestigious, mighty, and wealthy the institution is in trying to cover it up.As this venomous, brutal, and sadistic maniac attacked me as a baby killer, as someone who loves to put bullets in the heads of children, and screamed how lucky I am to be in America or he would destroy me, security, not to mention all the people watching, did nothing to help. All were innocent bystanders.I felt like I was in Berlin in 1936, a feeling reinforced when security finally came over and treated me, the victim, as if I were equally responsible for the situation and ended up actually hugging the “Free Palestine MotherF—ker” screaming Islamist attacker, even as he continued to openly threaten me with violence.We must always distinguish between Muslims, who are our brothers and sisters, and Islamists, who are political radicals who seek a second holocaust. As a Jew and as the father of three IDF soldiers, I could not be more proud that Israel has approximately 1.5 million Arab Muslim citizens, whom the Jewish IDF soldiers fight and even God forbid die for every single day.Just over the past two weeks alone, I worked closely with my friend Robert Kennedy, Jr., President Trump’s nominee for American Health Czar, to help rescue 100 Palestinian children from Gaza who are afflicted with cancer. Every Arab and Palestinian child who has died in Gaza, due to the Hamas monsters using them as bullet-proof vests and human shields, is mourned by the Jewish people and God.Each and every one of these children, treated as cannon fodder by Hamas in their genocidal war against Israel, is the equal of every Jewish child. The Torah, in its very first chapter is clear. God created every human being – Arab, Jew, Christian, Hindu, atheist, agnostic – alike and equal in his image.It is for this reason that Hamas, who are alleged to have stolen approximately half of the 820 metric tons, or 1.2 million pounds, of humanitarian aid that the United States military alone provided as of last May, and half of the more than 1000 trucks of aid that Israel also sent in as of the same date, must be destroyed and replaced with proper, democratic governance.The Fontainebleau has scores of Jewish guests, many with yarmulkes, staying there constantly. From this video, it does not appear that they are safe. Will the hotel, which I grew up just a few blocks from, finally take action to protect Jewish guests? These attacks are becoming more frequent and from the rage of the man who assaulted me, you can see the degree of the danger.It has to stop. That will not happen if the hotel does not cooperate with the police investigation and if its attorneys continue, as they have are alleged to have done, blaming me as an inciter for sitting quietly with a yarmulke and working on a laptop. Being Jewish is not a provocation.Attacked on different occasions So here we are. I grew up in Miami Beach, now live in New Jersey, and I’ve been attacked in the Fontainebleau on at least three occasions and each time I have complained to their management. I have been gracious and forgiving of the previous incidents, even as people pleaded with me before to hold them accountable and go public.I stupidly accepted their apparently fraudulent promise that they would retrain their security and protect the Jewish community. The lesson: we have no choice but to fight antisemitism. Whether the establishment is Jewish-owned or not makes no difference, and some might even argue that Jewish-owned and managed properties that condone, or cease to protect, against antisemitism are even more culpable.Already, Jewish tourists from all over the world are writing to me, and all over social media they are canceling their reservations at the Fontainebleau and rethinking Miami as a safe vacation destination. I don’t blame them. But then, all of America, indeed all of the world, is becoming infected with the Jew-hating disease.Will Governor Ron DeSantis, whom I honored at our 2018 gala at New York’s Plaza Hotel and helped to elevate nationally when he was an unknown Congressman, take action? He has proved to be one of Israel’s greatest champions and, as of this writing, is being spoken of as a possible replacement for Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense. But the Governor cannot watch the video of the Fontainebleau and turn a blind eye.The same is true of Miami Beach Mayor Steven Meiner, an Orthodox Jew whom I have met. He has yet to even reach out after this despicable incident in his city where an unhinged antisemite publicity threatened the life of a Rabbi known to him in his city’s most famous hotel. If these incidents, which are on the rise, don’t stop, Miami Beach, like Paris, Amsterdam, and London before it, will face a growing call for a boycott for a city that cannot protect its Jewish residents or tourists.The Islamist terrorists first and foremost want to harass, intimidate, assault, and murder “the public Jew,” those of us who are on the front lines visibly defending Israel and fighting antisemitism every day on television, social media, public platforms, and public rallies (our next giant Times Square rally for Israel, which we hold every eight weeks, is this Tuesday, December 11th).We are the ones who are particularly at risk because the terrorists want to shut us up and kill us. But of course, every Jew in America, including of course those who own and manage the Fontainebleau, are also at risk. But public Jews are the first targets, and we need law-enforcement to protect us or we will meet an early death, God forbid. It is a message I plan to bring God willing in a face-to-face meeting with Kash Patel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the FBI.Law enforcement must arrest and prosecute alleged unhinged antisemite Faiz Akbar who attacked me and threatened my life simply for being a Jew.This Sunday on the Jewish calendar, 7 Kislev, I will turn 58. In addition, we had a new grandson born to us the day after I was attacked, a beautiful occasion which was ruined utterly by having my life endangered at the Fontainebleau. My children ask me, Tatty, as you advance in years, what’s going through your mind? What’s your life’s work? What will your legacy be?It is simply this. I have devoted my life to ensuring that the sacred holocaust declaration of “Never Again” is not just an empty slogan but a sacred promise. Jewish life must finally have value. I will fight every day to ensure that it does. Enough is enough.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-832073","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/600776","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:45:49","author":"Shmuley Boteach","authors":["Shmuley Boteach"],"language":"en","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":270490756,"title":"Breaking News","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump said on Wednesday he has chosen former Senator Kelly Loeffler to head the Small Business Administration.\"Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive,\" Trump said in a statement.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-832078","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/534687","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:45:49","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.16},{"id":270490754,"title":"Breaking News","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday picked former congressman Billy Long to be commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service tax body.Trump cited Long's previous experience in real estate and as a business and tax advisor in a post on social-media site Truth Social, where he made the announcement.","url":"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-832077","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/534687","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:45:49","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.611},{"id":270490706,"title":"Mike Johnson Rejects Bidens Plea For Ukraine Funding And Instead Will Wait To Follow Trumps Orders N2648627","text":"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) is standing firm against the demands of lame-duck President Joe Biden. He rejected the outgoing administration's plea for additional funding for Ukraine. Johnson made it clear that he would not be taking orders from Biden but would instead wait for direction from the new commander-in-chief, President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson announced that he would not bring to the floor a request for $24 billion in aid to Ukraine. This followed reports that Biden was urgently pushing Congress to approve more assistance to Kyiv before his term ends. Johnson's move underscores his commitment to reevaluating foreign aid priorities under new leadership, which aligns with the views of Trump and many conservatives who question the growing U.S. involvement in Ukraine's war with Russia.\n\nBREAKING: Speaker Johnson rejects Biden's request for additional Ukraine funding, saying he will wait for direction from the new Commander-in-Chief.pic.twitter.com/4z70eJeqXj— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) December 4, 2024\n\nJohnson declared that Trump's election victory had shifted the dynamics of the Russia-Ukraine war. He said it is no longer Biden's privilege to decide on U.S. funding for the conflict. He told reporters that no additional Ukraine funding should be expected until Trump assumes office and evaluates the situation. He emphasized that the new leadership would consider a more strategic approach to the war.\n\nThis comes after the lame-duck administration announced a $725 million military package on Monday that includes air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket systems, and artillery for Ukraine. \n\nSince the war began in 2022, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with over $75 billion in military assistance, including various weapons, ammunition, training, intelligence support, and other military equipment such as air defense systems and tanks. The Biden-Harris Administration has also given the embattled country at least $20 billion in direct economic aid to help stabilize the foreign country’s economy. \n\nBiden recently called on Congress to provide $8 billion in several new aid packages to Ukraine to fund the war until 2026. He tried to peddle as much aid and funding to foreign countries as possible before Trump took office on January 20. The outgoing president’s request also included $16 billion for the Department of Defense to replenish stockpiles for foreign nations and to fund repairs for military equipment in DOD inventories.\n\nHowever, Republican lawmakers have pushed back against funding the endless war that is on the path to depleting the United States’ resources. Instead, they argue that the U.S. should focus on securing its own borders and addressing issues such as inflation and domestic infrastructure.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/04/mike-johnson-rejects-bidens-plea-for-ukraine-funding-and-instead-will-wait-to-follow-trumps-orders-n2648627","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/109/eca8f418-8a9e-4c9e-b90b-6e93f1916ac0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:45:48","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.022},{"id":270490708,"title":"Esquire Vaporizes Error Laden Column And Behold The Lack Of Outrage For Its Pushing Misinformation N2648639","text":"Well, the Joe Biden pardon continues to befuddle the media.

Yet while attributing this to ten current and former employees, none rise to a level beyond “sources say.”\n\nThis account of Hegseth’s time at Fox News is based on NBC News interviews with three current and seven former Fox employees, all of whom asked not to be named \n\nAs for the detrimental aspect of the alleged condition of the host, there is this scandalous description of his behavior:\n\nNone of the sources with whom NBC News has spoken could recall an instance when Hegseth missed a scheduled appearance because he’d been drinking. \n\nNEW: Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump’s pick for defense secretary, drank in ways that concerned his colleagues at Fox News, according to 10 current and former Fox employees who spoke with NBC News. https://t.co/JHIUnlhDmL— NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) December 3, 2024\n\nPresentation Paradox – THE DAILY BEAST\n\nAnnnnnd, once again the nameless cranks take priority over known individuals going on the record.\n\nAt The Daily Beast, they followed up on NBC’s coverage, declaring rather boldly that his “colleagues go public” with tales of his inebriation. If refusing to give your name to your accusation is going public, this is a fractured standard. But what is deeply revealing about this approach by NBC News, The Beast, and all other news outlets covering this story, is that there is a list of noteworthy names from Fox News who work alongside Hegseth and have gone on the record to refute these claims by unknown people with unknown positions and access. \n\nOne of his on-air partners, Will Cain, was rather resolute in his stance contesting the claim.\n\nBullshit. 100 percent bullshit. Actually…horseshit. https://t.co/GgD6Ax455q— Will Cain (@willcain) December 3, 2024\n\nBoth Kinds of Standards – CNN\n\nQuite a lot is missed by the media watchdog guy.\n\nRegarding that Esquire fiasco, it remains to be seen if one noted media analyst will ever get around to analyzing the mess. \n\nBUT – Given the Hegseth issues are concerning a Fox News personality, you knew this would prick up the ears of CNN’s media maven, Brian Stelter. He seemed to feel like he had pinned the network down, given its insufficient amount of coverage of the controversies, according to his expert measurement. \n\nBut this calls into question, then, issues concerning other networks that those networks avoid covering.\n\nSuch as CNN.\n\nWe have yet to spot Stelter’s coverage of the massive defamation suit that his network is facing, which has been moving through the courts for months.\n\nFor reference, here is the initial movement of the courts approving the case move forward:https://t.co/QzcnDjMMdfThen, after moves by CNN were repeatedly struck down, Jake Tapper is compelled to testify, and the legal team tried to rely on Sharia law.https://t.co/RYDzu8Vab8— Brad Slager: CNN+ Lifetime Subscriber (@MartiniShark) December 4, 2024\n\nGlossary Over Things – MSNBC\n\nDo dictionaries not exist in media circles?\n\nMolly Jong-Fast has been consistently untethered from reality in her scribblings, and she is among the class of media figures mewling that they will become targeted directly by Donald Trump and sent to jail, camps, or some other such hysterical fantasy.\n\nIn other words, she is the perfect guest to appear on the regular at MSNBC.

In doing so, he actually went full circle: The very first line of his statement emphasized their father-son relationship as well: “Today I signed a pardon for my son Hunter.”\n\nSo it was Biden’s open and close.\n\nHis PR team deliberately positioned it this way, of course. They had to: Hunter Biden isn’t a sympathetic character. He’s an adulterous, gun-toting addict who broke laws, ripped-off creditors, and used his dad’s connections to pocket millions of dollars he didn’t deserve. \n\nThat’s not exactly the resume of Atticus Finch.\n\nOn the merits of the case — or the strength of his character — Hunter Biden is a PR nightmare. He’s a spoiled, unlikeable trust fund kid who dotes on hookers, guns, and oodles of drugs. From his bizarre affair with his brother’s widow to denying paternity (and money) to a child he fathered with a stripper, Hunter Biden isn’t the kind of guy you can stick on “The View” and hope he charms middle America.\n\nThe opposite is true: The more we see and hear, the less we like.\n\nWhich is why the White House PR team emphasized their father-son relationship above all else. Even if Hunter was (is?) a dirtbag, surely we can understand a father’s love for his child! Why, any father would do the same!\n\nAll Joe Biden is guilty of is loving his son.\n\nTrouble is, everyone sitting in a jail cell right now is someone’s son or daughter. Many of them have sons and daughters of their own. But they don’t get a presidential pardon, because they didn’t roll a “BIDEN” in the genetic lottery.\n\nIt’s not fair.\n\nSo now, all the Democrats who’ve been huddled ‘round the campfire since 2016, hearing spooky stories about the Evil Orange Man, are looking at Joe and Hunter, and thinking to themselves, “Pass the pardon doobie, bro!”\n\nThey want to be protected from the Evil Orange Man, too. They’re not the president’s son, but they’re still perfectly capable of acting (and thinking) like little children. (Doesn’t that count?)\n\nPOLITICO broke an interesting story this evening: “Biden White House Is Discussing Preemptive Pardons for Those in Trump’s Crosshairs.”\n\n“Biden’s aides are deeply concerned about a range of current and former officials who could find themselves facing inquiries and even indictments, a sense of alarm which has only accelerated since Trump last weekend announced the appointment of Kash Patel to lead the FBI,” wrote POLITCO.\n\nFour names were explicitly mentioned as deserving of preemptive pardons: Sen.-elect Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Dr. Anthony Facui, and ex-Rep. Liz Cheney (formerly a Republican, formerly of Wyoming).\n\nTo all of you “unwashed masses,” this would seem sort of suspicious. Why issue blanket pardons to these three people who claim they’ve done nothing wrong — and who haven’t been charged with crimes? Don’t you have ANY faith in our judicial system? \n\nBecause otherwise, issuing blanket pardons sure sounds like the actions of a guilty man covering for his coconspirators.\n\nBut that’s just because you lack a liberal’s nuanced, sophisticated understanding of cause and effect. POLITICO made it abundantly clear that this is all [gestures wildly]… Trump’s fault:\n\nThat the conversations are taking place at all reflects the growing anxieties among high-level Democrats about just how far Trump’s reprisals could go once he reclaims power. The remarkable, 11-year breadth of Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter illustrated how worried the White House is about Trump officials seizing any potential openings for prosecution.\n\nCurses and drat! That blasted Trump forced President Biden into pardoning Hunter, and now he’s gonna make him pardon everyone else! That Donald Trump is a real troublemaker.\n\nFirst, President Biden swore there’d be no presidential pardon for Hunter. Then, on Sunday evening, he changed his tune and said he’d make an exception — but only for Hunter. \n\nWell, the rest of the Democrats had a “hold my beer” moment and figured, hey, since we’re sliding off that slippery slope anyway, the next obvious step is to also pardon everyone who’s kinda-sorta like Hunter… like me!\n\nConsider POLITICO’s article a test balloon.\n\nIt’s an attempt to move the goalposts one more time. But it won’t be the last time: There’s still (sigh) 47 days to go.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/scott-pinsker/2024/12/04/politico-predicts-presidential-pardons-for-anthony-fauci-liz-cheney-and-adam-schiff-n4934849","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/338/dde877a5-494b-463d-b5ed-600981bd5903.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:36:49","author":"Scott Pinsker","authors":["Scott Pinsker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":270489522,"title":"854675 The Most Commonly Mispronounced Words Of 2024","text":"The most commonly mispronounced words of 2024 \n\n(Web Desk) - The years may come and go, but one thing that never changes is people mispronouncing names and words - and 2024 was no different.\n\nIn fact, there was quite a lot of mispronouncing going on, and in the worlds of politics, pop culture and beyond, nothing was safe.\n\n“It’s a nice way to kind of look back into the year and see everything that has happened,” said Esteban Touma, a linguistic and cultural expert at Babbel, said [as reported by AP].\n\nHere's a rundown of the most mispronounced names and words in the US this year:\n\nKamala Harris [Comma-la]\n\nVice President Kamala Harris gained worldwide attention when she became the Democratic nominee for the US presidential election after President Joe Biden dropped out, and after campaigning she ultimately lost the election to Donald Trump.\n\nIt was during this election campaign that she had to combat with people mispronouncing her name - to which Harris's nieces, Amara and Leela gave the public a lesson on how to say their aunt's name during the DNC back in August.\n\n“First you say ‘Kama,’ like a comma in a sentence,” Amara said. “Then you say ‘La,’ like ‘la-la-la-la-la,’” Leela then added.\n\nShein [She-in]\n\nIt may be a popular fast fashion brand, but it seems a lot of us struggle with how to say Shein - the common way it is mistakenly said \"Sheen\".\n\nChappell Roan [Cha-puhl-rown]\n\nChappell Roan was one of this year's breakout artists, and although she was nominated for six Grammy awards it appears some still can't say her name correctly.\r\nSemaglutide [sem-ah-gloo-tide]\n\nOzempic, the treatment for type 2 diabetes which has also been used by celebrities for weight loss was widely talked about this year, but the active ingredient semaglutide is something we can't say right.\n\nZendaya [Zen-day-a]\n\nZendaya had some big movies out this year such as Challengers and Dune: Part II, but there are still people out there who say \"Zen-DIE-a\" instead of \"Zen-DAY-a\".\n\nDutch Kooikerhondje [Coy-ker-hund-che]\n\nThey make adorable pets, but not everyone gets the name of the Dutch Kooikerhondje right.\r\nBarry Keoghan [Barr-ee Key-oh-gin]\n\nThe Irish actor has had breakout roles in The Banshees of Inisherin and Saltburn, as well as his publicised relationship with pop star Sabrina Carpenter, but his surname has tripped people up.\n\nPhryge [Free-je]\n\n\r\nThe mascot of the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics are anthropomorphic Phrygian caps, a French symbol of liberty, though those who are not French may have had some trouble pronouncing the name of the mascot.\n\nPete Buttigieg [Peet Boo-tuh-juhj]\n\nDuring the election year, you may recognise US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg who made the TV rounds during the campaign -

Earlier in the day, Macron is to receive Barnier at 0900 GMT who will submit the resignation of the government.\n\nThe National Assembly debated a motion brought by the hard left in a standoff over next year's austerity budget, after the prime minister on Monday forced through a social security financing bill without a vote.\n\nWith the support of the far-right, a majority of 331 MPs in the 577-member chamber voted to oust the government.\n\n'CALLING ON MACRON TO GO'\n\nMacron flew back into Paris just ahead of the vote after wrapping up his three-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, an apparent world away from the domestic crisis.\n\nHe strolled earlier Wednesday through the desert sands of the Al-Ula oasis, an iconic tourist project of the kingdom, marvelling at ancient landmarks. After landing, he headed direct to the Elysee Palace.\n\n\"We are now calling on Macron to go,\" Mathilde Panot, the head of the parliamentary faction of the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party told reporters, urging \"early presidential elections\" to solve the deepening political crisis.\n\nBut taking care not to crow over the fall of the government, Le Pen said in a television interview that her party -- once a new premier is appointed -- \"would let them work\" and help create a \"budget that is acceptable for everyone\".\n\nLaurent Wauquiez, the head of right-wing deputies in parliament, said the far-right and hard-left bore the responsibility for a no-confidence vote that would \"plunge the country into instability\".\n\n'HIS FAILURE'\n\nMacron on Tuesday had rejected calls to resign, saying such a scenario amounted to \"political fiction\".\n\nWith markets nervous and France bracing for public-sector strikes against the threat of cutbacks, action that will shut schools and hit air and rail traffic, there is a growing sense of crisis.\n\nThe unions have called for civil servants, including teachers and air traffic controllers, to strike on Thursday over separate cost-cutting measures proposed by their respective ministries this autumn.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron is due to host a major international event Saturday, with the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral after the 2019 fire, with guests including Donald Trump on his first foreign trip since he was elected to be the next US president.\n\n\"His failure,\" was left-wing daily Liberation's front-page headline, with a picture of Macron, whose term runs until 2027.\n\n'SHATTERED STRATEGY'\n\nIn an editorial, Le Monde said Le Pen's move risked upsetting her own supporters, such as retirees and business leaders, by toppling the government.\n\n\"In the space of a few minutes, she shattered the strategy of normalisation she had consistently pursued,\" the daily said.\n\nSome observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier.\n\nLe Pen is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial. If found guilty in March, she could be blocked from participating in France's next presidential election.\n\nBut if Macron stepped down soon, an election would have to be called within a month, potentially ahead of the verdict in her trial.\n\nCandidates for the post of premier are few, but loyalist Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu and Macron's centrist ally Francois Bayrou are possible contenders.\n\nOn the left, Macron could turn to former Socialist premier and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, a contender in September.\n\nMacron is minded to appoint the new premier rapidly, several sources told AFP.\n\nIt was the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou's government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.\n\nThe lifespan of Barnier's government is also the shortest of any administration since the Fifth Republic began in 1958.","url":"https://www.dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/World/854686-french-government-falls-in-historic-noconfidence-vote","image":"https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2024/December/12-05-24/news_big_images/854686_69263168.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:34:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":270490344,"title":"Meet Jared Isaacman, the billionaire Trump picked to lead NASA","text":"Jared Isaacman isn't just a billionaire CEO.

He also does not like fluoride in water. By any measure, I don’t think he’s really someone to take seriously.\n\nHis beliefs also extend to thinking seed oils can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, obesity, and chronic tissue inflammation.\nThe argument is that when these undoubtedly ultra-processed oils are used, the Omega-6 fatty acids – previously considered a positive in lowering cardiovascular disease – that they contain in high concentrations are thought to turn rancid under high heat.\nWe all know that when good fats go bad, it sometimes leads to rather negative health effects. This is a concern because they are used by many restaurants and households to fry food.\nHowever, researchers and the actual science community overwhelmingly agree that seed oils are safe to consume. They may not be particularly beneficial in the nutritional sense but are no more harmful than many other processed food products. But science be damned.\nInterestingly, it appears MAGA (Make America Great Again) and now MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) people do not have an issue with the likes of Mountain Dew and McDonald’s.\n\nIt’s also ironic that the claims made by Kennedy used to make business-friendly Conservatives roll their eyes; they decried such petty concerns as whimpers from snowflakes. Now Republicans embrace him because he’s on Trump’s side.\nThe reason why the anti-seed-oil campaign is so tied to embittered right-wing reactionaries goes back to 2017, when a scientist named Dr Chris Knobbe suggested that such processed foods “are the primary and proximate cause of AMD (age-related macular degeneration)”.\nSomehow the MAGA/MAHA world has deduced that seed oils should now be demonised as another cause of white males and traditional values losing their place to women, gays and liberals.\nTypical of populist mobs, they focus on one single thing and blow it up into extremist paranoia, like turning a trickle of migrants into a raging torrent of criminal gang murderers flooding across the border.\nSo, in place of processed seed oils, the Trumpies propose we use tallow or animal fat. It’s why Kennedy wants to “make frying oil tallow again” and recently deep-fried a turkey in beef fat for Thanksgiving.\n\nNever mind that all diets high in fried fats are bad for the heart.

the year, accentuating a half a decade of economic strife between the world’s two largest economies.\nA spokeswoman for the New York-based Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, known for merger and acquisition cases plus other corporate law work, said it would continue its Asia business through offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo.\nThe company – known as Paul, Weiss for short – opened its Beijing office in 1981 to become one of the first foreign practices with an office in mainland China.\nThe closure would follow at least 11 others in China over the past two years, reflecting a dearth of China business and competition from local peers, analysts and industry media reports said.\nForeign multinational clients have pulled back from China on account of trade and tech disputes that arose during US president-elect Donald Trump’s first term in the White House between 2017-21, analysts said.\nDuring his campaign this year, Trump has since pledged tariffs of up to 60 per cent on Chinese goods after he returns to office next month.\n\nAnd last week, Trump said that he would add a 10 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports – on top of duties already in place – on his first day in office.\n“As the Trump 2.0 cabinet and policies take shape, the market anticipates further negative impact and disruption to global and US-China business flows,” said Nicholas Chen, managing partner with Pamir Law Group, which has offices in Shanghai and Taipei.\n“The anticipated US tariffs and economic targeting of Chinese will increasingly and directly hurt US supply chains and consumers.\n“This in turn hurts US service providers like law firms in China.”\nForeign clients of US law firms feel less interest than before 2017 in making direct investments in China, or taking part in Chinese initial public offerings, analysts said, impacting two possible sources of legal business.\nThe practices may worry that their lawyers would be detained for representing foreign

corner in terms of investment and trade,” said Joe Simone, a partner with Simone Intellectual Property Services in Hong Kong.\n“If they don’t see China as a place to make money, then what’s the

six-figure severance after leaving veterans' group, sources say","text":"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for secretary of defense, received a six-figure severance payment and signed a non-disclosure agreement when he exited the organization Concerned Veterans of America. The payment came amid allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety, as well as dissension among its leaders over Hegseth's foreign policy views.The Army veteran turned Fox News host signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down as CEO in January 2016, two sources associated with Concerned Veterans of America told CBS News, with one source saying the agreement included a financial payout. The CVA sources spoke to CBS News under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss legally-binding contracts, while also fearing professional reprisal. Public tax filings reviewed by CBS News confirm that Hegseth was paid more than $172,000 between October 2016 and September 2017 – well after Hegseth's formal departure from his role as CEO of Concerned Veterans from America in January 2016. Hegseth remained listed on tax filings as a former CEO working 50 hours a week between 2016 and 2017. An archived 2016 biography on Hegseth's website described him as a Fox News contributor and host, and did not list an ongoing role with Concerned Veterans for America. In a statement to the Military Times at the time of his departure, Hegseth said he was leaving the organization to focus on releasing a book and other advocacy work, while CVA said it wished him well \"in all future endeavors.\"Contacted by CBS News, Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, did not return a response before publication. But the embattled former Fox News host on Wednesday pushed back on reports that Trump is considering other candidates for defense secretary. On Capitol Hill as he continued to visit Republican members of Congress, Hegseth told CBS News that he does not intend to withdraw his name from consideration. He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.Experts consulted by CBS News said severance payments and non-disclosure agreements for outgoing CEOs are common. Such payments are issued for a number of reasons, including to maintain professional relationships, to work as an adviser to an incoming CEO, or to provide a soft landing for departing leaders, they said.Hegseth has contested the allegation that he was forced out of his CEO position. On Dec. 4 he retweeted a letter obtained by the New York Post on X, saying: \"Read for yourself. You'll see the truth is on our side.\" The letter, written on Concerned Veterans of American letterhead in January 2016, was authorized by Randy Lair, a trustee of the veterans' advocacy group. \"The truth is Pete resigned his position as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America as a result of a difference of opinion as to the future of the organization and so that he could focus on other endeavors, including, his relationship with Fox News,\" Lair wrote in part. He added: \"Pete was not terminated by the organization and, in fact, we at CVA worked with him though this difficult decision and mutually agreed the end of 2015 was the best timing for both parties…The bottom line is that Pete Hegseth voluntarily resigned his position and CVA recognizes and appreciates his accomplishments as CEO.\" Sources affiliated with Concerned Veterans of America at the time of Hegseth's tenure told CBS News that there was a \"difference of opinion\" over Hegseth steering the organization toward advocacy for foreign policy views that championed military intervention. Senior leaders of the organization strongly opposed Hegseth's foreign policy advocacy over its historical mission of backing conservative fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, the sources also highlighted what Lair's letter did not mention, specifically internal assessments of Hegseth's handling of the organization's finances and the alleged incidents of intoxication and sexual misconduct, which Hegseth and Parlatore, his attorney, have denied. Hegseth's financial record at Concerned Veterans for America Hegseth led Vets for Economic Freedom Trust, operating as Concerned Veterans for America, from 2012 to 2016. Tax records show that, during three of the five years of his leadership, the organization spent more money than it raised from donations and other means. Filings for October 2012 to September 2013 show the organization brought in $3.8 million but spent $3.9 million, representing a shortfall of $130,000. Hegseth's CEO compensation is listed as $67,500. Filings for October 2013 to September 2014 show revenue swelled $15.7 million but the organization spent $16.1 million — including $8.6 million on advertising and promotion — resulting in a shortfall of $428,000. Hegseth's salary is listed as $144,894. Filings for October 2014 to September 2015 show Hegseth's salary grew to $182,549 and the organization ran a surplus for the first time since 2011, with revenue of $14.1 million and expenses of just under $14 million. However, the organization again spent more than it raised the following year, when Hegseth was listed as the outgoing CEO. Filings for October 2015 to September 2016 show the organization raised just under $16 million but spent $16.4 million, resulting in a shortfall of $437,000. The filings show expenses at the organization were slashed after Hegseth's departure. From October 2016 to September 2017, compensation, salaries and wages were reduced to $2 million, down from almost $7 million the previous year. Spending on travel was reduced to $416,000, down from almost $2.4 million, and spending on conferences, conventions and meetings amounted to $124,000, down from $2.4 million.Hegseth has denied allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety at the organization. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal published Dec. 4, Hegseth said, \"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers — yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house. That's just untrue.\"Allegations at Vets for Freedom Prior to joining Concerned Veterans for America, Hegseth led Vets for Freedom (VFF) from 2007 to 2010, where he also faced allegations of financial mismanagement. In 2008, the organization raised $8.7 million, but spent $9.1 million. Filings show it received a loan of $20,000 to \"provide additional liquidity to the organization.\" The New Yorker reported that donors were concerned their money was being wasted and arranged for VFF to be merged with another organization, Military Families United, which took over most of its management. Revenue at VFF dwindled to $268,000 by 2010 and by 2011, the organization's revenue was listed as $22,000. Hegseth joined Concerned Veterans for America the following year. Margaret Hoover, host of the PBS program \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million. \"I don't know how he's going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years,\" she said.","summary":"Pete Hegseth, President-elect Trump's pick for secretary of defense, received a six-figure sum after he left Concerned Veterans for America amid allegations of financial mismanagement, intoxication and sexual impropriety, all of which he denies.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-hegseth-signed-nda-received-six-figure-payment-after-leaving-concerned-veterans-for-america/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/04/5396d6ba-c3a1-4b65-981a-81669ce37e64/thumbnail/1200x630/5f537fad3e39c18661dbbf4685155841/gettyimages-2187517427.jpg?v=0c07a24f1ac5eb64b06f31185829f707","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3381936_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:30:01","author":"James Laporta,Rhona Tarrant","authors":["James Laporta","Rhona Tarrant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":270489784,"title":"War criminals, creepo dad: The Trump pardons that defy belief","text":"The French, regularly described as “the oldest ally of the United States” by American politicians looking for a leg-up in the gorgeous halls of the Élysée Palace, must be thrilled.\n\nDonald Trump’s pick for the next US Ambassador to Paris, you may have noted, is one Charles Kushner.\n\n“Tu es serieux?” a world-weary Parisian might mutter. “You’re serious?”\n\nKushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2005 for tax evasion, 16 campaign funding felonies and witness tampering.","summary":"The “prerogative of mercy” was once a matter of life and death, as one of my ancestors discovered.

Tony Radakin, the UK's chief of defense staff, disclosed that Israel used its F-35s to carry out the widespread October 26 strikes against military sites across Iran, including air-defense systems and missile-manufacturing facilities.It appeared to mark the first confirmation from a Western government that Israel had used its fifth-generation aircraft in the operation, which came in response to a massive Iranian missile attack at the start of the month. It was reported at the time that Israel flew its F-35s and fired air-launched ballistic missiles.\"Israel used more than 100 aircraft, carrying fewer than 100 munitions, and with no aircraft getting within 100 miles of the target in the first wave, and that took down nearly the entirety of Iran's air-defense system,\" Radakin said during a Royal United Services Institute lecture in London.\"It has destroyed Iran's ability to produce ballistic missiles for a year and left Tehran with a strategic dilemma in how it responds. That is the power of [fifth-generation] aircraft, combined with exquisite targeting and extraordinary intelligence,\" Radakin said. \"And that was all delivered from a single sortie.\"He said the operation demonstrates the \"disproportionate advantage of modern ways of fighting.\" Business Insider contacted the Israel Defense Forces about Radakin's remarks but has yet to receive a response.The F-35 is a single-engine, multi-role stealth aircraft made by US defense contractor Lockheed Martin. There are several variants of the fighter jet, which took its first flight nearly 20 years ago and are now flown by a handful of countries around the world.Israel was the first to use the F-35 in combat in 2018. It operates just under 40 F-35I jets, a subvariant of the F-35A model, although this fleet will expand to 75 in the coming years.The F-35I is Israel's only fifth-generation aircraft. It also has older, American-made F-16 and F-15 fighter jets.Radakin's praise of the fifth-generation platform comes after Elon Musk criticized the F-35, the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program but widely considered a cornerstone of US airpower. The SpaceX CEO and advisor to President-elect Donald Trump took to social media last month to rag on the aircraft over its design and brushed off its stealth capabilities.

Ron DeSantis for Secretary of Defense if Hegseth cannot clear confirmation.\n\nHegseth’s nomination to lead the largest branch of the U.S. government and its millions of employees was met with immediate surprise by Washington insiders and defense experts alike, many of whom noted that Hegseth had never led a company or battalion, to say nothing of his inexperience at handling a multi-billion dollar budget.\n\nHegseth, 44, is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. A former infantry platoon-level commander, he deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He left the military after serving part-time for nearly two decades at the rank of Major and being awarded a pair of bronze stars.\n\nSince leaving the military Hegseth has taken a leadership role at a pair of veterans organizations and a gig as a Sunday commentator on Fox News. He is also a best-selling author. Trump apparently considered Hegseth as a potential Veterans Affairs Secretary during his first administration but backed off when he was informed Hegseth would never clear confirmation.\n\nIt is unclear if he will find the support required to make it past the Senate’s “advice and consent” role in the nomination process. After Trump tapped Hegseth for the job, an allegation of rape — which he denies — and a letter penned by his mother labeling him a serial womanizer were made public.\n\nThis was followed by allegations Hegseth was frequently drunk while working for Fox and forced to step away from one of his charities.

Byron Donalds of Florida and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nAlthough specific reasons for their exclusion have not been disclosed, various factors may have influenced these decisions, leading political analysts and observers to speculate on the underlying motivations.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on CNN’s “Laura Coates Live,” Rep. Byron Donalds candidly addressed his exclusion from Trump’s Cabinet. When asked if he was surprised not to have been chosen for a senior role, The Hill reported.\n\n“All I will say is I am not surprised that I have not been named, but that doesn’t mean I’m not going to do other things in the future.”\n\nWhen pressed by Coates about whether Trump had personally asked him to take on a position within his administration, Donalds’ reply was:\n\n“No. There are some other things that I’m looking at going forward.” Despite being a staunch ally of Trump, who considered him for the vice presidential shortlist, Donalds’ current stance indicates a readiness to pursue alternative opportunities.\n\nTrump’s Cabinet is taking shape with a focus on personal loyalty and political alignment. For example, Trump nominated Scott Turner, a former NFL player and motivational speaker, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which marks him as the sole African American in the Cabinet. In selecting other key figures, including former Fox News personality Pete Hegseth and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Trump seems to be prioritizing allies who align closely with his policies and view of governance.\n\nWhile the lack of representation of Black Republicans in key roles is notable, it raises critical questions about the political strategy at play. The decisions may reflect a combination of Trump’s preferences for loyalists and strategic calculations regarding overall Cabinet dynamics and public perception.\n\nIn summary, the reasons for the exclusion of prominent figures like Rep. Byron Donalds and Sen. Tim Scott from Trump’s Cabinet remain largely unspecified. Still, it is reasonable to speculate that loyalty, strategic considerations, and the individual career aspirations of these politicians influenced the selection process.

However, the song finally made it to #1 on a Billboard chart after over 45 years (and held on to #1 for two weeks) due to the President-elect’s use.”\n\nAccording to Willis, the song is “estimated to gross several million dollars” since Trump began using it while campaigning. \n\n“Therefore, I’m glad I allowed the President-elect’s continued use of Y.M.C.A. And I thank him for choosing to use my song,” he added. \n\nAccording to Willis, the song is not about the gay community. \n\n“There’s been a lot of talk, especially of late, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem,” Willis wrote. “As I’ve said numerous times in the past, that is a false assumption based on the fact that my writing partner was gay, and some (not all) of Village People were gay, and that the first Village People album was totally about gay life.”\n\nHe continued, “This assumption is also based on the fact that the YMCA was being used as some sort of gay hangout, and since one of the writers was gay and some of the Village People are gay, the song must be a message to gay people. To that I say once again, get your minds out of the gutter. It is not.”\n\nWillis added, “When I say, ‘hang out with all the boys’ that is simply 1970s Black slang for Black guys hanging out together for sports, gambling or whatever,” he said of one of the song’s most notable lyrics. “There’s nothing gay about that.”\n\nThe artist concluded: “The true anthem is Y.M.C.A.’s appeal to people of all [stripes] including President-elect Trump. But the song is not a gay anthem other than certain people falsely suggesting that it is. And this must stop because it is damaging to the song.”\n\nREAD MORE FROM EURWEB.COM: Bill Maher Considers Quitting HBO’s Real Time Amid Trump Fatigue: ‘I’m Sh**ing My Pants’ | WATCH","url":"https://eurweb.com/2024/village-people-singer-defends-trumps-use-of-ymca/","image":"https://eurweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Village-People-and-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:26:50","author":"Ny Magee","authors":["Ny Magee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":270488638,"title":"Dollar Tree Prices May Rise As Trumps Tariffs Impact Goods","text":"New York (CNN) — President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff plans may change what products customers can find on Dollar Tree’s shelves – and push the chain to increase prices again.\n\nThe discount retailer said on its earnings call Wednesday that Trump’s plans to tax imported goods may lead it to alter some product specifications, change sizes, or remove them from stores altogether if they become too costly. Dollar Tree may also raise prices from their current level of $1.25.\n\n“We believe there is a wide range of potential actions that we can take to help mitigate additional tariffs if and when they materialize,” Dollar Tree interim CEO Michael Creedon said on the call.\n\nDollar Tree, which also owns Family Dollar, did not say which products it may axe or hike prices on.\n\nTrump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariffs on goods coming from China. Tariffs are taxes placed on imported goods designed to protect domestic manufacturers. Companies that import products pay taxes and typically pass the extra cost on to customers in the form of higher prices.\n\nAn estimated 40% of Dollar Tree’s sales are reliant on imported goods, leaving the retailer highly exposed to tariffs, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysis. Dollar Tree said it will negotiate with vendors and shift where it gets its items from to alternate countries if tariffs take effect, a similar response to how it handled Trump’s tariffs during his first administration.\n\nDollar Tree may also raise prices to combat tariffs, joining a growing list of chains from Walmart to Best Buy that say that will hike prices to offset any impact.\n\nIn 2021, Dollar Tree raised base prices to $1.25 after 30 years of selling items for just a dollar. Dollar Tree also sells some products for up to $7.\n\nThis “multi-price” strategy gives the chain more flexibility to raise prices if an item becomes too expensive because of tariffs, Creedon said.\n\nUBS analyst Michael Lasser expects Dollar Tree to raise its fixed $1.25 prices by 10 or 20 cents to mitigate the tariff impact, he said in a research report last month.\n\nTariffs may be another hit to Dollar Tree, adding to its struggles. Its CEO stepped down last month and shares of the company have plunged more than 40% this year.\n\nDollar Tree’s low and middle-income customer base has been stung by higher prices, and they have stopped buying as much of the chain’s home furnishings and knickknacks the retailer is known for.\n\nMORE NEWS ON EURWEB.COM: All That Shilling and Sucking Up to Trump = No Payoff for Tim Scott and Byron Donalds in Administration – D.L.

Here’s how they can do it.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Skrmetti, a case challenging a 2023 Tennessee law banning genital surgery and puberty blockers for minors suffering from gender dysphoria. The case is an important reminder that, despite overwhelming popular opposition to the transgender movement, rolling back the Left’s last four years of transgender ideology won’t come easy. \n\nConsider the flack that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson faced just last month when—prompted by the election of Tim McBride, a “transgender” congressman from Delaware—he announced a new rule ensuring that the women’s restrooms and locker rooms in Congress are reserved for, well, women. \n\nOr take the example of South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace, who faced death threats recently after she introduced the Protecting Women’s Private Spaces Act, which would prevent men from using women’s private, protected facilities on all federal property.\n\nDespite these attempts at intimidation, conservatives owe it to the American people to keep their eye on the ball.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2021—Joe Biden’s very first day in office—he signed executive order 13988, which changed the substance of more than 100 laws by requiring every federal agency to expand its prohibitions on sex discrimination to include “gender identity or expression” discrimination. And for the next four years, Democrats aggressively pushed gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and dorm rooms; advanced pronoun-related speech codes; and advocated for men to compete in women’s sports.\n\nThe predictable result of this radical social experiment was a raft of injuries sustained by teen girls and millions of hardworking Americans throwing their support behind Republicans this election.\n\nNow, with control of the White House and majorities in both chambers of Congress, Republicans have a moral obligation to go on offense and roll back the Left’s transgender agenda. Protecting women on Capitol Hill is a fine place to start, but conservatives can’t stop until we’ve guaranteed the safety of our mothers, sisters, and daughters across the country.\n\nFixing Title IX should be at the top of the agenda. The simple, five-decades-old civil rights law meant to guarantee equality between men and women was abused by Biden’s Department of Education, which expanded the law to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and expression. Now, half the nation sits in a state of suspended animation as legal challenges to the new rule make their way through the courts.\n\nThankfully, the solution is simple. Come Jan. 20, 2025, President-elect Donald Trump can short circuit the legal process by revoking executive order 13988 and retiring it for good. After that, the White House can issue informal guidance to stakeholders in all federally funded fields impacted by gender identity, such as education and medicine. Hospitals, universities, medical clinics, and the like should all be immediately informed that sex once again means male and female—as it always has.\n\nOnce this warning shot is fired, the Trump administration must direct its attention to enforcement. First and foremost, that means launching investigations into schools and colleges that perpetuate sex discrimination by opening bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms, and sports teams to men parading as women. These schools should lose their federal funding and be subject to increased taxation on their endowments. If necessary, Republicans should also consider revoking their accreditation.\n\nFinally, Trump’s new Cabinet must take on the daunting task of agency rulemaking. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, the Food and Drug Administration, and several other federal agencies have issued rules on gender identity. One by one, these rules must be rescinded, and new rules must be launched.\n\nThese rules should indicate that “sex”—for purposes of all impacted federal laws outlawing sex discrimination—is to be interpreted as sex, not gender identity or transgender status. Moreover, they should clarify that the institutions that adhere to sex antidiscrimination law will not be in jeopardy of losing federal funding for enforcing those laws according to male and female definitions.\n\nCongress, for its part, should consider ways to clarify that sex means male and female, not some infinite spectrum of options. Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall’s recent bill, the Defining Male and Female Act of 2024, is a good example of this sort of legislation.\n\nMillions of American girls have spent the last four years in fear of sexual assaults in gender-neutral bathrooms, in frustration after losing out on scholarships and sports titles to men, and infuriated as they’ve been forced to use “preferred pronouns.” This never should have happened, but now that the Democrats’ social experiment has made it all the way to Capitol Hill, it is time for conservatives in Washington to wake up.\n\nWith the support of the American people—including millions of independent, moderate, and even Democratic women—Washington’s new leadership must abolish the Left’s radical gender ideology once and for all.","summary":"America wants Republicans to roll back the Left’s “transgender” agenda.

No.\"\n\nMr Hegseth also spent Wednesday lobbying senators — who must confirm Trump's cabinet picks — not to block his appointment to the defence secretary role.\n\nHe said he had spoken to Trump that morning, and Trump had told him \"I got your back\" but \"you need to be as tough as shit\".\n\nMultiple US media outlets have reported that Trump has been considering replacing Mr Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He was Trump's one-time rival for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, who Trump has previously referred to as \"Ron DeSanctimonious\".\n\n'Ridiculous narrative'\n\nThe New Yorker report cited anonymous former colleagues and multiple documents, including one compiled by ex-employees of the Concerned Veterans for America group, where Mr Hegseth was president from 2013 to 2016.\n\nThe document said Mr Hegseth, who was married, was frequently drunk on the job and often sexually pursued female staff, who he and members of his management team had categorised as \"party girls\" and \"not party girls\".\n\nOne former employee's letter of complaint said he drunkenly chanted \"kill all Muslims\" at a bar while on a work trip in Ohio. Another said that he \"treated the organisation funds like they were a personal expense account — for partying, drinking, and using CVA events as little more than opportunities to 'hook up' with women on the road\".\n\nMr Hegseth blamed \"disgruntled\" staff, who he said were fired for good reasons, for spreading false stories as an act of retribution while refusing to put their names to their claims.\n\n\"The media's driving with this ridiculous narrative,\" he told Kelly. \"They're going to make it up just like they have so far — all anonymous, all innuendo, all rumour, nothing sourced, no verification.\"\n\nHis mother, Penelope Hegseth, meanwhile appeared on Fox News to discuss an email she sent Mr Hegseth which later appeared in the New York Times.\n\nIn the 2018 email, she wrote:\n\n\"On behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way, I say … get some help and take an honest look at yourself.\"… I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.\"\n\nMs Hegseth said she wrote the email during an emotional time, when her son and his then-wife were going through a painful divorce.\n\n\"I wrote that in haste,\" she told Fox News. \"I wrote that out of love, and about two hours later I retracted it with an apology email.\" She said her son was now a \"new person, redeemed, changed\".\n\n\"I believe he's the man for the job,\" Ms Hegseth said. \"Being a TV news host, I think, prepares you for most things in a position like this — you're a good communicator, you have to think on your feet, you take charge.\"\n\nThe defence secretary role would put Mr Hegseth in charge of the Pentagon and make him leader of America's 1.3 million active-duty military members.\n\nIf Trump decides to replace Mr Hegseth, he'll become the second of Trump's picks not to make it to the Senate confirmation process after divisive ex-congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew as nominee for attorney-general.","summary":"Donald Trump's defence secretary nominee says he's the victim of a media smear campaign, and he'll \"fight like hell\" for the job — despite reports the president-elect is already considering replacing him with his one-time Republican rival.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-12-05/pete-hegseth-donald-trump-defence-secretary-appointment/104687770","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4f6acc0fef92cd39d269035a6e223007?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=42&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:22:13","author":"Brad Ryan","authors":["Brad Ryan"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":270488048,"title":"Blinken Ukraine Must Make Hard But Necessary Decisions","text":"In his final appearance at NATO headquarters as U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken spoke about Ukraine and what he said are the hard, but necessary, decisions it must make about mobilizing its forces on the front lines to “deal with Russian aggression.”\n\nAt the meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, the top U.S. diplomat said the alliance has made a commitment “for every person, every soldier that Ukraine mobilizes.” He said NATO is “committed” to ensuring that Ukraine has “the training and the equipment they need to effectively defend the country.”\n\nSeparately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is urging the Atlantic alliance to provide Ukraine with enough support to change what he called the “trajectory” of the war with Russia. He made his comments after meeting with the foreign ministers. Additionally, Rutte urged European countries to boost their defense spending. He said spending 2% of GDP on military budgets is not enough for deterrence.\n\nDuring former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first term in office, he criticized NATO for not spending more money on defense. Trump also has refused to say he wants Ukraine to defeat Russia and voiced skepticism about continued U.S. military aid. Trump has said he will resolve the war before he takes office January 20 but has not explained how that would happen.\n\nIn addition to the war in Ukraine, the foreign ministers Tuesday discussed what Rutte said was an “escalating campaign” of Russian hostile actions toward NATO countries, including acts of sabotage and cybercrimes.\n\nDrone attacks\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 29 of 50 drones that Russia launched in its latest round of overnight attacks.\n\nThe intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Ternopil regions, the Ukrainian air force said.\n\nOfficials in Kharkiv reported damage to a business from a downed drone, while officials in Sumy said Russian shelling damaged several buildings.\n\nRussia’s defense ministry said Tuesday it shot down 24 Ukrainian drones overnight, and 11 more early in the day.\n\nOfficials in Russia’s Ryazan region said a drone damaged four houses but caused no casualties.\n\nUkrainian drones were also shot down over the Rostov, Bryansk, Belgorod, Krasnodar, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said.\n\nSome information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-ukraine-must-make-hard-but-necessary-decisions/7887535.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/29E34286-D660-4A23-88E9-0FCFCAF0B734_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:21:49","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"et","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":270488046,"title":"Pete Hegseth Trump Pick To Lead Pentagon Says He Is Fighting On For Confirmation","text":"Pete Hegseth, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, said Wednesday he is continuing his fight to win Senate confirmation, even as news accounts say Trump is considering whether to name someone else.\n\nThe nomination of Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated military officer and Fox News talk show host, to lead the Pentagon has run into headwinds in the Senate, which must confirm his nomination, as he faces questions about allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking.\n\nWith no history of managing a large organization, either in the military or corporate world, Hegseth is an unconventional choice to oversee the country’s nearly 2.9 million active duty and reserve troops across the world, along with another 700,000 civilians who work for the military.\n\nBut Hegseth said he is not backing down, even as several U.S. news accounts say Trump is reconsidering the appointment, possibly in favor of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a former military officer. DeSantis is a Navy veteran who unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before withdrawing in January.\n\nOn social media platform X, Hegseth said, \"I’m doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers. The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of @realDonaldTrump — and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don’t want truth. Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.”\n\nAt the U.S. Capitol, as he headed to meet with senators faced with deciding whether to confirm him, Hegseth told reporters, “I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said, ‘Keep going, keep fighting. I’m behind you all the way.’ … Why would I back down?”\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday that 10 current and former Fox employees told the network that Hegseth’s co-workers at Fox had been concerned by his alcohol consumption, including occasions when he showed up at work smelling of alcohol and talking about being hung over. Other news accounts have raised questions about Hegseth’s partying and drinking at veterans’ groups he oversaw.\n\nHegseth is also facing questions about a 2017 encounter at a Republican women’s conference in California where a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her after extensive drinking. He told police investigating her claim that the encounter was consensual, and no charges were filed.\n\nA couple of years later, however, Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed amount to keep her from filing a lawsuit that Hegseth feared would get him fired from his weekend show at Fox.\n\nOne Trump ally, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, on Tuesday called the allegations against Hegseth \"very disturbing,\" and he said that some of them are \"going to be difficult\" for some senators considering his nomination.\n\nRepublican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the incoming Senate majority leader, said Hegseth must address the troubling allegations he faces.\n\n“There are hard questions being raised, so he’ll have to answer those,” Thune said.\n\nRepublicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate in January, meaning Hegseth can lose the support of no more than three Republicans, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, if necessary. Hegseth is unlikely to win any Democratic support.\n\nIn other presidential transition news, Trump on Wednesday named Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser in his first White House term, to be his senior counsel for trade and manufacturing when he is inaugurated January 20.\n\nNavarro served four months in prison earlier this year for defying a congressional subpoena investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol as about 2,000 Trump supporters tried to block lawmakers from certifying that Trump had lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump described Navarro, 75, as “a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.”\n\nThe president-elect also named Daniel Driscoll, a former soldier and Iraq war veteran, as secretary of the Army. Additionally, Trump plans to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees securities markets and investments.\n\nSo far, two of Trump’s choices for top-level jobs — Chad Chronister to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and Matt Gaetz for U.S. attorney general — have dropped out.","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/pete-hegseth-trump-pick-to-lead-pentagon-says-he-is-fighting-on-for-confirmation/7887538.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/A6087A35-C4C4-4AE4-AA05-2A26CAF79B62_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:21:49","author":"Ken Bredemeier","authors":["Ken Bredemeier"],"language":"en","source_country":"et","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":270489894,"title":"Speaker Johnson sets eyes on cutting government spending, vows to take a 'blowtorch' to the 'regulatory state'","text":"House Speaker Mike Johnson said he \"would like to\" cut spending for Planned Parenthood and PBS as Republicans look for ways to trim the fat of government spending through the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

DEM LAWMAKER JOINS REPUBLICAN-LED DOGE CAUCUS WITH PUSH TO REMOVE SECRET SERVICE FROM DHS Johnson added that the creation of DOGE is a \"generational opportunity\" to bring about transformational change within the administrative state and limit wasteful government spending. President-elect Donald Trump tapped Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk in November to lead DOGE, writing on his Truth Social account that the two would \"pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies — Essential to the 'Save America' Movement.\" Musk suggested at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in late October that the U.S. budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2 trillion. Johnson said he invited Ramaswamy and Musk to Capitol Hill on Thursday. He wants all Senate and House Republicans to come together and hold a \"brainstorming session\" to formulate plans for the new Congress. \"We've got a long list of areas where we know there are waste, fraud and abuses, and [the] Oversight Committee's been doing a lot of aggressive work on that. We'll end the Oversight Committee in the House. We've just created a new subcommittee that will be laser-focused on that, finding the places for the easy cuts. And then it's about scaling back the regulatory state,\" he said. BERNIE SANDERS ADMITS ‘ELON MUSK IS RIGHT’ TO SLASH PENTAGON WITH DOGE: ‘LOST TRACK OF BILLIONS’ \"We have the ingredients.

He promised to carry out the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.After Trump won the election against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, he announced his plans to appoint immigration hard-liners Tom Homan, his former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director, and Stephen Miller, his former senior adviser, to serve in his new administration.Los Angeles' Immigration Enforcement HistoryLos Angeles last month officially became a sanctuary city, prohibiting any city resources from being utilized for any immigration enforcement, \"on the heels of the election of Donald J. Trump, who has expressed broad support for mass deportations across the country,\" according to a news release from Los Angeles City Councilmember Nithya Raman, one of the members who introduced a motion to create the ordinance.The LAPD has not stopped people or taken action for any reason related to their immigration status and hasn't enforced immigration laws for 45 years, the department's new chief, Jim McDonnell, told the Associated Press (AP), referring to an LAPD policy known as Special Order 40 enacted in 1979.McDonnell, a veteran police officer and former sheriff, was selected by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass in October to lead the LAPD and was sworn in last month.Any immigration enforcement would be \"undercutting our primary mission, which is to be able to build public trust to work with every member of all of our communities, to be able to have hope that people will come forward if they were a victim of crime, a witness to a crime,\" McDonnell told the AP.LAPD's Plan to Protect ImmigrantsMcDonnell told the AP that the LAPD is working with consulate offices for Mexico and other Central American countries to draft a plan to protect immigrants ahead of Trump's mass deportation plans.Newsweek reached out to Trump's team via email for comment Wednesday evening.The LAPD in partnership with the consulates intend to create and circulate a video explaining their policies to the immigrant community to alleviate its concerns.McDonnell said the department is \"cognizant of what's at stake.\"During Trump's first presidency, the U.S. Department of Justice withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to sanctuary cities. This policy was repealed by President Joe Biden's Justice Department.This article includes reporting from the Associated Press.","summary":"The LAPD is working with consulate offices for Mexico and other Central American countries to draft a plan to protect immigrants.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jim-mcdonnell-lapd-mass-deportation-donald-trump-1995798","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2536460/jim-mcdonnel.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:19:34","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":270488262,"title":"Boston school custodian accused of assaulting 3 school workers: ‘You all cost me money’","text":"Skip to content\n\nAll Sections\n\n \n Subscribe Now \n \n\n Wednesday, December 4th 2024 \n\nE-Edition \n \n\n \n Home Page\n\nCrime & Public Safety\n\nYour Tax Dollars At Work\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBest Reviews\n\nReal Estate\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nSubmit a Letter\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nCollege Sports\n\nHigh School Sports\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElection 2024\n\nState House\n\nBoston City Hall\n\nEntertainment\n\nEntertainment\n\nTV and Streaming\n\nMusic and Concerts\n\nFun & Games\n\nSpecial Sections\n\nRestaurants Food & Drink\n\nBoston Herald Store\n\nNews Obituaries\n\nPlace an Obituary\n\nClose Menu \n\nSign up for email newsletters\n\n Sign Up\n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Boston school custodian accused of assaulting 3… \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\n Account Settings\n Contact Us\n Log Out\n\n Spoof a user\n\nSign up for email newsletters\n\n Sign Up\n\n Wednesday, December 4th 2024 \n\nE-Edition \n \n\nCrime & Public Safety \n\nYour Tax Dollars\n\nMassachusetts\n\n Trending: \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Ron DeSantis \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Snow forecast \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Karen Read update \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Tania Fernandes Anderson \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Judge Shelley Joseph \n\nBreaking News\n \n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Boston school custodian accused of assaulting 3 school workers: ‘You all cost me money’ \n\nDecember 4, 2024 at 7:19 pm \n\nCrime & Public Safety\n\nSubscriber Exclusive\n\nCrime & Public Safety | \n\n Boston school custodian accused of assaulting 3 school workers: ‘You all cost me money’ \n\nThe custodian is facing assault and battery charges\n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\n Boston police officers responded to the Mildred Avenue School for an assault earlier this year.

She compared Harris’ experience to her own professional journey.\n\n“Yes, I take the reelection of Donald Trump quite personally because of the person themselves, but also as a Black woman,” she explained. “And that is because I think for a lot of Black women, we can relate to Kamala Harris just in the sense of some of us have been in that position before where we felt qualified, if not overqualified in many respects.”\n\nThat’s right, folks. Hill believes that she and Harris were “overqualified” for the positions they wanted. More on that later.\n\nHill went on to argue that Harris’ loss shows that Americans are unwilling to embrace female leaders -- especially Black, female leaders who wash their collard greens in a bathtub.\n\n“For a lot of Black women, even though we should not internalize it this way, it felt like a particular rejection of some of the things that we’ve been fighting for,” she said.\n\nPredictably, the podcaster went on to trot out one of the left’s favorite narratives: The role misinformation allegedly played in influencing voters’ perceptions on the campaign trail. “I think it was particularly evident how racism and misogyny were driving a lot of the coverage, the opinions, and even how the electorate saw Kamala Harris,” Hill said.\n\nSo, let’s get back to this crack about Harris being “overqualified” to be the President of These-Here United States of America.\n\nFor starters, Harris is anything but qualified for that position, a reality that was on full display before and after she became the Democratic nominee. In fact, we already knew this after seeing her dismal performance in the Democratic primaries in 2019.\n\nAs RedState’s Ward Clark pointed out, Harris lacks core principles and policies. He rightly described her as “a creature of pure expedience,” who shifts her positions when it is convenient. This is reflected in her “no comment” strategy on policy matters. “She cannot articulate any position on demand because she doesn’t know for sure what it is,” Clark noted.\n\nIndeed, even former Obama strategist David Axelrod had to admit Harris was about as qualified for the presidency as a ham sandwich. “There’s zero enthusiasm on the ground for Kamala Harris in the demographics that [she] most needs.”\n\nA 2019 opinion piece written by Terry McAteer resurfaced that highlighted the toxic workplace Harris created while serving as California’s Attorney General. The author noted that Harris constantly criticized her staff while using profanity, noting that she “vocally throws around ‘F-bombs’ and other profanity constantly in her berating of staff and others.”\n\nThe vice president allegedly required members of her staff to greet her daily with “Good Morning, General,” and prohibited interns from making eye contact with her. Does anyone believe a horrible manager like that belongs in the Oval Office?\n\nOf course not, which is partly why voters could not support her. It had nothing to do with racism or sexism, as Hill suggests. It has everything to do with the fact that she was a lousy candidate, which is why she lost. Unfortunately for Hill and her comrades, they can only view things through the lens of progressive ideology which suggests that every negative thing that happens to a member of a “marginalized” group is the result of bigotry and misogyny, which is why they will continue losing.","url":"https://redstate.com/jeffc/2024/12/04/jemele-hill-finally-comments-on-the-election-and-you-already-know-what-she-blames-for-the-outcome-n2182820","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/249/10d331bd-1d49-4c30-b2ec-5106ec7e8c1e.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:14:49","author":"Jeff Charles","authors":["Jeff Charles"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":270487090,"title":"Big Win Against Fani Willis In Effort To Get Her Communications With Jack Smith Jan 6 Committee N2182777","text":"Chalk up another big loss for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.

He also granted Judicial Watch attorneys' fees. \n\nJudicial Watch was astounded by Willis' failure to respond and explained why they were trying to get the records. \n\n“Fani Willis is something else.

As we reported, he was sent to prison in March for four months for defying a subpoena from the duplicitous J6 Committee. It was yet another example of the weaponization of Biden’s Department of Justice.\n\nBut Navarro is back—in a big way. Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has chosen the economist to serve as senior trade counselor.\n\nThe Trump-Vance transition team praised Navarro in an email:\n\nI am pleased to announce that Peter Navarro, a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it, will serve as my Senior Counselor for Trade and Manufacturing. During my First Term, few were more effective or tenacious than Peter in enforcing my two sacred rules, Buy American, Hire American. He helped me renegotiate unfair Trade Deals like NAFTA and the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), and moved every one of my Tariff and Trade actions FAST.\n\nHe's back: RNC Night 3: Political Prisoner Peter Navarro Brings the Fire and the Warning\n\nPresident-elect Trump has made trade and tariffs a key focus as he prepares to return to the White House, and Navarro looks to play an influential role:\n\nThe Senior Counselor position leverages Peter’s broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills. His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas. Peter is not just a superb, Harvard-trained Economist, he is a noted author of more than a dozen bestselling books on strategic business management and unfair Trade. He did a superb job for the American People in my First Term. Peter will do even better as Senior Counselor to protect American Workers, and truly Make American Manufacturing Great Again.\n\nIt’s quite the turnaround for Navarro, who made a triumphant appearance on the RNC stage in July just after being released from prison. “The J6 committee demanded that I betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin,” he said. “I refused.”\n\nRemember? Justice Roberts Denies Peter Navarro's Request for a Delay, Ex-Trump Aide Heads to Prison Next to a Zoo\n\nThe Trump train just continues rolling along, much to the chagrin of the exploding heads over at CNN, MSNBC, et al.

But pardon him, he did. \n\n(Warning: profanity):\n\nVietor said he understood Biden's decision on a \"human level,\" but was frustrated that the president had made his defenders within the Democratic Party look \"stupid\" by reneging on his pledge not to pardon his son.\"Now everyone looks stupid. Everyone looks like they are full of s---,\" Vietor said.\n\nNote to Vietor: that’s because you are full of it.\n\nAnd Republicans are going to use this to argue it was politics as usual when Democrats warned of Trump's corruption or threat to the rule or the threat to democracy. And I think that's the piece of this I am most frustrated with, which is Joe Biden looking like a typical, lying politician.\n\nAnother note to Vietor: Biden doesn’t look like a typical, lying politician—he is one.\n\nAnd I think that leads to a cynical feeling that all politicians are bad. They are all the same and that this is just par for the course.\n\nPoor, poor Obama bros.\n\nBiden has ticked off virtually everyone—with the exception of Jill, Hunter, and Hunter’s wife—with this maneuver, and many even on his own side are whining that he just nuked his legacy. (I would argue that his legacy was going to be terrible no matter what, but this makes it that much worse.)\n\nBlowback: Pardon Fallout: A Visibly Shaken Chuck Todd Turns on Joe and Jill Biden in Must-Watch Moment\n\nMeanwhile, bro Jon Favreau, the former director of speechwriting for Obama, thought Biden should have pardoned a whole lot of other shady operatives if he was going to shower mercy on his son.\n\nFellow co-host Jon Favreau called it \"most infuriating\" that Biden chose to pardon his son and not \"a whole bunch of other people who were just government servants doing their job,\" such as Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nYou list me there, Jon. The felonious Fauci should be pursued to Dante's ninth circle—and no pardon should ever be given for what he wrought on America.\n\nFavreau said he believed Biden when he said he would not pardon his son and now he felt like a \"fool.\"\"I believed him. I feel like a f---ing fool, that's what makes me mad about it,\" he admitted.\n\nYou should feel like a fool, Jon, because if you were dumb enough to believe the serial-lying president on this one, that’s on you. And this foolish take is yours to own, too:\n\nIt’s been so satisfying to watch the liberal meltdown since Donald Trump won the presidential election. It’s hard not to feel a little fuzzy in the heart as the progressive tears erupt and the copium is guzzled. Although Biden’s pardon of Hunter is a corrupt act, especially after lying to the American people over it for so long, it’s nonetheless a bonus to see Progressive World flip out.\n\nAs to the Obama bros, I would say: Biden has once again proven himself to be exactly the president you deserve.","url":"https://redstate.com/bobhoge/2024/12/04/hurt-obama-bros-whine-about-bidens-pardon-of-hunternow-everyone-looks-stupid-n2182781","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/263/2829213b-8428-4625-8824-38cf60655ef2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-05 00:14:49","author":"Bob Hoge","authors":["Bob Hoge"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.773}]}
