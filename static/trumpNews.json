Waltz has been under scrutiny for weeks after reporting from The Atlantic that he had mistakenly added the magazine’s editor-in-chief to a Signal chat being used to discuss military plans.\n\n“I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating Mike Waltz to be the next United States Ambassador to the United Nations. From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation’s Interests first,” Trump wrote on social media.\n\n“In the interim, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will serve as National Security Advisor, while continuing his strong leadership at the State Department. Together, we will continue to fight tirelessly to Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN.”\n\nThere is precedent for the secretary of state to serve simultaneously as national security adviser. Henry Kissinger held both positions from 1973 to 1975.\n\nIt’s not clear how long Rubio will hold both jobs.\n\nBut he’ll be doing double duty at a moment when the Trump administration is facing no shortage of foreign policy challenges — the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program and an uncertain world economy in the midst of Trump’s global tariff war.\n\nWaltz came under searing criticism in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a sensitive military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nVice President JD Vance pushed back on characterizations that Waltz was ousted.\n\n“The media wants to frame this as a firing. Donald Trump has fired a lot of people,” Vance said in an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News Channel. “He doesn’t give them Senate-confirmed appointments afterwards.”\n\nTrump scrapped first UN pick\n\nTrump’s decision to move Waltz to the U.N. comes weeks after he pulled his pick for the job, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, from consideration over fears about Republicans’ tight voting margins in the U.S. House.\n\n“I’m deeply honored to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,” Waltz said Thursday.\n\nHis shift from national security adviser to U.N. ambassador nominee means he will now have to face a Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nThe process, which proved to be difficult for a number of Trump’s Cabinet picks, will give lawmakers, especially Democrats, the first chance to grill Waltz on his decision to share information about an imminent U.S. airstrike on Signal.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, signaled that Waltz will face difficult questions.\n\n“I look forward to a thorough confirmation hearing,” Coons said on social media.\n\nSeveral aides under consideration for Waltz’s job\n\nTrump is believed to be weighing several senior aides to eventually take on the national security adviser role, including special envoys Steve Witkoff and Richard Grenell, National Security Council senior director for counterterrorism Sebastian Gorka and senior State Department official Michael Anton, according to several people familiar with the ongoing deliberations.\n\nWitkoff, a fellow New York City real estate maverick who has known Trump for years, has played a key role in negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict and has been the administration’s chief interlocutor in the Iran nuclear talks launched last month.\n\nWitkoff has expressed no interest in taking the job, which requires hands-on management of numerous agencies, but could, if asked by Trump, assume temporary control of the NSC, according to one U.S. official familiar with the matter.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Witkoff would prefer to stay in his current special envoy role, which is relatively independent and not tied to any particular bureaucracy.\n\nGrenell, in addition to being Trump’s envoy for special missions, is serving as the interim president at the Kennedy Center. He served as ambassador to Germany during Trump’s first administration, was special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and did a stint as acting director of national intelligence. He’s also weighing running in next year’s California governor’s race.\n\nWaltz had previously taken “full responsibility” for building the Signal message chain and administration officials described the episode as a “mistake” but one that caused Americans no harm. Waltz maintained that he was not sure how Goldberg ended up in the messaging chain, and insisted he did not know the journalist.\n\nTrump and the White House — which insisted that no classified information was shared on the text chain — publicly stood by Waltz throughout the episode. But the embattled national security adviser was under siege from personalities such as Laura Loomer, who has encouraged Trump to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda.\n\nAs reports began to circulate that Waltz could be leaving the administration, Loomer appeared to take credit in a post on the social media site X, writing: “SCALP.”\n\n“Hopefully, the rest of the people who were set to be fired but were given promotions at the NSC under Waltz also depart,” Loomer wrote in another post.\n\nWaltz gets ‘soft landing’ with UN nomination\n\nRetired Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, an analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said with the U.N. nomination Trump presented Waltz with a “soft landing” as he removed him from the powerful national security advisory post just over 100 days into the administration.\n\nThe Signal episode hurt Waltz. But even more damaging were the attacks by Loomer and his hawkish views on Iran and Russia, which are more in line with Republican orthodoxy, Montgomery said.\n\n“He hurt himself by having to constantly defend his staff that were under inappropriate attack,” Montgomery said. “I think Waltz tried as hard as he could to adjust his traditional thinking about foreign policy to the president’s more opportunistic system, but the president is just a hard person to adjust to.”\n\nHegseth continues to face scrutiny\n\nQuestions have also swirled around Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his role in the Signal chat.\n\nWhile Waltz set it up, Hegseth posted times for aircraft launches and bomb drops into the unsecured app and shared the same information with dozens of people in a second chat, including his wife and brother.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Hegseth also bypassed Pentagon security protocols to set up an unsecured line for a personal computer in his office –- beside terminals where he was receiving classified information. That raises the possibility that sensitive information could have been put at risk of potential hacking or surveillance.\n\nThe Pentagon inspector general is investigating Hegseth’s use of Signal, and he has faced criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. It has added to the turmoil at the Pentagon at a time when Hegseth has dismissed or transferred multiple close advisers. Nonetheless, Trump has maintained public confidence in Hegseth.","summary":"Rep.

Judge Rodriguez said he wouldn't interfere with the government's right to deport people in the country illegally through other means, but it could not rely on the 227-year-old law to do so.\n\n“Neither the Court nor the parties question that the Executive Branch can direct the detention and removal of aliens who engage in criminal activity in the United States,” wrote Judge Rodriguez, who was nominated by Mr. Trump in 2018. But, the judge said, \"the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms.”\n\nIn March, Mr. Trump issued a proclamation claiming that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the U.S. He said he had special powers to deport immigrants, identified by his administration as gang members, without the usual court proceedings.\n\n\"The Court concludes that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful,” Judge Rodriguez wrote.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News, Vice President J.D. Vance said the administration will be “aggressively appealing” the ruling and others that hem in the president's deportation power.\n\n“The judge doesn’t make that determination, whether the Alien Enemies Act can be deployed,” Mr. Vance said. “I think the President of the United States is the one who determines whether this country is being invaded.”\n\nThe chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., said in a statement the judge had made clear “what we all knew to be true: The Trump administration illegally used the Alien Enemies Act to deport people without due process.”\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, most recently during World War II, when it was cited to intern Japanese-Americans.\n\nThe proclamation triggered a flurry of litigation as the administration tried to ship migrants it claimed were gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador. \n\nJudge Rodriguez’s ruling is significant because it is the first formal permanent injunction against the administration using the AEA and contends the president is misusing the law. \"Congress never meant for this law to be used in this manner,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case, in response to the ruling.\n\nJudge Rodriguez agreed, noting that the provision has only been used during the two World Wars and the War of 1812. Mr. Trump claimed Tren de Aragua was acting at the behest of the Venezuelan government, but Judge Rodriguez found that the activities the administration accused it of did not amount to an invasion or “predatory incursion,” as the statute requires.\n\n“The Proclamation makes no reference to and in no manner suggests that a threat exists of an organised, armed group of individuals entering the United States at the direction of Venezuela to conquer the country or assume control over a portion of the nation,” Judge Rodriguez wrote. “Thus, the Proclamation’s language cannot be read as describing conduct that falls within the meaning of ‘invasion’ for purposes of the AEA.”\n\nIf the administration appeals, it would go first to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That is among the nation’s most conservative appeals courts and it also has ruled against what it saw as overreach on immigration matters by both the Obama and Biden administrations. In those cases, Democratic administrations had sought to make it easier for immigrants to remain in the U.S.\n\nThe administration, as it has in other cases challenging its expansive view of presidential power, could turn to appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, in the form of an emergency motion for a stay pending an appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court already has weighed in once on the issue of deportations under the AEA. The justices held that migrants alleged to be gang members must be given “reasonable time” to contest their removal from the country. The court has not specified the length of time.\n\nIt’s possible that the losing side in the 5th Circuit would file an emergency appeal with the justices that also would ask them to short-circuit lower court action in favor of a definitive ruling from the nation’s highest court. Such a decision likely would be months away, at least.\n\nThe Texas case is just one piece of a tangle of litigation sparked by Trump's proclamation.\n\nThe ACLU initially filed suit in the nation's capital to block deportations. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued a temporary hold on removals and ordered the administration turn around planes that had left with detainees headed to El Salvador, a directive that was apparently ignored. Later, the Supreme Court weighed in.\n\nThe justices stepped in again late last month with an unusual postmidnight order halting deportations from North Texas, where the ACLU contended the administration was preparing for another round of flights to El Salvador.","summary":"U.S. District Court Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. is the first judge to rule that the Alien Enemies Act cannot be used against people who, the Republican administration claims, are gang members invading the United States","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-cannot-use-alien-enemies-act-to-deport-venezuelans-from-south-texas-judge-rules/article69523827.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/dd92r8/article69523829.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Alabama_33479.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:58:42","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.541},{"id":316934584,"title":"Tokyo's Tariff Envoy Says US Talks 'Constructive'","text":"Tokyo's envoy for US tariff talks in Washington said Thursday that the second round of negotiations between the two countries had been \"frank and constructive.\"Japan, a key US ally and its biggest investor, is subject to the same 10 percent baseline tariffs imposed on most nations plus steeper levies on cars, steel and aluminum.\"We were able to move forward in frank and constructive discussions to reach a mutually beneficial agreement as soon as possible,\" Ryosei Akazawa told reporters.\"We were able to advance concrete discussions on, for example, expanding trade between our two countries, non-tariff measures and economic and security co-operation.\"Akazawa said he had \"strongly proposed\" to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other officials a review of President Donald Trump's sweeping levies on trade partners.Trump in early April announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on Japan of 24 percent, but later put them on pause for 90 days along with those on other nations except China.The next round of ministerial-level talks will \"take place intensively from mid-May onwards,\" Akazawa said.

Steve Bannon , who was White House Chief Strategist, believes Mr Trump will win if he is able to find a way to run for the third stint as leader. The Trump Organisation is selling red caps which read \"Trump 2028\" in an apparent reference to the next US presidential election. \"There are methods which you could do it. President Trump is going to be eligible, is going to run again, and will win again,\" Mr Bannon, who was in his advisory role from January 2017 to August 2017 and has since retained links with Mr Trump, said in a podcast called Apocalypse Now?. Mr Bannon, who himself now has a daily live podcast, added: \"I will tell you, on the afternoon of the 20th January of 2029, he's going be in the White House signing executive orders.\" America's constitution restricts presidents to a maximum of two terms in office. However, Mr Trump previously stated there were \"methods\" – if not \"plans\" – find a way to get around this and remain power . Speaking on the Daily Mail podcast , hosted by David Patrikarakos, Mr Bannon insisted he was sure the 78-year-old US President would find a way to circumvent the limit. Referring to bizarre theories Joe Biden \"stole\" the 2020 election, Mr Bannon added: \"The whole reason he came back and ran again was his burning conviction that he had won in 2020, it had been stolen... \"His inner group and our audience - almost to a person, I think it's almost 100 per cent - believe strongly to the core of their being that the 2020 election was stolen.\" Yet, in his short return as US President, Mr Trump has already sparked fears of an economic slump. He has ratcheted-up his tariff war and, as a result, central banks are expected to reduce borrowing to costs to put more money back into the pockets of households and businesses, and to boost spending. International relations are tense too. Mr Bannon understands, though, Mr Trump intends to avoid \"kinetic war\" with China by showing Beijing \"respect\" and seeking \"some sort of accommodation\".

US District Judge Richard Leon ruled that plaintiffs who sued to preserve the Institute of Museum and Library Services are likely to show that the administration doesn't have the legal authority to unilaterally shutter the agency, which Congress created. Also Read | Pahalgam Terror Attack: 'America Stands in Solidarity With India, Supports the Right To Defend Itself' Says Pete Hegseth to Rajnath Singh. The American Library Association and a labour union for federal employees filed a lawsuit last month to stop the administration from gutting the institute after President Donald Trump signed a March 14 executive order that refers to it and several other federal agencies as “unnecessary.” Keith Sonderling, the agency's newly appointed acting director, subsequently placed many agency staff members on administrative leave, sent termination notices to most of them, began cancelling grants and contracts and fired all members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. Also Read | US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz To Step Down From Post After Signal Chat Fiasco, Alex Wong Also Out. “These harms are neither speculative nor remediable,” Leon wrote. The judge said he was issuing a “narrow” temporary restraining order that preserves the status quo at the agency without granting all of the relief that plaintiffs' attorneys were seeking. It bars the administration from taking any more steps to dissolve the agency or its operations, fire any staffers or cancel contracts while the lawsuit is pending. The institute has roughly 75 employees and issued more than USD 266 million in grants last year. Plaintiffs' attorneys warn that closing the agency will force libraries to end grant-funded programs, cut staff and possibly even close. “And even if Defendants possessed constitutional or statutory authority to eviscerate IMLS, they have provided no reasoned explanation for doing so, ignored strong reliance interests, and failed to consider more reasonable alternatives,” they wrote. Government lawyers said Trump's executive order requires the institute to reduce its work to only that which is required by statute. They also argued that the district court doesn't have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims. “Plaintiffs' requested injunctive relief would effectively disable several federal agencies, as well as the President himself, from implementing the President's priorities consistent with their legal authorities,” they wrote. Cindy Hohl, president of the American Library Association, said the cut in funding is already impacting libraries across the country, including in rural areas where libraries are setting up their summer reading programs. “Many libraries that already have contracts with performers and educators, they're having to find other ways to be able to pay for their assistance with programs,” she said. Hohl added that the grants are a minute percentage of the overall federal budget but provide sizable funding for some facilities that will have to close.

James Risch of Idaho, voted in favor of Burch, while all 10 of the committee’s Democrat members voted against him. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota now has to bring the nomination to the full Senate floor for a final vote. \n\nThe action comes more than three weeks after Burch’s hearing before the committee, during which he fielded questions on foreign aid, the Vatican-China deal, and the Holy See’s role in securing a lasting peace in the Middle East. \n\nIf confirmed by the full Senate, Burch, who is president of CatholicVote, will step down from his position at the organization, CatholicVote indicated.\n\nDuring his hearing earlier this month, Burch emphasized his support for the Trump administration’s foreign-spending cuts, which have had a widespread impact on Catholic aid organizations, saying: “I think the partnership with the Holy See can be a very good one, but I think those partners have to understand that our foreign aid is not endless, that we can’t fund every last program.”\n\nOn China, Burch said he intended to encourage the Vatican to apply pressure on the communist regime concerning its human-rights abuses and reported violation of its deal with the Vatican regarding the appointment of bishops. \n\n“I would encourage the Holy See as the United States ambassador, if I’m confirmed, to resist the idea that a foreign government has any role whatsoever in choosing the leadership of a private religious institution,” he said.\n\nBurch stated his intentions to support Vatican diplomacy to end the Israel-Hamas war, telling the committee he believed the Holy See “can play a significant role” by being “a partner in that conversation and [delivering] the necessary moral urgency of ending this conflict and hopefully securing a durable peace.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump last December nominated Burch to serve as ambassador to the Vatican, writing in a Truth Social post that “he represented me well during the last election, having garnered more Catholic votes than any presidential candidate in history!” and adding: “Brian loves his Church and the United States — he will make us all proud.”\n\nCatholicVote is a political advocacy group that endorsed Trump in January 2024 and ran advertisements in support of Trump during his campaign. The organization says it spent more than $10 million on the 2024 elections.\n\nBurch, who lives in the Chicago suburbs, is a graduate of the University of Dallas, a private Catholic school. In 2020, he wrote a book titled A New Catholic Moment: Donald Trump and the Politics of the Common Good. \n\nAccording to his biography on CatholicVote, Burch has received the Cardinal O’Connor Defender of the Faith Award from Legatus International and the St. Thomas More Award for Catholic Citizenship by Catholic Citizens of Illinois.","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/us-ambassador-designate-to-vatican-clears-senate-foreign-relations-committee","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20250501170524_42d287064a3164625462656cf9f0876f4a7aa5d7a8b5f8b88a6b5904dcbcd184.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:39:52","author":"Madalaine Elhabbal/cna","authors":["Madalaine Elhabbal/cna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.196},{"id":316934516,"title":"Putin 'moving closer to Ukraine peace deal', but can he be trusted","text":"New intelligence reviewed by US and Western officials suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin may have shifted his immediate focus in the Ukraine war toward the shorter-term objectives of solidifying his hold on territory his forces have seized and boosting his country's struggling economy, multiple people familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nThis represents an evolution from recent US and Western intelligence assessments suggesting that Putin felt the state of the war was to his advantage, that he had the momentum as well as the manpower to sustain a longer fight against a faltering Ukraine and seize the entire country.\n\nThe perception Putin may have shifted his thinking has played into US President Donald Trump and his negotiators' belief that the Russian president may be more willing to consider a potential peace deal than in the past, two US sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nREAD MORE: US and Ukraine sign rare-minerals deal sought by Trump﻿\n\nHowever, senior US officials remain skeptical of Putin and his repeated assertions in ongoing talks that he wants a peace deal, even though what is being proposed by the US is incredibly generous to Russia, handing them most of the territory they've taken. There is also a widespread belief that even if Russia agrees to a version of the agreement on the table it may look to resume the war and try to seize more of Ukraine in the long-term.\n\n\"I think that he may be thinking - I don't want to say thinking smaller - but thinking about what a reasonable nearer-term objective is,\" said a senior western intelligence official.\n\nThe pressure exerted by an increasingly angry Trump administration, threatening more sanctions and a struggling Russian economy, have Putin in a potentially difficult position. There has also been strong emphasis in talks on the potential for investments between the US and Russia if the war ends, opportunities the US has called \"historic.\"\n\n\"All of this really depends on what is the US willing to put on the table so that he could not just claim victory domestically,\" the official continued, \"but really feel that he has achieved something that is worth a significant pause and then maybe retake up the fight at some point later.\"\n\nThe official pointed to Putin's repeated references to where the Russian people have historically come from and said he maintains \"a long-term objective,\" to seize more of Ukraine, \"at least those portions that are the cradle of Russian civilisation\" in Putin's eyes.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Albanese, Dutton try to convince voters in final day of campaigning\n\nMoscow is willing to \"play along\" with the US and restrict its immediate objectives to improve its relationship with Washington, a senior European official agreed, but \"clearly hasn't given up on their maximalist war ends.\"\n\nThe Kremlin hopes that a better relationship \"draws the attention away after a tactical pause and that they can then use the mix of military, economic, informational and political tools to achieve Putin's full objectives in Ukraine and beyond,\" the official said.\n\nEarlier this year, US intelligence officials cautioned now-senior Trump advisers that controlling Ukraine remained Putin's top priority next to regime survival and warned he was eager to exploit any perceived rush to negotiations by the new administration, according to a source familiar with those conversations.\n\n\"Putin's thinking has evolved because he thinks he has a sympathetic US president who doesn't know what he's doing and is more interested in short-term wins,\" said Democratic Congressman Jason Crow, who sits on the House intelligence committee. Putin, he added, \"thinks there can be a settlement, and it simply won't be enforced.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump national security adviser Waltz out following Signal chat blunder in major staff shakeup\n\nUkraine is pleading for security assistance\n\nDuring negotiations that started under Trump, Ukraine's leaders have repeatedly pleaded that the US and Europe provide security assistance and guarantees as part of a potential pact so that even if Ukraine does cede some land, Russia would be deterred from resuming the war to seize more of the country.\n\n\"The Russian objective is to get as much territory recognized as possible and have as weak of a Ukraine as possible,\" said a senior US official who argued there's \"zero indication\" Putin could actually conquer the rest of Ukraine when his forces have been unable to dramatically move the front lines in a long time.\n\nSo any shift in Putin's thinking comes from that realisation and the Trump administration's efforts to get the two sides to negotiate an end to the conflict, said the official.\n\n\"The calculation of what more Putin could achieve at this given stage has probably changed, in part because there's a desire to end the war,\" the official said. \n\n\"The calculus on the US side has changed (since the Biden administration), which contributes to the changing calculus of the Russians presumably.\"\n\nDiscussions about where territorial lines could be drawn have focused on the five territories where Russia has the strongest foothold, including Crimea which Putin seized in 2014. \n\nTrump has said Ukraine will not get back most of the land it has lost to Russia.\n\nREAD MORE: Eta Aquarids meteor shower set to reach its peak early next week\n\nLast week, Vice President JD Vance indicated the US envisions an eventual truce \"somewhere close\" to where the current front lines are with \"some territorial swaps.\"\n\n\"This peace deal is about these so-called five territories.

In the military, it's the toughest 100 yards.\"\n\nDoubts Putin is negotiating in good faith\n\nBut there has long been doubt among political and intelligence officials that Putin and the circle around him are negotiating in good faith, instead trying to stretch the talks out and continue their military campaign.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed that scepticism this week, telling reporters it is \"time to treat Putin like the deceptive war criminal he is\" and reminding Trump that the Russian leader \"cannot be allowed to drag the United States along.\"\n\nTrump has consistently insisted that he believes Putin wants peace and expressed optimism about a potential deal, but on Saturday appeared to question the Russian leader's aims.\n\n\"Maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Vatican.\n\n\"We understand that Washington is willing to achieve a quick success in this process,\" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded on Wednesday. \n\n\"But at the same time, we hope for an understanding that the settlement in the Ukrainian crisis is too complicated to be done overnight. There are lots of details and lots of tiny things to be tackled before a settlement.\"\n\nTrump had referenced recent Russian strikes on Kyiv and elsewhere that the senior western intelligence official said are in line with the argument that Putin is not engaging in truce talks with an intention of ending the war.\n\n\"But if something gets put on the table that is too good to pass up, I think that they could change the way they're thinking a little bit on that,\" said the official.","summary":"New western intelligence suggests the Russian president is shifting his immediate aims in the three-year-old Ukraine conflict.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/russia-ukraine-war-us-intelligence-suggest-putin-changing-his-goals/d9ed151a-c4b5-440d-b3a9-d328b18edbfa","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/jEx839O59hjxMsG4ITQ7LuTl9OI=/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F4fda08f9-f2b3-44c2-84e8-418481a9ac3a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:36:15","author":"9News","authors":["9News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":316932142,"title":"UN eyes major overhaul amid funding crisis, internal memo shows","text":"The high-level review comes as UN agencies scramble to cope with the fallout from US foreign aid cuts under President Donald Trump that have gutted humanitarian agencies.\n\nThe six-page document, marked “strictly confidential” and reviewed by Reuters, contains a list of what it terms “suggestions” that would consolidate dozens of UN agencies into four primary departments: peace and security, humanitarian affairs, sustainable development, and human rights.\n\nUnder one option, for example, operational aspects of the World Food Programme, the UN children’s agency, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN refugee agency would be merged into a single humanitarian entity, it said.\n\nThe memo contains a range of suggestions, some large, some small, some speculative, which, if all adopted, would represent the most sweeping reforms in decades.\n\nIt suggests merging the UN AIDS agency into the WHO, and reducing the need for up to six translators at meetings. Another suggestion proposes merging the World Trade Organization – which is not a UN entity – with UN development agencies.\n\nOne official familiar with the memo called it a starting point.\n\nBut, the language of the internal self-assessment appears to confirm what both supporters and critics of the global body have long said: that the UN needs streamlining. In a series of observations, the memo refers to “overlapping mandates”, “inefficient use of resources”, “fragmentation and duplication” and notes a bloating of senior positions.\n\nIt describes “systemic challenges” the UN faces, problems exacerbated as the general assembly continues to add missions and programmes. “Increased mandates, often without clear exit strategies, and complexities have led to significant overlaps, inefficiencies and increased costs,” the document said.\n\nThe memo was prepared by a task force appointed in March by secretary general António Guterres, who said at the time the body needed to make itself more cost-effective.\n\nThe task force, considering long-term structural changes, is in addition to shorter-term cost-cutting efforts. Some diplomats have described the effort as a proactive step to help forestall deeper US cuts.\n\n“The memo is the result of an exercise to generate ideas and thoughts from senior officials on how to achieve the secretary general’s vision,” said Guterres’ spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric.\n\nGuterres has long called for UN reform. During a meeting with Trump in 2017, the secretary general told the US President that the world body was saddled with “fragmented structures, byzantine procedures, endless red tape.”\n\nBut, it is now facing one of the greatest financial crises in its 80-year history. At the start of the year, the US, by far the UN’s largest donor, was already about US$1.5 billion in arrears in mandatory payments for the regular budget and US$1.2 billion in arrears for peacekeeping.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, he has cut billions of dollars more in foreign assistance as part of his “America First” foreign policy.\n\nCuts and geopolitical shifts\n\nThe task force memo does not mention any country by name, but notes starkly that “geopolitical shifts and substantial reductions in foreign aid budget are challenging the legitimacy and effectiveness of the organisation.”\n\nAmong the impacts is the UN humanitarian office, which faces a US$58 million shortfall, has cut 20% of its staff. UNICEF projects its budget will shrink by 20% and the UN migration agency expects a 30% budget drop, affecting 6,000 jobs.\n\nThe cuts are “having an immediate, devastating impact,” Bob Rae, the Canadian ambassador and president of the UN’s economic and social council, said on Monday.\n\n“What’s happening is terrible – we’re cutting rations in refugee camps,” Rae said.\n\nThe memo also suggests relocating some UN staff from more expensive cities to lower-cost locales, and merging operations in Rome.

Such an approach must support affected workers while seeking to incorporate a new softwood lumber agreement in any trade deals reached with the U.S., it added.\n\n“We are under direct attack,” Eby said of the softwood lumber duties on Thursday.\n\n“We are under a national security investigation; it’s ludicrous.”\n\nThe letter also highlights B.C.’s concerns with changes to the immigration system that have seen cuts to B.C.’s allocations under the Provincial Nominee Program, which impact our ability to attract and retain in-demand professionals.”\n\nLast month, B.C. said it was only granted 4,000 nominations under the program, about half what it received last year. Most of the province’s slots are being used to recruit healthcare workers.\n\nEby also pressed Carney for federal partnership in funding the province’s North Coast Transmission Line, a project he said would enable “nation-building clean electricity” to power critical mineral mining and the decarbonization of the Port of Prince Rupert.\n\nIt also highlighted a desire to partner with Ottawa on expanded housing programs and, in the wake of the Lapu Lapu Day attack in Vancouver, on public safety.\n\n“I thank you, again, for your condolences and would ask for your continued support in the wake of this horrific incident,” Eby wrote.\n\n“I know that public safety is a shared area of concern for our governments, and we expect to reach out to your administration in the weeks ahead with further advocacy in that area.”\n\nCarney is slated to take questions from the media for the first time since the election on Friday.","summary":"B.C.

'And everybody would know it.'\n\nObama, 61, said that she's 'not a martyr' and joked about how she would address such marital strife if it was happening. \n\n'I would be problem-solving in public, like, 'Let me tell you what he did,'' she said.\n\nRobinson took the joke one step further: 'If they were having a problem, I'd be doing a podcast with him.'\n\nObama acknowledged that marriage is 'hard' for her and the former president but added that 'I wouldn't trade it,' calling President Obama, 'as the young people say... my person.' \n\n'The beauty of my husband and our partnership is that neither one of us was ever really, ever going to quit at it, because that's not who we are. And I know that about him. He knows that about me.'\n\nShe said that young people give up on marriage too soon, in part because they see a false image of a perfect union between herself and her husband. \n\n'I talk about these things because I think that people give up too quickly on marriage,' the 'Becoming' author said.\n\n'Because there is so much friction built into the equation. And if you're not getting help, talking about it, going to therapy, just understanding how things are changing, and how do you continuously renegotiate your relationship with your partner, I just see people quitting,' she said.\n\n'Because they look at me and Barack and go, '#couple goals.' And I'm like, it's hard,' Obama added.\n\nThe former Fox News anchor made the blistering comments on The Megyn Kelly Show as he discussed the Obama's much-talked about 30-year marriage. \n\nCarlson said former First Lady Michelle 'really dislikes her husband and it's super obvious.'\n\n'I'm not just saying that to be catty... I think I'm trying to feel compassion for her but her hostility toward the guy is unbelievable.'\n\nThe conservative pundit went on to claim 'there's nothing more destabilizing than an unhappy marriage' and that's why he believes Michelle's life exemplifies why it was important to focus on marriage.'\n\n'It's not just her,' he continued. 'She's like a freak show and it's easy to make fun of her and I enjoy it, but I do think it's a whole class of people who are afflicted with the same kind of restlessness and rage and emptiness and they're the ones wrecking our society.'\n\nKelly agreed with Carlson, adding that 'everything Michelle says about her husband is negative.'\n\n'I almost never say negative things about Doug,' Kelly said. 'He's not perfect but when I think about him, I don't immediately go to whatever is negative. I go to what's positive and what I love about him.'\n\nMichelle has been open about her marriage struggles throughout the years and particularly on her new podcast, IMO (In my Opinion), which she hosts with her brother Robinson. \n\nThe Obamas have been married for 32 years but have faced ongoing rumors about their marriage status over the last few months.\n\nMichelle has shared that the former president was broke when they met and that she had to convinced to support his bid for the White House. \n\n'Being married to the president of the United States [is a] thing that that none of us kind of banked on. We knew Barack was smart and ambitious, but, you know...' she said. \n\nShe has also shared personal grievances with her husband, like his former impunctuality and lack of deep conversations with his golf friends. \n\nEarlier this month, Michelle addressed the rumors directly on an episode of actress Sophia Bush's podcast.\n\nShe said her decision to skip President Jimmy Carter's funeral, and President Donald Trump's inauguration, were simply decisions she made for herself.\n\nHer absence at both high-profile political events stoked divorce rumors, as did President Obama's admission last week that he was in a 'deep deficit' with his wife.\n\n'That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with disappointing people. I mean, so much so that this year people were, you know, they couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing,' Obama said in the podcast episode, released Tuesday.\n\n'That this couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right?' she continued.\n\nMichelle added: 'That's what society does to us.'\n\n'We start actually, finally going, \"What am I doing? Who am I doing this for?\" And if it doesn't fit into the sort of stereotype of what people think we should do, then it gets labeled as something negative and horrible.'\n\nAmid the speculation, the Obamas have been seen going out to dinner twice in DC over the last month.\n\nMichelle also recently addressed those who have called her 'angry' in the past as she discussed the 'angry black woman' trope.\n\n'The first label they put on us as Black women is that we are angry,' she said earlier this month. 'And the irony is, like, yeah. I am probably less light than many of my white female friends.'\n\nShe added of the way the media has portrayed her: 'The first thing that some female journalist said is that I emasculating him just by sort of trying to tell the truth about what my life was, right?","summary":"Michelle Obama has finally addressed rumors that she and husband and ex-President Barack Obama are on the outs after Tucker Carlson claimed she 'really dislikes her husband.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14670313/Michelle-Obama-divorce-rumors-Barack-Tucker-Carlsons-explosive-claims.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/02/01/97937879-0-image-a-8_1746144132763.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/30/8285978370563655925/1024x576_MP4_8285978370563655925.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:22:08","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Asked to describe what’s inside the Tennibot robot, its maker also had tariffs on the mind.\n\n“Injection molded parts, rivets, screws, nuts, wheels, motors, batteries,” said Haitham Eletrabi, co-founder and CEO of Tennibot, based in Auburn, Alabama. “The supply chain gets very complex. We get parts from all over the world. Tariffs are adding a lot of uncertainty.”\n\nIt’s not just the U.S.-China trade rivalry that was weighing on some attendees. Francesca Torsiello, of the recruitment firm Adapt Talent, said she’s also hearing more wariness from Canadian robotics and engineering candidates about taking jobs in the U.S. amid a tense political environment.\n\n“In the past, people in Canada found it attractive to come and work for U.S. companies; right now they’re being very hesitant,” Torsiello said.\n\nAP video journalist Rodrique Ngowi contributed to this report.","summary":"For now, humanoids are still a niche but one that invites intense curiosity.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/01/trump-tariffs-robots/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump_Tariff_Robots_37265.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:17:43","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.025},{"id":316935278,"title":"World News | Trump Threatens Sanctions on Countries Purchasing Iranian Oil, Petrochemicals","text":"Washington, DC [US], May 2 (ANI): US President Donald Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on the 'countries or individual' found buying Iranian oil and petrochemical products.

However, it has previously accused the US of waging a systematic disinformation campaign against China and said any attempts to drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the CCP would fail.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies said in March that China remained the top military and cyber threat to the US, noting that China had the ability to hit the United States with conventional weapons, compromise US infrastructure through cyber attacks and target its assets in space.\n\nCIA director John Ratcliffe also said that no adversary had ever posed a more formidable challenge to the US than the CCP.\n\n\"It is intent on dominating the world economically, militarily, and technologically,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMr Ratcliffe also told US broadcaster Fox News that the videos represented a change in tact by the CIA to gather intelligence on adversaries such as China.\n\n\"One of the primary roles of the CIA is to collect intelligence for the president and for our policymakers.

We're not letting it go to waste.\"\n\nIn March, the CIA's intelligence approach around the war changed under the Trump administration, with the intelligence agency cutting knowledge-sharing ties with Ukraine in the wake of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's high-profile clash with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nAt the time, then-national security adviser Mike Waltz said the Trump administration had taken a \"step back\" and was \"reviewing all aspects\" of its intelligence relationship with Ukraine.\n\nMr Ratcliffe confirmed the move and said it was possible that both the military aid and intelligence sharing restrictions could \"go away\", saying the US would \"work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine\".\n\nABC/Reuters","summary":"The CIA has released two short videos that appear designed to tap into possible discontent in the Chinese government and encourage leaks of sensitive state secrets to the US.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/cia-releases-mandarin-videos-to-lure-chinese-information-leaks/105242672","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/34cefc8e4283ccb4138eb32500176e1f?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=573&cropW=1019&xPos=104&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:11:32","author":"Luke Cooper","authors":["Luke Cooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.021},{"id":316933296,"title":"Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy hails ‘historic’ minerals deal as an equal partnership with US","text":"Ukrainian analysts have noted that Kyiv has apparently been able to extract some major concessions, despite Donald Trump’s repeated claim that Ukraine “has no cards” to play. “Ukraine held the line. Despite enormous pressure, every overreaching demand from the other side was dropped. The final deal looks fair,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, wrote on X. Notably absent from the final text was the insistence that Ukraine should repay previous military US assistance via the deal, something Trump has previously repeatedly demanded.\n\nThe Kremlin was silent on Wednesday’s agreement, but former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev claimed it meant Trump had “broken the Kyiv regime” because Ukraine would have to pay for US military aid with mineral resources.\n\nThe deal will show the “Russian leadership that there is no daylight between the Ukrainian people and the American people, between our goals,” US treasury secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business Network in an interview. “And again, I think this is a strong signal to the Russian leadership, and it gives President Trump the ability to now negotiate with Russia on even a stronger basis,” he said. His remarks appeared to send a signal to Russia that Washington remains aligned with Kyiv despite question marks over its commitment to its ally since Trump’s return to power upended US diplomacy.\n\nThe Trump administration will approve its first sale of military equipment to Ukraine since Trump took office, in an indication that the minerals deal signed by the two countries this week may open a path to renewed weapons shipments. The state department has certified a proposed licence to export “$50m or more” of defence hardware and services to Ukraine, according to a communication sent to the US committee on foreign relations. Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office.\n\nThe state department announced a 30-year veteran of the foreign service to run the US embassy in Kyiv “during this critical moment as we move toward a peace agreement to stop the bloodshed”. The appointment of Julie Davis, now the US ambassador to Cyprus, was announced the day after the minerals deal was signed. She has previously served as ambassador to Belarus and deputy ambassador to Nato. She replaces Bridget Brink, who announced she was leaving the post last month as the Trump administration pushed ahead with plans for peace talks that many believed favoured Moscow.\n\nFrench foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Thursday that the European Union was preparing a 17th round of sanctions against Russia, describing Vladimir Putin as the “sole obstacle” to peace in Ukraine. The 27-nation bloc has hit Russia with multiple rounds of sanctions in response to its invasion of Ukraine and said earlier this year that it would not lift them before the “unconditional” withdrawal of Moscow’s forces from its neighbour. “We Europeans will accompany this American [sanctions] initiative with a 17th package of sanctions and I committed yesterday to [US senator] Lindsey Graham that we would try to coordinate both the substance and the timing of these two packages of sanctions,” Barrot told AFP in an interview.\n\nA Russian drone attack late on Thursday set buildings ablaze in Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, injuring 14 people, but causing no deaths, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. Fedorov, writing on the Telegram messaging app, clarified earlier casualty figures, saying a report that one person was killed had proved to be untrue. One man buried under rubble had been pulled out alive, he said. Nine people were being treated in hospital.\n Fedorov said Russian forces had made at least 10 strikes on the city, targeting private homes, high-rise apartment buildings, educational institutions and infrastructure sites.","summary":"Ukrainian president says the deal was the result of Vatican meeting with Donald Trump.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump noted in conclusion of his announcement.\n\nCongress will vote on Waltz’s confirmation as the US Ambassador to UN, a position that recently became available after Trump’s previous nominee, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, was withdrawn from consideration.\n\nSeveral US news sources reported on Thursday that Trump had been furious for some time about Waltz’s security breach but was slow to fire him as he did not want to “hand the liberal media a scalp.”\n\nTrump did not indicate whom he would tap as a permanent replacement for Waltz. As for Rubio, his interim appointment means the top diplomat by now has taken on a total of four positions in the administration. In addition to being secretary of state and interim national security adviser, he is also currently serving as the acting national archivist and acting USAID administrator.\n\n“It does show some confidence in Rubio’s loyalty to the President,” veteran diplomat Richard Kauzlarich, who once served as senior deputy to the Secretary of State and the President’s Special Representative to the Newly Independent States from 1993-94 during Bill Clinton administration, told Kyiv Post’s Washington correspondent.\n\nHe went on to add, from a management perspective, it will be “challenging” for Rubio to lead reform in the State Department and the National Security Council, “which is facing multiple internal and external challenges (e.g., Ukraine, Iran).”\n\n“Who will be the deputy NSA will be important,” he added. \n\nJohn Herbst, former US ambassador to Kyiv during George W. Bush’s administration, believes that the departure of Waltz as National Security Advisor and his replacement by Rubio as interim NSA “suggests no major change in US national security policy” as he put it, “including regarding Russian aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nHerbst currently serves as senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.\n\nHe went on to elaborate, “both [Rubio and Waltz] recognize that China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran have been cooperating closely against core US interests and that a real policy of peace through strength is needed to protect those interests. That includes helping Trump establish a durable peace in Ukraine, which means putting pressure on the party, Russia, that has rejected various Trump proposals for a ceasefire.”\n\nThe State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce told Kyiv Post’s Washington correspondent during Thursday briefing that moving forward, the Trump administration will be watching Putin’s ‘actions”, when it comes to Ukraine ceasefire issue.\n\n“Secretary [Rubio] has been clear that we are watching Putin’s actions, right, not his words. And in the process, he’s refined a very specific timeline. Weeks ago it was weeks; a few days ago it was days, that this would be a pivotal week” Bruce said.","summary":"Former US Ambassador to Ukraine tells Kyiv Post the departure of the National Security Advisor, with Rubio as interim replacement, suggests no major change in US foreign policy.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/51875","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/05/02/ebe821b592964aaea5cb632ff4a95296.jpeg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:04:25","author":"Alex Raufoglu","authors":["Alex Raufoglu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":316931588,"title":"Rogan mocks 'my favorite podcaster' Gavin Newsom as Democrats attempt to recapture podcasting","text":"Podcaster Joe Rogan mocked California Gov.

Established to uphold global rules and support development, they are now caught between an aggressively nationalist America – their largest shareholder – and the rest of the world. If their leaders speak truth to power, they risk US president Donald Trump’s wrath. If they don’t, they risk their own legitimacy.\n\nThe challenge of walking this tightrope was evident at last week’s Spring Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. The IMF’s mandate is to stand guard over countries’ exchange rates and policies that affect global financial stability. This involves “calling out” those whose actions will impoverish their neighbours.\n\nSo far, the fund has not named the US as its main rule-breaker. But ahead of the Spring Meetings, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva responded to the Trump administration’s unpredictable behaviour by acknowledging the “off the charts” uncertainty caused by US tariffs, reiterating the need for central-bank independence, and urging countries to avoid “self-inflicted injuries”.\n\nIn early April, World Bank president Ajay Banga emphasised the bank’s focus on its core mandate: driving development and reducing poverty. For several decades, the World Bank has supported efforts – particularly infrastructure investments – to lift millions of people out of poverty.\n\nBut Trump’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has decimated programmes that enabled the bank’s work. Instead of addressing this issue at the Spring Meetings, Banga focussed on job creation amid rising unemployment worldwide. The bank has also begun promoting nuclear and technology-agnostic energy solutions to appeal to a US administration that is allergic to climate action.\n\nHow the IMF and the World Bank approach the Trump administration will determine their effectiveness. The first 100 days of Trump’s second term offer insights into the strategy they should pursue.\n\nFirst, they could be targeted and should plan accordingly. Trump’s takeover of Washington’s John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts shows that no organisation is safe – some of America’s largest NGOs and philanthropies are already preparing for funding cuts.\n\nMoreover, the IMF and the World Bank are mentioned in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for Trump’s second presidency published by the Heritage Foundation, and included in the 180-day review of US involvement in international organisations that Trump ordered on Feb 4.\n\nTrue, the team overseeing the review has been dismissed, throwing the process into disarray. But that may not be an obstacle, given the administration’s propensity to act without restraint.\n\nSecond, policymakers must bat away non-credible threats. When Mark Carney became Canadian prime minister in March, after Justin Trudeau stepped down, he insisted in his first conversation with Trump that the US president recognise Canada’s sovereignty (Trump also addressed Carney as “prime minister,” whereas he had often referred to Trudeau as “governor”). It helped that Trump’s bluster about annexing Canada lacked political backing in Washington, much less a feasible plan.\n\nThe situation is somewhat murkier for the IMF and the World Bank. At the Spring Meetings, US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent criticised both institutions, but said the US would maintain its leadership role and expand its global influence.\n\nOther countries must now decide the extent to which they are prepared to let one shareholder unilaterally determine the future of institutions that rely on their financial contributions and participation.\n\nThird, no institution is alone. Whether and how the IMF and the World Bank accede to Trump’s demands will affect the ecosystem in which they operate. US law firms that capitulated to Trump, who wielded the threat of illegal executive orders, may have ensured their own survival, but they have eroded the US legal system’s legitimacy. The same goes for Columbia University, whose acquiescence to government oversight has undermined academic freedom.\n\nThe IMF’s ability to achieve its objectives depends on the confidence of central bankers and policymakers worldwide, and maintaining it requires accurate reporting on the global economy.\n\nThe World Bank, for its part, relies on thousands of firms and community organisations throughout the developing world, and its approach to infrastructure and energy projects sets standards for others to follow.\n\nFourth, as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky discovered, Trump puts a premium on personal relationships. But the right response is not capitulation. Both Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni and British prime minister Keir Starmer have been able to maintain a working relationship with Trump by employing flattery and avoiding concrete commitments.\n\nThis is new terrain for the IMF and the World Bank, whose leaders are used to working with the US state department and the Treasury, as well as Congress. Now, the IMF’s managing director and the bank’s president must take a much more active role in relationship management with the White House.\n\nBeyond the Trump administration, the IMF and the World Bank must remember their other stakeholders in the US: the American people. For example, support by religious organisations for debt relief for the poorest countries in the 1990s enabled the IMF and the World Bank to act on the issue.\n\nThe Trump administration shut down USAID despite agency officials’ warnings that one million children will go untreated for severe malnutrition, up to 166,000 people will die from malaria, and 200,000 more children will be paralysed by polio over the next decade.\n\nBut many Americans support foreign aid, and more than half give to charity each year, often to help the poorest in other countries. Moreover, one-quarter take the time to volunteer, and some 240,000 have served in the Peace Corps since 1961.\n\nAs the heads of the IMF and the World Bank steer these institutions into the future, they must strike a delicate balance between confronting and conceding to the White House. But staying on Trump’s good side is not enough to pursue their missions: they must also be mindful of the world within and outside of America.\n\nNgaire Woods is dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"The international financial institutions are caught between an aggressively nationalist America – their largest shareholder – and the rest of the world.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/05/02/treading-the-trump-tightrope-at-the-imf-and-the-world-bank/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/08057fe2-imf-n-world-bank-logo-220225.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-02 00:00:02","author":"Ngaire Woods","authors":["Ngaire Woods"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.018},{"id":316929794,"title":"Japan says its US$1 trillion in US Treasuries could be leverage in trade talks","text":"Japan’s huge US$1 trillion-plus in US Treasury holdings are among the tools available for Tokyo to use in trade negotiations with the United States, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on Friday.\nThe remark came as Japan’s top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Washington for a second round of bilateral tariff talks.\nKato said the primary purpose of Japan’s US Treasury holdings – the largest in the world – is to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to conduct yen intervention when necessary.\n“But we obviously need to put all cards on the table in negotiations.

He has been to blame for accidentally leaking military plans to the press via an unfortunate Signal group chat. \n\nHe was axed as national security advisor on Thursday and was soon after nominated by the president to become ambassador to the U.N.\n\nThe 'Loomer Unleashed' host told Palmeri all about the dirt she had on the former NSC boss. \n\nLoomer said that Waltz, a Republican congressman from Florida before his appointment to Trump's Cabinet, was letting anti-Trumpers into the agency. \n\n'He is saying that he's personally vetting these individuals who have a history of anti Trump remarks and anti-Trump associations,' Loomer, an ultra-Trump fan, told the host. \n\n'Why would he be signing off on them? And then it reminded me of a video that I had saved in my phone for many years of Michael Waltz on video speaking out against President Trump when he first ran for president, accusing him of being against service members,' Loomer continued, stirring up controversy. \n\nLoomer then shared a story about how she was about to show Trump the video in the Oval Office when the ex-adviser walked into the room. \n\nLaura Loomer has traveled with Trump and had meetings at the White House\n\nConservative show host Laura Loomer, an ally of Trump's, hinted that she could have talked to the president about ousting the former national security adviser \n\nLoomer appeared on the Tara Palmeri Show \n\n'You know, I was about to show this video to President Trump, and then Michael Waltz, you know, walked into the Oval Office,' she told Palmeri. 'It just makes me wonder.'\n\nThen, Loomer played what appears to be an old campaign ad in which the former Florida congressman slams the president. \n\n'He essentially called anyone who was captured in combat a loser,' Waltz says in the clip. 'It's something that I just personally can't stomach.'\n\nThe ad then cuts to a snip of Trump slamming late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who was a captured in the Vietnam war, saying he prefers soldiers that weren't captured.\n\n'Don't let Trump fool you,' Waltz continues in the commercial. 'Look into his real record.' \n\nLast month, Trump denied that Loomer had anything to do with a round of National Security Council firings after she exposed some of the workers. \n\nTrump said 'no' when asked if she was behind the dismissal of several of National Security Advisor Michael Waltz's aides.\n\n'Laura Loomer is a great patriot. She's a very strong person,' Trump said. 'She's been in the party a long time, she's done a good job,' he later added.\n\nTrump and Loomer pose for a picture \n\nInstead of being behind the firings, the president said that Loomer met with him and gave him recommendations on people to hire.\n\n'And sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But I saw her yesterday. She was at the ceremony. And she'll always have something to say, usually very constructive,' Trump said. 'She recommended certain people for jobs.'\n\nThat week, DailyMail.com confirmed that Trump had fired several members of the National Security Council team. \n\nThe dismissals came after Waltz accidentally added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat discussing attack plans. \n\nDonald TrumpFloridaPolitics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMAGA star who influenced Trump aide 'bloodbath' firings hints she was behind Mike Waltz's ouster\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Provocative far-right commentator Laura Loomer hinted that she may have been partially behind Mike Waltz's ouster from his national security advisor role.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14670073/laura-loomer-trump-firings-mike-waltz-ouster.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/01/23/97935797-0-image-m-68_1746139950540.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-01 23:56:16","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":316934544,"title":"Kamala Harris weighs run for governor or another presidential bid","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' return to the political spotlight Wednesday came not only with a sharp rebuke of President Donald Trump, but also a carefully worded acknowledgment of her political future ambitions.Speaking in San Francisco, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted Mr. Trump's economic agenda. His tariffs, \"as I predicted, are clearly inviting a recession,\" she said, in what was close to an \"I told you so\" moment, just about six months since Mr. Trump won all seven of the battleground states, as well as the popular vote, with a margin exceeding 2.5 million votes.Harris also suggested she's been having conversations about her next political steps, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028. \"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said, smiling as the Democratic crowd responded warmly.Sources familiar with Harris' thinking say she's weighing a gubernatorial bid in her home state, a third run for the presidency or not seeking elected office. \"I don't think she will make a wrong decision,\" a former senior Harris campaign official told CBS News. \"Seventy-five million Americans voted for her.

May 1 is traditionally a day of labor activism. \n\n“I’m here for my students, primarily because they’re trying to destroy our education system with (cutting) the funding of public education, and the rights of our students getting a fair education,” said Mary Beth Luck, an elementary school teacher in the Gahanna-Jefferson City School District. \n\nIn particular, Luck is worried about a proposal in the Ohio House’s version of the state budget that would require districts carrying reserves of over 30% of the year’s expenditures to offer tax discounts to homeowners. She said the discounts would cost her district millions.\n\nREAD MORE: Ohio Republicans eye $4.2 billion in school savings for one-time property tax cuts\n\nLuck is concerned that could result in teacher cuts, larger class sizes, or decreases in expensive programs such as special education, she said. \n\nChristopher Monteiro, a Columbus City Schools high school teacher, protested the House’s version of the budget because it excluded the final two years of the Fair School Funding Plan, a bipartisan, six-year education funding scheme. The plan was designed to increase K-12 school funding by $2 billion over 2018 funding levels of $6.9 billion, addressing a 25-year-old Ohio Supreme Court’s ruling that found districts overly relied on property taxes.\n\nHe also protested against the possibility that college professors could lose their academic freedom in the sweeping Senate Bill 1, which goes into effect June 27.\n\nREAD MORE: Ohio colleges could lose state funding if they don’t implement new higher-ed law, bill architect says\n\nThe bill says professors can’t strike and specifies they can’t “indoctrinate” students, conditions that Monteiro worries will be applied to public school teachers next.\n\n“And then in the middle of that, the Browns getting $600 million for their failing football team,” he said. “It’s just a slap in the face. In my opinion, they are just seeking to ruin public education so that they can privatize it with vouchers and charters and all those things.”\n\nJeanne Melvin, a retired public school teacher and president of Public Education Partners, a volunteer group supporting public education, said she’s upset with proposed cuts to public schools and Trump’s proposed shuttering of the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n“It bothers me that children are being hurt in the name of politics,” she said. \n\nEmily Kleinhenz, a librarian at Worthington Libraries, wore a baseball cap that said, “The book was better.”\n\nShe protested cuts to public libraries in the Ohio House’s version of the budget that would end the practice of giving libraries 1.7% of total state tax revenue and replace it with a set amount, which in the fiscal year beginning July 1 could be up to $15 million less than what they’re getting this year.\n\nLibraries are more than places where people check out books, she said. They offer homework help, provide teachers with resources and books for their classrooms, among other services.\n\n“It’ll affect all libraries throughout Ohio,” she said. “Small libraries that are in the rural areas that are needed the most will be gone.

federal election over, the spotlight is back on the NHL playoffs with thousands of fans gathering Thursday night at the Canadian Tire Centre to display their Canadian pride and cheer on teams in the “Battle of Ontario.”\n\nHockey has been part of Canadian identity for decades, but right now, the sport may once again provide a symbol of unity and sovereignty for many Canadians in the shadow of the Trump administration.\n\nAdd to that the fact that two Canadian teams — the Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs — are facing off in the playoffs for the first time in 21 years, with a do-or-die game Thursday night, and fans who spoke to Global News outside the Canadian Tire Centre said they’re seeing more pride.\n\n“Hockey represents our nationality, it’s everywhere, it’s what we do,” said Maureen Dubé, a Toronto Maple Leafs fan, to Global News.\n\n“I think there’s more pride because of what’s going on in the U.S. I think that we’re prouder and we’re louder and we’re more united together.”\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has levied repeated rounds of damaging tariffs on Canada since March, and repeatedly said he wants to make Canada the 51st state — a push roundly rejected by Canadian leaders and voters.\n\nFor fans, the sport represents Canadian identity, national unity and source of social cohesion and belonging, according to recent surveys.\n\nSeventy-four per cent of respondents felt hockey holds a deep significance to Canadian national identity, according to a 2022 Environics Survey.\n\nAnother 62 per cent of Canadians reported they felt a connection to hockey when playing, watching or just being involved in the sport, according to a 2021 Angus Reid survey.\n\n“Everybody grows up with a team, something they can put their heart behind – get together as a community behind that common cause,” said Phil Bilon, an Ottawa Senators fan who spoke to Global News.\n\n“For Canada hockey has been that thing because so many kids grow up playing it, something that unites us all and it all goes back to when we were kids we all grew up with this familiar game.” Aaron Johson, another Ottawa Senators fan added.\n\nThe game’s aggressive and sometimes violent style is what separated hockey from other European sports in the 1890s, allowing Canadians to create a distinct image making hockey perfect for expressing national identity, according to a 2002 paper published in the Journal of American Folklore that studied Canadian identity through sport.\n\nThe “Elbows Up” movement — which riffs off the term popularized by hockey legend Gordie Howe and has become a rallying cry for national unity and defending Canada against Trump’s threats — is one such phenomenon where sports and politics collide.\n\nThe movement has been central to the pushback against American taunts and tariffs, becoming a prominent political slogan during the recent federal election.\n\nWhile the “Battle of Ontario,” along with the playoff series may only be just a game, hockey’s continued popularity transcends the rink.\n\n“It would be great to see a Canadian team bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada where the game was founded,” Devon Shuker, an Ottawa Senators fan said.\n\n“This is our game and this is where it’s going to stay.”","summary":"The NHL 'Battle of Ontario' may provide a newfound sense of Canadian pride amid U.S. President Donald Trump's

The cases are not related.\n\nThe protections had been set to expire April 7, but U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered a pause on those plans. He found that the expiration threatened to severely disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and could cost billions in lost economic activity.\n\nChen, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, found the government hadn’t shown any harm caused by keeping the program alive.\n\nBut Solicitor General D.

He has done that.\" The former Ohio senator said the White House believes Waltz will better serve the administration as UN ambassador, a Senate-confirmed position. Waltz’s exit comes nearly four months after he resigned from his Florida congressional seat to take the NSA role at the White House. The Army veteran faced growing scrutiny after he created a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal in late March, where top national security officials discussed pending attacks against the Houthis in Yemen. HEGSETH FACES LATEST BATTLE DEFENDING HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY POST AT THE PENTAGON Waltz inadvertently added The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the \"Houthi PC small group\" on Signal, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive information about the timing of U.S. military strikes in Yemen. Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, maintains the information he shared was not classified. Democrats have expressed disbelief that information relating to targets and strikes would not have been classified given its sensitive nature. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general is investigating Hegseth’s use of Signal. Vance told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that Waltz’s ousting was not a result of Signalgate, which he called a \"nothingburger.\" He argued the former Florida congressman is simply being moved to another administration position because Trump believes Waltz would do a \"better job in a different role.\" The vice president was also added to the Signal group chat along with DNI Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe and other senior members of the Trump administration. In the chat, Vance expressed his disagreement with the strikes, arguing that such action could be seen as \"inconsistent\" with Trump’s foreign policy messaging when it comes to European allies stepping up to the plate for their own defense. He viewed the strikes as \"bailing\" Europe out. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc,\" the vice president wrote in Signal. HOUTHIS SHOOT DOWN 3RD US REAPER DRONE AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES DAILY AIRSTRIKES Vance told Baier that he believes the Signal chat reflected well on him because it shows his willingness to engage in conversation with other administration officials about how best to implement the president’s agenda. \"I think that's what a good national security team should do,\" he explained. The U.S. has been striking Houthi targets in Yemen for more than 40 days straight. US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement earlier this week that since the start of Operation Rough Rider, it has struck over 800 targets. The strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous leaders, including senior missile and UAV officials, according to CENTCOM. Vance said the Houthis see the consequences of firing on American ships in international waters and disrupting global trade.

Bernie Sanders, who began his three-day tour in Pennsylvania with a message promoting democracy and workers' rights over the rising power of oligarchy. \n\nSanders, 83, has been traveling across the country in recent months to speak against the policies of President Donald Trump and expose the toll of corporate greed that he says will threaten the survival of democracy. The Vermont senator, joined by the Philadelphia AFL-CIO and other labor organizations, gave a speech emphasizing the plight of U.S. workers. \n\nMORE: Deportations, tariffs and federal workforce cuts define Trump’s first 100 days of his second term\n\n\"Today, in the richest country in the history of the world, 60% of our people are living paycheck to paycheck,\" Sanders said. \"I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck. Many of you are living paycheck to paycheck. Millions of people should not and will not live paycheck to paycheck in the richest country in the history of the world.\" \n\nSanders, an independent who garnered broad-based support for his Democratic runs in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, decried the increasing political influence of Elon Musk and other billionaires as workers' wages and benefits fail to keep pace with inflation. He called for the passage of legislation to encourage strong labor unions, renewed his push for universal health care and said the United States must commit to policies that address the dangers of climate change. \n\n\"The American people, by the millions, are saying no to oligarchy, no to Trump's authoritarianism, no to Trump's kleptocracy, and no to tax breaks for billionaires,\" Sanders said. \n\nThursday's rally came amid several protests across the city, including a group that gathered outside the federal courthouse on Sixth and Market streets to rally against Trump's immigration policies targeting sanctuary cities. Sanders' speech at City Hall was followed by a march on Broad Street.\n\n\"I'm just really upset about everything that's happening in this administration, and I'm particularly distraught about what's happening to immigrants,\" said Valerie Buickerood, who traveled to the rally from New Jersey. \"... We have a dictator in power and I am just horrified over that. I have children who are young adults and have a whole life ahead of them to live in this country.\"\n\nBuickerood said she's traveled to rallies in Washington and Florida in recent months to stand beside others who are alarmed about the direction of the country. \n\n\"Bernie, sometimes, is a little left of what I believe, but not so far left at all for me to not want to come out and hear what he has to say,\" she said. \"I know where he's coming from and I'm in line with pretty much most of the things he stands for as a legislator.\" \n\nHank Albert, a retired teacher from Cheltenham, said he worked for the Sanders campaign in 2016. He called Sanders a rare politician who inspires people the way former President John F. Kennedy did when he famously challenged Americans to embrace the power they hold to do good for their country. \n\n\"Nobody believes in that, or nobody lives it anymore,\" Albert said. \"Bernie Sanders is the closest I've ever seen to making that come true. ... Everybody has that dream that maybe it can really happen, but who's going to open the door? There aren't very many people who have the key, but he does.\" \n\nSanders will continue his tour Friday with a stop in Harrisburg at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex, followed by a rally Saturday at Lehigh University in Bethlehem.","summary":"Thousands of people gathered in Center City on Thursday to see U.S. Sen.

I think we'll hit that much earlier.\"\n\nAccording to Cocks, Hasbro has shifted some manufacturing to countries including the U.S., Turkey, China, Japan, India, Vietnam and Indonesia. So far in 2025, he said the company has relocated several hundred SKUs from China to these other locations.\n\nHowever, he affirmed that China is \"always going to be an important place for us to source product.\" Toy making can be labor intensive and require specialized types of labor, he stressed — and Chinese manufacturers have expertise in making specific items like high-end action figures. They also dominate the market for lower-end electronics and foam swords, he continued. But over time, Cocks predicted that other \"sources of supply will mature,\" and Hasbro will be able to diversify production even in those more specialized categories.\n\nHasbro on Tuesday reported an earnings beat, but it forecasted that if Trump's 145% duty on imports continues, the company could take a $300 million hit to its bottom line. However, management was fairly optimistic its diversification strategy would help mitigate any losses.\n\nCocks conceded that he expects prices to go up.

A similar plan during his first term was canceled due to an estimated $92 million price tag and objections from Washington, D.C., officials over the damage tanks and armored vehicles could cause to roads.What to KnowAccording to planning documents obtained by the Associated Press, the proposed event would include more than 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 military vehicles, 50 helicopters, seven bands and potentially thousands of civilians. Though no final decision has been made, the parade would mark a significant expansion of the Army's already scheduled birthday festival on the National Mall, raising concerns about costs and logistics.The documents, dated April 29 and 30, represent the Army's most current plans, which include assembling troops and equipment from 11 corps and divisions across the country. Units listed range from tank and infantry battalions to artillery and Stryker units. The parade would also feature a parachute jump by the Army's Golden Knights, historical reenactors and veterans' groups.The parade is expected to follow a route from Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac into Washington, D.C., and conclude with a concert and fireworks. Among the challenges the Army has identified are housing for incoming troops and significant security requirements for the transport and display of equipment.Arlington County Board Chair Takis Karantonis told the Washington City Paper that Trump's administration is planning a 4-mile long military parade through the capital, the outlet reported this weekend.While the Army's birthday celebration has been in development for over a year, the parade component was added only recently, prompting concerns about the potential costs—likely in the tens of millions—and strain on city infrastructure.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser recently reiterated those concerns, stating that if tanks are used, they should be \"accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads.\"Col. Dave Butler added that the Army hopes to create an event the entire nation can celebrate, and a parade could become part of that vision. The National Park Service has already submitted a request to designate the parade a national special security event, which is under review.What People Are SayingCol. Dave Butler told the AP, \"We want to make it into an event that the entire nation can celebrate with us. We want Americans to know their Army and their soldiers. A parade might become part of that, and we think that will be an excellent addition to what we already have planned.\"Speaking about the Army's upcoming 250th anniversary, before Trump's alleged plans for a military parade were revealed, Gen. Randy George, chief of staff of the Army said: \"As we prepare for our future, we also reflect on our past. 'This we'll defend' was first used as a battle cry by the Continental Army. Today it reminds us that our Army's purpose is clear: to fight and win the nation's wars. We remain committed to honing our warfighting skills, enforcing standards and discipline, and living the values that have defined our Army culture for the past 250 years.\"What Happens NextArmy officials stressed that no final decision has been made, with spokesperson Steve Warren confirming to the AP the plans are still under discussion.Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.Update: 5/1/25, 7:51 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information and remarks.","summary":"President Trump has long pushed for a grand military parade since witnessing France's Bastille Day parade in 2017.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/armys-massive-parade-trumps-birthday-includes-plan-6600-troops-2067045","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2637184/trump-melania.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-01 23:42:09","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.051},{"id":316927678,"title":"Trump’s deputy at the DOJ pushed for search warrant for student protesters’ Instagram accounts","text":"Donald Trump’s criminal defense attorney Emily Bove, now a top official at the Department of Justice, reportedly pushed for an “aggressive” criminal investigation into Columbia University student activists that fueled a mass exodus of civil rights prosecutors.\n\nFederal prosecutors — and a judge — fought against Bove’s pursuit of student activists’ Instagram accounts and search warrants as part of an allegedly aborted criminal inquiry into student demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to a behind-the-scenes report from The New York Times.\n\nProsecutors in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division feared that the investigation was a pretext to facilitate Trump’s deportation campaign targeting dissent on campus, and ultimately refused to put together a list of activist group members Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the newspaper reported.

A week later, he paused many of the tariffs for 90 days, but retained a 145% surcharge on products from China and a 10% tariff on most imports. \n\nThe tariffs are expected to have an outsized impact on footwear and apparel companies, many of which rely on supply chains in the countries targeted by tariffs. \n\nOn a call with Wall Street analysts Thursday afternoon, Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle said apparel brands are facing an “unprecedented level of public policy uncertainty.” \n\n“Our industry has never faced an environment where rules and regulations around trade are more unknown and unknowable,” he said. \n\nBoyle said he’s optimistic Columbia can navigate the uncertainty better than competitors, citing the company’s strong balance sheet, dispersed supply chain, experience at dealing with tariffs and moderately priced products, which could be more in demand if the economy weakens. \n\n“I’m confident we can weather this storm,” he told analysts. \n\nBoyle said Columbia is taking steps to reduce the impact of tariffs, including accelerating shipments from countries where tariffs are paused, cutting spending and pausing capital investments in the U.S. \n\nHe also said the “vast majority” of Columbia products made in China will either be sold in that country or redirected elsewhere in order to avoid hefty tariffs from importing them to the U.S.\n\nAt the product level, Boyle said Columbia is exploring everything from redesigning products to repricing them. He did not provide any specifics about price increases, noting the ongoing uncertainty. \n\n“Companies are unable to confidently plan and invest in their U.S. business until there is clarity with respect to U.S. trade policy,” Boyle said. \n\nEven with its mitigation steps, Boyle said Columbia expects $40 million to $45 million in additional costs for fall 2025 products because of the 10% universal tariff. \n\n“Who knows?” Boyle said. “I may wake up tomorrow, and the whole world’s changed.” \n\nColumbia previously announced plans to cut at least $150 million in annual costs. On the call with analysts, Columbia executives said they expect to cut additional costs given the tariff environment, possibly including layoffs.\n\n“That’s on the table in terms of factors we need to be considering for the balance of this year,” Chief Financial Officer Jim Swanson told analysts.\n\nLast year, Columbia had a round of layoffs focused on its corporate headquarters. \n\nColumbia on Thursday also reported $778.5 million in quarterly sales and $0.75 in earnings per share, both above Wall Street expectations. \n\nIn February, the company said it expected sales would increase 1% to 3% this year. While the company withdrew its sales forecast, Boyle told analysts Columbia was on track to hit its 2025 financial targets before the tariffs were announced. \n\nColumbia shares, which are down 26% this year, were down slightly in after-hours trading within two hours of the earnings report. \n\n– Matthew Kish covers business, including the sportswear and banking industries.

Department of Education (DOE) Secretary Linda McMahon announced Wednesday the team will be launching an investigation into Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal's office. The team, a joint initiative by the DOE and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), is taking action in response to Reykdal requiring schools to allow biologically male trans athletes on girls sports teams. \"Multiple Washington state school districts have reported that OSPI is requiring school boards to adopt policies that allow males to participate in female sports and occupy female-only intimate facilities, thereby raising substantial Title IX concerns,\" the announcement said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM McMahon issued a warning to Reykdal and the rest of the Democrat-controlled state. \"Washington state appears to use its position of authority to coerce its districts into hiding ‘gender identity’ information from students’ parents and to adopt policies to covertly smuggle gender ideology into the classroom, confusing students and letting boys into girls sports, bathrooms and locker rooms,\" McMahon said. \"If true, these are clear violations of parental rights and female equality in athletics, which are protected by federal laws that will be enforced by the Trump administration.\" Reykdal provided a statement to Fox News Digital and did not indicate his office would cooperate with the federal investigation. \"My job as the leader of this constitutional office is to communicate, uphold and enforce the law,\" Reykdal said. \"My office will enforce our current laws as we are required to do until Congress changes the law and/or federal courts invalidate Washington state’s laws. Unless, and until that happens, we will be following Washington state’s laws, not a president’s political leanings expressed through unlawful orders.\" Reykdal spoke in defense of transgender athletes in girls sports in an address Feb. 20, claiming it was \"inaccurate\" to say there are only two genders. \"It is quite simply inaccurate to say, biologically, that there are only boys and there are only girls,\" Reykdal said on camera. \"There's a continuum. There's a science to this. There are children who are born intersex. There are children whose hormones and whose chromosomes are not consistent with their sex at birth.\" STATE EDUCATION CHIEF SAYS IT'S ‘INACCURATE’ TO SAY THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS, IN DEFENSE OF TRANS ATHLETES Washington's high school athletes are allowed to compete based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex. Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy states that each athlete will participate in programs \"consistent with their gender identity or the gender most consistently expressed,\" and there are no medical or legal requirements. Bills that would prohibit transgender girls from participating in girls and women's sports have been introduced but not passed. The Kennewick School Board filed a Title IX complaint with the DOE's Office of Civil Rights against Reykdal's office in late March over the issue. Kennewick School Board President Gabe Galbraith previously told Fox News the district is seeking federal intervention to ensure the order will eventually be honored. SCHOOL BOARD PLEADS WITH TRUMP ADMIN TO FORCE STATE BAN ON TRANSGENDERS IN GIRLS SPORTS AS DEMOCRATS REFUSE \"There's boys participating in girls sports. There's boys in girls locker rooms. It's unfair. It's not safe, and we're asking the federal government to just step in and put an end to this and ensure that the state is following President Trump's statements,\" he said. Other school districts have taken a stand against Reykdal since President Trump signed his \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order Feb. 5. The Tumwater School District's board of directors voted later that month to ban trans girls from playing for girls sports teams. The resolution passed by a vote of 3-1 after a civil rights complaint was filed against the district over an incident involving a trans athlete in a girls basketball game. The complaint alleged that the Tumwater School District in Washington is investigating 15-year-old Frances Staudt for \"misgendering\" the opponent and violating the district's policies against bullying and harassment Feb. 7. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the document, Staudt asked the school's principal and athletic director before the game whether the player was a biological male. The administrators then allegedly confirmed that they had been notified that the player was transgender but denied her pleas to have the player removed. However, the DOE OCR announced an investigation into Tumwater School District just days later. Now, the Trump administration is going further up the chain of command in the state, and taking aim at the superintendent. In addition to reports that Washington schools are allowing trans athletes in girls sports, the DOE cited in its announcement Wednesday that La Center School District in La Center, Washington, received a letter of finding indicating Reykdal was requiring districts to enact policies, such as mandating that districts not notify parents of a change in their child’s \"gender identity,\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"President Donald Trump&apos;s newly formed Title IX investigative team is launching an investigation into the Washington state superintendent of public instruction.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-title-ix-team-probing-education-chief-who-called-inaccurate-say-theres-only-boys-girls","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/1200/675/absolute-joke-washington-state-school-board-officials-slam-state-superintendent-for-defying-trump-eo.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-01 23:36:04","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.09}]}
