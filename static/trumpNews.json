If Trump is Superman, Newsom is Lex Luthor; if Trump is Hulk Hogan, Newsom is Andre the Giant; and if Trump is American Airlines, consider Newsom to be punctuality.\n\nWhy does Newsom want to frame himself as the anti-Trump? Because it’s been beneficial to his political survival, that’s why. He’s like a cruise ship magician, with one really good trick.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nConsider this, a Public Policy Institute of California poll from earlier this month showed a dramatic decline in support for Governor Newsom, with only 44 percent of Californians approving of Newsom’s job performance, down from 52 percent in February.\n\nAdditionally, a majority thought California was going in the wrong direction. In other words, Newsom and his leadership were about as popular in California as Pete Hegseth is in Iran right now.\n\nThen, all hell broke loose in Paramount and Los Angeles, after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents started rounding up illegal aliens for deportation.\n\nNewsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass took the position that despite officers being assaulted, Waymos being set ablaze, motorists being pelted with chunks of concrete, and buildings being vandalized, the “protests” were mostly peaceful and the Los Angeles Police Department had things “under control.” Right. Kind of like how Congress has spending under control.\n\nNewsom’s objections were laughable. In fact, they were a real riot.\n\nTrump didn’t buy it, and sent in hundreds of National Guard troops to protect federal property and agents – all against Newsom’s objections, of course.\n\nNewsom embraced the conflict like it was Randi Weingarten at a DNC meeting, and at one point even challenged Trump administration “Border Czar” Tom Homan to arrest him. Not fake-arrest like Greta Thunberg. Newsom wanted real handcuffs and everything…making Newsom the first Democrat in history to ask a border agent to arrest anyone.\n\nThere is no question Newsom ended up benefiting from the face-off.\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult survey taken June 13-15, as the LA protests were fizzling out, 11 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would back Newsom in a 2028 primary, up from 5 percent who said the same in March.\n\nThose results put Newsom in second place, behind former Vice President Kamala Harris, who garnered the support of 34 percent of Democrats.\n\nIn response John Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College told The Hill newspaper, “He’s doing really well among Democrats, both in California and throughout the nation. He’s getting a boost in 2025.”\n\nBy nationalizing what was essentially a California story, the deeply unpopular Newsom was able to regain his standing among Democrats, in a state where the Dems outnumber Republicans by a two-to-one margin.\n\nIf the focus is on Newsom’s performance on crime, homelessness, the budget, the insurance crisis, The French Laundry, wildfires, or any number of other California catastrophes, Newsom loses. However, if the framing is one of a typical partisan food fight, with Newsom branded as the leader of the Democratic resistance, he wins.\n\nHowever, in politics you always have to worry about the law of unintended consequences. While it’s true that Newsom benefits from nationalizing every level of politics, the Democratic Party largely doesn’t: particularly, Senate Democrats.\n\nIn the pages of Split Ticket, Lakshya Jain, Harrison Lavelle, and Armin Thomas conclude that this type of partisanship is the real reason Democrats have been shut out from nearly half of the nation’s Senate seats. “The decline in ticket splitting means they [Democrats] can no longer overcome structural coalitional differences as easily as they once did,” they explain.\n\n“In 2012, they were winning Senate races in states like North Dakota and West Virginia, even as Barack Obama lost them by more than 20 points. But virtually no modern candidate achieves that type of overperformance now,” they conclude.\n\nIn short, Democrats benefit from ticket splitting a lot more than Republicans do.\n\nIf voters take Newsom’s cue and nationalize all aspects of politics, including down ballot races, the Democrats can say goodbye to the U.S. Senate for good.\n\nNone of this is any big surprise to those of us in California — we know that like everything with Newsom, as long as he personally benefits, he’s all in.\n\nAs we Californians say of people like Newsom: It’s his movie, we’re just in it.\n\nSo, enjoy those seats while you can, Senate Democrats. The rest of the country is in for a real treat.\n\nJohn Phillips can be heard weekdays from noon to 3 p.m. on “The John Phillips Show” on KABC/AM 790.","summary":"If voters take Newsom’s cue and nationalize all aspects of politics, including down ballot races, the Democrats can say goodbye to the U.S. Senate for good.  ","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/30/nationalizing-politics-benefits-gavin-newsom-but-hurts-senate-democrats/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24187703140415.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 01:39:12","author":"John Phillips","authors":["John Phillips"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":336902706,"title":"Far-left actor John Cusack says Iran 'should get' nukes to protect Middle East from US and Israel","text":"Anti-Israel and anti-Trump actor John Cusack expressed hope last Friday that Iran will get a nuclear weapon. In a post shared to X, the actor said Iran should get a nuclear weapon so that it can deter the U.S. and Israel’s aggression in the Middle East. \"Iran will surely rush to get a nuclear weapon- and they should get one,\" he wrote, adding, \"it’s the only way to deter US and Israel from bombing every country in Middle East.\" WATCH: BERNIE SANDERS REACTS TO TRUMP'S IRAN STRIKES IN REAL TIME AT 'FIGHTING OLIGARCHY' RALLY Cusack published his post almost a week after President Donald Trump ordered U.S. military strikes on three major Iranian facilities believed to be developing nuclear weapons.

But he failed to secure a meeting with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent or make any clear progress.\nTrump announced earlier this year that he would increase the tariff on imported vehicles from 2.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent – a move that was temporarily paused for 90 days to allow negotiations. That window closes on July 9, and signs suggest Trump is prepared to let the tariff take effect.\nIn an interview on Fox News broadcast on Sunday, Trump said he had no plans to scale back the tariffs and that letters detailing his administration’s demands would be sent to Japan and other trade partners “starting pretty soon”.\n“I could send one to Japan. Dear Mr Japan, here’s the story. You’re going to pay an extra 25 per cent tariff on all your cars,” Trump said on Fox.\n“They won’t take our cars and yet we take millions and millions of their cars into the United States,” he complained.\n“It’s not fair. I explained that to Japan and they understand it. And we have a big deficit with Japan and they understand that too.”\n\nWhile Japan was unhappy when the US doubled tariffs on Japanese imports of steel and aluminium to 50 per cent in early June, there is even greater concern about the critically important auto sector, analysts say.\n“For Japan, the auto sector is most definitely the most important thing,” said Martin Schulz, chief policy economist at Fujitsu’s Global Market Intelligence Unit.\n“There can be no solution on trade in general unless auto tariffs are significantly lower,” he told This Week in Asia. “Japan and the rest of the world adjusted to the 10 per cent tariff on all imports that was announced, but anything beyond that is simply a no-go for Japan.”\nAccording to Schulz, it is not simply a question of the impact of tariffs on the profits of Japanese car manufacturers, as vehicles account for fully one-third of all Japanese exports, while 8 per cent of all jobs in Japan are in some way linked to the auto sector or its extended supply chain.\nThe substance of Akazawa’s discussions with the Trump administration has not been confirmed, although Schulz points out that the British government was able to carve out an exception on exports of British-built cars to the US, albeit on a far smaller scale than Japanese exports, while German car makers are discussing a more beneficial quota system linked to greater investment in manufacturing in the US.\nJapan has not been able to achieve that sort of breakthrough in part because of the sheer number of vehicles sold in the US – about 4.72 million in 2024 – but also because of the uncertainty in Japanese politics due to the July 20 House of Councillors election, which may well usher in a new government with new approaches to the US.\n\n“What we may see is a framework of an agreement before July 9 with the details filled in later,” Schulz said, thereby enabling Japanese firms to avoid the tariff increase. But that would be hard to predict with any certainty when considering Trump’s approach to politics, he added.\nTakaki Nakanishi, CEO of the Tokyo-based Nakanishi Research Institute and a specialist in the auto sector, said the 27.5 per cent tariff was “ridiculously high” and should be cancelled – but he was confident that Japanese firms would be able to ride out the challenges should it be imposed.\n“I think I expected this situation, so I am neither pessimistic nor optimistic,” he said. “The Japanese government is working hard to get its message across, but I do not think they are able to make their point.”\nTokyo has gone to great lengths to emphasise that Japanese firms are larger investors in the US, with manufacturing plants across the country employing hundreds of thousands of people. Many of these companies are in the auto sector and already contributing to the US economy.\nJapan has also played up its role as a key security ally in the Asia-Pacific, critical to resisting the challenges posed by China, North Korea and Russia.\n\nNone of those points appear to have hit home, however, and Nakanishi expects the new tariff rate to be imposed on Japanese cars in a few days’ time.\n“Everybody thinks that the tariff rate is ridiculously high, but no Japanese car firms are thinking of leaving the US market,” he said. “Japanese car makers will try to make further cost reductions and work hard to maintain good relations with their US partners, while still benefiting from the cars that are actually built in the US.”\nThat would give Japanese firms a distinct advantage over makers from other countries, such as South Korea, he added.\n“This could be a chance to increase brand volume and market share in the US and these tariffs could even trigger growth in the US market by encouraging Japanese competitiveness,” he said.\n“There will be short-term pressures on profitability, but firms can offset that and I am far more optimistic about the long-term outlook in the US.”","summary":"Japan’s top negotiator has made a last-ditch trip to Washington in hopes of heading off a steep US tariff on Japanese cars – but with just over a week to go, and President Donald Trump doubling down in recent comments, analysts say neither side appears willing to compromise.\nRyosei Akazawa, Japan’s chief trade envoy on the issue, flew into the US capital on Thursday and spoke twice to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick by phone over the weekend.

It's all got a little bit embarrassing hasn't it? Pretty simple question. When are you going to meet the Donald?' Stefanovic said. \n\nThe PM said they would meet in the 'coming months' but refused to lock in a date.\n\n'I can't comprehend how the President, given how close allies we have been with the US for so long, couldn't give a rat's about meeting with you,' Stefanovic continued.\n\n'I think it's so disrespectful. And why don't you just tell him to bugger off?'\n\nMr Albanese said he was having audio issues and missed the question which was repeated by co-host Sarah Abo.\n\nKarl Stefanovic has told Anthony Albanese he should tell Donald Trump to 'bugger off' as he faces mounting pressure to lock in a meeting with the US President\n\n'He (Trump) seems to be snubbing you,' she said. \n\nThe PM rejected the assumption and said he and Trump had had 'really constructive discussions'. \n\nIt comes amid speculation Albanese will finally meet Trump at a Quad meeting in India later this year.\n\n'I'd be prepared, of course, to meet with President Trump when a suitable time can be organised,' the PM told the ABC on Monday.\n\n'We also have the Quad meeting coming up that we are finalising as well.\n\n'So these things are being organised, and I look forward to having a meeting and continuing the constructive dialogue that I've had with President Trump up to now.' \n\nThe September meeting now offers the best chance for their long overdue meeting.\n\nThat month, Albanese will also travel to New York for the UN leader's week, and may also be able to meet Trump there, or make a trip to Washington. \n\nThe PM rejected the assumption he was being 'snubbed' by the US President and said he and Trump had had 'really constructive discussions'\n\nThe prime minister is the only leader from the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - made up of Australia, the US, India and Japan - who has yet to meet Trump in person\n\nSticking points in the US-Australia relationship which are crying out to be addressed include the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, which is currently under review by the Trump administration, and punishing tariffs imposed by the US on Aussie imports, including a 50 per cent levy on steel and aluminium.\n\nThe prime minister has been accused of dragging his feet in meeting with the leader of Australia's most important security ally. \n\nSince Trump was inaugurated in January, the pair have spoken on the phone three times. \n\nHe missed an opportunity to meet the US president at the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this month when Trump left the Summit early to deal with the Israel-Iran conflict. \n\nHe also did not attend last week's NATO Summit, where political observers had hoped he would have a second chance to meet with Trump.\n\nEven US lawmakers are now urging Albanese to come to the White House and develop a personal rapport with Trump in order to save the wavering AUKUS pact.\n\nThe meeting, when it does happen, will not necessarily be an amicable one. Trump is expected to leverage tariffs and his commitment to AUKUS in order to pressure Albanese to increase defence spending, which at 2.2 per cent of GDP is well short of the 3 per cent that the US has previously demanded of Australia. \n\nThere is added pressure on Australia to boost defence, now that NATO members have agreed to lift their defence spending to 5 per cent of GDP over 10 years - with the White House later indicating it expects its allies in the Asia-Pacific to follow suit.\n\nTrump also reportedly does not like Australia's ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, and may view Rudd's ongoing tenure as a barrier to improved relations.\n\nRudd enjoys cross-party support in Australia, but his position has been under threat since past comments he made about Trump came to light.\n\nIn November, shortly after Trump's election win, Daily Mail Australia revealed how Rudd never envisioned his comeback, calling his first term a period of 'episodic craziness'.\n\nIn other, since deleted comments made online, Rudd labelled Trump a 'village idiot', a 'traitor to the West' and 'the most destructive president in history'.\n\nIndiaAnthony AlbaneseJapan\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAlbo, tell Donald Trump to 'bugger off': Brutal advice for PM as he drops clue about when he will meet US President\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Prime Minister is the only leader from the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue - made up of Australia, the US, India and Japan - who is yet to meet Trump in person since his re-election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14862657/Anthony-Albanese-Donald-Trump-meeting.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/01/02/99876901-0-image-m-20_1751332017793.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 01:25:01","author":"Editor,Harrison Christian","authors":["Editor","Harrison Christian"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":336902918,"title":"Trump lifts U.S. sanctions on Syria in bid to boost new government","text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order terminating U.S. sanctions on Syria, aiming to boost the nation’s struggling economy and support the new government after rebels overthrew President Bashar Assad last year.The order removes various sanctions on Syria, effective July 1, while keeping those on Assad, 'his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS or its affiliates, and Iranian proxies,” according to the White House, referring to the Islamic State group.Trump’s move is part of an effort to 'promote and support the country’s path to stability and peace,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.

Sun's lawyer Jarrod Schaeffer declined to comment following Monday's proceedings but has previously dismissed the new charges as “feverish accusations unmoored from the facts\". Hu's lawyers didn't immediately respond Monday but have also similarly denied the charges. Prosecutors say the couple collected millions of dollars in kickbacks by exploiting Sun's role in helping New York procure personal protective equipment, or PPE, during the pandemic in 2020. They say Sun, a naturalised US citizen, used connections in her native China to secure PPE for the state, though she didn't disclose her family's ties to two vendors that received more than USD 44 million, prosecutors say. Sun previously pleaded not guilty to charges she used her position in state government to advance Chinese government priorities in exchange for financial rewards, including assistance with Hu's business ventures in China. The lucrative benefits helped the Long Island couple live a lavish lifestyle with multimillion-dollar properties and luxury cars, prosecutors have said.

He warned that if the bill passed, he would immediately launch the “America Party,” vowing to fund primary challengers against any Republican lawmakers who supported the measure.Musk’s criticism extended to the conservative House Freedom Caucus, long known for opposing government overspending. “How can you call yourself the Freedom Caucus if you vote for a DEBT SLAVERY bill with the biggest debt ceiling increase in history?” he posted, pledging to personally bankroll campaigns to unseat those he sees as betraying their promises to voters.The billionaire’s intervention comes as Senate Republicans advanced the 1,000-page bill in a razor-thin 51–49 vote, setting the stage for a tense week of amendments before Trump’s July 4 deadline for signing the legislation into law. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, despite White House claims of economic growth and benefits for working Americans.Live EventsPresident Trump, attempting to downplay the rift, told Fox News, “I think Elon is a wonderful guy… but he got a little bit upset, and you know that wasn’t appropriate.” Trump also suggested Musk’s opposition was triggered by proposed cuts to electric vehicle subsidies—a claim Musk flatly denied, insisting his concern is with “the mountain of disgusting pork in wasteful spending”.Musk’s dramatic threats and the volatility they sparked—including a temporary $150 billion drop in Tesla’s market cap—underscore the high stakes and deep divisions within the Republican Party as Trump pushes for a legislative win ahead of Independence Day. With polls showing the bill is unpopular among Republican voters, Musk warned, “This bill is political suicide for the Republican Party… It will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!”(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onElon MuskAmerica PartyRepublican votersTesla market capHouse Freedom Caucustax and spending legislationDonald Trump\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

In a statement to TheWrap, Feig called the heightened persecution of immigrants in Los Angeles and beyond “inhumane and cruel.”\n\n“The inhumane and cruel persecution of immigrants in our communities is unconscionable and unacceptable,” he said. “In Los Angeles and across the country, the hardworking people we interact with every day are sincere in their desire to build a rewarding life in the U.S. for themselves and their families. Their pursuit of the American Dream is precisely what our country was built on. After all, what’s more American than trying to make it in America?”\n\nThe filmmaker then called on the country’s leaders to embrace the immigrant experience. \n\n“Instead of stoking fear and resentment, our country’s leaders should pursue immigration policies based on a fundamental truth: immigrants make us stronger,” he said.\n\nBefore he was elected, President Donald Trump vowed to increase pressure on deporting undocumented immigrants as a significant focus of his campaign. Since his inauguration in January, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have occurred publicly and frequently, with documented and undocumented immigrants alike fearing for their safety from the often-masked agents.\n\nA University of Southern California graduate, Feig made a name for himself when he created the cult classic comedy series “Freaks and Geeks.” He directed a number of episodes of successful comedy shows following “Freaks and Geeks,” including “The Office” and “Arrested Devel0pment.” From there, he launched a successful career in film as a comedy writer/director, helming such projects as “Bridesmaids,” “Spy,” “A Simple Favor” and 2016’s “Ghostbusters.” Most recently, “Another Simple Favor” premiered in March.\n\nFeig’s NILC donations follows a $300,000 contributor The Trevor Project, Translifeline.org and It Gets Better — all queer advocacy organizations — earlier this year. In mid-June, the filmmaker took to social media to condemn the Trump administration’s shuttering of suicide prevention services for members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nLA recently found itself at the center of national conversation, as Trump deployed the national guard to stem protests against ICE activity. In June, the Los Angeles Dodgers committed $1 million in donations to immigrant families.\n\nIn a statement to TheWrap on Feig’s donation, Kica Matos, the organization’s president, said, “Now more than ever, we need Americans from all walks of life to step up and fight to support vulnerable immigrants. Not only are they under attack, but the path to authoritarianism is being built on their backs. We are grateful for Paul’s generous support, as it will help continue to fuel our advocacy – not just in support of low income immigrants, but also our democracy.”\n\nThe Ankler first reported the news.","summary":"The \"Bridesmaids\" and \"A Simple Favor\" director says the persecution of immigrants in the L.A. community is \"inhumane and cruel\"\n\n\nThe post Paul Feig Donates $100K to National Immigration Law Center, Calls Trump ICE Policy &#8216;Unconscionable and Unacceptable&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/paul-feig-national-immigration-law-center-donation-trump-ice-cruel/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Paul-Feig-Simple-Favor.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 01:05:14","author":"Casey Loving","authors":["Casey Loving"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.285},{"id":336898122,"title":"Holly Valance seen for first time without wedding ring after split from billionaire","text":"The former Neighbours actress and pop star, 42, was photographed at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 wearing a black top, comfy blue jeans, a black cardigan and trainers.\n\nThe Aussie carried a large suitcase and a Christian Dior tote bag as she made her way to a waiting car.\n\nMORE: Who gets what in Holly, ex split\n\nIt comes after it was revealed that Holly and Nick, 52, are divorcing after 13 years of marriage. \n\nFriends told The Sun that the couple had quietly separated in recent weeks.\n\nA family friend said: “This has been a very difficult period for both Nick and Holly, and they are keeping things private out of respect for their family.\n\n“The joint parenting of their two amazing daughters remains their top priority. \n\n“They’ve had to juggle a demanding lifestyle.

The Senate additionally rejected an amendment that would have funded Planned Parenthood as part of the budget reconciliation bill by a 49-51 vote. \n\nThe success comes after a major campaign by conservatives and pro-life organizations urging Republicans and President Donald Trump to end taxpayer dollars to abortion organizations through reconciliation — as Congress did in 2015 and 2017. \n\nDefunding abortion providers through the reconciliation process would allow the Senate to bypass the critical 60-vote threshold for a simple majority vote, instead capitalizing on Republicans’ overall trifecta. While federal funding for abortions specifically is barred by the Hyde Amendment, pro-life opponents argue no federal funds should be used to prop up any organization that performs abortions.\n\nPlanned Parenthood’s most recent annual report revealed record numbers of abortions and taxpayer funding in 2023-2024.\n\nThe report, called “A Force For Hope,” states that 402,230 unborn babies were killed in abortions, up from 392,715 the previous year. At the same time, the organization received $792.2 million in taxpayer funding, up almost $100 million from the previous year.\n\n“Planned Parenthood has said losing Medicaid funding would put at least 200 health centers across the country at risk of closure — 90 percent of them in states where abortion is legal. More than 1 million low-income people would lose access to a health care provider,” according to the Hill. \n\nThe inclusion of the provision also follows a Supreme Court ruling last week essentially allowing red states to deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would apply nationally.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Senate provision stripping abortion providers — including Planned Parenthood — of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Massive New Legislation Aims to Cut Funding for Planned Parenthood first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/massive-new-legislation-aims-to-cut-funding-for-planned-parenthood/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/rewrite-this-title-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Will-Defund-Abortion-Giant.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 01:02:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":336901198,"title":"Karoline Leavitt Reveals Handwritten Message from Trump to Fed Chair Jerome Powell with Sharp Critique","text":"President Donald Trump is finding novel ways to try to pressure Fed chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates – this time releasing an angry handwritten note that casts the US central bank as behind the curve.\n\nTrump posted a chart of ‘World Central Bank Rates’ – showing institutions from countries including Botswana, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, and Albania which have set their own rates lower than the U.S.\n\nHe hand-wrote the note in all-caps with his familiar Sharpie marker, once again telling Powell that he is ‘too late’ in bringing down rates.\n\n‘You have cost the USA a fortune and continued to do so,’ he lectured. ‘Hundreds of billions of dollars being lost! No inflation,’ the president added.’ \n\nTrump last week said he was already thinking of replacements for the Princeton-educated Powell, who he has repeatedly called ‘stupid.’ \n\nThe president published the post online shortly before the White House press briefing, where press secretary Karoline Leavitt read from what she called ‘original correspondence’ from Trump.\n\n‘As the president has consistently stated, the American economy is booming, and there were so many economic analysts who said that this president’s policies would drive our economy down, when in fact, we have seen the opposite,’ she said at the top of the briefing. \n\nPowell has consistently said Fed decisions would not be influenced by political pressure. \n\nBut that hasn’t stopped the White House from trying. \n\n‘The American people want to borrow money cheaply, and they should be able to do that, but unfortunately, we have interest rates that are still too high,’ Leavitt said.\n\nThe president made clear where he thinks US rates should be. ‘Should be here,’ he wrote on his note, pointing to six countries with lower rates at the top of his list. \n\nPowell himself testified last week that one reason the Fed was reluctant to slash rates further was the uncertainty Trump’s tariffs were injecting into markets.\n\nHe told the Senate Finance Committee: ‘We do expect to show up — tariff inflation to show up more.’\n\n‘But I want to be honest, we really don’t know how much of that’s going to be passed through to the consumers. We just don’t know. And we won’t know until we see it. It could be lower than we expect; it could be higher. We have to wait and see, which is kind of what we’re doing.’\n\nIn just one example, Trump last week said the US was ending trade talks with Canada after it imposed a digital services tax that could hammer US tech companies.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD \n Published:01:51 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:55 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nOasis have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans.\nBrothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reunite on stage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Friday - in their first gig in 15 years.\nThe iconic Britpop band will perform stadium shows across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and North, Central and South America, where it will conclude with a show at São Paulo's Estádio do Morumbi on November 23. \nAnd on Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside. \nIt has also been revealed the brothers have enlisted new bandmates for the tour, with drummer Joey Waronker and guitarists Andy Bell, Gem Archer and Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs on board.\nA source told The Mirror: 'With a new lineup and it being such a huge first show, the boys will do some songs inside the venue too. \n\nOasis have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans\n\nBrothers Noel and Liam Gallagher will reunite on stage at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on Friday - in their first gig in 15 years (Seen in Cardiff in 1997)\n'Some tours would start with a smaller show or take a week or two to get into the groove again- but there is no time for that, and also Liam and Noel want every night to be massive. \n'This is such a huge comeback show, and they are taking it very seriously, it all points to it being an incredible comeback tour.'\nFans have since reacted to hearing rehearsals for the Gallagher brothers' gig kicking off in Wales, taking to social media.\nOne fan shared a clip saying: 'Hello, so it is Monday, the gig is this weekend and you can probably hear it behind me already - the sound check is happening. \n'I'm not sure what song it is but it defintiely sounds like Oasis. There was just instruments earlier but now there is vocals so they seem to be in Cardiff already. Which is very early for a sound check. '\nMeanwhile sharing other clips, people said: 'Oasis soundcheck in Cardiff just now, @liamgallagher sounding biblical,'; \n'THEY'RE IN THERE!!! @liamgallagher and @oasis are testing @principalitysta speakers in Cardiff and they are LOUD,';\n'Oasis soundcheck Cardiff sounds wicked,'; 'Oasis sound checking in Cardiff ohhhh my god.'\n\nOn Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside (Seen in Cardiff in 1997)\n\nOasis crew members could be forgiven for looking back in anger on Sunday after Liam took a swipe at them on social media \n\nLiam risked upsetting the tireless roadies responsible for organising Live '25 - the band's first tour since their 2009 implosion - by claiming even their families will be relieved to rid of them\n\n Oasis announce plans to release MORE tickets ahead of reunion stadium tour \nOasis crew members could be forgiven for looking back in anger on Sunday after Liam took a swipe at them on social media. \nLiam, 52, risked upsetting the tireless roadies responsible for organising Live '25 - the band's first tour since their 2009 implosion - by claiming even their families will be relieved to rid of them this summer.\nTaking to X, he quipped: 'Our crew members don't have friends and there wife's and husbands are glad to see the f**king backs of them and tell me n rkid everytime we see them they don't know how we put up with them on a daily basis let alone go around the f**king world with them fyi.' [sic] \nThe singer appeared to be responding to claims that Oasis crew members have not been issued free tickets for friends and family members - widely considered to be a perk of the job. \n'The crew will be travelling around the country with the band, setting up the venues, and will be on hand throughout the concerts in case they are needed,' one source told the Daily Mail's Katie Hind.\n'They'll be away from their family and are usually given tickets to invite them down to join them at one of the shows.\n'But the Gallagher brothers have banned any free tickets being given out. The crew are all fuming. Many of them have toured with other big-name artists and have never known anything like it. \n\nA statement posted to the band's official website confirmed a limited number of extra tickets will be released 'in the coming days' \n'All Oasis seem to care about is making as much money as they can. Is this about fans, or is the truth that it's all about the money?'\nThe band recently confirmed a limited number of extra tickets will be released ahead of July. \nA statement posted to the band's official website on Wednesday read: 'As the shows are getting closer, Oasis promoters may be able to release a very limited number of additional tickets for sale once final sight lines are checked and the production is fine tuned.\n'These final production releases will happen over the coming days.'\nFollowing their initial release, thousands of fans waited for hours in virtual queues to get their hands on highly coveted tickets for the band's reunion shows, only to find that prices had jumped in a 'dynamic pricing' scheme.\nJapanSouth KoreaOasisWalesLiam Gallagher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOasis kick off rehearsals in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour after last-minute change\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

She also highlighted the strong personal relationship between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nAlso Read | Laos Job Scam Alert: Cybercrime Centre Reveals Modus Operandi of Fraudsters Luring Indians Into Cybercrime Rackets in Vientiane With Fake Job Offers (Watch Video).\nResponding to a question from ANI about how the US views China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Leavitt said, \"India remains a very strategic ally in the Asia Pacific and the President has a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi, and he will continue to have that.\"\nThe comments come as External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is currently in the United States to attend the QUAD Foreign Ministers' Meeting. On Monday, he inaugurated an exhibition at the United Nations titled \"The Human Cost of Terrorism,\" which aims to draw global attention to state-sponsored terrorism.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Reiterates Vow To Block Iran's Nuclear Ambitions, Claims US Strikes 'Obliterated' Key Sites.\nThe QUAD is a diplomatic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. It is committed to supporting an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient. The grouping's origin traces back to the joint humanitarian response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nEarlier, on June 18, it was confirmed that US President Donald Trump accepted Prime Minister Modi's invitation to attend the upcoming QUAD Summit in New Delhi later this year. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had shared details of the phone conversation that took place between the two leaders on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Canada.\n\"For the next meeting of QUAD, PM Modi invited President Trump to India. While accepting the invitation, President Trump said that he is excited to come to India,\" Misri said in a video message.\nThe White House spokesperson's remarks on India's importance in the Indo-Pacific came shortly after she addressed another ANI question about a possible trade deal between India and the US.\nAddressing the media, Leavitt said, \"Yes, the President said that last week (that the US and India are very close to a trade deal), and it remains true. I just spoke to our Secretary of Commerce about it. He was in the Oval Office with the President. They are finalising these agreements, and you'll hear from the President and his trade team very soon when it comes to India.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy AMELIA WYNNE FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:50 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:52 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi has admitted that he's constantly worried about his health and mortality.\nThe rocker, 76, spoke candidly in a new interview as he said he often now asks himself: 'Will I last too much longer?' \nFrancis is the co-founder, lead singer, lead guitarist and the sole continuous member of the rock band Status Quo.\nIn recent years he has embraced vegetable smoothies, herbal supplements and 60 sit ups-a-day as part of his impressive lifestyle overhaul following years of alcohol and drug addiction. \nHe told The Mirror this week: 'My wife asks me when we have coffee at about 7ish, 7.30 am, she says, 'How are you today?'. I go, 'Well...' It's in the morning I get, 'What the f*** am I doing?' \n'And I can't get that out of my mind, whatever I do. I'll be alright as the day goes on. I'm going into the studio in a while. And then I look forward to the next meal, and that's it really.\n\nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi has admitted that he's constantly worried about his health and mortality\n\nThe rocker, 76, spoke candidly in a new interview as he said he often now asks himself: 'Will I last too much longer?'\n'Will I last too much long. Being 76 gets to me most mornings'. \nBack in 2021 he quipped that he hadn't got 'long left' as he discussed his strict health regime to prepare for his OUT OUT QUOING tour in 2022. \nHe said to The Sun on Saturday at the time: 'Coming out [of lockdown] is a problem for me. Going back to work with Quo is a problem for me.\n'Physically, can I do the Quo gig? I'm fit, but I cannot emulate the lung capacity any more and I have to increase that.\n'I've been practising in my room at night. I've been trying to sing Paper Plane and I get about a quarter of the way through it and it just tires you out.'\nHis intense fitness schedule included 30-length dips in his swanky indoor pool at 7am, followed by eight minutes of crunches and 60 sit-ups.\nFrancis, who lives in Surrey with his wife of 32 years Eileen, fills his nutrition-packed smoothies with broccoli, kale, spinach, carrots, raspberries and strawberries, with apple cider vinegar to aid digestion. \nBreakfast includes a diverse selection of fruit and vegetables while 'dinner' takes place at 3.30pm, giving the Status Quo star plenty of time for his stomach to settle ahead of exercising his vocal cords or going on stage. \nFrancis revealed he prefers to eat early as he performs better on an empty stomach. \n\nFrancis is the co-founder, lead singer, lead guitarist and the sole continuous member of the rock band Status Quo\nDinner is followed by a one-hour scenic power walk around his leafy neighbourhood. \nFrancis confirmed he has ditched prescription medicines in favour of herbal remedies and a long list of supplements including probiotics, Omega 3, vitamin D and magnesium tablets. \n\n Status Quo's FRANCIS ROSSI on sipping margaritas with Queen and why he won't buy wine (but loves a smoothie) \nHe decided to go teetotal several years ago after abusing alcohol in the 80s and developing a £1.7million cocaine habit which caused his septum to fall out in the shower. \nFrancis said any type of drug, including prescription medications, can be a 'slippery slope' for him, after struggling to give up the legal drug, Valium, in the past. \nHe also watched the deterioration of his band mate Rick Parfitt - who he has known since the age of 16 - after the rock 'n' roll lifestyle took a toll on his body. Rick passed away in 2016 at the age of 68. \nWhile he has turned his life around for the better, Francis confirmed he still has one vice, a single cigarette which he savours between 5.15pm and 6.30pm daily.\nHe opts for an American spirit tobacco which is free of nasty preservatives and additives \nFrancis said of his one-a-day habit: 'I light it and the nicotine hits worse than any drug or alcohol. I've got to have one vice!' \n\nIn recent years he has embraced vegetable smoothies, herbal supplements and 60 sit ups-a-day as part of his impressive lifestyle overhaul following years of alcohol and drug addiction \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStatus Quo's Francis Rossi, 76, admits he's constantly worried about his health and mortality after lifestyle overhaul: 'Will I last too much longer?'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Flossie strengthened with maximum sustained winds of 100 kph. It was centred about 270 km southwest of Zihuatanejo and was moving northwest at over 19 kmph. Mexico's government issued a tropical storm warning along the southwestern coast from Punta San Telmo to Playa Perula.

A tropical storm watch remained in effect for the southwest coast from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. A watch means tropical storm conditions are possible in the area within two days. Flossie is expected to rapidly intensify into a hurricane late Monday or early Tuesday, then skirt the coast for a few days. While its centre is forecast to remain offshore, moderate rain was likely in parts of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco through early next week. Meanwhile, the remnants of Barry were bringing heavy rain to Mexico's Gulf coast after it came ashore as a tropical depression south of Tampico with maximum sustained winds of 48 kmph, the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:47 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:52 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nA Strictly Come Dancing hunk has reportedly signed up for Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, just weeks after his shock split from his fiancée.\nBen Cohen, 46, is reportedly gearing up to take on the gruelling Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins challenge. \nThe former rugby player, who is well known for his appearance on Strictly more than a decade ago, is looking forward to 'throw himself into a new challenge' following his split from fiancée of 12 years Kristina Rihanoff. \nA TV insider told The Sun: 'Ben has had a difficult few months with his split from Kristina, having to sell their home and also having spiralling business debts.\n'Celeb SAS is not only a good pay day for him, but it's a new challenge to throw himself into.\n'Ben is obviously a sportsman and a very physical, competitive player so if anyone can handle the SAS recruitment process, it's him.'\n\nStrictly Come Dancing hunk Ben Cohen has reportedly signed up for Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins just weeks after his shock split from professional dancer fiancée\n\nThe former rugby star is reportedly gearing up to take on the gruelling challenge, in a bid to impress Rudy Reyes, Chris Oliver, Billy Billingham and Jason Fox\nMailOnline have contacted Ben and Celebrity SAS representatives for comment. \nBen and Kristina's relationship was the product of the BBC show's infamous curse when he left his then-wife Abby in 2013, before going onto date Kristina, before money troubles reportedly tore them apart. \nMailOnline was told that it was the severe financial difficulties they had recently experienced are believed to have been behind their split.\nThe extent of the couple's struggles were laid bare in unusual circumstances - during a court appearance last September when Kristina was caught driving without insurance.\nGiving evidence during the case, England World Cup winning rugby star Ben admitted he had bungled the handling of their car insurance policy and told how he was 'fighting to save his relationship and home'.\nA friend of the couple said: 'The past six months have been hell for them and it has torn the love they had apart. For the sake of their family, they have chosen to go forward as separate individuals.\n'Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it's over and it looks like there's no going back.'\nThe couple were left with crippling debts after they ploughed every penny they had into a yoga studio which plunged into crisis during the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe former rugby player is looking forward to 'throw himself into a new challenge' following his split from fiancée of 12 years Kristina Rihanoff\n\nEXCLUSIVE The real reason for Kristina Rihanoff and Ben Cohen's split after 'six months of hell' is revealed as the couple separate after 12 years together \nAccording to The Sun, the couple are now left with a crippling £1million debt. \nIn a tortuously frank admission Cohen told the court: 'I get up every day and I fight not to lose everything - to lose my cars and my house and my relationship. I'm so overdrawn.'\nWhen questioned about the strains on his and Rihanoff's relationship, he said: 'We're still living together. We're in it financially.\n'We're in business together so the problem is that we opened the business before Covid and we got the worst severities of it and in all honestly this is just another problem for me to deal with.\n'I've got credit cards that are overdrawn. I'm overdrawn in both accounts. We have got a business debt because of Covid. It's just another problem.'\nMailOnline was given an insight into the struggles during an interview with the couple in May 2021.\nThey started Soo Yoga Group together in June 2017 - four years after falling for each other when they partnered on the 11th series of the hit BBC show.\nCompanies House records showed that the Soo Yoga Group Ltd was £488,470 in the red in its last submitted set of accounts for the year ending on July 31, 2022.\nThe company was facing being struck off and Cohen has since resigned as a director leaving Rihanoff as its sole director - while other companies linked to the couple were also in difficulties.\nIt was not long before the couple had put their £1.75million five-bedroom home in Sywell, Northamptonshire, where they had lived since 2016 on the market.\nCohen resorted to selling topless photos of himself in a bid to raise some much needed cash.\n\nThe extent of the couple's struggles were laid bare during a court appearance last September when Kristina was caught driving without insurance (pictured 2024)\nAhead of the new year, he created a calendar with 1,000 personally signed editions selling at £32.95 a time in the hope of raking in £33,000.\nThe couple revealed the irony of how they set off full of hope on a project to improve health and wellbeing only to be plunged into a crisis which left them facing losing everything and damaging their mental health.\nRussian-born Rihanoff - who left Strictly in 2015 before giving birth to their daughter Mila the following year - had worked hard to retrain as a yoga instructor.\nBut the couple were forced to close their seven-studio yoga centre when the pandemic struck just nine months after opening.\nThe studio offered dance, meditation and pilates classes while Cohen taught high intensity training.\nRihanoff told MailOnline: 'The company is a new company we'd just set it up. We invested everything we've ever had.\n'It was awful. I put everything into it and you don't even have a chance to develop the business.\n'We opened in August after the first lockdown and had a huge spike. It's a family orientated centre. Then November lockdown, December it was awful because we didn't know the end of it. It was forever and ever and ever. Fingers crossed we can go back to normality soon.'\nShe spoke of struggles with depression which has 'skyrocketed through the lockdowns' and admitted they struggled.\nAt that point the couple were able to temporarily run outdoor classes on tennis courts in Northampton but told of their plans to expand the business into a nationwide venture - hoping to emule the success of David Lloyd's sports club empire.\nCohen said: 'Yes it's great being outside and doing stuff but it shouldn't be at that point - we haven't earned a penny.'\nCohen told how it was 'tough to run a business' but said of his hopes: 'Essentially we want to do what David Lloyd did.

Hundreds of demonstrators braved the sizzling heat in Seville on Sunday to demand change in international tax, debt and aid policies. “Global South countries will never be able to decide how they want to do development if they are bound to the new colonial debt,” protester Ilan Henzler, 28, told AFP.","summary":"SEVILLE, (Spain): UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the world to “rev up the engine of development” at an aid conference in Spain on Monday at a time when US-led cuts are jeopardising the fight against poverty and climate change.\n\n\n\nDozens of world leaders and more than 4,000 representatives from businesses, civil society and financial institutions are gathering in the city of Seville for the June 30-July 3 conference to seek fresh impetus for the crisis-hit aid sector.\n\n\n\nBut the United States is snubbing the biggest such talks in a decade, underlining the erosion of international cooperation on combating hunger, disease and climate change.\n\n\n\nGuterres told delegates at the opening of the conference that two-thirds of United Nations sustainable development goals set for 2030 were “lagging” and more than $4.0 trillion of annual investment would be needed to achieve them.\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s gutting of his country’s development agency, USAID, is the standout example.\n\n\n\nBut Germany, Britai","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40370439/un-chief-urges-aid-surge-in-world-of-climate-chaos-raging-conflicts","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/07/686329ef98bcf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:49:06","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.103},{"id":336900678,"title":"World News | PM Modi's 5-nation Tour to Focus on Boosting Bilateral Cooperation in Critical Minerals","text":"New Delhi [India], July 1 (ANI): With 21st-century technologies increasingly reliant on critical minerals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming five-nation tour, beginning July 2, is expected to expand India's bilateral cooperation in sectors such as mining, mineral resources, and energy.\nAt a special briefing ahead of PM Modi's visits to Ghana, Argentina, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, and Namibia, Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Dammu Ravi, spoke about the growing importance of critical minerals for new-age technologies.\nAlso Read | Laos Job Scam Alert: Cybercrime Centre Reveals Modus Operandi of Fraudsters Luring Indians Into Cybercrime Rackets in Vientiane With Fake Job Offers (Watch Video).\n\"In terms of critical minerals, the new technologies of the 21st century, all of them depend on critical minerals, and we have to be aware of the fact that these technologies of the 21st century, critical minerals are very, very important. We have to find ways to get bilateral understanding mechanisms to be able to capture that. And just not in the context of bilaterally, but also in terms of partner countries, partnering with many countries to be harnessing critical minerals, both in terms of the processes and acquiring these minerals around the world,\" Ravi said.\nRavi highlighted the mineral wealth of Africa and Latin America, saying, \"Africa is full of those minerals, and we believe that we have to be much more focused on being able to tap that resource in Africa. And I think KABIL and National Mineral Development Corporation they're very much actively looking at opportunities in Africa. In this context, the Prime Minister's visit to both Ghana and Namibia becomes very important. These are areas where we believe there's a lot of opportunity, and we will be looking at it very closely.\"\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Reiterates Vow To Block Iran's Nuclear Ambitions, Claims US Strikes 'Obliterated' Key Sites.\nHe added that defence cooperation, critical minerals, and digital public infrastructure (DPI) will be among the top items on the agenda during the Ghana leg of the tour.\nMeanwhile, Secretary (East) P Kumaran informed that PM Modi will attend the BRICS Summit in Brazil, which will be followed by a state visit.\nEarlier, PM Modi had visited Brazil on three occasions, the first in July 2014, followed by another visit in 2019 to attend the BRICS summit, and in November last year to attend the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro.\nSpeaking about the upcoming state visit, Kumaran, said, \"The state visit will provide an opportunity to review the entire gamut of our partnership, including trade and investments, oil and gas, renewable energy, mining and critical minerals, defense and security, agriculture and livestock, healthcare and traditional medicine, tourism, space, science and technology, DPI, and also sports and people-to-people relations in general. Both leaders will also be discussing during their talks global issues of mutual interest.\"\nHe also stated that India and Brazil are looking at a few important bilateral Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements, especially in renewable energy, agricultural research, and security cooperation.\nAdditionally, Kumaran highlighted that Prime Minister Modi's visit to Argentina will be the first bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister in the last 57 years and described it as 'historic'.\nHe noted that India's advancements in defence manufacturing, the space sector, and emerging areas such as information technology and digital public infrastructure (DPI) can offer valuable expertise to Argentina. \"Our expertise in Telemedicine and Digital healthcare solutions are also an offer for Argentina in expanding access to medical services and improving overall quality and cost-effective healthcare delivery,\" he added.\nKumaran pointed out that Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves and the fourth-largest shale oil reserves, along with substantial conventional oil and gas deposits, making it a potentially important energy partner for India in the future.\n\"Argentina's rich reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, copper and other rare earth elements complement India's growing need for secure and sustainable supplies to these elements for its clean energy transition and industrial growth. India's public sector, KABIL, has already won a few concessions in Argentina since 2024. Our leaders will be discussing more on this subject,\" he said.\n\"The visit is expected to further strengthen the strategic partnership and open new avenues of cooperation.

He said Canada should have put the tax against U.S. tech giants on the back burner so it could have been used as a negotiating tool.\n\n“The timing of this is simply not great,” Geist said. \n\n“You know, had they provided a bit of a deferral … for, say, 30 days … that would have offered up an opportunity for this to be one of the cards you could play in the negotiations.”\n\nHe noted the federal parliamentary budget officer projected the tax would have brought in around $7.2 billion in revenue over five years.\n\n“We’re giving up billions in return … we should be getting something as part of the tariff discussions. What the Canadian government seems to have gotten is a return back to the status quo that existed just a week ago.”\n\n“All they’ve been able to (do) is to get the United States back to the bargaining table. Well, they were at the bargaining table before the government decided, over many warnings, to go ahead and say, ‘we’re going to start collecting this right away,’ and not defer this at least for a month, to open the door to some sort of broader-based agreement.”\n\nHad the tax actually gone into effect, Geist said Canadian consumers would have ended up paying more in the end as tech giants like Amazon, Meta, Airbnb, Uber and Google looked to recoup the losses.\n\n“In fact, Google, which was certainly one of the companies that would be targeted by this, began charging a specific fee to Canadian advertisers, and those advertising in Canada, just last year in anticipation of the new tax. So, it’s clear many of the charges were ultimately going to be borne by Canadian business, and arguably, at the end of the day, by Canadian consumers.”\n\nGeist also said he believes Canada made a mistake by bailing from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s plan to set up a multilateral tax approach designed to replace digital service taxes imposed by individual countries.\n\n“Countries had said they would not, while they were doing these discussions, introduce new measures, and the Canadian government stood virtually alone in saying, ‘No, they didn’t want to see one of these moratoriums,'” he said.\n\n” I think at the end of the day, the government saw the potential revenues and were willing to sacrifice some of the principles around sort of multinational agreements in order to try to get them, and they knew that there was going to be opposition from the United States. \n\n“I think … they thought they could either talk their way through or they could massage the issue with the US. But if we’ve learned anything from especially Donald Trump right now, that approach just doesn’t work.”\n\nCanada needs ‘reset’ on tech policy \n\nWhile Geist said he believes the tech industry needs to be regulated, he thinks Canada needs to re-think its approach.\n\n“I think we need a real reset, and I think a lot more realism when it comes to some of our tech policy. And that’s not to say that tech companies shouldn’t be regulated. They absolutely should, but taking an approach where you stand at the top of the mountain and say, ‘This is what we’re going to do, and we’re not interested in hearing what you have to say,’ and … we’re going to call your bluff. They’re not bluffing. \n\n“Canada, the Canadian market, just isn’t important enough, and the costs of some of these regulatory proposals are so high that they are going to invite a response. You simply can’t expect companies to face potentially billions in additional costs and not have some kind of response.\n\n“The Canadian government, for too long, has almost looked at these tech companies like an ATM where they just want to do withdrawals to help fund their policies,” he concludes. “We’ve got to do a better job of coming up with realistic and effective tech policy.”\n\nFormer ambassador weighs in on digital services tax, environment of trade talks \n\nAmid news that trade talks resumed, CityNews spoke with Frank McKenna — the former Canadian ambassador to the United States and the current deputy chair of TD Bank Group — about the decision to scrap the tax.\n\n“This is actually fairly typical in negotiating with President Trump. He’s very unpredictable. Some might think it’s a negotiating tactic. I think it’s a character flaw, but regardless it’s unpredictable and you have to be prepared to move with (the) music,” he said.\n\n“I think the Government of Canada came to the conclusion that a trillion-dollar trade deal, which would be beneficial to Canadian workers and industry, was so important it shouldn’t be derailed by a [two]-billion-dollar item, which was probably going to get flushed down the toilet during the negotiations anyway.”\n\nMcKenna, who also previously served as a Liberal premier of New Brunswick, said the current environment in Washington is vastly different from when he was ambassador during former U.S. President George W. Bush’s second term. He specifically recalled the decision not to join the war in Iraq and a bitter dispute over softwood lumber.\n\n“President Bush, or even for that matter, President Clinton, were extremely respectful. And President Bush would tell me about Iraq. He said, ‘Look, I understand your country has different views and different political imperatives, and I respect that. \n\n“That’s not what we’re getting now. If anything, I would say the country of the United States as a whole is quite respectful, but at the level of the president, his language tends to be very inflammatory.”\n\nMcKenna said while the digital services tax was an attempt globally to get some fairness from tech giants and several other countries still have the tax, “it had flaws in it” and acknowledged it was an irritant south of the border.\n\n“It’s been a policy that does not have much love anywhere, certainly from the United States technology giants, but also within Canada from the business community and even consumer advocates,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, McKenna urged people to wait for the final results of the negotiation period.\n\n“We have to keep cool and carry on to use that line. Negotiating with the president is an extremely difficult task because there are a lot of issues, personality issues, that are involved in it,” he said.\n\n“I think that Canada is doing a fine job today, but we have to remember the prize is worth the fight. We have almost a trillion dollars in business between our two countries.”\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press","summary":"If politics is like poker, Canada got caught bluffing, with nothing to show for its bold and according to one expert, impetuous, implementation of the digital services tax.

The discussions culminated Sunday night when Carney called Trump to let him know Canada would rescind the tax.\n\nThe tax would have hit large tech companies, including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb, with a three per cent levy on revenue from Canadian users.The first payment — retroactive to 2022 — was due on Monday and could have collectively cost American companies US$2 billion.\n\nCarney said the move would provide businesses with some certainty.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense to collect tax from people and then remit them back,\" he said.\n\nBut the last-minute change caused some confusion among companies that were in the process of paying the tax.\n\nTariq Nasir, a partner at EY Canada’s indirect tax practice, said some companies have given instructions to pay the tax, but the payments were not going through at the Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nCompanies that have made the payments are now wondering how to get that money back and how to account for the payments in their quarterly statements, due in the next month.\n\nBusiness groups on both sides of the border praised the government for moving to eliminate the tax, while critics accused it of capitulating to the U.S.\n\nBloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet said Carney campaigned during the election on finding a way out from under Trump's tariffs, and has compromised on multiple things including defence and counter tariffs, but has nothing to show for it so far.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nInterim NDP Leader Don Davies said the decision to end the digital services tax amounts to \"pure caving in to Trump and his billionaire friends.\"\n\n\"Canada is a sovereign country with the right to make our own tax laws.

It’s all got a little bit embarrassing hasn’t it? Pretty simple question. When are you going to meet the Donald?” Stefanovic said.\n\n“Not at all. Look, we will meet when we meet in coming months, but my priority has been on delivering for Australians,” Mr Albanese said.\n\n“Do you have a date? It sounds a bit open-ended in coming months,” Abo asked.\n\n“Well, it is at this point in time, but we’ll have a meeting. We’ve had a few constructive discussions,” Mr Albanese replied.\n\nSpeaking on Sunrise, Mr Albanese was again grilled over the failure to secure talks with the US President.\n\n“Are you just kicking yourself for [not] getting on that plane to meet Trump earlier?” host Nat Barr asked.\n\n“Are you now looking at this and thinking it was a mistake to leave it this late?”\n\n“Not at all, Nat!” he said.\n\n“I’ve had my priorities right, which the Australian people got to have their say in on May the 3rd, which is why I’m still speaking to today.\n\n“We’re available for a meeting. We would’ve met at the sidelines of the G7, except that the President quite understandably left and left meetings with others as well, left the G7 to go back to Washington because of what was happening with Iran and Israel.”\n\nKevin Rudd’s ‘Village Idiot’ moment\n\nMr Albanese was also grilled over former Prime Minister turned US ambassador Kevin Rudd’s description of the US President as “a village idiot”. \n\nSuggesting there was “no coming back from Mr Rudd’s past comments about the President” Mr Albanese was then asked, “Are you putting your loyalty to Kevin Rudd above our alliance with the US?”\n\n“Well, JD Vance had some pretty strong comments, it’s gotta be said, and he’s now the Vice-President of the United States of America,” Mr Albanese replied.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has been urged to tell the US President to “bugger off” during an agonising line-up of interviews over his failure to secure face-to-face talks.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/bugger-off-pm-urged-to-act-over-donald-trumps-refusal-to-meet/news-story/11f208025366266a37b2ae375e129f35?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1f143daa075f7e7a52fa8f7abab3b505","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:24:45","author":"Samantha Maiden","authors":["Samantha Maiden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.568},{"id":336900652,"title":"World News | Canada Withdraws Digital Services Tax Following Suspension of Trade Talks by Trump","text":"Ontario [Canada], July 1 (ANI): Canada has officially withdrawn its proposed digital services tax, aiming to revive trade negotiations with the US, just days after US President Donald Trump halted discussions in protest of the levy, Al Jazeera reported on Monday.\nAs per Al Jazeera, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Sunday announced that he and President Trump had reached an agreement to restart talks, targeting a July 21, deadline outlined at the recent G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis.\nAlso Read | Laos Job Scam Alert: Cybercrime Centre Reveals Modus Operandi of Fraudsters Luring Indians Into Cybercrime Rackets in Vientiane With Fake Job Offers (Watch Video).\nThe now-scrapped tax, which was set to take effect from Monday, would have imposed a 3 per cent levy on revenues earned by digital services companies from Canadian users above USD 20 million in a calendar year, retroactive to 2022, as per Al Jazeera.\nIt was intended to target online platforms, digital advertising, social media, and data monetisation, impacting major US tech firms such as Apple, Google (Alphabet), Amazon, and Meta.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Reiterates Vow To Block Iran's Nuclear Ambitions, Claims US Strikes 'Obliterated' Key Sites.\nPresident Trump denounced the tax on Friday, calling it \"a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" in defence of American tech giants, as reported by Al Jazeera.\nCriticism followed the Canadian government's decision to withdraw the tax.\nTech analyst and journalist Paris Marx told Al Jazeera that the move signals Canada's vulnerability to US pressure, arguing that digital services taxes are crucial to ensuring large multinational tech firms contribute fairly to the countries in which they operate.\nMarx pointed out that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) efforts to establish a global framework for digital taxation have stalled largely due to US resistance under both the Biden and Trump administrations, leading many countries to adopt their own taxes.\n\"It has been continually delayed for years in the hope that a diplomatic process in the OECD would create an international framework to ensure those companies pay more tax in countries around the world.

Supporters claim this moratorium would stop a patchwork of conflicting state laws from slowing AI’s rocketing development.\n\nBut without subsequent federal action, a moratorium on state regulation risks making the AI industry a law-free zone, where Big Tech companies can essentially do whatever they want with an untested, sometimes exploitative new technology.\n\nWe’ve needed federal regulation on AI companies for some time, but if this new moratorium passes, it will become even more urgent for Congress to act.\n\nIf the AI industry is going to grow sustainably and responsibly, we need legislation to provide guardrails and clear rules about how to protect the creators of content that AI tools use — publishers, authors, journalists, artists, musicians and creatives of all types.\n\nRight now, those content creators are AI’s victims.\n\nBig Tech and AI companies scrape vast amounts of content to build and operate their generative AI products, which turn content into GenAI outputs for users.\n\nSometimes they just reproduce content creators’ passages word for word — without credit or compensation.\n\nAI companies admit these unfair and un-American tactics are fundamental to their businesses, but they refuse to pay because it’s cheaper to steal.\n\nEven worse, this predatory behavior lets AI models act as information gatekeepers.\n\nIf Big Tech is left to its own devices, Americans will have less access to accurate information, and certainly no one to hold accountable for errors and mistakes.\n\nReporting on stories that Americans need to know will dwindle as the AI companies undermine the business models of publishers, opening the door to viewpoint suppression and creating opportunities for foreign propagandists.\n\nHow dire these problems will become is a matter of guesswork — because AI development is currently a black box.\n\nDevelopers do not share information on whether or how they are obtaining consent for using publisher content. (News reports suggest that when they do share information about these methods, it is sometimes misleading.) \n\nPublishers must hire experts to reverse-engineer how their content has been taken, a costly process that overburdens small publishers and can’t always identify all works that were used in training the models. \n\nThis lack of transparency hinders the enforcement of intellectual property rights and distorts regulatory decisions, business development and more. \n\nFederal legislation could address these issues by requiring recordkeeping and full disclosure.\n\nAI companies must let publishers know whether a generative AI model was trained on their work — and must also explain whether certain publications have been specifically excluded from AI models, so that the public can judge any bias.\n\nFurther, AI companies must disclose the sources they use to keep their models’ responses current.\n\nSimple rules such as these will prompt commercial GenAI developers to enter agreements with publishers to use their content — agreements that will likely block AI companies and foreign actors from distorting the news that the public receives.\n\nThe benefits will be widespread. These rules would strengthen America’s position in the AI race by making its products more trustworthy and preserving the journalism that lies at its foundation.\n\nProtecting intellectual property and homegrown content is what gives American AI companies an international competitive edge. Strong federal rules will also keep many small media businesses viable, and protecting thousands of workers and their communities.\n\nThe White House blueprint for AI wisely recognizes that AI development must be responsible and aligned with American values, including respect for intellectual property and the rule of law.\n\nIf Congress is going to act, as it appears it might, to limit the ability of states to enact these important regulations, then it’s up to the House and Senate to fill that gap — and set this growing but potentially dangerous industry on a solid foundation.\n\nDanielle Coffey is president and CEO of the News/Media Alliance, which represents more than 2,200 publishers nationwide.","summary":"We need clear federal rules to protect the creators of content that AI tools use — because right now, those professionals are AI’s victims.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/30/opinion/big-beautiful-ai-rule-means-feds-must-act-now-to-stop-big-techs-abuses/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/senate-side-capitol-seen-washington-107414450-e1751329340593.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:22:32","author":"Danielle Coffey","authors":["Danielle Coffey"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":336898312,"title":"\"PORKY PIG PARTY\": Elon Musk Slams Trump's Bill, Calls For New Political Party","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-slams-donald-trump-spending-bill-calls-for-new-political-party-8804076\" on this server.\nReference #18.91a12417.1751331960.121c9660\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.91a12417.1751331960.121c9660","summary":"Billionaire Elon Musk reiterated his criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump's spending legislation on Monday, arguing that it underscores the need for a new political party.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-slams-donald-trump-spending-bill-calls-for-new-political-party-8804076","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:18:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":336894636,"title":"PM talks up Australia-US ties as Trump pressure grows","text":"Australia is an important partner to the US, the prime minister has insisted, as he faces growing pressure to lock down an in-person meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nSince Anthony Albanese's first planned face-to-face with the US president was up-ended last month by events in the Middle East, the prime minister has spent weeks being grilled over their next possible meeting.\n\nSome have speculated that Mr Trump has yet to meet Mr Albanese because Australia is relatively insignificant, globally, compared to other US trading partners.\n\nBut the prime minister disagrees.\n\n\"Australia always pulls our weight,\" he told Sky News on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're significant players in delivering peace and security in our region, we're also a significant economy, providing goods and services to the world and making a difference.\"\n\n\"I think viewers, watchers and readers of some of the media would think that Australia is this little country that doesn't contribute anything to this relationship - we do,\" he also told Seven's Sunrise program\n\nThe two leaders were expected to meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit in mid-June but Mr Trump left the event the night before their scheduled chat to deal with escalating tensions between Iran and Israel.\n\nHowever, the prime minister wasn't the only world leader to be stood up by the US president.\n\nMexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum was also due to meet Mr Trump for the first time that same day, while scheduled talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were also put on ice.\n\nMr Albanese said he understood the president's decision to leave, which eventually led to a fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel, and noted there would be plenty more opportunities to meet as the global summit season looms.\n\nThe G20 leaders meeting in November, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in June and the Quad meeting - which will occur some time this year - all offer a second chance for the two to get together.

Ron DeSantis, escaping the insane blue-state policies that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to a head.\n\nThe newcomers — myself included — made the state redder than it had ever been before. \n\nIn the 2024 election, President Donald Trump romped in the formerly deep-blue Miami Dade County and turned Palm Beach County purple, losing it by just a single percentage point.\n\nPundits pointed to the increasingly Republican Hispanic vote, and that was a factor. But the energized newbies made the shift a GOP tsunami.\n\nTo this day many Floridians habitually send real-estate listings to their ideologically aligned friends up north — those who longed to join the “Great Migration” but whose work or family obligations made them stay put.\n\nWhen those friends complained about their deteriorating schools, the congestion tax or rising crime, we’d send back an alligator gif, a Florida flag emoji or a video of tough-talking DeSantis describing the fate of protesters who dare to block Florida traffic.\n\nCome join us, we’d say.\n\nNow a different group is looking in our direction — and we’re not feeling so encouraging.\n\nThese people didn’t think the COVID restrictions that kept NYC children in masks outdoors through 2022 were too much.\n\nThey were fine with cashless bail and New York’s sanctuary city status.\n\nBoys in girls’ sports? Who cares! They vote blue, no matter who.\n\nBut even these Democrats find Mamdani to be a bridge too far.\n\nThey were OK with the city’s leftward drift and the accompanying chaos — yet they know Mamdani’s agenda of government-owned grocery stores, higher taxes on “whiter” neighborhoods, destroying screened schools, disdain for Jews and more will degrade the city to a place they can’t abide.\n\nBut Florida is not the place for them.\n\nThis new Florida-curious group, we fear, still thinks Democrats’ policies work, and that it’s just a funny coincidence that in so many major blue cities those policies have led to disarray. \n\nReal liberalism has never been tried, you see.\n\nFloridians, old and new, understand this is not so.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned” about Mamdani flight, a man who moved here from Connecticut told me. “His socialist policies — like rent freezes and free everything — are exactly the kind of insanity I left behind.”\n\n“If they move here, they better keep their blue votes at home,” his wife added, “and learn to appreciate the true reasons why Florida is so amazing.”\n\nA lifelong Floridian living on its west coast told me he worries about blue-state newcomers who arrive “not simply to build a better life, but often bringing with them political agendas that risk altering the character of our communities.”\n\n“Bring your money, leave your liberal views,” as a long-time Floridian in Boca Raton put it.\n\nFlorida has been at the top of the net migration list for years, a point of statewide pride. This spring the Citizens Budget Commission reported that at least 125,000 New Yorkers fled for Florida since 2018 — taking nearly $14 billion of income with them.\n\nBut money isn’t everything.\n\nOr, as Florida state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia warned “all of my Republican friends” on X, “Georgia ‘welcomed’ people with tax credits for the liberal film industry. Now they’re a swing state” — one that was once solidly red.\n\n“It’s not about an influx of money. It’s about an influx of ideology,” Ingoglia added. “IF you come, please leave your leftist ideas behind.”\n\nOne Floridian man suggests handing out “Don’t New York My Florida” t-shirts at the Fort Lauderdale airport — but I say that’s too late.\n\nLet’s distribute them at JFK or LaGuardia and require our wannabe neighbors to wear them on the trip.\n\nFloridians have built something great here, and we want to keep it that way.\n\n“Kind of left” is too far left for us, and a “moderate Democrat” is, too.\n\nUnderstand that Mayor Eric Adams might be New York City’s voice of civic moderation — but his stances would never fly here.\n\nSo stay and fight, all you New York Democrats dismayed at your party’s leftward swerve. Take your city back!\n\nDon’t come to Florida and try to “moderate” us.

Friday's celebration will also feature a flyover by B-2 Spirit bombers, the same jets that struck Iran's uranium enrichment sites at Fordo and Natanz in Operation Midnight Hammer.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to celebrating our nation's founding on Friday in the nation's capital. To join in the celebration, the might of America's Air Force will conduct a flyover featuring our state-of-the-art F-22s, B-2s and F-35s -- the same air capabilities used for the decisive and successful strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities,\" Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nPresident Trump is scheduled to speak at the event. Additional personnel from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where the bombers are based, are also expected to attend.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump told Fox News that plans were in the works to honor the pilots.\n\n\"Yes, they're going to come to the White House,\" Trump said. \"These people flew 36 hours in a small space, a big plane, but a small space mostly occupied by bombs, and they flew so brilliantly.\"\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, the 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs and long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles \"completely and fully obliterated\" Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe Pentagon said seven B-2 bombers dropped 14 bunker-buster bombs, while other B-2's flew over the Pacific as decoys. The bombers refueled multiple times while in flight.\n\nU.S. officials have pushed back on a leaked preliminary report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency that said the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear development by a few months.\n\nIran has acknowledged that the nuclear sites sustained \"serious and significant damage\" from the strikes.","summary":"The U.S. pilots of the B-2 bombers, that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities this month, will be honored by President Donald Trump at the White House on the Fourth of July.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/06/30/b-2-bomber-pilots-white-house-fourth-july/9261751327510/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/9261751327510/2025/1/b7097aad1915ea78d081789500ec421f/v1.5/B-2-bomber-pilots-to-be-honored-at-White-House-Fourth-of-July-celebration.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:13:14","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":336894270,"title":"The truth about what happens to Britain's stolen cars: Map reveals smuggling routes used by gangs to sneak motors out of the UK - and where they finally end up","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jul 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBryan Kohberger accepts plea deal in Idaho murders case after prosecution drops death penalty\n\nWoman killed in Spain jet ski accident named as wife of football club chairman\n\nMajor blow for savers as Reeves is set to slash tax-free Isa allowance\n\nROBERT JOBSON: A senior courtier told me what Harry and Meghan did to the heartbroken Queen.

Email rory.tingle@mailonline.co.uk \nBy RORY TINGLE, HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:13 BST, 1 July 2025 |Updated:01:13 BST, 1 July 2025 \n\nGangs are stealing luxury cars from British driveways before whisking them abroad within hours for sale in the Middle East and Africa - as this new graphic reveals. \nOther expensive vehicles, including Range Rovers and Rolls-Royces, are shipped to Eastern Europe and then smuggled into Russia for use by sanctions-dodging Kremlin elites. \nThe highly sophisticated nature of the criminal gangs fuelling Britain's £1.77billion-a-year car theft epidemic is shown by their use of £20,000 high-tech devices to trick keyless entry systems. \nStolen cars are then rapidly driven to Dover and loaded onto ferries before victims, lenders or the police can react.\nOne police investigator said a car could be shipped abroad with cloned number plates before the owner had even been able to report it stolen. \nA new report contrasts the professionalism of gangs overseeing this 'comprehensive logistical process' with the lax police response - which has seen charging rates drop to just 2.6 per cent in 2023/2024. \nStolen cars are often broken into parts that end up in second-hand dealerships or scrapyards in Cyprus, the UAE and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where they are sold into other Middle Eastern and North African countries.\nThe illegal trade has driven an 82 per cent increase in car insurance premium quotes since 2021, according to the report, Organised Vehicle Theft in the UK: Trends and Challenges, by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nA Range Rover stolen by the gang that was seized by police before being shipped abroad \n\nThis gang, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, were linked to almost 100 stolen cars, which were stolen and shipped off to the Middle East, or broken down for parts. Top row, left to right: Asif Matadar, Shewaz Rehman, Imran Taj. Bottom row: Zeeshan Ali, Adam Elwood and Mohammed Irfan\nAbout 130,000 vehicles are stolen each year in the UK - many from driveways or on streets outside homes. \nOne gang operating in Oldham, Greater Manchester were jailed last year after being linked to nearly 100 stolen cars. \nThe group arranged for prestige cars including Range Rovers, Mercedes, Porsche and BMWs to be stolen to order before being shipped off to the Middle East, or broken down for parts. \nRingleader Asif Hussain was jailed for 15 years after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to handle stolen goods, conspiracy to export, and fraud.\nThe RUSI report says organised crime groups have 'shopping lists' of makes and models, indicating many are stolen to order. \nWhile manufacturers have made it harder to hack into keyless entry systems, criminals are beating them in a tech 'arms race' by using specialised devices costing as much as £20,000.\nThese typically work by ‘relaying’ or amplifying the signal of the victim’s key fob, often located inside their home, to trick vehicles into believing the fob is nearby.\nSellers in Bulgaria and Poland advertise devices designed for specific high-end models including Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lamborghini, Lexus and Porsche.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nTwo thieves recently showed a documentary crew how they could steal a keyless car in less than 20 seconds for a £5,000 fee\n\nThief 'T' and an accomplice demonstrated how they use an amplifier, which looks similar to a radio or walkie-talkie, to pick up the signal from the 'key' inside a home\nAs the report explains: ‘Vehicle theft is no longer a low-level, opportunistic crime, but rather a high-value, low-risk form of serious and organised crime with domestic and international dimensions. \n‘The criminal vehicle theft economy is far more resilient than the public and private systems meant to stop it.’\nThe illicit trade was described as a response to a shortage of car parts across much of the Middle East and Africa. \nMeanwhile, demand from Georgia and Azerbaijan could be an 'unintended consequence of sanctions' levied on Russia. \n'Examples have emerged of vehicles vanishing from UK streets and reappearing in Moscow,' the report states. \n'Vehicle theft in the UK represents a perfect storm of increasing domestic and international demand, compounded and exploited by innovative and organised criminals.'\nDespite the massive surge in car thefts, police forces have been 'collapsing' teams dedicated to tackling it. \nThe Met Police once had nearly 100 vehicle crime investigators, but this has now dwindled to only a 'handful'.\nThe RUSI report calls for a national body to be created to investigate car thefts and recover vehicles from overseas, as well as tightened security at ports. \n\nCriminals usually go in pairs to steal keyless cars. One holds a transmitter and stands next to the vehicle while the other stands close to the house holding an amplifier\n\nLast year, Essex Police found more than £14m worth of 'chopped' luxury cars as they were due to be shipped out of the country\n\nA Range rover recovered by Essex's Stolen Vehicle Intelligence Unit (SVIU)\nWhile many stolen cars are rapidly shipped out of the UK, others are left to ‘cool off’ before export to check if they are fitted with trackers. \nOne industrial estate in Essex was recently exposed as a storage facility for an international car smuggling ring exporting cars to Lithuania. \nA stolen Audi fitted with a GPS device was tracked to Baldwins Farm after being stolen from a driveway in North London. \nFive weeks later, it reappeared in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, where the vehicle had already been broken down into parts. \nDuring a recent Dispatches documentary, a reporter spoke to two thieves who showed how they could steal a keyless car in less than 20 seconds for a £5,000 fee.\nThief 'T' and an accomplice demonstrated how they use an amplifier, which looks similar to a radio or walkie-talkie, to pick up the signal from the 'key' inside a home and use it to unlock a car parked outside.\nThe two men, dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, demonstrated the technique on a car they claimed to have already stolen after placing the key fob in the living room of a property. \n\nGreater London experienced the most car theft in total in 2023, with 18,624 recorded thefts from 2,451,620 cars on the road - 0.76 per cent are stolen\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nEXCLUSIVE The murky past of family-run Essex farm now linked to international car smuggling ring \nAfter just a few seconds of holding the amplifier outside the window, the car door unlocked, allowing T to simply open the door and start up the engine. \nOnce the engine had started, the accomplice could take the amplifier, jump in the car and they drove off - with the entire theft taking less than 20 seconds.\nThe men then boasted of taking up to 20 vehicles a month for as much as £5,000 per car, depending on its value, and said up to 90 percent of them are stolen for parts.\nAsked whether they ever feel bad about their actions T said: 'These cars are insured, that's like, that's a first world problem. There's bigger s*** going on out there, that's, like... Your f***ing Range Rover's gone, boo-hoo, go and buy another one, man.'\nHe added: 'A lot of these cars are getting broken for parts. A lot of them are getting shipped out, Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece.' \nAdam Gibson, an agent at the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NaVCIS) - which is funded by the car industry - said the value of vehicles stolen seems to be dropping while the volume is increasing.\n'Whereas we were finding Range Rover's worth £150,000, we're getting pickup trucks and SUVs worth £40,000 now,' he said. \n'We are seeing brands like Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Lexus. So the quality has dropped off, I suppose, but the volume has gone up.\n\nBaldwins Farm, an industrial estate in Essex, was recently exposed as a storage facility for an international car smuggling ring exporting cars to Lithuania \n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is the second most common destination for stolen UK cars (20.1%), followed some way behind by Cyprus (6.7%). Jamaica (5.7%) and Georgia (5.1%) were the fourth and fifth most common export countries respectively\n'Some gangs will literally gut the car of any personal effects. Others will just leave everything.\n'There's kids seats, toys, all sorts of them… I'm constantly told by people that vehicle crime, where it's victimless, it's just the insurance companies.\n'Yes, the insurance company pay out, but we all get our premiums go up because the insurance aren't going to absorb it. So it has a knock-on effect on everyone else.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe truth about what happens to Britain's stolen cars: Map reveals smuggling routes used by gangs to sneak motors out of the UK - and where they finally end up\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Journalists and special guests previewed the renovated museum in Rio de Janeiro, where they could also see a large part of its 20-million-artifact collection.

Brazil's Education Minister Camilo Santana told journalists the museum's complete renovation is slated for completion by the end of 2027. He added that the reconstruction budget of almost USD 95 million is being split between public and private companies. The building was once a royal palace that served as the seat of the united Portuguese and Brazilian empire before the museum's collection was transferred there in 1892.

Visitors will be welcomed at the main entrance by a symbol of the institution's resilience: the Bendego meteorite, which weighs 5.6 tonnes and was found 241 years ago in the countryside of the state of Bahia. Brazil's Federal Police ruled out criminal offense in the 2018 fire, stating that the blaze in the former palace likely started with an air conditioning unit inside an auditorium near the front entrance. Arson was ruled out. Some artifacts have been recovered, notably most fragments of a skull belonging to a woman dubbed Luzia. It is one of the oldest human fossils ever found in the Americas, and was a top museum treasure. Recovery efforts were suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Its slogan reads, “See something, tap something.”\n\nICE acting Director Todd M. Lyons called the app dangerous.\n\n“Advertising an app that basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers’ backs is sickening,” he said in a statement. “My officers and agents are already facing a 500% increase in assaults.”\n\nDeveloper Joshua Aaron described ICEBlock as a grassroots initiative to keep communities informed about ICE activity.\n\n“When I saw what was going on in this country, I just really felt like I had to do something,” he said in an interview with Time, referring to immigration enforcement raids following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. “The app is to inform, not obstruct.

Josh Carpenter of Sports Business Journal reported that the PIF-sponsored league held meetings in Dallas last week. Following the meeting, a tentative schedule was decided, which is most likely to remain the final schedule, sources claimed.The source stated that while the locations were confirmed, only the dates could be subject to potential change. While the LIV Golf 2025 season teed off with four straight overseas events, next year, the league will not come to the U.S. until the seventh event.The LIV Golf 2026 season is likely to start on February 5 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It will then head to Adelaide, Australia, the following week. After a couple of weeks off, the league will travel to Hong Kong, followed by Singapore, and the latest addition, South Africa, for the three March events.The PIF-sponsored circuit has hosted the Donald Trump-owned Doral Golf Course every year, but the tentative schedule has the Miami-based course missing in 2026. Besides, LIV is also not hosting any event the week before the Masters Tournament. Instead, they have opted to host the Mexico event the week after the first major of the season.LIV's first U.S. event of the season will be played in May in Washington, D.C., or Virginia. This event will be held just a week before the PGA Championship.The other three overseas events in LIV's schedule are South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

There’s dignity in giving you a job, so you can provide for your family and the opportunities that you deserve. This is not a city of handouts. This is a city of hands up.”\n\nEarly this month, 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, called out remarks Mamdani made during a June 11 episode of “The Breakfast Club” podcast. \n\nDuring the conversation, Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assembly member from Queens who was born and raised in Uganda, discussed raising corporate taxes to pay for his idea to “Trump-proof” New York City.\n\n“We’re talking about corporations that are making millions of dollars, not in revenue, but in profit,” Mamdani said. “And the second is taxing the top 1% of New Yorkers. We’re talking about people who make a million dollars a year or more, taxing them just by a flat 2% tax increase.” \n\nMamdani also mentioned 50 Cent by name, saying, “I know if 50 Cent is listening, he’s not going to be happy about this. He tends to not like this tax policy, but I want to be very clear this is about $20,000 a year. It’s a rounding error. And all of these things together, they make every New Yorker’s life better, including those who are actually getting taxed now.”\n\n50 Cent, who endorsed President Donald Trump in 2020, criticized Mamdani’s remarks. \n\n“Where did he come from? Whose friend is this? I’m not feeling this plan,” 50 Cent said in what appears to be a since-deleted post. “No. I will give him $258,750 and a first class one-way ticket away from NY. I’m telling Trump what he said too!” the rapper wrote.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to both 50 Cent and Mamdani for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.","summary":"New York City Mayor Eric Adams is agreeing with rapper and actor 50 Cent that New York City Democratic socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s economic proposals should be in \"Fantasyland.\" ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/30/us-news/eric-adams-backs-50-cent-says-mamdani-deserves-a-one-way-ticket-to-fantasyland/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/eric-adams-backs-50-cent-107435410.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:10:34","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":336891394,"title":"Todd Chrisley compares his first shower after prison to his ‘first sexual encounter’","text":"It’s all about the little things.\n\nTodd Chrisley, 56, continues to open up about his recent release from federal prison after more than two years behind bars, and there are some things that he missed more than others.\n\nDuring the ABC News special “The Chrisleys: Life After Lockup” on Sunday, June 29, the reality star joked about taking his first shower after finally returning home from Florida’s FPC Pensacola.\n\n“It was almost like your first sexual encounter,” Todd told host Juju Chang.\n\nHe also revealed that his first meal after returning home to Nashville was from Pizza Hut, while Todd’s wife, Julie Chrisley, 52, chose a meal from the popular fast-food joint Zaxby’s.\n\nBoth Todd and Julie Chrisley were freed from federal prison in May following pardons from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe “Chrisley Knows Best” stars were found guilty of federal tax evasion and fraud in June 2022 following a three-week trial. They were sentenced that November, and their respective sentences began in January 2023.\n\nBut following President Trump’s pardons, Todd was released from FPC Pensacola on May 28 after serving just over two years of his 12-year sentence. \n\nJulie, who was sentenced to seven years at Kentucky’s FMC Lexington federal prison, was also freed on May 28.\n\nBoth reality stars opened up about their first nights in prison, and what they missed the most, during their sitdown with ABC.\n\n“Todd, take us behind bars with you,” Chang asked the Chrisley family patriarch. “What was that first night like?”\n\n“I was angry at God,” Todd responded. “And when I went to bed that night and the lights went out, I cried myself to sleep and I said, ‘God, why are you allowing this?’”\n\n“You don’t realize the things that you took for granted until you don’t have it,” he continued. “So your freedom, your ability to go to church, your ability to go out to eat, you know, to stay in your bed all day, those things are taken from you, so when you have them back, it’s a blessing.”\n\n“You don’t realize how much your freedom means to you until you don’t have it,” Todd added. “If it didn’t change you, then you’re not human.”\n\nAs for Julie, she said that she missed her family the most during the 28 months that she was locked up in FMC Lexington.\n\nThe pair has sons Chase, 29, and Grayson, 19, as well as daughter Savannah, 27. Todd also shares daughter Lindsie, 35, and son Kyle, 33, with his ex-wife Teresa Terry. Plus, Todd and Julie adopted their granddaughter Chloe, 12, from Kyle in 2016.\n\n“My children and my husband, you know, I missed birthdays and holidays and graduations and things that I can never get back,” she told the ABC News host. “So now I just have to focus on what’s ahead of us.”\n\nNow that they are free from prison and back home, the Chrisley couple reportedly has big plans on the horizon.\n\nBesides launching a new Lifetime reality show following the entire Chrisley clan, Todd also revealed that he and Julie hope to move to South Carolina to open a hotel and “create a show around” it.\n\n“You know, I think we will always have a presence in Nashville, but I have a pull for Julie and I to go back to South Carolina — to Charleston — to that area,” he said during the ABC News special. “And we have plans for what we wanna do.”\n\n“We have hopes of acquiring a hotel – a mansion – there, that we are gonna convert into a hotel, and we’re gonna create a show around that,” Todd added.","summary":"Todd also revealed that his first meal after returning home to Nashville was from Pizza Hut.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/30/entertainment/todd-chrisley-compares-first-shower-after-prison-to-first-sexual-encounter/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/107432781.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7F9YCmFe-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-01 00:06:41","author":"Connor Surmonte","authors":["Connor Surmonte"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":336893258,"title":"World News | Terrorism Anywhere is Threat to Peace Everywhere, Says EAM at Inauguration of 'The Human Cost of Terrorism' Exhibition","text":"New York [US], July 1 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday inaugurated an exhibition at the United Nations on 'The Human Cost of Terrorism,' highlighting the need to expose state sponsorship of terrorism.
