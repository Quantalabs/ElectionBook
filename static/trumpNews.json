Trump had made a determination, and spent time with his trade and tariff team Tuesday “perfecting it,” according to Leavitt.\"They're not going to be wrong. It is going to work. And the president has a brilliant team of advisers who have been studying these issues for decades. And we are focused on restoring the golden age of America and making America manufacturing superpower,” Leavitt said.RELATED STORY | Farmers prepare for potential fallout from Trump's Wednesday tariffsTrump’s trade policy has sought to address what the administration views as unfair trade with other nations, boost manufacturing and raise revenue.Senior officials are in alignment on why Trump wants to pursue tariffs, though decisions were still being made at last check, according to a source familiar with the administration’s thinking. Several considerations have been on the table, including reciprocal rates by country and a 20 percent universal rate, according to another source familiar with the administration’s thinking.Starting in the early days of his second term in office, Trump had been presented different options his trade team had put together, and weighing them closely, an official noted at that time. More recently, Trump has indicated potential for leniency.“The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades. They ripped us off like no country has ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us. But it's substantial money for the country nevertheless,” Trump said Sunday.\"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about, yeah. We'd be talking about all countries that — not a cut off. And if you look at the history and you look at what's happened,” Trump added.The administration has held conversations with other countries. While Leavitt noted Trump is open to calls, she also said, “there's one country the President cares most about, and it's the United States of America.”Over the weekend Trump indicated deals are possible but would happen later.\"They want to make deals. It's possible if we can get something for the deal. But, you know, we've been taken advantage of for 40 years, maybe more, and it's just not going to happen any more. But yeah, I'm certainly open to that. If we can do something where we get something for it,” Trump said last Friday.The administration though has been presented with concerns about the ability for a country specific reciprocal policy to achieve the administration’s tax goals, though, according to a source familiar with the administration’s thinking.Other countries, however, have indicated they are preparing for retaliatory responses or reserve the right to respond, including Canada, Mexico, the UK, the EU, China and Japan.“These tariffs he’s proposing are enormous so we should expect the retaliation to be enormous,” said Brendan Duke, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and formerly on the National Economic Council under the Biden Administration.In addition to reciprocal tariffs, auto tariffs are also expected to take effect Tuesday. Steel and aluminum tariffs took effect last month. Trump has indicated he’d like to pursue tariffs on pharmaceuticals and lumber. It’s unclear if pauses in fentanyl related tariffs against Canada and Mexico would be extended. At last check over the weekend, no final decisions had been made on additional sectoral tariffs or fentanyl related tariffs, according to an administration official.It’s uncharted territory, according to one Washington trade expert, who expects the tariffs to be more broad and comprehensive than was believed just several days ago.Some are concerned about the impact on consumers. Duke believes the tariffs will place a larger burden of the share on low and middle income families.“I think fundamentally families are going to face higher costs. Businesses have made clear they plan on raising prices in reaction to these enormous tariffs he’s talking about,” said Duke.“The Biden Administration faced a lot of political heat because of rising prices and this is just pouring gasoline on that fire of too high a prices,” he added.RELATED STORY | What to expect as new tariffs take effect this weekDespite swings in the stock market and concerns from some economists the tariffs will amount to a tax on consumers, the White House has maintained that the market is a “snapshot in time.” When pressed on concerns on Wall Street and Main Street, the White House said the president takes them seriously.\"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did,” Leavitt said.“The disconnect is because in the first Trump administration, there were tariffs imposed on China in a more limited way, as well as steel and aluminum tariffs. And there is some evidence that if you impose sector specific or more targeted tariffs, you can do that without necessarily under cutting the financial markets and the economy. But for something broader based, it's very unclear,” said Brightbill.The economic impact isn’t known until more is known about how broad the tariffs are, according to Tim Brightbill, co-chair of Wiley Rein’s International Trade Practice, who underscored the importance of certainty in the announcement.“So many of our clients and businesses just want to know what's coming. They're trying to prepare, but it's hard to prepare when you don't know the size and scope of the tariffs that are going to be announced,” he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump is set to make a major tariff announcement on what the White House has dubbed ‘Liberation Day’ Wednesday, though many questions remain about the details.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/new-tariffs-are-just-hours-away-questions-remain-over-whats-in-store-for-trumps-liberation-day","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/999816d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F37%2F5cfba0df400799e3f9e2fa221d06%2Fap25051018922359.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:56:58","author":"Haley Bull","authors":["Haley Bull"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.236},{"id":306660494,"title":"Donald Trump’s tariff gambit will raise the stakes for an economy already looking fragile","text":"President Donald Trump is set Wednesday to begin the biggest gamble of his nascent second term, wagering that broad-based tariffs on imports will jump-start a new era for the US economy.\n\nThe stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nAs the president prepares his “liberation day” announcement, household sentiment is at multi-year lows. Consumers worry that the duties will spark another round of painful inflation, and investors are fretting that higher prices will mean lower profits and a tougher slog for the battered stock market.\n\nWhat Mr Trump is promising is a new economy not dependent on deficit spending, where Canada, Mexico, China and Europe no longer take advantage of the US consumer’s desire for ever-cheaper products.\n\nThe big problem right now is no one outside the administration knows quite how those goals will be achieved, and what will be the price to pay.\n\n“People always want everything to be done immediately and have to know exactly what’s going on,” said Joseph LaVorgna, who served as a senior economic advisor during Mr Trump’s first term in office. “Negotiations themselves don’t work that way. Good things take time.”\n\nFor his part, LaVorgna, who is now chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, is optimistic Mr Trump can pull it off, but understands why markets are rattled by the uncertainty of it all.\n\n“This is a negotiation, and it needs to be judged in the fullness of time,” he said. “Eventually we’re going to get some details and some clarity, and to me, everything will fit together. But right now, we’re at that point where it’s just too soon to know exactly what the implementation is likely to look like.”\n\nHere’s what we do know: The White House intends to implement “reciprocal” tariffs against its trading partners. In other words, the US is going to match what other countries charge to import American goods into their countries. Most recently, a figure of 20 per cent blanket tariffs has been bandied around, though LaVorgna said he expects the number to be around 10 per cent, but something like 60 per cent for China.\n\nWhat is likely to emerge, though, will be far more nuanced as Trump seeks to reduce a record $USD131.4 billion trade deficit.\n\nMr Trump professes his ability to make deals, and the sabre-rattling of draconian levies on other countries is all part of the strategy to get the best arrangement possible where more goods are manufactured domestically, boosting American jobs and providing a fairer landscape for trade.\n\nThe consequences, though, could be rough in the near term.\n\nPotential inflation impact\n\nOn their surface, tariffs are a tax on imports and, theoretically, are inflationary. In practice, though, it doesn’t always work that way.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr Trump imposed heavy tariffs with nary a sign of longer-term inflation outside of isolated price increases. That’s how Federal Reserve economists generally view tariffs, a one-time “transitory” blip but rarely a generator of fundamental inflation.\n\nThis time, though, could be different as Mr Trump attempts something on a scale not seen since the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1930 that kicked off a global trade war and would be the worst-case scenario of the president’s ambitions.\n\n“This could be a major rewiring of the domestic economy and of the global economy, a la Thatcher, a la Reagan, where you get a more enabled private sector, streamlined government, a fair trading system,” Mohamed El-Erian, the Allianz chief economic advisor, said Tuesday on CNBC. “Alternatively, if we get tit-for-tat tariffs, we slip into stagflation, and that stagflation becomes well anchored, and that becomes problematic.”\n\nTariffs could rewire domestic and global economy\n\nThe US economy already is showing signs of a stagflationary impulse, perhaps not along the lines of the 1970s and early ’80s but nevertheless one where growth is slowing and inflation is proving stickier than expected.\n\nGoldman Sachs has lowered its projection for economic growth this year to barely positive. The firm is citing the “the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence” and second-order impacts of tariffs as administration officials are willing to trade lower growth in the near term for their longer-term trade goals.\n\nFederal Reserve officials last month indicated an expectation of 1.7 per cent gross domestic product growth this year; using the same metric, Goldman projects GDP to rise at just a 1 per cent rate.\n\nIn addition, Goldman raised its recession risk to 35 per cent this year, though it sees growth holding positive in the most-likely scenario.\n\nBroader economic questions\n\nHowever, Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, thinks the recession risk is even higher at 40 per cent, and not just because of tariff impacts.\n\n“We were already on the pessimistic side of the spectrum,” he said. “A lot of that is coming from the fact that we didn’t think the consumer was strong enough heading into the year, and we see growth slowing because of the tariffs.”\n\nMr Tilley also sees the labour market weakening as companies hold off on hiring as well as other decisions such as capital expenditure-type investments in their businesses.\n\nThat view on business hesitation was backed up Tuesday in an Institute for Supply Management survey in which respondents cited the uncertain climate as an obstacle to growth.\n\n“Customers are pausing on new orders as a result of uncertainty regarding tariffs,” said a manager in the transportation equipment industry. “There is no clear direction from the administration on how they will be implemented, so it’s harder to project how they will affect business.”\n\nWhile Mr Tilley thinks the concern over tariffs causing long-term inflation is misplaced. Smoot-Hawley, for instance, actually ended up being deflationary, he does see them as a danger to an already-fragile consumer and economy as they could tend to weaken activity further.\n\n“We think of the tariffs as just being such a weight on growth. It would drive up prices in the initial couple (inflation) readings, but it would create so much economic weakness that they would end up being net deflationary,” he said. “They’re a tax hike, they’re contractionary, they’re going to weigh on the economy.”","summary":"US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs aim to reshape trade but are instead sparking fears of inflation and economic slowdown.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/world-politics/donald-trumps-tariff-gambit-will-raise-the-stakes-for-an-economy-already-looking-fragile--c-18237067","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18237067/717e5a4b8ac7f82aa88f2c3dce9a88b72cd54631-16x9-x0y75w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:52:57","author":"Jeff Cox,Jeff Coxcnbcwed","authors":["Jeff Cox","Jeff Coxcnbcwed"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.057},{"id":306660986,"title":"Epic 25-hour anti-Donald Trump speech declares 'not normal times' rallying cry","text":"In a jaw-dropping display of endurance and political defiance, New Jersey’s own Sen. Cory Booker shattered records by holding the US Senate floor for more than 25 hours. He did this to launch a powerful, all-night protest against President Donald Trump’s controversial policies and what he sees as the U.S. Congress's lack of action . He didn’t leave for bathroom breaks, didn’t stop for food and didn’t give up until 8:05 p.mm, 25 hours and 5 minutes after he began, and was met with an explosion of applause as he gave up the floor. His heroic filibuster has now officially broken the long-standing record set by notorious segregationist Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes back in 1957. Booker, a former American football player, promised to stay on the floor \"as long as physically able.\" Sen. Chuck Schumer proudly announced to Booker that he had surpassed the record just before 7:30 p.m. EST. Schumer said: \"I just want to tell you, do you know you have just broken the record, do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you.\" Fellow Democrats on the Senate floor gave Booker a standing ovation after he broke the record. Starting at 7 p.m. EST on Monday, Booker continued speaking until he officially beat Thurman's record at 7:19 p.m. EST on Tuesday. Booker said: \"These are not normal times in our nation. And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.\" Senator Chris Murphy said: \"What you have done here today Sen. Booker couldn't be more different than what occurred on this floor in 1957. Strom Thurman was standing in the way of inevitable progress towards equal political and economic rights for Black Americans.\" In a passionate display, Booker spent hours decrying the cuts to Social Security offices spearheaded by Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. He detailed the repercussions of Trump's initial directives and voiced concerns over potential wider reductions to the social safety net, despite Republican assurances that the program would remain intact. As Senator Cory Booker delivered his marathon speech, he seemed to be fuelled by nothing more than a couple of glasses of water. Yet, as the hours passed, his voice resonated with increasing passion, captivating the Senate into the afternoon. Booker himself urged his fellow Democrats to dig deep into their core principles to muster the strength needed to stand up to the Republican president. \"Moments like this require us to be more creative or more imaginative, or just more persistent and dogged and determined,\" Booker implored.

Listen here\n\nBy MARK NICOL DIPLOMACY EDITOR\n\nPublished: 01:40 BST, 2 April 2025 | Updated: 01:41 BST, 2 April 2025\n\nA threatened Iranian attack on British military facilities in the Chagos Islands would trigger a regional conflict, experts say.\n\nIn recent days, Iranian forces have called for a pre-emptive strike on the Diego Garcia UK-US Pacific security outpost to deter any American attack on its mainland.\n\nAccording to the country's security officials, they have been ordered to plan for such an attack in a bid to keep fiery US President Donald Trump at bay.\n\nTehran appears to have been unsettled by the recent arrival at Diego Garcia of at least three US B-2 Spirit aircraft, known as Stealth Bombers. Satellite images have shown the nuclear bombers parked on the airstrip in a frightening display of US military power.\n\nIranian state-controlled media outlets have reported the appearance of the B-2s as proof the US intends to strike the country's nuclear facilities.\n\nBritain has maintained a military presence on the island since the Second World War.\n\nThe future of the airstrip and other security facilities are currently the subject of controversial negotiations between the UK and Mauritius which wants to take back sovereignty of the islands.\n\nToday, former UK military intelligence commander Philip Ingram said any Iranian attack on Diego Garcia would spark a Middle East war – but that they are probably bluffing.\n\nIf Iran did strike, Israel would likely join the US is launching counter attacks on mainland Iran intended to destroy military facilities.\n\nSatellite images show three B-2 Spirit aircrafts (circled) on the Diego Garcia UK-US security outpost \n\nMr Ingram said: 'Iran has the capability on paper to strike Diego Garcia. They know the US would respond by destroying the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [also known as the Iranian Revolutionary Guards] across Iran.\n\n'I think Iran is using rhetoric to threaten the Chagos Islands. They will have observed the debate in the UK and elsewhere about the islands' future.\n\n'Fortunately, it is merely words on Tehran's part and intended to signal strength to their regional allies.'\n\nMr Trump has threatened to attack Iran should it fail to strike a deal over its nuclear programme. He has written to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, setting out the US's position.\n\nThe US President has predicted 'bombing, the likes of which we have never seen before', should Iran fail to comply. \n\nIran, meanwhile, complained to the United Nations Security Council on Monday about Mr Trump's 'reckless and belligerent' remarks.\n\nIran's long-range Khorramshahr missile and the Shahed-136B kamikaze drone could reach the Chagos Islands from southern Iran, a journey of around 2,400 miles.\n\nThe Diego Garcia naval and air base, home to 4,000 service personnel and civilians, is also lightly defended. \n\nIt plays a crucial role in the UK's nuclear weapons chain, due to the targeting and positioning technologies based there.\n\nIran's long-range Khorramshahr missile and the Shahed-136B kamikaze drone could reach the Chagos Islands from southern Iran\n\nDiego Garcia is the largest of the Chagos Islands and home to a UK-US military base \n\nLast October, the UK announced it would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius but would maintain a 99-year lease over the military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. \n\nHowever when a new Mauritian prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam, was elected shortly afterwards, he wanted to renegotiate the terms. It is believed Mauritius has demanded the UK double its payment to £18billion in order to lease back the military base when it acquires sovereignty over the islands.\n\nMr Ramgoolam also expects the payment to be inflation-linked and frontloaded – meaning the UK would have to pay in full immediately.\n\nDonald Trump has approved Chagos Islands 'surrender' deal, says No1)\n\nDespite Foreign Office assurances that the UK will only sign a deal that is 'in our national interest', UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has come under attack over Britain's position in negotiations.\n\nYesterday it emerged US President Donald Trump had signed off on the UK's deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.\n\nA spokesperson for Sir Keir said the UK was now 'working with the Mauritian government to finalise the deal and sign the treaty'.\n\nBritain and the United States are against Iran developing a nuclear weapon. The country has been attempting to do so secretly for decades, in breach of international accords.\n\nThe Foreign Office has also condemned Iran's threats to the Chagos Islands 'in the strongest terms'.\n\nIran is believed to possess the Middle East's largest ballistic missile inventory and demonstrated its capabilities against Israel during the recent conflict.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, has said of Donald Trump's threat to bomb his country: 'If they commit any mischief, they will surely receive a strong reciprocal blow'\n\nIranian missiles at the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Tehran\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Mr Trump's bombing threats on Monday.\n\nHe said: 'The enmity from the US and Israel has always been there. They threaten to attack us, which we don't think is very probable, but if they commit any mischief, they will surely receive a strong reciprocal blow.'\n\nMr Khamenei is also under pressure from hardliners to lift a ban on building nuclear bombs.\n\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Brigadier General Amir Hajizadeh said: 'The Americans have at least ten bases in the region, around Iran, with more than 50,000 troops – this means they are sitting in a glass house. Someone sitting in a glass house does not throw stones at others.'\n\nMeanwhile, China has today kicked off large-scale military and coastguard exercises around Taiwan, in yet another bid to destabilise the country.\n\nDonald TrumpIranIsrael\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nWhat would happen if Iran attacked the Chagos Islands... and why taking out US Stealth bombers would be the end of its notorious Revolutionary Guard, revealed by MARK NICOL\n\nAdd comment","summary":"A threatened Iranian attack on British military facilities in the Chagos Islands would trigger a regional conflict, experts warn","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14559191/What-happen-Iran-attacked-Chagos-Islands-taking-US-Stealth-bombers-end-notorious-Revolutionary-Guard-revealed-MARK-NICOL.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/01/15/96789887-0-image-m-43_1743517153388.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:41:38","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol Diplomacy","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol Diplomacy"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.021},{"id":306657726,"title":"Little House on the Prairie actress Patty Maloney dead at 89","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Apr 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSentebale boss is accused of 'openly playing the race card' in row with Prince Harry as royal's 'unpleasant' messages are revealed\n\nBritish mother and her daughters, eight and five, are killed in New York car crash after Audi 'driven by glam wigmaker' ploughed into family as they walked along busy street \n\nDonald Trump's crippling 'Liberation Day' tariffs threaten crisis for Rachel Reeves with Chancellor's headroom to be wiped out just one week after cuts\n\nI discovered the truth about my agonising back pain and SHRINKING after doctors misdiagnosed me.

The conglomerate would receive US$19 billion in cash.\nThe Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the liaison office posted the article on their websites, keeping up pressure on the company for a third straight week by sharing such critical pieces from pro-Beijing media.\nThe company earlier hinted it would postpone the signing of the deal, scheduled for Wednesday.\nLast Friday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced that it would launch an antitrust investigation into the transaction.\nFu Yongsheng, a lawyer at Shanghai Brilliance Law Firm, laid out the options available to the market regulator in investigating the ports sale.\n“If the relevant transaction affects fair competition in China’s related markets, the SAMR may implement anti-monopoly measures, such as conditional approval of the transaction or prohibition of the transaction,” he said.\n\nIf the original sale agreement clearly stipulated that the parties’ rights were terminated after the exclusivity period ended and there were no other restrictive clauses, then they should be able to freely transact with other parties, he added.\nThat would allow a new buyer to emerge after the 145-day window for exclusive negotiations passed while the investigation was being carried out.\nBut Fu noted that if the agreement includes clauses such as break-up fees, then “relevant responsibilities must still be fulfilled”, Fu said.\n“It is also noteworthy that the original transaction is under investigation for monopolistic issues, and [any] new transaction is likely to attract close scrutiny from regulatory authorities, potentially being regarded as an attempt to evade review,” he said.\nThe country’s Anti-Monopoly Law has been applied on a company headquartered in Hong Kong before.\nFu noted that in the A.P. Moller-Maersk acquisition of LF Logistics in 2022, national regulatory authorities imposed restrictive conditions stating that “port data must not be abused to exclude competitors”.\nLF Logistics was a subsidiary of supply chain management company Li & Fung and is based in the city.\n“The applicability of the Anti-Monopoly Law in … [the Hutchison] case does not affect the principle of the one country, two systems,” Fu said.\nArticle 2 of the law states it “shall apply to the monopolistic conduct outside the territory of the People’s Republic of China that has an effect of precluding or restricting competition in the domestic market of the People’s Republic of China”.\nExplaining the scope of the law, Fu added: “The applicability of the law mainly depends on whether the transaction affects the domestic market in China. If it does, the law can apply even if both parties are US companies and the transaction involves US projects.\n“Although CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands overseas, its business operations, management team and main markets are centred in Hong Kong, and it is deeply involved in the Chinese mainland and the global market.”\nFu also pointed to Article 25 of the Anti-Monopoly Law that stipulates an operator obtaining control over other operators or capable of exerting decisive influence on them through contracts or other means constituted a concentration.\n\nPeng Yu, an associate professor at Shanghai Maritime University Law School, also noted that the SAMR could intervene in the deal. Articles 2 and 38 of the law may be involved.\nArticle 38 required a review of concentrations involving national security, he said. Although the transaction did not concern ports within China, its potential threat to the country’s supply chain could trigger a national security assessment, Peng said.\n“The acquisition of Hutchison Ports’ assets by BlackRock is not just a capital operation, but also a microcosm of the China-US global supply chain competition,” Peng said.\n“The risk of discriminatory treatment of cargo owners objectively exists and needs to be balanced through legal deterrence, supply chain diversification and international cooperation.”\nSuch risk could put Chinese shippers at a disadvantage in terms of pricing monopoly, differences in operational priority and threats to supply chains for imports of liquefied natural gas and iron ore that relied on the Panama route, he said.\nIn its latest editorial targeting Hutchison, Ta Kung Pao urged the company to immediately end the deal, adding the legal review “cannot be delayed or postponed”.\n“This behaviour disregards the principle of one country and undermines one country, two systems,” it said.\nIt also noted US President Donald Trump vetoed the merger of Lattice Semiconductor and a Chinese company on the grounds of national security during his first term in 2017. British authorities also rejected Super Orange HK Holding’s proposed acquisition of Pulsic in 2022.\nThe article published by Ta Kung Pao and reposted by Beijing’s offices quoted 10 members of the country’s legislature and local lawmakers, including City University Professor Chow Man-kong. He supported CK Hutchison’s termination of the deal and exploration of cooperation with Chinese investors, the article quoted him as saying.\nThe piece quoted lawmaker Jesse Shang Hailong as saying the BlackRock-led consortium would control 10 per cent of the world’s container terminal throughput capacity, which, together with the port assets of the Panama Canal, would “directly threaten China’s maritime trade”.\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant for the semi-official Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies think tank, said that although the central government did not openly voice its objection to the port sale in official statements, as the antitrust probe was under way, the implication of posting the articles slamming the deal was clear.\n“Its position is actually that CK Hutchison should not do it,” Lau said. “If CK Hutchison ignores the Chinese government’s objection and signs the deal, and if the government finally determines that the deal is harmful to national interests after the investigation, the government can take action against it.”\nAdditional reporting by Yuke Xie","summary":"Market regulator empowered to put limits on sale or even halt deal under Anti-Monopoly Law, legal experts explain.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3304821/how-china-could-put-conditions-hutchison-port-sale-and-new-buyer-emerges","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/02/575b7f06-044e-4a74-8295-f613da197ee0_780d9b67.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:31:12","author":"Fiona Sun,Lam Ka-Sing","authors":["Fiona Sun","Lam Ka-Sing"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":306656124,"title":"Republicans Sweep Florida's Special Elections To Maintain Narrow House Majority","text":"In what was widely considered a referendum on President Donald Trump's first 10 weeks in office, Republican candidates won their special elections to the House of Representatives in his home state of Florida on Tuesday -- although not by the wide margins posted by their GOP predecessors.In Florida Congressional Districts 1 and 6, where Trump and the previous seat-holders won by more than 30 points, Republicans Jimmy Patronis topped Democrat Gay Valimont by a 55%-44% margin and Randy Fine defeated Josh Weil 55%-44% respectively, as projected by CNN.While Democrats are declaring a minor moral victory and a possible sign that some Trump voters could be experiencing buyers' remorse.

Their slim 218-213 majority will boost to 220 seats once the new members are sworn in. \n\nAs CFO, Patronis oversaw the state of Florida’s finances and regulations and served as the State Fire Marshal, a position he has held since 2017. He also served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2014, representing a district in the Panama City area. \n\nThe race received national attention after Democrats were hoping for a long-shot victory in an attempt to erode the GOP’s narrow majority in the House. Democrats saw a glimmer of hope after achieving a significant upset victory in a GOP-leaning state Senate race in Pennsylvania last week. \n\nValimont raised nearly $6.4 million from Jan. 9 to March 12, five times more than Patronis, according to fundraising reports from the Federal Election Commission. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not invest in the race, but the Democratic National Committee stepped in to fund the rollout of a voter protection program in this district and in another special election in the 6th District but did not specify the dollar amount for the investment.\n\nThe substantial funding indicated enthusiasm among grassroots Democratic donors in a race taking place months after President Donald Trump was elected. However, despite the strong fundraising, the political landscape in the district heavily favored the GOP. In the 2024 election, Trump secured approximately 68% of the vote in the district, slightly surpassing the 66% Gaetz received that year. \n\nThe district is among one of the most reliably Republican areas of the state.

Patronis’ victory provides a bit of cushion to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who is already working with a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives and could hardly afford another loss. In recent weeks, Republicans have worried about signs that even some conservatives have grown uneasy with Trump’s deep cuts to everything from funds for food banks to vital grants for health research.

Nearly 400,000 were approved in fiscal year 2024, most of which were applications to renew employment. Rejection rates of H-1B applications spiked during President Donald Trump’s first term but fell under former President Joe Biden, according to an article at the Pew Research Centre website.\n\nIndia is the top country of birth for H-1B workers. Roughly three-quarters (73%) of H-1B workers whose applications were approved in fiscal 2023 were born in India. A majority of approvals every year since 2010 have gone to workers born in India, the report added.\n\nChina is the second-most common birthplace, accounting for 12% of H-1B workers approved in 2023.\n\nComputer-related jobs have been the most common occupation for H-1B workers for more than a decade. Since fiscal 2012, about 60% or more of H-1B workers approved each year have held a computer-related job. In 2023, the share was 65%, and these workers reported a median annual salary of $123,600. Examples of these include jobs in systems analysis and programming, computer systems technical support, and data communications and networks.\n\nThe next largest job group for H-1B workers approved in 2023 is architecture, engineering and surveying (9%). Workers in these jobs reported a median annual salary of $115,000. Examples of these include jobs in electrical or electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial engineering.\n\nThe analysis noted that Amazon has been the employer with the most H-1B workers approved each year since 2020. Amazon received more than 11,000 H-1B approvals in fiscal 2023. This accounts for 3% of all H-1B applications approved that year.\n\nMany of the other top employers provide information technology and business services, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Google.\n\nIn 2023, three of the top 10 H-1B employers were either headquartered in India (Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services) or originated in India and are now headquartered in the U.S. (Cognizant Technology Solutions).\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nA Planeload of Regrets (Asia Samachar, 8 Feb 2025)\n\nASIA SAMACHAR is an online newspaper for Sikhs / Punjabis in Southeast Asia and beyond.

The narrow margin of Fine's victory on Tuesday, however, is likely to leave Republicans uneasy about their prospects in next year's national mid-term congressional elections.\n\nDemocrat Weil made waves by raising more than $12m in campaign donations during this campaign, compared to the approximately $1m brought in by his opponent.

And nearly 20 people who expected to start jobs in the last week no longer have offers.\n\nThe moves come after the federal government announced the end of more than $11 billion in COVID-19-related funding last week. MDH is losing more than $220 million in federal support.\n\nMinnesota is one of 23 states suing the Trump administration over the federal COVID aid freeze.\n\nGrant money helped the state respond to measles and avian flu and monitor wastewater to gauge levels of diseases like COVID-19, according to state officials.\n\nMinnesota layoffs\n\nState Health Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said the funding cutoff came with little warning.\n\n“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice but to proceed with layoffs immediately,” she said in a statement. “They left us in the lurch, with no advance notice, no close-out period, halting work that would have helped us address chronic gaps in the system and be better prepared for future threats.”\n\nMinnesota layoffs come as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services begins a push to reduce its workforce by more than 20,000 workers to about 62,000, according to the Associated Press. Many scientists, doctors and others with years of experience are expected to lose jobs.\n\nMDH has more than 2,000 employees and is tasked with, among other things, monitoring the spread of infectious diseases in the state.\n\nIn the last two-year state budget, MDH had about $1.5 billion in a mix of state, federal and other funds. About 55% of that comes from the federal government, according to the agency.\n\nPandemic era funding\n\nDuring the 2020-2021 biennium, its budget grew to about $2.7 billion due to an influx of temporary funding from the state and federal governments in response to COVID-19.\n\nDuring the worst of the pandemic, MDH helped set up testing sites and provided regular updates on key information like new infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nHHS officials announced the end of state and local COVID funding last Tuesday.\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the federal health agency said in a statement to the Associated Press.\n\nMuch of the funding, which was set to end within the next six months, was used for testing, vaccination, and community health workers responding to the pandemic. the AP reported. It also supported a 2021 program aimed at addressing “health disparities among high-risk and underserved patients, including those in minority populations.”\n\n“Abrupt terminations of grants and contracts is unprecedented and will impact our work and that of our partners,” MDH said in a statement on the cuts last week.\n\nFederal grant cuts will affect several state programs, according to MDH, which expects that less staffing will mean slower response times to infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nCommunity clinics, vaccination efforts, and the state public health laboratory will not offer the same level of service that they did before, the agency said. As a result, the state won’t be able to offer as much laboratory support for hospitals and health care systems.\n\nThere will also be significantly less support for nursing homes, including funding for ventilation system upgrades and staff training.","summary":"Minnesota’s health department is laying off 170 employees whose positions were funded by pandemic-era federal grants to the state that were recently terminated by the administration of President Donald Trump.

The IOPC has launched an investigation into the incident. \nA large cordon last night remained in place outside the train station, however trains continue to operate as usual. \nThere is also disruption to the bus station and taxi rank outside the station as this area is currently part of the scene. \nLocals told MailOnline that the town feels 'really unsafe', with many still in shock following the incident. \nIrisa Gordoni, who moved to the town 10 years ago from Italy, feels that while knife crime was common, the town has begun to feel increasingly unsafe, especially for women. \n\nA man has been shot dead by police at Milton Keynes railway station after reports of a man carrying a knife (picture from the scene)\n\nOfficers were called to Milton Keynes Central following reports of a man carrying a firearm just before 1pm yesterday (picture from the scene)\n\n'We run a small family business and sometimes you know, so I'm always worried you know that something could happen in my shop or close to my shop,' she said.\n'It just makes me feel unsafe really, I feel like everyone feels a bit scared. \n'You are scared to say anything to anyone because you don't know how it will go down,' she added: 'The train station is only 15 minutes from here.'\nShe continued: 'I feel the difference, it's become really unsafe to walk around. It used to be different because I was new to the area…I used to like it a lot.'\nThose who saw the incident have also come forward to share their accounts upon seeing the standoff between police and the armed man.\nWitness Domenico Scalzo, 38, a delivery driver, said: 'It was very shocking - I will definitely have nightmares.'\nHe described how he rushed outside to see police officers giving the man - who he said appeared to be in his 20s and was bleeding - CPR.\n'It's really difficult for the police, there are teenagers around here as young as 12 carrying massive knives, but you don't expect to see people gunned down in the streets by the police in the UK.\n'I was having my coffee and I saw a police Volvo arrive. I heard a pop - I used to work with firearms in private security, I knew it wasn't a car backfiring or anything.'\n\nResidents living above the station in Milton Keynes reported hearing a loud 'bang' during the incident\n\nPolice officers could be seen trying to save a man's life after shots were fired at around 1pmon Tuesday\n\nThe station had a large cordon around it\nDomenico, an Italian national, said he's lived in the UK for 13 years - seven in London before moving to Milton Keynes.\n'I've lived in places that are more dangerous and never seen anything like this before,' he added.\nA worker at a nearby store added: 'I have never known anything like it. It is obviously concerning, we have never heard anything happen like this before.' \nResidents living in a flat above the train station reported hearing a single loud 'bang' during the incident.\nAlan Brockbank, 70, said: 'All I heard sounded like something heavy had been dropped, it didn't sound like a shot or anything.\n'We could see the person lying on the floor and they were trying to resuscitate him.'\nHe claimed that he witnessed a man receiving CPR chest compressions who was partly obscured by the awning at the station exit.\nMr Brockbank and his wife Edith, 67, who are both retired, assumed someone had suffered something like a heart attack at the time. \n'There was all sorts of activity trying to get people back, there was somebody trying to film it, the police were trying to tell them to go back,' Mrs Brockbank said.\n'We didn't connect the bang with what was happening. I started looking to see what could have been dropped and I couldn't see anything related to that sound.'\nMr Bockbank added: 'It was only later on we saw armed police with automatic weapons. There was two of them.'\n\nThames Valley Police said armed officers responded and challenged the man at the station before shots were fire by police\n\nOfficers tried to save the man, who a witness said appeared to be in his 20s and was bleeding from his stomach\n\nPictured: Emergency services at Milton Keynes Central railway station after a man has been shot dead\nA man who lives in the flats above the station, but did not want to be identified, said he thought it was a gunshot immediately 'because it was really loud'.\nAnother resident added: 'I heard the original bang from the shot, I think, but saw quite a lot of commotion outside, but that was pretty much it - they were pretty speedy.'\nFollowing the noise, she went downstairs to see the CPR being performed on a man outside the train station. \n'There was quite a lot of police already there, they kind of sectioned off the area,' she said.\nMilton Keynes commander, Chief Superintendent Emma Baillie, said: 'We understand that this incident may cause concern locally, but we would like to reassure the community that there is no wider risk to the public.' \nShazna Muzammil, a councillor and Conservative group leader at Milton Keynes City Council, previously said she was 'deeply shocked' by what had happened.\nShe said: 'Our thoughts are with all those there and affected by it.\n'Very thankful to the police and emergency services for their swift response in keeping everyone safe.'\nA spokesperson for the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) previously said: 'We can confirm we have begun an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of a man by Thames Valley Police (TVP) at Milton Keynes railway station today [Tuesday]. \n\nDespite attempts to save the man, he was pronounced dead at the scene at 1.44pm\n\nIt is understood that the station has been closed while a cordon is in place and emergency services continue to deal with the incident\n\nThere is not believed to be any further risk to the public, police said \n 'We were notified by TVP shortly after the incident and IOPC investigators have been sent to the station and the police post-incident procedure to begin gathering information. \n'Our thoughts are with the family of the man who died and all those who have been affected by this incident. \n'Our role in these circumstances is to independently investigate all of the circumstances surrounding this incident, including the actions and decisions taken by the police. \n'We declared an independent investigation at 2.26pm. It is in its very early stages and no further information is available at this time.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPolice issue update on man shot dead by officers at Milton Keynes train station - as locals fear 'town is more unsafe than ever'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The electric vehicle (EV) company's shares ended the day up 6.4% amid the backdrop of a 0.3% gain for the S&P 500 and a 0.8% gain for the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nRivian's valuation moved higher today following news that the company is spinning off Also -- its EV micromobility business. The stock also got a boost from recent analysis that Rivian could benefit from recent controversies surrounding Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk.\n\nRivian stock jumps on micromobility spin-off\n\nRivian announced today that it has spun off its micromobility unit focusing on electric bikes, scooters, and other small vehicles into a separate business known as Also. The business is focused on electrified personal transportation, and Rivian will remain a substantial minority stake in the new entity and anticipates that there will be future collaboration between the two companies. By spinning off Also, Rivian has raised new capital that will help it expand its core EV business. \n\nCould Tesla's loss be Rivian's gain?\n\nRecent sales tracking suggests that Tesla's vehicles are seeing a steep pullback in the European market. For example, it looks like March sales for the company's vehicles in France declined 37% year over year, and its vehicle sales in the Netherlands declined 61%. With Tesla seemingly stumbling, some investors are betting that these shifts could create opportunities for Rivian and other players in the EV industry.\n\nTesla's sales woes in Europe appear to be connected to Elon Musk's recent political activities and close relationship with President Donald Trump. Given the extent of the sales pullback, it's possible that significant damage has been done to the brand. If so, that could make it significantly easier for Rivian to expand its footprint in the EV market.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/04/01/why-rivian-stock-surged-today/?source=askdougpancakes&utm_source=chromefollow&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=news&referring_guid=8d089bcb-6920-4ebf-8b49-274b67973c81","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F813372%2Fgettyimages-1088813672.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:08:45","author":"Keith Noonan","authors":["Keith Noonan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":306655302,"title":"World News | Nepal Government Appeals Public Not to Participate in Any Demonstration Organized by Monarchists","text":"Kathmandu [Nepal], April 2 (ANI): The Government of Nepal has appealed to the general public not to participate in any of the demonstrations organized by monarchists.\nAnnouncing the decisions of the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, informed that an appeal has been made not to participate in the demonstrations of the royalist group.\nAlso Read | Famous Birthdays on April 2: Ajay Devgn, Michael Clarke, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Pedro Pascal - Know About Celebrities and Influential Figures Born on April 2.\n\"The Government of Nepal appeals to the general public not to get involved in such chaotic activities,\" he said, referring to the violence of 28 March, which claimed the lives of two.\n\"The Ministry of Home Affairs has been instructed to investigate the truth and facts of the Tinkune incident and take action against the culprits and make arrangements to prevent such incidents from happening in the future,\" the cabinet decision said.\nAlso Read | TikTok Ban Looming in US, Donald Trump Signals Deal Will Come Before April 5 Deadline.\nMinister Gurung informed about the decision to give the responsibility to the Ministry of Health and Population to arrange for the treatment of those injured in the incident.\n\"The government has decided to direct the Ministry of Health and Population to make arrangements for free medical treatment for those injured in the protest that took place last Friday in the name of supporters of the former monarch,\" the minister said.\nThe cabinet meeting also decided to investigate the incidents of vandalism that took place during the protests and act against those found guilty.\nOne of the bloodiest pro-monarch protests in the Himalayan Nation's history, the March 28 protest called by pro-monarchist forces under the leadership of controversial businessman Durga Prasain, sent a spree of violence across the capital.\nThe protest organized near the Tribhuvan International Airport turned violent, claiming the lives of two, which included a TV journalist.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MILLY VEITCH FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:47 BST, 2 April 2025 |Updated:01:06 BST, 2 April 2025 \n\nNoel and Liam Gallagher have reportedly secured themselves an even bigger payday from their Oasis reunion tour this summer, after landing a multimillion merchandising deal.\nThe brothers are reported to have banked themselves a staggering £20million from Warner for the rights to their image.\nThe agreement allows for their likeness to be used on a wide range of merchandise for fans to buy at their shows, which are set to begin in just three months time.\nAnd going one step further, Noel and Liam have allegedly taken legal protections to impede counterfeit sellers trying to flog knock-off merch and steal their profits.\nAccording to The Sun, the two musicians filed documents at the Intellectual Property Office last month to trademark the now-famous black and white photo they used to announce their comeback.\nThe move gives them sole rights to the image, thereby preventing any unauthorised use, with bootleggers unable to use the snap for unofficial merchandise such as clothing, books and even paintbrushes.\n\nNoel and Liam Gallagher have reportedly secured themselves an even bigger payday from their Oasis reunion tour this summer, after landing a multimillion merchandising deal (seen in 2008)\n\nThe brothers are reported to have banked themselves a staggering £20million from Warner for the rights to their image \nA source told the publication: 'Oasis have secured a massive deal for their merch this summer as they know everyone is going to want something to remember the shows by. They have already started working on an extensive merchandise range after signing a very lucrative deal for it last year. \n'But now they are massively cracking down on fake merch because it could seriously put a dent in their profits unless they make moves now to stop it.\n'They have made it clear that they won’t be taking any nonsense and will use the full extent of the law if they find anyone selling unofficial products featuring the new photo of the brothers together.'\nMailOnline has contacted representatives for both Noel and Liam for comment. \nNoel recently admitted he was surprised by the huge demand for tickets to the upcoming shows and the resulting chaos, which saw fans waiting in queues for hours and tickets sold out in a matter of minutes.\nSpeaking to photographer Kevin Cummins for his new book Oasis: The Masterplan, he admitted: 'I thought it’d be a big deal, but I was a bit taken aback by just how much of a big deal it was'.\nIt comes after Noel and Liam signed another big-money deal, as they plot to make millions out of a film of their upcoming reunion.\nIn February, the bandmates registered Uprise North Limited with just themselves as directors.\nPapers filed to Companies House in recent days state the business to be 'Motion Picture Production Activities'.\n\nAnd going one step further, Noel and Liam have allegedly taken legal protections to impede counterfeit sellers trying to flog knock-off merch and steal their profits (seen in 1996)\n\nRumours swirled when the pair first announced their reunion tour last autumn, that a streaming giant had made a substantial offer to make a documentary about the reunion tour.\nBut the establishment of a company run by the brothers for this purpose appears to show they are seeking complete control of such a venture and also appears to demonstrate that money wasn't a major concern for the brothers.\nThe Oasis Live 25 tour kicks off on 4 July at Cardiff's Principality Stadium before playing sell-out gigs at Manchester's Heaton Park, Wembley Stadium in London, and Edinburgh's Murrayfield stadium.\nThe pair will then embark on a global tour taking in shows in Japan, Argentina, the United States and Brazil.\nIt was recently reported that Liam and Noel will not get a penny until after their Oasis reunion world tour, over fears that they may fall out again.\nManagement sources say promoters drew up complex contracts which only allow the warring brother to be paid for each individual show after it has actually happened.\nThe pair - who came to blows at their last gig as a band 15 years ago in Paris - have signed a so-called 'guarantee versus percentage' contract for each and every gig starting in the UK next summer.\nThis means they are guaranteed to pocket an estimated £3 million for each of 30 stadium dates.\n\nIt comes after Noel and Liam signed another big-money deal, as they plot to make millions out of a film of their upcoming reunion (Noel pictured in August)\n\nIt was recently reported that Liam and Noel will not get a penny until after their Oasis reunion world tour, over fears that they may fall out again (Liam pictured last year) \nHowever if 90% of each show's profits is more than £3 million - which it is very likely to be as ticket prices were so high - they will get that percentage figure instead. That means they could easily bank £5 million for each show.\nThe deal means they won't get anything until each show is costed up, after it happens. Until then, all ticket revenues stay out of reach in a neutral 'escrow' bank account which neither the band nor the promoters can touch.\nUsually, experts say, big artists like this get as much as half the guaranteed figure before the shows even start, and the rest of the guarantee, plus the percentage, after each shows end.\nOasis insiders say they won't get a single penny until after each individual show is done and dusted.\nExperts estimated they will bank £5 million a show for 30 shows worldwide, meaning the pair will earn £150 million between them - £75 million each just from the ticket profits.\nThey are also predicted to earn 'tens of millions' from merchandising, sponsorship deals, and renewed interest in their music.\nAn Oasis source was keen to downplay the relevance of the Gallagher brothers not being paid a penny until they actually turned up for the tour.\n\nThe source said: 'This situation (not receiving any upfront earnings on the back of predicted or actual ticket sales) is not unique to Oasis or indeed this tour. This is the common arrangement across the industry.'\nThere are clear signs that Liam and Noel are keeping their distance from one another until they absolutely need to be together.\nLast year Liam took 20 of his best mates and family for a week of partying in Ibiza and hires a massive party villa at a cost of £75,000. Noel wasn't among the revellers.\nMeanwhile Liam is taking a year off living in London to be at a remote manor house in the Cotswolds while Noel lives in London and Hampshire.\nLondonLiam GallagherOasis\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNoel and Liam Gallagher 'set to rake in extra £20M from Oasis reunion tour through merchandise after securing image rights to stop counterfeit sellers'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Randy Fine won a special election Tuesday to represent Florida's 6th Congressional District, defeating Democratic challenger Josh Weil and squashing efforts by national Democrats who spent millions of dollars on the race. Fine was on track for a much narrower victory than the 33-point margin by which Mike Waltz won the district in November, according to early returns. Also Read | Famous Birthdays on April 2: Ajay Devgn, Michael Clarke, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Pedro Pascal - Know About Celebrities and Influential Figures Born on April 2. The narrowing margins may signal a shift in public sentiment, driven by unusually strong Democratic enthusiasm in a traditionally Republican stronghold. It's happening less than five months since the presidential election and following a strong fundraising surge among Democrats worried about the aggressive overhaul of government initiated by President Donald Trump in his first few months in office. Also Read | TikTok Ban Looming in US, Donald Trump Signals Deal Will Come Before April 5 Deadline. Fine had faced growing pressure during the race's final days as some Republicans publicly criticised his campaign and fundraising efforts. His victory ends Democratic hopes to score a huge upset in a district that was heavily supportive of Trump in November. Because of the difference in time zones, polls remained open in the other congressional district with a special election Tuesday, where Florida's chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, is hoping to win a seat for Republicans. Republican wins in both districts would give the GOP a 220 to 213 advantage over Democrats in the US House. Patronis is looking to replace Matt Gaetz, who was tapped to be attorney general before he withdrew. He is facing a challenge from Gay Valimont, a gun control activist who raised about USD 6.5 million, according to fundraising reports, versus Patronis' USD 2.1 million. The race to fill the seat vacated by Waltz when he was tapped to become Trump's national security adviser received national attention. Democrats poured money into Weil's campaign to outraise Fine by nearly tenfold, attempting to flip a seat where the president won by more than 30 points. Fine, a self-described “conservative firebrand,” ran with Trump's endorsement. On social media, Trump congratulated Fine for “a great WIN against a massive CASH AVALANCHE.” National Republican operatives worried in the weeks leading up to the election that Fine needed more money to combat Weil's eye-popping $9 million compared to Fine's $1 million, which drew national attention from political operatives questioning whether this race would embarrass Republicans less than 100 days into Trump's administration. Yet that wasn't the case for Democrats. For weeks, national leaders have attributed Weil's fundraising success to what they characterised as widespread outrage about the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal government. That outrage failed to materialize in large enough numbers to overturn the outcome in the reliably Republican district, foiling Democrats' hope to pull off a huge upset that would have buoyed their party. Fine was first elected to the Florida House in 2016 and ran each year as a representative until 2024 when he successfully won his election to the Florida Senate. He is known for his support of Israel and his efforts to restrict LGBTQ+ rights.

I was a vegetarian for nearly a decade. But when I became a mother and needed to improve my iron levels, I made a tough decision. \n\nI returned to meat, but on my own terms — ultimately raising pigs ethically and sustainably on our farm on Djaara Country outside Daylesford, Victoria. \n\nI wanted my kids, and yours, to grow up with access to good, honest, local food. Not factory farmed, boxed protein pumped out by global corporations.\n\nAnd while we’re on the topic of steak — remember Trump Steaks? Launched with Trumpian bravado in 2007 and sold through The Sharper Image and QVC, they fizzled out in just two months after failing to meet expectations. \n\nTurns out, even a gold-plated sales pitch can’t fix bland meat. \n\nIf we let foreign corporates dominate our meat supply, Australians could soon be paying premium prices for cuts that are all sizzle, no steak — Trump Steaks, anyone? Great for a laugh. Terrible for your Sunday barbie.\n\nBut the rest of this isn’t funny. \n\nWe’re hurtling toward a future where beef mince for spag bol — Australia’s most cooked meal — could jump from $18 per kg to $36 per kg during a disease outbreak, or to $25 per kg if global demand surges due to US trade turmoil. \n\nRump steak could hit $56 per kg. That’s not dinner — that’s a luxury item.\n\nAnd what happens when all that’s left is factory-farmed meat? \n\nDisease risk skyrockets. \n\nWe’ve seen it already: the avian flu egg crisis, salmon outbreaks in Tasmania (owned by JBS, the world’s largest meat company), and China’s 2019 African Swine Fever disaster, which wiped out 40 per cent of their pigs and doubled pork prices.\n\nExperts say it’s only a matter of time before Foot and Mouth Disease reaches Australia. \n\nIf it hits a meat system built on monocultures and mega-farms, we’re done.\n\nThe government’s answer? A meagre $3.5 million for a national food security strategy – spread over two years. \n\nThat’s not a solution. \n\nThat’s a rounding error in the federal budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the PM is talking tough on supermarket price gouging. \n\nBut unless we break the supermarket duopoly and stop them funnelling meat through their chosen processors, the price-fixing and supply squeeze will continue. \n\nDiversity is the only way to bring resilience back into our food system.\n\nWe need urgent regulatory reform to allow on-farm processing, serious investment in micro-abattoirs and fast-tracked permits for regional facilities. \n\nThese aren’t pipe dreams — they’re practical, shovel-ready solutions that would give small producers a fighting chance and put power back in the hands of local communities.\n\nWhy is this so urgent? \n\nJust look at what happened in December 2024: Hardwicks, Victoria’s largest cattle and sheep abattoir, abruptly shut down its small service kills — giving farmers a mere two weeks’ notice before Christmas. \n\nMany of those producers had no alternative processing options. Their animals were ready, their customers were waiting, but their supply chains were severed overnight.\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: getting approval to build a micro-abattoir in Australia can take years due to government red tape. \n\nOur farmers don’t have years — they needed these facilities yesterday. \n\nThis is what a broken system looks like. \n\nAnd unless we fix it, more small farmers will walk away. And when they go, they take our food security with them.\n\nThis is a wake-up call, Australia. \n\nWe’re walking into a perfect storm of global trade chaos, disease risk, and corporate greed – and the people who grow your food are being shut out at every turn.\n\nThere’s still time to fix this.\n\nBecause if we don’t, April 2 won’t just be Liberation Day in the US — it’ll be the day Australians lost control of their dinner plates.\n\nLet’s not wait until the only meat left is overpriced, imported and Trump-tier terrible. \n\nLet’s fight for real food, from real farmers, before it’s too late.\n\nTammi Jonas is a small-scale livestock farmer and spokeswoman for the Australian Food Sovereignty Alliance","summary":"One move by Donald Trump could send an Aussie industry into a meltdown – and turn an everyday staple into a “luxury” most can’t afford.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/other-industries/trumps-liberation-day-a-death-sentence-for-crucial-aussie-industry/news-story/8fc574838e47a2936e06e02f51063c40?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4c2510846c3c9e1454a51fdcc122b7cd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:04:51","author":"Donald Trump","authors":["Donald Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.395},{"id":306655292,"title":"Elon Musk threatens ‘generals’ who he claims are  ‘paying’ for Tesla protests after shelling out millions for Wisconsin election","text":"Elon Musk made a last-ditch plea to Wisconsin voters during his appearance in front of a fawning panel of Fox News personalities hours before polls closed in a closely watched state Supreme Court race.\n\nThe world’s wealthiest man and his allies have spent more than $20 million to boost a conservative judge’s campaign in a race that could determine the ideological balance of the state’s highest court, among the first high-stakes elections during Donald Trump’s presidency.\n\nMusk and his political action committee are pouring money into elections across the country to support Republican candidates, including legally dubious pledges to “personally” hand voters $1 million checks and give out $50 to anyone who takes a picture of themselves outside a voting booth after voting for the candidate he supports.\n\nThe billionaire’s press blitz to support a conservative candidate in Wisconsin follows widespread protests outside Tesla businesses and a wave of vandalism targeting Tesla vehicles to protest his efforts to purge the federal workforce and gut entire agencies with his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n“This is fundamentally a case of terrorism … for the purpose of intimidation.

Hegseth had only just left Asia, where he promised “credible deterrence” efforts by the US against China in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nRelated: Japan unveils first plan to evacuate 100,000 civilians from islands near Taiwan in event of conflict\n\n“The publicity around the exercise likely also has the US in mind – they want to persuade the Trump administration that Lai is a troublemaker and to deter the US from maintaining high levels of support to Taiwan,” said Amanda Hsiao, a director in Eurasia Group’s China practice.\n\nThat maintenance has been less than assured since Donald Trump took office for the second time – upending the global order and withdrawing the US from much of its role as a superpower highly involved in geopolitics.\n\nTrump’s public questioning of Taiwan’s worth, his accusations of industrial theft, and his dramatic abandonment of Ukraine had left many on the island wondering if its most important partner might not be so reliable any more.\n\nBut recent days have seen the clearest signs yet that, at least for now, the US plans to keep up its support of Taiwan’s freedom.\n\nOn Sunday in Tokyo, Hegseth met his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, and declared the US was “re-establishing deterrence”, (claiming it had waned under Joe Biden – an assessment several analyst told the Guardian they disagreed with).\n\n“America is committed to sustaining robust, ready and credible deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait,” Hegseth said.\n\nIt followed comments in the Philippines, where he met President Ferdinand Marco, that the two countries should stand “shoulder to shoulder” to deter conflict. China is also engaged in escalating hostilities with the Philippines over disputed territory in the South China Sea.\n\nWhile Hegseth was still in Asia, the Washington Post reported on a leaked internal Pentagon memo, directing the prioritisation of deterring a Chinese annexation of Taiwan, while pulling back from other regions including the Middle East and Europe, where Russia continues to wage war on Ukraine.\n\n“China is the department’s sole pacing threat, and denial of a Chinese fait accompli seizure of Taiwan – while simultaneously defending the US homeland is the department’s sole pacing scenario,” the memo reportedly said.\n\nHegseth’s comments and the memo have provided some reassurance in Taiwan.\n\n“[They] give strong assurances to US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific that the US will continue to be a strong military presence in the region,” said Bethany Allen, head of China investigations and analysis at ASPI, adding that the memo’s “sole pacing scenario” language about Taiwan went beyond previous US statements from any administration.\n\n“What we’re not seeing from this administration compared to previous ones, is the invocation of solidarity among democracies as a reason for US military assurances in the region,” Allen said.\n\nA Taiwanese official told the Guardian that Taiwan was deeply appreciative of Hegseth’s remarks, which the official said remained consistent with longstanding US policy on bolstering Taiwan’s military deterrence capabilities.\n\nThe official also said the remarks fit with the existing trajectory of “an increasingly robust US commitment to the region”, and that Taiwan maintains “frequent and very positive” communications with the many different levels of the Trump administration. There are other signs of US support – including a recent visit to Taiwan from the Alaska governor for talks on gas sales, increases in US military training of Taiwanese soldiers, and fast-tracked deliveries of major weapons orders to Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office declined to comment on the reported memo. But publicly and privately the Taiwan government has stressed it has not had concerns about the US’s commitment, even if analysts say Taipei’s actions – which have included delegations sent to Washington, pledges to increase spending, and major new semiconductor deals – have suggested differently.\n\nRorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Taiwan would have to tread carefully “not to be seen as putting the US at risk” of entering a costly war. As president, Lai has taken a more confrontational approach to cross-strait tensions than his predecessor. “Whether the Trump administration sees Taipei’s actions as escalatory matters a great deal in how it would respond to a contingency,” Daniels said.\n\nAnalysts said Hegseth’s comments, while a good sign for Taiwan, should still be taken with a grain of salt. Some pointed to widespread warnings that there is some space between what US officials say and do, and what Trump says.\n\n“There’s a concern with the Trump administration that its attention shifts around, and what is promised now may not come through,” said Ja-Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.\n\nRaymond Kuo, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said the comments from Hegseth reflected both a continuation and intensification of the “pivot” to Asia driven by successive administrations, but there were factional considerations.\n\n“The China hawks in the administration generally have not been the main drivers in recent foreign policy discussions, including Greenland, the Panama canal, and Canada.”\n\nKuo warned that Trump has the final decision-making power and he has proved to be both highly transactional and to hold negative opinions of Taiwan.\n\nThere is also a credibility issue. The world has seen how Trump treated Ukraine, and the global recipients of USAid assistance. Hegseth, a former national guard major and Fox News host, is also battling calls for his resignation after he shared sensitive military information to a Signal group that had mistakenly included a journalist. In messages subsequently published from the group, Hegseth accused Europe of being “pathetic” and “freeloading”.\n\nChong said the Trump team’s treatment of partners raised questions about “how well, willing and able they are to work with allies in the region”.\n\nBeijing is of course watching. There are talks of a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping being arranged.\n\n“It will be important for Trump to deliver a clear signal of resolve to uphold the status quo when he meets with Xi,” said Ryan Hass, director of the China Center at the Brookings Institute, saying deterrence depends on capabilities and resolve.\n\n“Secretary Hegseth’s comments and reported directives are additive and helpful in this regard, but ultimately, Beijing will take the measure of President Trump.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/hegseth-indicates-us-backing-taiwan-000221278.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/686593e236c66ff19681890bc28e1e8e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-02 00:02:21","author":"Helen Davidson In Taipei","authors":["Helen Davidson In Taipei"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.07},{"id":306654290,"title":"Republican wins in Florida’s 6th district, bolstering GOP majority in House","text":"(FOX NEWS) — Trump-endorsed Republican state Sen.

The country's army said in a statement that the armed reconnaissance drone had entered Algerian airspace Monday near Tin Zaouatine, a border town and stronghold for Tuareg separatists opposed to Mali's government. Mali's army acknowledged that one of its drones had crashed in the area, but did not confirm whether it was shot down by Algeria.

Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the shooting down of the drone — rather than issuing a warning -- reflected simmering frustrations. It “confirms the serious tensions between the countries and unwillingness and zero tolerance by Algeria to allow the use of its airspace and territory by Malian forces,” he said.

Algeria once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali's government and Tuareg rebels. But the two countries have grown apart since a military junta staged coups in 2020 and 2021, putting military personnel in charge of the country's key institutions. Algeria has denounced the direction that Mali's new government has taken and its expanded efforts to quash rebellion in historically volatile parts of northern Mali. Afraid of conflict spilling over the border, Algerian officials have denounced Mali's use of Russian mercenaries and armed drones near Tin Zaouatine, which is divided by the border separating the two countries. But failures to curb instability in northern Mali have led to the downfall of previous governments and Mali's Prime Minister Abdoulaye Maiga addressed the issue in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly last year, promising to respond swiftly to violence in the north. Algeria has one of Africa's largest militaries and has long considered itself a regional power but military leaders in neighboring Mali and Niger have distanced themselves as they've championed autonomy and sought new alliances, including with Russia. Algeria did not specify who the drone it intercepted belonged to. A spokesperson for Mali's army declined to comment when asked about Algeria's alleging that an armed drone had crossed its border, but said the crash didn't hurt anyone or cause property damage. Unverified video circulating on social media showed images of an Akinci drone manufactured by Baykar downed in Tin Zaouatine. Mali purchased at least two from the Turkish company last year and has used them against armed separatists as well as fighters linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.

The Post reported last week the deal is not expected to be signed by the informal deadline of April 2, pending an antitrust review.\nRegardless of the eventual buyer, the sale could trigger a wave of regulatory reviews in the more than 20 countries where the docks are located, should their governments deem them necessary.\n\nWhat about the port fee proposal?\nThe Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) has proposed fines on shipping companies using China-built or operated vessels.\nEven for non-Chinese operators or owners, having these vessels in their fleet or on their order books – almost impossible to avoid, given Beijing’s dominant share in the shipbuilding market – will also result in high port fees, levied on an escalating scale based on proportion.\nCurrently, a port call for a Chinese bulker or tanker can cost as little as $50,000 according to ship tracker Marine Traffic, but under the USTR proposal, each port call for a vessel of Chinese make could climb as high as US$1.5 million.\nThe USTR held a two-day hearing in Washington last week and solicited public comments on the proposal. Figures from the maritime sector voiced significant concerns, as did representatives of fuel and agriculture businesses.\nHow many vessels would be affected?\nMarine Traffic data shows 2,717 vessels built in Chinese shipyards made port in the US from January 2024 to the end of February, for a total of 16,870 port calls.\nHow will the fees impact US agriculture?\nNearly one-fourth of all grain and 40 per cent of all oil seeds grown in the United States are exported, supporting the entire agricultural and rural economy, said North American Export Grain Association (NAEGA) president Alejandra Castillo at the hearing.\nAccording to NAEGA, 50 per cent of the global bulk freight fleet is Chinese-built, while only 0.2 per cent is constructed in the United States.\n\nShould the proposed measures be implemented, NAEGA said it would request exemptions for agricultural exports as well as for imported materials vital to farm production and the animal feed industry.

He also emailed them asking them, \"What do you do all day?\" DOGE SLASHES OVER $100M IN DEI FUNDING AT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT: ‘WIN FOR EVERY STUDENT’ To organize his information and rank the roles of the non-faculty employees, he created a website, Bloat@Brown, which Shieh said was similar to DOGE and Mark Zuckerber's college project of scrapping student ID photos to rank who was hotter. Shieh wrote about how he used publicly available information on LinkedIn, the student newspaper, and job boards to compile all the information he could about each employee and fed that information into a GPT-4o mini, an AI app, to rank the non-faculty employees. Shieh, a sophomore at Brown University, said he did this work from a common room in his dorm’s basement that floods whenever it rains, thus making plastic tarps for the shared work and leisure space a necessity for a school that charges students $93,064 a year. He formatted his site to identify three particular jobs: \"DEI jobs, redundant jobs, and bulls--t jobs.\" According to Shieh, DEI was important to look into because of President Donald Trump’s executive orders and his administration threatening to withhold federal funds to universities with DEI policies. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOLED OUT OVER $200M TO UNIVERSITIES TO INJECT DEI INTO COUNSELING COURSES: REPORT In fiscal year 2024, Brown University, which has an Office of Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion, reportedly received \"more than $254 million\" in federal funding. \"After doing some digging, I discovered that much of the money is being thrown into a pit of bureaucracy,\" Shieh wrote. \"The small army of 3,805 non-faculty administrators is more than double the faculty headcount, and makes for roughly one administrator for every two undergrads.\" In addition to the information Shieh found, he also sent a mass email to the 3,805 non-faculty employees asking about their duties. \"This was purposefully done in the dead of night, just in case Brown’s IT team felt inclined to block emails from my domain,\" Shieh said, adding that he said he was a journalist for The Brown Spectator, an inactive libertarian journal that is attempting to restart. Shieh said that only 20 of the 3,805 people emailed responded, with some replies allegedly saying, \"f--k you,\" and another directing Shieh to \"stick an entire cactus up [his] a--.\" The following day, after sending the email, the university reportedly told staff not to respond to Shieh’s email. In addition, Shieh claimed his social security number was leaked, and his email was spammed with \"every porn newsletter on the internet.\" \"Less than 48 hours later, as has previously been reported, an associate dean my model warned could be redundant (her role overlapped with other deans on the discipline team and she was the only one without a JD) informed me I was under review for ‘emotional/psychological harm,’ ‘misrepresentation,’ ‘invasion of privacy,’ and ‘violation of operational rules,’\" Shieh wrote. Shieh, who is being represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), said the associate dean also told him give back all the confidential information he had, which he says was \"scraped from the public internet.\" \"If college administrators are this scared of a sophomore with a laptop, they should be terrified of what’s coming next,\" Shieh wrote.

Clark added that \"The website included derogatory descriptions of job functions of named individuals at every job level. While the emails were framed as a journalistic inquiry, the supposed news organization identified in the email has had no active status at Brown for more than a decade, and no news article resulted.

Weil, a Democratic public school teacher, had outraised Fine, a state senator, and a poll had shown them running practically neck in neck days before the election.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, voter Andrew Julius cast his ballot for Weil in Daytona Beach, Florida because he said he seemed like a level-headed, educated person. He was also concerned about how Trump’s team were handling foreign policy, including the latest privacy concern when Waltz shared war plans on a Signal chat that included a journalist.\n\n“I had a top secret security clearance with my job in the Navy because I was a sonar tech,” he said. “If I would have done just a fraction of a mistake or what was done with this whole Signal-gate fiasco, I would have been court martial-ed.”\n\nBut the majority of voters continued to support the Republican ticket.\n\nAt the Church of Christ in Daytona Beach, Fine campaign volunteer “Spock” Hinson wore a shirt with Trump’s mugshot that said Never Surrender. The former Democrat said he supported Trump and key ally Elon Musk. “I want him to do what he’s trying to do,” he said of Musk. “Anybody who’s not happy with him is either brainwashed or a crook.”\n\nOn social media, Trump, who had endorsed Fine, congratulated him for “a great WIN against a massive CASH AVALANCHE”.\n\nFor congressional Republicans, the election win helps preserve their razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, which is in the middle of a complex negotiation with the Senate aimed at enacting legislation authorizing Trump’s campaign promises, including the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, an extension of tax cuts passed during his first term and an increase in the US government’s debt ceiling.\n\nA second special election in Florida for the seat vacated by Republican Matt Gaetz, who resigned after Trump nominated him for attorney general only to drop out amid reports of sexual misconduct and drug use or possession, has not yet been called. Democrats were not expected to be competitive in the heavily Republican area.\n\nBefore Tuesday’s special elections, the GOP held 218 seats in Congress’s lower chamber and the Democrats 213. But despite their disappointing performance in last November’s presidential election, Democrats appear to be continuing their streak of strong performances in off-year elections nationwide. Last week, a Democrat won an upset victory in a state senate race in Pennsylvania and the Trump administration a day later withdrew their nomination of congresswoman Elise Stefanik as UN ambassador, a decision widely seen as fueled by concern over creating another vacant House seat.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/florida-special-election-republican-randy-235716237.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/1251e656af2386d995fa0b37dd7d784c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 23:57:16","author":"Chris Stein In Washington And Ashley Spencer In Daytona Beach, Florida","authors":["Chris Stein In Washington And Ashley Spencer In Daytona Beach, Florida"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":306655312,"title":"World News | California Lawmakers Reject Bills to Ban Trans Athletes' Participation in Girls Sports","text":"Sacramento, Apr 2 (AP) California lawmakers won't change state policies allowing transgender kids and teens to play on sports teams consistent with their gender identities amid heated nationwide debates over the participation of trans youth in athletics. Democratic lawmakers on the state Assembly's Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports and Tourism rejected two proposals by Republican lawmakers on Tuesday after hours of impassioned debate and commentary.

One bill would have required the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports, to adopt rules banning students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team. The other would have reversed a 2013 law allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity. It would have applied to K-12 and college students. Also Read | TikTok Ban Looming in US, Donald Trump Signals Deal Will Come Before April 5 Deadline. The hearing came a day after Transgender Day of Visibility, and weeks after Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom angered his political allies when he suggested on his podcast it's unfair for transgender athletes to participate in girls sports. Democratic Assembly member Chris Ward, the committee chair who leads the legislative LGBTQ+ caucus, said the bills were part of a broader attack on the rights of transgender youth. He said they could also be invasive to cisgender girls who might be asked to prove their sex. “I don't think anybody should be gender policing women and girls,” Ward said. But Republican Assembly member Bill Essayli, who authored the bill to reverse the 2013 law, said the proposal was about fairness. “Biology matters,” he said. “Sports are one of the places where that reality is most obvious.” Taylor Starling, a student-athlete in Riverside who says a trans runner took her spot on her high school's varsity cross country team, said a ban would help ensure female athletes are treated fairly. “Why are girls being told that we must sit down and be quiet while boys unfairly get ahead of us in life?” she said. But LGBTQ+ advocates and parents of transgender children urged lawmakers to support trans kids — in sports and beyond. Cati Johnson, a parent of a transgender girl in middle school, said it was important to defend the rights and protections of trans kids, such as the ability to use a restroom that aligns with their gender identity. “The facilities ban really sends the message that she is not welcome as her authentic self,” Johnson said of her daughter. “And that's just not OK.” At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women's or girls sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah. In New Hampshire and West Virginia, students who sued those states over bans were allowed to compete. At the federal level, President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month aimed at barring transgender athletes from participating in girls and women's sports. Some states have also imposed bans on gender-affirming care and required schools to share students' gender identity with parents without the students' consent. Essayli and other proponents of the proposals referred multiple times to Newsom's comments. The governor later told The Los Angeles Times he had deliberated on the issue for years, and he stuck by his comments. “I know that hurt a lot of people. But respectfully, I just disagree with those on the other side of this,” he said. Newsom has not directly called for a reversal of existing state law and won't have to weigh in after the bills died. Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent Newsom a letter last week, saying his remarks on his podcast caught her attention and requesting he clarify his stance. “Take a stand on your convictions,” she wrote. “Be clear about the harms of gender confusion. Protect female spaces. Do not encourage children to seek permanent medical interventions to their sex. Inform parents.” The US Department of Education also announced an investigation last week into the state education department over a law banning school districts from requiring teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The state's constitution was revised in 2022, when Democrat lawmakers voted to adopt the Equal Rights Amendment, which added gender identity to its list of diversity classifications that are protected under state law. The law prompted a nationally publicized feud between the University of Nevada, Reno and its women's volleyball players in October. The players approached university administrators privately to express their desire to forfeit a match against San Jose State University, which rostered a trans athlete. But the university did not honor that request and instead released a statement insisting it would play the match. Nevada also insisted its players would be allowed to skip the contest without facing discipline. WHO IS BLAIRE FLEMING? SJSU VOLLEYBALL PLAYER DOMINATING FEMALE RIVALS AND ENRAGING WOMEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS The team ultimately forfeited the day before the match was scheduled to be played, due to not having enough players. However, the university has said it had discussions with the players about potential \"legal issues\" that would emerge if the match were not played. \"University administrators met with the Nevada volleyball team and discussed scenarios of what could happen if they chose not to play. One of the scenarios that was discussed revolved around possible legal issues for violating the Nevada Constitution,\" read a statement that was provided exclusively to Fox News Digital by the University of Nevada, Reno. The dispute between the players escalated into a national controversy that even garnered mainstream political attention in the weeks leading up to November's election.

Yet Booker also provided a moment of historical solace for a party searching for its way forward: By standing on the Senate floor for more than a night and day and refusing to leave, he had broken a record set 68 years ago by then Sen.

Instead, Booker’s performance was a broader critique of Trump’s agenda, meant to hold up the Senate’s business and draw attention to what Democrats are doing to contest the president. Without a majority in either congressional chamber, Democrats have been almost completely locked out of legislative power but are turning to procedural maneuvers to try to thwart Republicans.\n\nCan his speech rally the anti-Trump resistance?\n\nBooker is serving his second term in the Senate. He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 2020, when he launched his campaign from the steps of his home in Newark. He dropped out after struggling to gain a foothold in a packed field, falling short of the threshold to meet in a January 2020 debate.\n\nBut as Democrats search for a next generation of leadership, frustrated with the old-timers at the top, Booker’s speech could cement his status as a leading figure in the party.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, tens of thousands of people were watching on Booker’s Senate YouTube page, as well as on other live streams.\n\nAs Democratic colleagues made their way to the Senate chamber to help Booker by asking him questions, he also made heartfelt tributes to his fellow senators, recalling their personal backgrounds and shared experiences in the Senate. Booker also called on Americans to respond not just with resistance to Trump’s actions but with kindness and generosity for those in their communities.\n\nBooker said, “I may be afraid — my voice may shake — but I’m going to speak up more.\"\n\nBy Mike Catalini and Stephen Groves Associated Press\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, N.J.

Will it rally anti-Trump resistance?","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — In a feat of determination, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker held the Senate floor with a marathon speech that lasted all night and into Tuesday evening, setting a historic mark to show Democrats’ resistance to President Donald Trump’s sweeping actions.\n\nBooker took to the Senate floor on Monday evening, saying he would remain there as long as he was “physically able.” More than 24 hours later, the 55-year-old senator, a former football tight end, was still going. It set the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber’s history, though Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor.\n\nIt was a remarkable show of stamina as Democrats try to show their frustrated supporters that they are doing everything possible to contest Trump’s agenda. Yet Booker also provided a moment of historical solace for a party searching for its way forward: By standing on the Senate floor for more than a night and day and refusing to leave, he had broken a record set 68 years ago by then Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a segregationist, to filibuster the advance of the Civil Rights Act in 1957.\n\n“I’m here because as powerful as he was, the people are more powerful,” said Booker, who spoke openly on the Senate floor of his roots as the descendant of both slaves and slave-owners.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black party leader in Congress who had slipped into the Senate chamber to watch Booker on Tuesday afternoon, called it “an incredibly powerful moment” because he had broken the record of a segregationist and was “fighting to preserve the American way of life and our democracy.”\n\nStill, Booker centered his speech on a call for his party to find its resolve, saying, “We all must look in the mirror and say, ‘We will do better.‘”\n\n“These are not normal times in our nation,” Booker said as he began the speech Monday evening. “And they should not be treated as such in the United States Senate. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent, and we all must do more to stand against them.”\n\nBooker warns of a ‘looming constitutional crisis’\n\nShifting his feet, then leaning on his podium, Booker railed for hours against cuts to Social Security offices led by Trump adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. He listed the impacts of Trump’s early orders and spoke to concerns that broader cuts to the social safety net could be coming, though Republican lawmakers say the program won’t be touched.\n\nBooker also read what he said were letters from constituents, donning and doffing his reading glasses. One writer was alarmed by the Republican president’s talk of annexing Greenland and Canada and a “looming constitutional crisis.”\n\nThroughout the day Tuesday, Booker got help from Democratic colleagues, who gave him a break from speaking to ask him questions. Booker yielded for questions but made sure to say he would not give up the floor. He read that line from a piece of paper to ensure he did not slip and inadvertently end his speech. He stayed standing to comply with Senate rules.\n\n“Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity has just been nothing short of amazing and all of America is paying attention to what you’re saying,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said as he asked Booker a question on the Senate floor. “All of America needs to know there’s so many problems, the disastrous actions of this administration.”\n\nAs Booker stood for hour after hour, he appeared to have nothing more than a couple glasses of water to sustain him. Yet his voice grew strong with emotion as his speech stretched into the evening, and House members from the Congressional Black Caucus stood on the edge of the Senate floor to support Booker.\n\n“Moments like this require us to be more creative or more imaginative, or just more persistent and dogged and determined,” Booker said.\n\nBooker’s cousin and brother, as well as Democratic aides, watched from the chamber’s gallery. Sen. Chris Murphy accompanied Booker on the Senate floor throughout the day and night. Murphy was returning the comradeship that Booker had given to him in 2016 when the Connecticut Democrat held the floor for almost 15 hours to argue for gun control legislation.\n\nHis Senate floor speech breaks Thurmond’s record\n\nStill hours away from breaking Thurmond’s record, Booker remarked Tuesday afternoon, “I don’t have that much gas in the tank.”\n\nYet as anticipation in the Capitol grew that he would supplant Thurmond, who died in 2003, as the record holder for the longest Senate floor speech, Democratic senators sat at their desks to listen and the Senate gallery filled with onlookers. The chamber exploded in applause as Schumer announced that Booker had broken the record.\n\nBooker had already surpassed the longest speech time for a sitting senator — the 21 hours and 19 minutes that Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, had held the floor to contest the Affordable Care Act in 2013. Responding to his record being broken, Cruz posted a meme of Homer Simpson crying on social media.\n\nThroughout his determined performance, Booker repeatedly invoked the civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis of Georgia on Tuesday, arguing that overcoming opponents like Thurmond would require more than just talking.\n\n“You think we got civil rights one day because Strom Thurmond — after filibustering for 24 hours — you think we got civil rights because he came to the floor one day and said, ‘I’ve seen the light,‘” Booker said. “No, we got civil rights because people marched for it, sweat for it and John Lewis bled for it.”\n\nBooker’s speech was not a filibuster, which is a speech meant to halt the advance of a specific piece of legislation.

Cerabino, Chairman of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, stated that \"the substance of that agreement is consistent\" with the firm's views on access to legal representation by clients and that the firm has a \"history of working with clients across a wide spectrum of political viewpoints.\"The announcement comes amid a wave of executive orders from Trump targeting Big Law over their affiliations — both with political adversaries and with causes he has publicly criticized.

In 2023, Wilkie brought on Tim Heaphy, the former chief investigative counsel for the House select committee that probed the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.The firm represented Trump during a 1990s bankruptcy case and successfully defended his close ally, Thomas Barrack, in a 2022 federal case. The firm also represents X, the social media company now owned by Trump ally and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.","summary":"The law firm that employs Doug Emhoff is pledging at least $100 million in pro bono legal work for causes aligned with \"conservative ideals,\" Trump said.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/willkie-doug-emhoff-big-law-pro-bono-work-trump-2025-4","image":"https://i.insider.com/5fdbb883d366e60018098bc2?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 23:51:13","author":"Katherine Li","authors":["Katherine Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.348}]}
