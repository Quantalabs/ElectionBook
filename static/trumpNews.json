Analysts had estimated $9.39 billion on average, but some projections topped $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.In a mixed blessing, AMD reported some sales of older chips in China. That added to revenue — and signaled that the company is navigating trade restrictions — but weighed on profit margins. The outlook let down investors who had hoped to see a bigger payoff from artificial intelligence spending. AMD is still playing catch-up with Nvidia Corp. in this lucrative market, but the chipmaker has said that a new more powerful design — due in the second half of the year — will give it an advantage. The shares fell as much as 16% to $204.01 in New York on Wednesday, the biggest intraday decline since October 2018. They had been up 13% this year through Tuesday’s close.Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su stuck to her usual bullish tone, repeating a prediction that the company’s AI revenue will reach the tens of billions of dollars in 2027. She brushed off questions about the possibility of component shortages and said that her company will be able to meet the expected increase in orders. “There’s no question that demand continues to be strong,” Su told analysts on a conference call. “And so we’re working with our supply chain partners to increase supply as well.”Fourth-quarter sales rose 34% to $10.3 billion, beating a $9.7 billion average estimate. Profit was $1.53 a share, minus certain items. Analysts projected $1.32 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.AMD’s data center business, the main beneficiary of AI spending, rose 39% to $5.38 billion in the period. Analysts had predicted $4.97 billion on average. Personal computer-related sales rose 34% to $3.1 billion. The average prediction was $2.89 billion.Like Nvidia, AMD is contending with US restrictions on what it can export to China — the world’s biggest market for chips. President Donald Trump recently moved to relax the curbs, but it’s taken time to get the needed licenses from the Department of Commerce.The company generated $390 million of revenue last quarter from shipping older-generation MI308 chips to Chinese customers. It expects about $100 million of such sales in the current period, the dropoff a sign of diminished demand for a product that’s becoming more outdated.AMD is looking to sell its newer MI325 processor in China, but it still doesn’t have licenses to offer that chip. The company said it continues to discuss the issue with Washington and prospective Chinese customers.More broadly, AMD expects giant deals with OpenAI and Oracle Corp. — as well as overall demand for AI gear — to generate tens of billions of dollars in new revenue. Analysts and investors have pressed executives for more precise projections on when that will happen.AMD’s recent agreements with OpenAI, Oracle and the US Department of Energy reflect increased interest in its MI series of AI accelerators. Those products, which go head to head with chips from Nvidia, are used in data centers to create and run AI services.AMD is also one of the largest providers of graphics chips and central processing units used in PCs and servers. Intel, AMD’s chief rival in that field, gave a disappointing forecast last month, saying it couldn’t get enough supply to meet strong demand. Wall Street took that as an indication that AMD was continuing to win market share.(Updates share reaction starting in first paragraph.)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2026 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/companies/amd-suffers-worst-rout-since-2018-on-disappointing-forecast-11770229962609.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/06/1600x900/logo/company_3_1733465099406_1733465108677.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 18:32:42","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":399473570,"title":"Clifford Everald Warmington appointed ECJ Commissioner","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister without portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Clifford Everald Warmington, making his contribution to the 2021/22 Sectoral Debate in the House of Representatives on May 5. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Clifford Everald Warmington appointed ECJ Commissioner \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica – Governor-General Sir Patrick Allen has, on the advice of the Prime Minister Andrew Holness appointed Clifford Everald Warmington to serve as Nominated Commissioner on the Electoral Commission of Jamaica (ECJ), effective February 1, 2026.\n\nWarmington succeeds Senator Thomas Tavares-Finson, who retired from the commission on January 31, 2026.\n\nREAD: Tavares-Finson retires as ECJ Commissioner\n\nHe joins the other Nominated Commissioner representing the Prime Minister, Dr Aundre Franklin.

(Photo: JIS) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\n\n\n\n House passes legislation to strengthen cybercrime framework \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — The House of Representatives, on Tuesday passed legislation to strengthen Jamaica’s cybercrime framework, providing stronger protection for children and sharper tools for law enforcement and prosecutors.\n\nClosing the debate on the Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act, Minister without Portfolio in the Office of the Prime Minister with Responsibility for Science, Technology and Special Projects, Andrew Wheatley, addressed concerns raised that the bill does not deal with the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe Opposition had argued that the bill does not expressly reference artificial intelligence, deepfakes, forged documents or manipulated videos, and that this may make prosecution difficult.\n\n“We have to be very real how we deal with issues like this, because the House must recognise that the Cybercrimes Act is technologically neutral. That neutrality is very much intentional. It allows prosecution of offences under the Act, irrespective of the technology used, the platform involved or the method of manipulation,” Dr Wheatley said.\n\n“The absence of a specific reference to AI is, therefore, not fatal. What matters is whether the required elements of the offence are present, whether an intimate image is created or generated, and whether fraudulent manipulation of data has occurred through input, alteration, deletion, suppression, or other means contemplated by the app,” he added.\n\nThe minister further stated that the Government has already indicated its intention to develop a National AI policy and has reappointed the National AI Task Force to assist with this work, including analysis of Jamaica’s legal and regulatory framework and recommendations for new laws or further amendments.\n\nOn the matter of a public education campaign, Dr Wheatley said a law is only as effective as public understanding and enforcement readiness, “so proper public education must be done”.\n\n“If we want to ensure that a number of our laws, in particular, sensitive regulation and laws are fully appreciated, we have a responsibility to ensure that we have adequate public education as well. We cannot just pass laws and expect people to comply; we have to ensure that the laws that we pass for the benefit of our people, that they themselves are aware of their own obligation and the consequences that will follow,” the minister said.\n\n“Laws cannot be created in isolation. It must be done in such a way that our citizens appreciate the work that is being done to protect them, and that is why I truly agree that public education is essential. So, following passage, we will embark on an education and awareness programme to ensure citizens, institutions, and law-enforcement agencies understand the provisions of the Act, the practical standards and the consequences of breach,” he continued.\n\nThe bill is to be sent to the Senate for its approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: cybercrime house legislation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Forex: $157.38 to one US dollar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The United States (US) dollar on Wednesday, February 4, ended at $157.38, down 5 cents, according to the Bank of Jamaica’s daily e... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reputed gang leader ‘Bloodstain’ charged with double murder in Molynes shooting \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A reputed gang leader has been charged with multiple offences, including murder, following a deadly shooting on Grenmeade Road in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gas prices up $0.17, $0.18, diesel up $1.18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Motorists should see increases at the pumps in the price of gasoline effective Thursday, February 5, according to the latest ex-re... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Morgan accuses Golding of hypocrisy over failure to act against Dennis Gordon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Government Senator Marlon Morgan has accused People’s National Party (PNP) President Mark Golding over what he described as a prol... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vaz rejects auditor general’s procurement findings, defends StarLink acquisition after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Energy and Telecommunications Minister Daryl Vaz has rejected the auditor general’s findings that he breached procurement rules in... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man sentenced to life in prison for plotting to kill Trump in 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, Jamaica (AFP) — A man who plotted to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Paulwell demands transparency after Vaz flagged for breaching procurement rules \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The People’s National Party (PNP) has raised concerns about transparency and accountability following reports that Energy and Tele... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

A third victim, Desmond Brown, otherwise called “Papa”, a 44-year-old chef of Grenmeade Road, was shot and injured.\n\nInvestigators said a white Nissan AD Wagon motor vehicle drove past the victims, turned around, and stopped near them before occupants of the vehicle opened gunfire. Powell reportedly ran into premises number 14, where he collapsed. Jackson sustained a gunshot wound to the neck, while Brown was shot in the left side of his chest.\n\nThe victims were rushed to the Kingston Public Hospital by residents. Jackson was pronounced dead at 7:20 pm, while Powell was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. Brown was admitted in serious condition.\n\nThe scene was processed by detectives from the Major Investigation Division, who recovered four 9mm spent casings, a damaged bullet, a bullet fragment, four blood samples and three DNA samples.\n\nAshley was arrested on Monday, January 12, 2026, during an operation in Phoenix Park Village, Phase 2, St Catherine, conducted by the St Catherine South police. He was later identified on an identification parade on Monday, February 2, 2026, at the Greater Portmore Police Station.\n\nHe was formally charged on Tuesday, February 3, 2026.\n\nHis court date is being finalised. Investigations continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Bloodstain charged Double Murder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gas prices up $0.17, $0.18, diesel up $1.18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Motorists should see increases at the pumps in the price of gasoline effective Thursday, February 5, according to the latest ex-re... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Morgan accuses Golding of hypocrisy over failure to act against Dennis Gordon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Government Senator Marlon Morgan has accused People’s National Party (PNP) President Mark Golding over what he described as a prol... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vaz rejects auditor general’s procurement findings, defends StarLink acquisition after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Energy and Telecommunications Minister Daryl Vaz has rejected the auditor general’s findings that he breached procurement rules in... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man sentenced to life in prison for plotting to kill Trump in 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, Jamaica (AFP) — A man who plotted to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Paulwell demands transparency after Vaz flagged for breaching procurement rules \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The People’s National Party (PNP) has raised concerns about transparency and accountability following reports that Energy and Tele... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ex-Klansman members expected to testify against Tesha Miller, co-accused \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica – Two former Klansman members are set to testify as star witnesses for the Crown in the trial of alleged gang leader Tesha Miller an... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Struggling Cavalier SC host Mt Pleasant in rescheduled JPL game \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Defending champions Cavalier SC will host Mount Pleasant FA in a rescheduled Jamaica Premier League (JPL) second round game at Sta... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Latest News, News \n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Morgan accuses Golding of hypocrisy over failure to act against Dennis Gordon \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Government Senator Marlon Morgan has accused People’s National Party (PNP) President Mark Golding over what he described as a prolonged failure to remove Dennis Gordon from Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and to secure his resignation as PNP Region 3 chairman.\n\nIn a statement, Morgan said Golding’s inaction undermines his public claims of being a defender of transparency, accountability and probity.\n\nMorgan’s comments followed media reports that JACDEN, a company owned by Gordon, benefited from the University Hospital of the West Indies’ (UHWI) inappropriate use of its tax exemption status to import 12 dialysis machines.\n\nAccording to a report by the auditor general, the UHWI’s use of its tax exemption breached customs laws and effectively resulted in a $10-million tax waiver being granted to JACDEN.\n\nSenator Morgan says Golding’s evasive answers at a recent PNP media conference regarding the JACDEN/Dennis Gordon/Tax Exemption saga are unacceptable and show that Golding is hypocritical when he claims to believe in principles of accountability and transparency.\n\nMorgan says Golding should be reminded of his bold proclamation on the 2025 campaign trail when he stated that he is against actions which deprive Jamaica of valuable tax dollars but make a few cronies with political connections richer instead of benefiting the people.\n\nSenator Morgan added that Golding’s failure to act by removing Gordon from the PAC and securing his resignation as PNP Region 3 chairman, despite the issue being in the public domain for several weeks, shows that he cannot be taken seriously when he speaks on issues of probity, accountability, and transparency.\n\nAccording to Senator Morgan, even if Golding were to act now concerning the Dennis Gordon/JACDEN scandal, it would be too little too late, as his hesitation has already confirmed that he takes positions on national issues based on political opportunism and not principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Government Senator Marlon

He may be Mr Modi’s friend, but why is he announcing India’s policies on social media while the Prime Minister maintains silence? What deal has been struck behind closed doors, and why is it being hidden from the nation?” the AAP leader asked.Dhaliwal warned that under this deal, the BJP is preparing to open India’s doors for American agricultural goods at zero tax, which will destroy Indian farmers by flooding the market with cheaper imported products. “This is not trade. This is surrender. This is BJP’s plan to finish the agriculture sector in India so that their capitalist friends can profit,” Dhaliwal said.Dhaliwal reminded that farmer unions and several Chief Ministers had earlier warned the Centre that if any agreement is made with the US, agriculture must be kept out because Indian farming is already in deep crisis. “But BJP is again trying to bring the same ‘black farm laws’ back through the back door,” he said.Dhaliwal also raised alarm over the health and food safety risks of chemical-heavy American produce and warned that the deal could also force India to stop purchasing oil from Russia and shift to costlier imports from the US, leading to massive inflation. “When fuel becomes expensive, everything becomes expensive. This deal will hit every household,” he stated.Dhaliwal also cornered the BJP’s Punjab leadership, asking why they are maintaining a criminal silence on an issue that directly threatens the state’s backbone - agriculture. The AAP spokesperson questioned whether BJP leaders in Punjab dare to tell farmers where they will go once American wheat, maize, soyabean, cotton, dairy, fish, meat, and other products enter India at near-zero tax and destroy local markets. “Punjab is a farming state. If this deal is implemented, what will happen to our wheat belt, our cotton belt, our dairy farmers, and our own fish markets? BJP Punjab leaders must answer, where will our farmers go, where will our agriculture go, and what future will be left for Punjab?” the spokesperson asked.MLA Dhaliwal demanded that PM Modi immediately disclose the full agreement, including all terms and conditions, in the Lok Sabha and to the people of India.Dhaliwal declared AAP will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with farmers and will fight this “anti-farmer, anti-Punjab, anti-India” deal both inside Parliament and on the streets until it is scrapped. “Punjab is the backbone of India’s agriculture. If this deal is implemented, Punjab will be devastated. AAP will not allow BJP to sell India’s farmers for political friendships and corporate profits,” the party asserted.","summary":"Addressing a press conference in Chandigarh on Wednesday, AAP Punjab Chief Spokesperson Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said it is shocking and humiliating that when the issue concerns India’s future and the livelihood of over 80 crore people, the details are not being shared by the Prime Minister in Parliament, but are instead being revealed through Trump’s tweets.","url":"https://zeenews.india.com/india/dhaliwal-corners-bjp-punjab-where-will-punjab-s-farmers-go-when-this-deal-destroys-our-markets-3013861.html","image":"https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2026/02/05/1900925-article-gallery-3.jpg?im=Resize=(1200,900)","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:54:51","author":"Last Updated,Zee News","authors":["Last Updated","Zee News"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":399491840,"title":"Trending World","text":"Ryan Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September of 2024. \n\nRouth, 59, was found guilty last year of trying to kill Trump, then still a presidential candidate, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. \n\nA US Secret Service agent in the area spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired at Routh, who then fled the scene. He was arrested nearby. \n\nIn a sentencing memorandum, Judge Aileen Cannon said Routh's crimes \"undeniably warrant a life sentence\".\n\n\"[H]e took steps over the course of months to assassinate a major Presidential candidate, demonstrated the will to kill anybody in the way, and has since expressed neither regret nor remorse to his victims,\" she wrote. \n\nRouth's lawyer, Martin Ross, said they would be appealing the case. \n\nRouth pleaded not guilty and elected to represent himself during the trial, which began on 8 September. \n\nA native of North Carolina who lived in Hawaii prior to his arrest, Routh repeatedly acted erratically during the court proceedings, including challenging Trump to a game of golf and making references to Adolf Hitler and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n\nAfter a jury found him guilty, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before US marshals quickly escorted him out of the courtroom. \n\nWhile Routh is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point during the incident, federal agents told jurors they later recovered a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and an extended magazine in the spot where he had been hiding. \n\nAdditionally, jurors were told that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was likely to appear, as well as a note for a friend which described the incident as \"an assassination attempt\". \n\nIn his closing statement during the trial, Routh spoke in the third person and touched on a wide variety of unrelated topics, including US history, the Russia-Ukraine war and his intention to buy a boat - prompting the judge to repeatedly interrupt him and send the jury away. \n\nThe lead prosecutor in the case, John Shipley, said that a \"mountain of evidence\" was presented which points to \"how close he got to actually pulling this off\". \n\nThe incident in Florida was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. \n\nThat shooting left one person dead and several wounded, including Trump. \n\nThe shooter, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was killed by officers at the scene.","url":"https://www.classfmonline.com/world/Man-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-2024-attempt-on-Trump-s-life-70589","image":"https://cdn.classfmonline.com/imagelib/thumbs/22759120.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:54:43","author":"Bbc.com","authors":["Bbc.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":399446626,"title":"Vaz rejects auditor general’s procurement findings, defends StarLink acquisition after Hurricane Melissa","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister of Energy, Telecommunications and Transport, Daryl Vaz (JIS Photo) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nFebruary 4, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Vaz rejects auditor general’s procurement findings, defends StarLink acquisition after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Energy and Telecommunications Minister Daryl Vaz has rejected the auditor general’s findings that he breached procurement rules in the acquisition of StarLink satellite devices following the devastation caused by Category 5 Hurricane Melissa.\n\nHurricane Melissa made landfall on October 28, 2025.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Vaz said any suggestion of wrongdoing was unfounded and failed to take into account the extreme emergency conditions that existed after the hurricane destroyed telecommunications connectivity across several parts of the island.\n\nVaz said catastrophic damage to Jamaica’s physical and digital infrastructure left multiple parishes, particularly in western Jamaica, without communication, while Government ministers and agencies received hundreds of messages from citizens desperate to contact loved ones.\n\nHe dismissed as “uninformed and grossly inaccurate” the auditor general’s claim that his involvement breached Section 20 of the Public Procurement Act, 2015, which assigns sole responsibility for procurement to the head of the procuring entity. According to Vaz, all actions taken were consistent with the “Guidance Note on the Acquisition of Goods, Services and Works in the Situation of Emergency or Extreme Urgency” issued by the Office of Public Procurement Policy.\n\nThe minister said the circumstances clearly met the requirements for employing emergency procurement procedures, citing both the existence of a genuine emergency and the necessity of the procurement activity. He noted that the guidelines allow, subject to fiscal responsibility considerations, for procurements in emergency situations to be approved by the head of a procuring entity regardless of value or procurement method.\n\nVaz explained that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Melissa, StarLink was the only reliable source of connectivity, leading to a surge in demand that quickly exhausted local supplies. He said households, businesses, government services, emergency responders, disaster response teams, security forces and the financial sector were all simultaneously seeking access to the devices.\n\nHe further noted that Jamaica had received a donation of StarLink devices for emergency response, but that these were rapidly depleted as demand continued to increase, including within the local telecommunications sector itself.\n\nAccording to Vaz, the procurement of additional devices was driven by the urgent need to address a critical communication void that was hampering rescue and recovery efforts in the worst-affected parishes. He said an immediate solution was essential to support relief operations and mitigate public panic.\n\nActing in his capacity as co-chair of the Relief and Recovery Oversight Committee, Vaz said he took the decision to ensure that the Government could secure the available devices quickly and distribute them to state agencies and recovery teams. He said the devices were procured through the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management.\n\n“The procurement of the devices was possible as a result of the swift and decisive actions taken, and I make no apologies for this,” Vaz said, adding that if even one life was saved or one family rescued as a result, the decision would have been justified.\n\nThe minister also accused the Opposition of being disingenuous, saying its criticism was an attempt to seek relevance. He claimed that Opposition members, including senior figures in the People’s National Party (PNP), had requested and received the same StarLink devices during the crisis.\n\nVaz said councillors and members of parliament in affected areas were recipients of the procured devices, including in response to a request from the leader of the Opposition. He argued that the accountability being demanded should therefore extend to the devices received by Opposition members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Energy and Telecommunications Minister Daryl Vaz Hurricane Melissa STarlink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man sentenced to life in prison for plotting to kill Trump in 2024 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, Jamaica (AFP) — A man who plotted to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in September 2024, two months before th... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Paulwell demands transparency after Vaz flagged for breaching procurement rules \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The People’s National Party (PNP) has raised concerns about transparency and accountability following reports that Energy and Tele... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ex-Klansman members expected to testify against Tesha Miller, co-accused \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica – Two former Klansman members are set to testify as star witnesses for the Crown in the trial of alleged gang leader Tesha Miller an... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Struggling Cavalier SC host Mt Pleasant in rescheduled JPL game \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Defending champions Cavalier SC will host Mount Pleasant FA in a rescheduled Jamaica Premier League (JPL) second round game at Sta... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NET celebrates 16 years of rebuilding and reaffirming partnerships for national impact \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The National Education Trust (NET), a registered charitable organisation and an agency of the Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man denied bail in WhatsApp malicious communication case \n\n\n\n\n BY DANA MALCOLM Observer online reporter malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A foreign national who allegedly sent threats that he had put a “hit” on his landlord's daughter was remanded in custody when he a... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tropical Battery seeks extension for audited financial statements \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 4, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Tropical Battery Company Limited has requested an extension to file its audited financial statements for the year ended September ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without medicine, she needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.'\n\nGuthrie - surrounded by her sister Annie and brother Camron - then directly addressed her mother's possible captors. \n\n'We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family, we are doing everything that we can,' Guthrie said. \n\nGuthrie then said to the potential kidnappers that 'we are ready to talk' but wanted proof that they weren't potentially using fraudulent images of her. \n\n'We live in a world where voices and images and images are easily manipulated. We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us,' she said, holding back tears.\n\nGuthrie then attempted to speak to her 84-year-old mother. \n\n'Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter, Nancy.'\n\n'We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you. Everyone is looking for you, mommy, everywhere. We will not rest, your children will not rest until we are together again. \n\n'We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you, mom.'\n\nAnnie and Camron Guthrie then echo their sister's words: 'We love you, mom. Stay strong.' \n\nThe video was simply captioned: 'Bring her home.' \n\nCops said on Tuesday that they had turned the $1 million adobe-style house back over to the Guthrie family, but the FBI had descended Wednesday.\n\nPolice have previously been investigating the possibility that a ransom demand has been made. \n\nCNN legal analyst Andrew McCabe said in response to the video that it appeared unclear whether the Guthries had a legitimate offer.\n\n'I feel like this is a fairly strong signal that they do NOT believe that they've had a legitimate ransom demand yet... This, to me, reads like an effort to establish a line of communication,' he said. \n\nThe FBI descended on the Tucson home on Wednesday as law enforcement efforts were stepped up dramatically in the search for the missing retiree.\n\nA pickup truck from the Pima County Sherriff's Department arrived at Nancy's home, along with two carloads of FBI investigators. The house has since been taped off, and agents were still inside as of 5.30pm local time.\n\nK-9 units were also spotted combing the inside, according to Fox News.\n\nMeanwhile, a second pair of investigators were at the home of Savannah Guthrie’s sister Annie. The detectives were seen collecting what looked like a tripod and lights from their car before going back inside.\n\nOfficers were previously spotted at the house, where the Today Show anchor is believed to be holed up, on Tuesday. \n\nWednesday's visit came shortly after a detective from an online pedophile unit showed up to talk to the Guthrie family.\n\nSeen outside the house in Daily Mail photos, the man was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force badge.\n\nThe FBI affiliate specializes in combating online grooming and technology enabled child abuse. \n\nThe uptick in activity comes shortly after a source told a local ABC News affiliate that the FBI is rushing in outside experts - including hostage negotiation specialists.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the case had been handled entirely by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department who called in extra help after realizing the devout grandmother had been abducted.\n\nSigns of a struggle can still be seen at her home, with her Ring doorbell removed and a splatter of blood by the entrance door.\n\nThe 84-year-old mother-of-three lives alone at the house in the affluent Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where authorities found her phone, wallet and car following her mysterious disappearance on January 31.\n\nAn Apple Watch was also found inside the property, which investigators say stopped syncing with her pacemaker at around 2am - suggesting she was taken from her home at around that time.\n\nOfficers are now looking into Savannah's superfans who have piled her with gifts and mail before her mother was abducted, the Daily Mail revealed earlier on Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators specifically asked NBC whether there were any troubling fan interactions that could be relevant to the case, a senior source claimed.\n\nNo suspect has been identified and police insist there is no danger to the wider public. \n\nHowever, investigators have not ruled out that Nancy may have been targeted because she is the mother of the famous Today show host.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Pima County Sheriff's Department is looking into the possibility that Nancy's kidnapping may be linked to a trespassing case in January, TMZ reports. \n\nIn that case, one of her neighbors told authorities he noticed a suspicious person outside of his own home. \n\nBut when the unidentified lurker triggered a motion sensor, causing floodlights to switch on, he fled the scene and witnesses were unable to provide a description of the suspect.\n\nPolice are now going door-to-door collecting security camera footage from neighbors as they attempt to identify a suspect and are searching for a vehicle of interest, a law enforcement source said.\n\nThey are also investigating the possibility that a ransom demand has been made.\n\nDespite the lack of answers, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has faith that Nancy is still alive.\n\n'We have nothing else to go on but the belief that she is here,' he said in an interview with NBC’s Liz Kreutz. 'She's present. She's alive, and we want to save her.'\n\nHe noted that his department is taking all tips and leads very seriously.\n\n'The leads we’ve got coming in are critical to us. They’re valuable, and we’re sharing those with the FBI and others,' Nanos said.\n\nTo aid in the investigation, President Donald Trump announced he was allocating additional federal support for the search.\n\nHe said on Tuesday he planned to call Savannah, noting that his thoughts were with the news anchor amid the 'terrible' situation.\n\n'I'm going to call her later on, I think it's a terrible thing,' Trump said. 'Very unusual situation, but we're going to find out.'\n\nThen, on Wednesday, the president made good on his promise, NBC News anchor Tom Llamas reported on air.\n\nHe said that Trump took the moment to 'offer words of support for her and her family as they search for her mother.'\n\nAuthorities are expected to provide another update into the investigation on Thursday. \n\nThis is a developing story.","summary":"Savannah Guthrie demanded proof that her missing mother Nancy is alive in a heartbreaking new video.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15529633/Savannah-Guthrie-message-missing-mom-Nancy-search-Arizona.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/05/01/106119499-0-image-m-26_1770256286023.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:49:26","author":"Editor,Ruth Styles,Stephen M.

Im grateful to our Omani brothers for making all the necessary arrangements, he wrote on X.White House officials confirmed to news agencies that the meeting would take place in Oman on Friday. Earlier this week, officials said the meeting would likely happen in Turkey.Disagreements about the agenda for the talksDespite the confirmation of the talks, there was no indication that the sides had found common ground on the agenda.Iran has pushed to restrict the negotiations to discussing its long-running nuclear dispute with Western countries.However, on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio presented a different view, telling reporters, If the Iranians want to meet, were ready.He added that talks would have to include Irans ballistic missile program, its support for armed proxy groups in the Middle East, and its treatment of its own people, in addition to nuclear issues.Meanwhile, a senior Iranian official told the Reuters news agency that Irans missile program was off the table. Another senior Iranian official said that Tehran would welcome negotiations over the nuclear dispute, but US insistence on addressing non-nuclear issues could jeopardize the talks.Trump continues to pile pressure on IranAmid the uncertainties of the talks preparations, US President Donald Trump continued to up the pressure on Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.I would say he should be very worried, Trump said in an interview with US broadcaster NBC News.According to Trump, Iran was planning a new nuclear facility in response to US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites during Israels war with the Islamic Republic in June.They were thinking about starting a new site in a different part of the country, Trump told NBC. We found out about it, I said, You do that, were going to do very bad things to you.In recent weeks, Trump has significantly increased the US military presence in the region and has refused to rule out new military action.","url":"https://www.oneindia.com/international/us-iran-to-hold-talks-in-oman-on-friday-7988675.html?ref_source=OI-EN&ref_medium=Home-Page&ref_campaign=News-Cards","image":"https://imagesvs.oneindia.com/img/2026/02/dw_20260205061511_75723382_403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:45:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":399497832,"title":"Cat fight breaks out over Karl Lagerfeld's €200m fortune!

Email lettice.bromovsky@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LETTICE BROMOVSKY, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:01:13 GMT, 5 February 2026 |Updated:01:44 GMT, 5 February 2026 \n\nKarl Lagerfeld famously had a soft spot for just one member of his inner circle – his pampered Birman cat Choupette, who was earmarked to enjoy a fortune of around $1.5million after the fashion icon's death.\nThe late designer, who died from cancer in 2019 aged 85, made detailed plans during his lifetime to ensure his feline companion would continue living in luxury, including setting aside a substantial sum of money and a house with a garden under the care of his former housekeeper Françoise Caçote.\nWhile Choupette's extravagant lifestyle is unlikely to be disrupted, the rest of Lagerfeld's €200million estate has now become the focus of a fresh legal battle – seven years after his death.\nIt has emerged that his will, finalised in April 2016, is being challenged by an unknown claimant, opening the door for the designer's nieces and nephews to potentially inherit a share of his vast fortune after initially being cut out entirely.\nUnder the terms of the will, Lagerfeld left the bulk of his wealth to what he once described as his 'real family': his long-time assistant Sébastien Jondeau, his godson Hudson Kroenig – who was just 11 when the designer died – and male models Brad Kroenig and Baptiste Giabiconi.\nGerman media reported this week that Christian Boisson, the executor of the will, has written to Lagerfeld's surviving relatives to inform them of the legal contestation. \nIf the will were to be annulled under French inheritance law, the estate would instead be divided among his next of kin.\n\nThe most common method to leave money for pets is to give it to a new caretaker, a foundation designed to care for the pet, or a nonprofit \n\nSebastien Jondeau, Karl Lagerfeld and Baptiste Giabiconi German Vogue 30-year anniversary party in Berlin 2009\n\nKarl Lagerfeld's cat Choupette (pictured together in 2016) was left $1.5million by the late designer, who passed away in 2019 at the age of 85\nLagerfeld had no children, and both of his sisters, Christiane and Thea, died before him. Any ruling in favour of blood relatives would therefore benefit their children.\nChristiane Lagerfeld emigrated to the United States in the 1950s, later settling in Connecticut, where she raised four children. \nOne son, Karl, died aged 18 in a motorbike crash, while her surviving children – Paul and Roger Johnson and Caroline Wilcox – could now stand to inherit. \nDespite the distance between them, Lagerfeld once designed Wilcox's wedding dress and had it flown to the US on Concorde in 1992.\nHowever, family ties were strained. Lagerfeld had not seen Christiane since 1974, and none of his American relatives were invited when his legacy was celebrated as the theme of the 2023 Met Gala in New York. Roger Johnson, now a long-haul truck driver, has previously suggested he would be unlikely to accept any inheritance, saying they had no meaningful relationship.\nHis half-sister Thea's daughter, Thoma Gräfin von der Schulenburg, aged 82, is also among the potential beneficiaries should the will be overturned.\nHis devotion to Choupette was well known. Lagerfeld once described the cat as living like a 'kept woman', dining with him at the table, sleeping under pillows and even using an iPad. \n\nJoin the debate\nWho SHOULD inherit Karl Lagerfeld’s €200m fortune loyal humans or iconic cat Choupette?Comment now\n\nAs her Instagram already shows, she travels in style a $2,000 Louis Vuitton carrier - a far cry from the $20 standard mesh carrier from Amazon - and flies on marvelous private jets, which her haters could only dream of\n\nHudson Kroenig and Brad Kroenig on the catwalk of the Chanel fashion show in 2016\n\nDrowning in legal paperwork, Choupette? In France, where Choupette resides - as well as in the US and UK - pets are considered property, and therefore, cannot inherit a cent\nDuring his lifetime, he ensured arrangements were in place for her care, meaning the current dispute is unlikely to affect her.\nChoupette's lavish lifestyle has long fascinated fans, with the Instagram-famous cat travelling by private jet, posing with luxury carriers and skipping high-profile events such as the Met Gala in favour of naps at home.\nThe will challenge is not the only cloud hanging over Lagerfeld's estate - tax authorities are also pursuing an investigation amid claims that his main residence was Paris rather than Monaco, potentially leaving an unpaid bill of between €20million and €40million.\nKarl Lagerfeld\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCat fight breaks out over Karl Lagerfeld's €200m fortune!

': Kremlin on Trump's claims India will stop buying Russian oil","text":"NEW DELHI: India is free to purchase crude oil from any supplier and its efforts to diversify energy imports are not new, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, rejecting suggestions that New Delhi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil.Responding to claims by US President Donald Trump that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to halt Russian oil purchases and shift to buying crude from the United States and possibly Venezuela, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia saw nothing unusual in India’s position.\"We, along with all other international energy experts, are well aware that Russia is not the only supplier of oil and petroleum products to India. India has always purchased these products from other countries. Therefore, we see nothing new here,\" Peskov said.Peskov added that Russia had not received any official communication from India on stopping imports of Russian oil. He had made a similar remark a day earlier.Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova also defended the energy trade between the two countries, describing it as mutually beneficial.\"We remain convinced that India's purchase of Russian hydrocarbons is beneficial to both countries and contributes to maintaining stability in the international energy market. We are ready to continue close cooperation in this area with our partners in India,\" Zakharova said at a press briefing.Private Kommersant FM business radio noted that while Trump spoke of an agreement on Russian oil, Prime Minister Modi did not mention any such commitment.Energy expert Igor Yushkov of the National Energy Security Fund said Indian refiners would find it difficult to completely replace Russian crude with US supplies.\"The American shale oil they export is light grades, similar to gas condensate. Russia, on the other hand, supplies relatively heavy, sulfur-rich Urals. This means India will need to blend US crude with other grades, which incurs additional costs, meaning a simple substitution won't be possible,\" he said.Yushkov said Russia currently exports between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels per day to India, a volume the US would struggle to match.\"Russia typically exports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels per day to the country. America won't be able to cover that volume. So, one gets the sense that Trump is simply trying to show that he won these trade negotiations and the deal was concluded entirely in line with US demands,\" he said.Recalling the impact of earlier supply shifts, Yushkov said Russia’s pivot to the Indian market in 2022, after losing access to European and American buyers, had led to a production cut of 1 million barrels per day, pushing global oil prices to $120 per barrel and driving US gasoline and diesel prices to record highs.Trump last year imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian goods, among the highest globally, including a 25 per cent levy linked to India’s purchases of Russian energy.India imports around 88 per cent of its crude oil needs. Russian oil accounted for just 0.2 per cent of India’s crude imports until 2021, but India became the largest buyer of discounted Russian crude after Western nations distanced themselves from Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.According to data from real-time analytics firm Kpler, India’s imports of Russian crude fell to about 1.1 million barrels per day in the first three weeks of January, down from an average of 1.21 million barrels per day in the previous month and over 2 million barrels per day in mid-2025.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nothing-new-new-delhi-free-to-kremlin-on-trumps-claims-india-will-stop-buying-russian-oil/articleshow/127921522.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-127921541/127921541.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:38:37","author":"Toi Business Desk","authors":["Toi Business Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.065},{"id":399496156,"title":"San Bernardino man, shot at by immigration agents, testifies before Congress","text":"Martin Rascon was riding in his brother-in-law’s pickup truck on Aug. 16, on the way back from an errand, when the vehicle stopped. Assuming they stopped at a light or for traffic, the San Bernardino resident looked up from his phone.\n\n“But to my surprise, I was instead met with four men in face masks, sunglasses and baseball caps, and guns drawn, pointed straight at us, walking straight toward our car,” Rascon told members of Congress Wednesday, Feb. 3.\n\nRascon spoke publicly for the first time this week, at a forum hosted by Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, about the incident in which agents smashed the vehicle’s windows and fired at the driver, Francisco Longoria, Rascon’s now-father-in-law.\n\n“Seconds after they started pounding on the windows, one of the men broke the driver’s side window, punched Francisco in the face, and began reaching into the car,” said Rascon, 23, a U.S. citizen. “At the same time, a man on the other side of the car broke the passenger window, where Jonathan was sitting, and began reaching into the vehicle.”\n\nFrancisco Longoria then drove “through the only open pathway down the street, hoping to be driving toward safety,” Rascon said. “We were instead met with gunfire. After we had passed the men, one of the four men attempted to murder us after we passed by. He fired and made contact with the passenger side of our car multiple times.”\n\nPopping noises can be heard over the sound of squealing tires in Rascon’s video, which was posted on Instagram shortly after the incident took place by the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.\n\n“Any one of those bullets could have killed me or two people that I love,” Rascon said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security later said the stop was part of a targeted enforcement operation. The department alleged Longoria drove at Customs and Border Patrol officers, striking two of them.\n\n“In response to this violent act, a CBP officer was forced to discharge his firearm in self-defense,” the department’s statement reads.\n\nSan Bernardino Police Department records, obtained by the Southern California News Group through a California Public Records Act request, contradict ICE’s statement.\n\nSan Bernardino police officers were dispatched at 8:51 a.m. to Acacia Avenue and Baseline Street to investigate reports of shots fired. The incident report refers to the men who stopped Longoria as U.S. Marshals.\n\n“MARSHALL WAS NOT STRUCK,” an update at 9:07 a.m. reads. “MED AID WILL BE FOR A SCRAPE TO THE ARM.”\n\nImmigration officers later went to Longoria’s house on the 1000 block of Mountain View Avenue, triggering an hours-long standoff with neighbors as they tried to get him and his family to go outside.\n\n“Those four men were asked to identify who they were looking for, but they had zero idea as to who they were even targeting,” Rascon told the members of Congress Wednesday.\n\nMore than two dozen San Bernardino police officers responded to the stand-off shortly before 2 p.m., according to the incident report.\n\n“HOSTILE CROWD — NEED TO START PUSHING CROWD PAST CAUTION TAPE,” an update at 2:04 p.m. reads.\n\nPepper spray was “deployed” at 3:34 p.m.\n\nThe immigration officers left after 4 p.m. without detaining Longoria or anyone in his family. Two people were arrested by the police department in connection with crowd control issues, according to the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.\n\nSan Bernardino police critcized DHS, saying the agency acted “recklessly” because Longoria wasn’t taken into custody.\n\nUnder California law, state and local law enforcement are limited in how they can interact with federal immigration efforts. The California Values Act, also known as Senate Bill 54, was signed into law in 2017 by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from making resources available to federal immigration enforcement agencies, except to prevent violence. In June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge brought against the law by the first Trump administration.\n\nTwelve days later, ICE agents returned to Longoria’s house at 4 a.m. Aug. 28. They had a warrant for assault on a federal officer for allegedly striking ICE officers with his truck when he drove away on Aug. 16.\n\n“The men breached our front doors by breaking the locks and yelling that we needed to come out of the house with our hands up,” Rascon said.\n\nLongoria appeared in a Riverside courtroom 10 hours later, where a judge dismissed charges he assaulted a federal officer during the Aug. 16 incident for lack of evidence. ICE officials took him into custody after the hearing.\n\nLongoria has lived in the United States for 23 years, according to his attorneys, but has repeatedly had applications for citizenship denied. ICE has called him a “criminal illegal alien,” but his country of origin has not been shared publicly.\n\n“I still look over my shoulder and so does the rest of my family,” Rascon said.\n\nOthers who have been the target of force by ICE during President Donald Trump‘s immigration crackdown also spoke during Wednesday’s forum. They included Luke and Brett Ganger, the brothers of Minneapolis woman Renee Good. Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent on Jan. 7. Marimar Martinez, who was shot five times by a Border Patrol agent in Chicago, and Aliya Rahman, a Minneapolis resident who was dragged out of her car by immigration agents, also spoke.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has repeatedly said it’s targeting “the worst of the worst” — including terrorists, gang members and violent criminals — in the immigration sweeps that began soon after his second inauguration last year, ICE’s own data says something different.\n\nAccording to ICE data, as of Jan. 8, there are 6,280 people in ICE’s seven detention centers in California. The agency categorizes 28% of them as criminals and 18% are categorized as “Threat Level 1,” the highest level, based on the severity of their “criminality” and how recently it occurred. The agency defines detainees as criminals if they have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges.\n\nLast month, Garcia, the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, vowed to impeach U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem if she isn’t fired or doesn’t resign.\n\nMore on immigration in the Inland Empire\n\nJudge orders halt to indiscriminate immigration stops, arrests in California\nWho’s in ICE detention in California?

As part of his visit to the US, the EAM also met with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The EAM's visit coincides with the agreement between two of the World's largest democracies on a trade deal. The Minister says that a detailed account of the negotiations is now underway. The two sides are expected to issue a joint statement on the exact tenets of the deal soon.Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the Critical Minerals meet in Washington DC EAM Jaishankar said, \"It was not with me, because that is being handled by Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal (the negotiations on the trade deal). The Prime Minister and the US President had a conversation; some announcements came out of it. Thereafter, a detailing of the trade negotiations is underway as we speak.\"The EAM further elaborated that Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal would detail the timelines on the formal announcement of the deal. \"It is hard for me to say, and the Commerce Minister would know it better, because he is in direct engagement with the US Trade Representative,\" he said. Earlier, speaking in Parliament, Piyush Goyal highlighted that both countries have finalised several areas of a bilateral trade agreement following intensive negotiations.Goyal informed the House that both sides will now work to complete technical processes and finalise paperwork to expeditiously unlock the potential of the deal. He described the framework as a landmark step in strengthening bilateral relations and advancing the vision of a developed India by 2047.He added that the 18 per cent rate announced by US President Donald Trump is lower than tariffs imposed on several competing countries, which enhances India's export competitiveness.In the statement delivered to the House, Goyal noted that the negotiating teams for both nations engaged over the last year to conclude a balanced and mutually beneficial agreement. He stated that the discussions aimed to safeguard critical and sensitive sectors in their respective economies.The Minister emphasised that the interests of India's agriculture and dairy sectors remain protected under the new framework.\"The US side, too, had areas that were sensitive from its point of view. Following a nearly year-long discussion spread over many rounds, the two negotiating teams were able to narrow their differences significantly and finalise several areas of the bilateral trade agreement,\" Goyal said.Meanwhile, in the US, the EAM also underlined the importance of the Critical Minerals ministerial meet that he was part of.\"It was a very good discussion. Critical minerals are a very important subject. The US has been partnering up for some years. Today, they launched a new initiative called FORGE, which we have supported. It's a kind of successor to the Mineral Security Partnership. Overall, to me, it was a good meeting, very productive, very outcome-oriented, and very businesslike, and that was the core reason I came,\" he said.In his address to the minesterial Jaishankar said that \"excessive concentration\" in critical mineral supply chains poses a major global risk and called for structured international cooperation to \"de-risk\" them, as India deepens engagement with the US-led framework on strategic minerals.

He described the meetings as frank and productive.\n\nZeldin, Loeffler, and other federal officials brought a sense of leadership and commitment to the fire zone that has been sorely lacking.\n\nThe real work is just beginning.

Will Asia-Pacific sign up?","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s call for middle powers to band together amid a fragmenting world order is a vision analysts say appeals to many Asian nations, but lacks a blueprint to bring them all together.\nSpeaking in Switzerland last month, Carney urged mid-sized and smaller countries to unite against the economic coercion of great powers, warning that nations failing to act collectively risked being “on the menu” rather than “at the table”, in a thinly veiled rebuke of the United States.\nHis speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20 drew a standing ovation, with Carney calling for a “third path with impact” and asserting that middle powers should push back against the use of tariffs and supply chain pressure as tools of geopolitical leverage.\nThe subtext was unmistakable: US President Donald Trump has imposed escalating tariffs on Canadian goods, derided Carney as the country’s “governor”, and openly suggested absorbing Canada as America’s 51st state.\n\n‘Devil in the details’\nDespite the strong reception to Carney’s Davos speech, analysts say the Asia-Pacific’s middle powers – from Japan and South Korea to Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia – face political realities, divergent interests and security dependencies on Washington or Beijing that make unified action unlikely.\nRobert Patman, an international relations professor at New Zealand’s University of Otago, called Carney’s speech “defiant and constructive”, adding that it resonated precisely because of waning confidence in the major powers’ capacity to lead on transboundary challenges such as climate change and pandemics.\n“Carney’s message struck a chord because he was calling for the ‘rise of the rest’ at a time when the world is experiencing a vacuum in global leadership,” he said.\nBut countries like New Zealand were unlikely to respond “energetically”, Patman said, given that several minor parties in its governing coalition lean towards the “anti-woke” stance of the Trump administration.\nThe opposition Labour Party, by contrast, hailed Carney’s proposal as a possible template for safeguarding free trade and a rules-based order, in an implicit critique of Washington’s increasing use of unilateral pressure.\nIn Indonesia, Yohanes Sulaiman of Jenderal Achmad Yani University said Jakarta shared the spirit of Carney’s message but questioned its feasibility.\n“The devil is in the details,” said the associate professor of international relations, comparing the suggested association to the Cold War-era Non-Aligned Movement that he said “went nowhere” because its members had little in common beyond avoiding superpower rivalry.\n“I don’t think anyone will follow suit,” Yohanes said. “How will this new association position itself against the US, with a vindictive Trump on the helm, and China or Russia?”\n\nRegional realities\nAnalysts say Australia’s position highlights the fundamental tension in Carney’s vision. Despite its self-identification as a middle power, Canberra remains tethered through the Anzus alliance as well as the Aukus security pact between it, the US and UK.\n“This makes Australia vulnerable to the whims of an increasingly erratic and unreliable US,” said Allan Patience, an honorary fellow at the University of Melbourne’s School of Social and Political Sciences.\nCarney’s idea was “interesting”, Patience said, but Canberra could not embrace it without asserting more independence from US influence.\nStill, he argued that the Canadian leader’s proposal for a loose coalition of like-minded states capable of resisting “the aggressive demands of Trump” was “badly needed”.\n“Australia could be part of such an alliance if it disentangles itself from the US alliance,” Patience said.\nElsewhere, Quah Say Jye, a doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge specialising in politics and international relations, said most traditional middle powers agreed with Carney’s diagnosis of global instability.\n“But it’s different to say that they can form a coherent bloc,” he said, noting that Japan and South Korea, for example, still heavily depended on US security guarantees and Carney’s proposal also offered little to solve genuinely global issues such as climate change.\nBoard of Peace debate\nThe debate over Trump’s newly announced “Board of Peace” – originally conceived to oversee Gaza’s future following October’s ceasefire announcement – further illustrates the challenge of middle power alignment.\nWhile many Western nations and Asia-Pacific powers, including New Zealand, turned down invitations to join, Indonesia accepted and Australia has yet to declare its position.\nQuah said the board had essentially become an informal test of international credibility, with membership sending mixed signals.\n“Joining looks like capitulation to Trump and a rejection of Carney’s vision,” he said.\nPatman said that New Zealand’s hesitation was rooted in long-standing principles. Wellington has consistently supported a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation since the Oslo Accords of 1993.\nBy contrast, Yohanes said Indonesia’s participation reflected President Prabowo Subianto’s personal diplomatic ambitions “to make Indonesia internationally relevant”.\n\nAustralia’s “noticeably weak” response, meanwhile, was characteristic of it “keeping its head down for fear of provoking a backlash from Trump”, Patience said.\n“This is very much out of step with Carney’s imagining of a new world order,” he added. “It is disappointing that Australia cannot see the merit in backing Carney and encouraging him to strengthen his idea.”\nQuah cautioned against reading too much into the symbolism of participation, however.\nJudging alignments by Board of Peace membership was too simplistic, he said, pointing to Finnish President Alexander Stubb’s concept of “value-based realism”.\nUnder such a framework, which marries principled positions with pragmatic power politics, Indonesia’s choice makes sense, according to Quah.\n“It affords them a seat at the table and enables them to try to exercise some influence over the proceedings,” he said. “And it shields them from retaliation.”","summary":"Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s call for middle powers to band together amid a fragmenting world order is a vision analysts say appeals to many Asian nations, but lacks a blueprint to bring them all together.\nSpeaking in Switzerland last month, Carney urged mid-sized and smaller countries to unite against the economic coercion of great powers, warning that nations failing to act collectively risked being “on the menu” rather than “at the table”, in a thinly veiled rebuke of the United...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3342400/canada-wants-middle-power-alliance-will-asia-pacific-sign","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/02/04/a396ae21-3504-4ee4-ad58-176cddb0e7cc_ba11ac84.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:31:42","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.084},{"id":399497332,"title":"FOMO or TACO, India-US Trade Deal Back On","text":"By: Nirupama Subramanian\n\nThe dark clouds over the “most consequential relationship of the 21st century” appear to have lifted with US President Donald Trump’s announcement earlier this week that he was slashing the reciprocal trade tariff on Indian goods from 25 percent to 18 percent. Though Trump didn’t specify it, he is also reported to have dropped the 25 percent punitive tariff for India’s purchase of Russian oil. If indeed it comes off. There is plenty of pushback on the Indian side over some of its stickier details, particularly agriculture and Russia’s crude.\n\nIndian markets, anyway, have cheered up after months of gloom. It isn’t just exporters who are celebrating. The tariff rapprochement and the mention of a “trade deal” by Trump in his announcement on his Truth Social media platform have brought back faith in the US-India partnership. Advocates of the relationship are seeing the latest development as reaffirmation that the US and India can now return to the original purpose of their partnership, which is balancing China in Asia. There is talk that the postponed Delhi summit of the Quad grouping might be held this year, bringing Trump to India.\n\nThe mood in Delhi is self-congratulatory. India’s “strategic patience” is being hailed, as is the “silent treatment” Modi gave to Trump, even while officials from both sides continued to negotiate.\n\nTrump’s announcement came days after India and EU wrapped up a landmark free trade agreement. In India, the belief is widespread that the timing was not coincidental, that the India-EU deal, described as the “mother of all trade deals,” may have been shock treatment that caused a rethink in the Trump administration. After last year’s US tariff shock, India also fast-tracked and finalized trade agreements with the UK, Oman and New Zealand. It is possible the US may have had a bout of FOMO – or, in Trump’s lexicon, TACO.\n\nDid Trump have a Fear of Missing Out, or does Trump Always Chicken Out?\n\nThe good tidings on the India-US front appear to have put the stride back in Modi’s steps. His carefully cultivated vishwaguru (teacher to the world) image suffered a setback when India failed to find support even from friends during its attack on Pakistan in May 2025 after a terrible terrorist massacre in Kashmir, and Trump’s contested claims that he forced India and Pakistan into a ceasefire to prevent a nuclear showdown damaged his strongman status at home.\n\nThe morning after the tariff breakthrough, Modi tweeted a Sanskrit verse about self-confidence making everything possible. Later in the day, he told a meeting of parliamentarians of his National Democratic Alliance that India had renewed respect in the word. “The world is looking at India and is recognizing its strengths,” Modi is reported to have said at the meeting, where he also described the deal with the US as a “big decision” that would bring big benefits for India.\n\nBut is the champagne being uncorked too early? Trump’s Truth Social post also claimed that Modi had made big concessions to secure a “trade deal.” India agreed to stop buying Russian oil to end the war in Ukraine, Trump said. Second, Trump spoke of a “commitment” from Modi to “buy American” beyond the commitment to purchase more than US$500 billion of US energy, technology, agricultural, coal, and many other products. And third, Trump also said India had agreed to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers on US exports to zero.\n\nModi’s tweet thanking Trump was silent on these claims, but a prominent farmers’ association has called Trump’s asserted Indian concessions on agriculture, as a “betrayal of the people.” A social media post by US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that US agricultural exports to the massive Indian market would lift prices and “pump cash into rural America” has heightened the concern among India’s farm lobbies even more. The farmers’ association warned that US agricultural products would flood the Indian market and “devastate the entire peasantry of India”.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the government for selling of the “seat and blood” of farming by buckling under to US pressure in order to save Modi’s industrialist buddy Gautam Adani, who has been indicted in a US court on charges of bribery involving one of his firms under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nIn Delhi, the minister for Commerce Piyush Goyal, who led the trade negotiators, said the trade agreement is still being finalized, and would be ready in “weeks.” He also denied claims that India had opened its markets to US agricultural products such as corn and soya, important farm crops across India. The Prime Minister would never let down India’s farmers, Goyal said. He claimed the Indian team of negotiators had “shielded” the politically sensitive sectors of agricultural and dairy farming, while other worker-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewelry exports, which employ large numbers of workers, would benefit from the deal.\n\nGoyal’s silence is telling on Trump’s other claim of India stopping its Russian oil purchase in return for the removal of the 25 percent additional tariff that he had imposed as a “secondary sanction.”\n\nOver the past four years of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, India has justified its decision to work around international sanctions on Russia to buy Russian oil as an exercise of its strategic autonomy in its economic interests. Now Delhi must defend the opposite. If it is indeed the case that India will no longer buy oil from Russia under US pressure, the decision is bound to impact relations with Moscow. As of now, the only other statement on the subject is from the Kremlin, where deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Preskov said Moscow had not received any communication from India in this regard.\n\nA US-India joint statement, which Goyal said would be made in days, may throw more light on the actual contents of the deal. But if the concessions made by India are as sweeping as Trump claims, the opposition to it may come from within Modi’s own Hindutva family. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the BJP, is dead set against taking dictation from another country.","summary":"&#8230;If some of the murkier points can be worked out, that is","url":"https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/fomo-taco-india-usa-trade-deal-back-on","image":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0kq8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8180466-4857-4116-93c5-9f4ad44aa5ec_768x512.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:31:23","author":"Asia Sentinel","authors":["Asia Sentinel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"HK","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":399495194,"title":"Trump Suggests 'Softer Touch' Needed on Immigration","text":"MINNEAPOLIS: US President Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that a \"softer touch\" may be needed on immigration, as his administration said 700 federal officers would be pulled from Minnesota but that mass deportations would not stop. The fatal shootings of two protesters by federal officers in Minneapolis last month sparked widespread outrage in the United States and calls for an end to immigration raids in the Midwestern city, but Trump's administration has been reluctant to shift course. \"I learned that maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch. But you still have to be tough,\" Trump said in an interview with NBC's \"Nightly News\" when asked what he had learned from Minneapolis. Trump's border chief Tom Homan had earlier announced that 700 federal officers would be withdrawn from Minnesota, but said the contentious deployment would continue, with about 2,000 agents remaining after the drawdown. And in an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News later in the day, he vowed that removals of undocumented migrants would continue. \"Mass deportations are here, they're coming, we're already breaking records, and we're not going to stop,\" Homan said. - 'A step in the right direction' - The mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota -- both Democrats -- described the announcement of the pullback from the city as \"a step in the right direction,\" but called for the federal government to move faster in winding down its immigration operations in the state. Homan -- sent as a replacement to oversee the crackdown in Minneapolis as anger over the fatal shootings and the government's false accounts of them grew -- said the reduction would take effect immediately. He cited increased cooperation with local authorities. Homan said there are now \"more officers taking custody of criminal aliens directly from the jails\" rather than detaining them on the streets -- efforts that require fewer personnel. Before the launch of the high-profile crackdown in Minnesota, there were only 150 federal immigration officers in the state, he said. - 'Mass deportations' - Homan also stressed he would stay in Minneapolis -- which has become a major flashpoint in Trump's overall immigration policy -- \"until we get it all done.\" \"President Trump fully intends to achieve mass deportations during this administration, and immigration enforcement actions will continue every day throughout this country,\" Homan said. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey welcomed the reduction in federal personnel but said on X that the US immigration operation in Minneapolis -- dubbed Metro Surge -- must end \"immediately.\" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz took a similar stance, calling for a \"faster and larger drawdown of forces\" and state-led investigations into the killings of the two Minneapolis protesters. Federal agents shot and killed an unarmed woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, as she attempted to drive away from an encounter with ICE agents last month. Two weeks later, immigration officers beat and shot dead intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, also 37, as he lay pinned to the ground. Both victims were US citizens. In the NBC interview, even though Trump said that neither of the victims was an \"angel,\" he was upset about their deaths. \"I'm not happy with what happened there,\" he added. \"It should have not happened... To me it was a very sad incident, two incidents.\" At the same time, Trump threw his support behind ICE agents. \"I'm going to always be with our great people of law enforcement, ICE, police, we have to back them. If we don't back them, we don't have a country,\" the president said. The killings drew international attention and condemnation over the government's false accounts of what happened, intensifying public concern about the conduct of federal immigration operations. Following the outcry over the shootings that drew tens of thousands of demonstrators into the streets, Trump withdrew combative Customs and Border Protection commander Gregory Bovino and replaced him with the more policy-focused Homan, who then pledged to draw down the operation with conditions.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-suggests-softer-touch-needed-on-immigration-1935091","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/05/2006839-ttt.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:28:48","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":399495332,"title":"Opinion: The Ugly Truth Behind Trump Ordering Kaitlan Collins to Smile","text":"President Donald Trump snapping at CNN top reporter Kaitlan Collins for not smiling after she asked about the Epstein files was more than a clumsy deflection of a valid question. It was a worldview.\n\n“Why don’t you ever smile?” He asked her. \n\n“You don’t look very happy.”\n\nSmile, girl. Be pretty. Make me think you like me. Deliver your questions like room service, not subpoenas.\n\nTrump has never asked a male correspondent why he isn’t smiling. He didn’t say it to Jim Acosta. He didn’t say it to David Sanger. He didn’t even say it to Don Lemon. Men are allowed to look grim, severe, even hostile, while women are expected to look decorative, happy, even pleasing. Even if they’re asking about rape, corruption, and moral rot, a lady reporter must remember her lip gloss. \n\nExpecting women to grin and bear it is nothing new. When women speak with authority, they are “shrill.” When they persist, they are “scolds.” Flip the gender and men who speak with authority are “experts.” When they persist, they’re geniuses. Or at worst if a man starts to explain something obvious, it’s called “mansplaining,” which we treat like a mildly annoying dinner companion.\n\nWhat makes Trump’s jab at Collins, 33, especially grotesque is that she was asking about convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. It took more than one thousand victims—one thousand!—for America to agree that Epstein was not a misunderstood libertine with powerful friends, but a serial predator running a vertically integrated abuse operation with powerful friends. \n\nEven now, Trump’s instinct is to shrug off Epstein’s crimes and, instead, focus on the real problem: a woman asking tough questions. Yes, it’s her job, but wouldn’t Collins serve the world better if she simply stayed at home and made babies like Usha Vance? \n\nOur culture endlessly excuses men’s bad behavior. We call it “context.” We call it “complicated.” We call it “locker room talk.” Which brings us to longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia and the institutional moral vertigo now on display at CBS.\n\nAttia’s emails with Epstein, ingratiating, immature, and wildly inappropriate, are being waved away as a lapse in judgment. CBS now frames its decision to keep him on air as a brave stand against “cancel culture,” as if basic standards were some kind of authoritarian plot.\n\nBut this is not cancel culture. This is character culture.\n\nIn a recent statement, Attia described his actions in 2018 as “incredibly naive.” The man was in his forties! His statement also failed to mention that he made the choice to stay and hang out with his pal Jeffrey in Manhattan while his infant son was in an ICU thousands of miles away. (The child’s heart had stopped beating. Fortunately, Attia’s wife, a nurse, was able to revive the baby who did recover.) \n\nAttia has said that he wants to live as long as possible so he can spend meaningful time with his grandchildren. Maybe he can dispense grandfatherly wisdom such as “P---y is, indeed, low carb,” a light observation he emailed to Epstein. \n\nThe recent reveal of Attia’s behavior lost him the sponsorship of a protein bar that was also, ironically, low-carb. The makers of David Protein bars concluded, sensibly, that this was not the sort of judgment one wants attached to their brand. CBS, meanwhile, is looking the other way while positioning Attia as a martyr for free speech.\n\nIn short, men can show a lack of judgment and keep their jobs, while women can show a lack of enthusiasm and be criticized. And that’s the connective tissue to Trump and his craving for grinning gals. \n\nTrump wants a court, not a press corps. He wants obsequious cabinet members who “dear leader” him until he falls asleep in a surround-sound loop of over-the-top flattery. He wants Collins to smile. Smiles signal obedience. In a way, it’s a compliment – a step up from “Quiet, piggy.” \n\nOf course, Kaitlan Collins does not owe anyone a grin. Nor does any women connected to the Epstein files, including the victims, reporters, lawyers, and podcasters.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyPresident Donald Trump snapping at CNN top reporter Kaitlan Collins for not smiling after she asked about the Epstein files was more than a clumsy deflection of a valid question.

Darcy Tinning, 19, was accused of threatening to shoot the head of state with a pistol and kill US President Donald Trump in a January 19 post on social media platform X. His threat to Herzog included a violent remark referencing extinction, which federal prosecutors said constituted hate speech and risked inciting others with similar views. The Newtown man was arrested on Wednesday and brought before a Sydney court on Thursday. Given the Israeli president is set to arrive in Australia on Sunday, the prosecutor said the teen posed a risk to the community due to the violent nature of the threats. She noted the threat to Herzog was made amid heightened tensions after the Bondi terror attack in December. \"The current heated climate, the unrest in the community, makes the threats very serious,\" the prosecutor said. \"Unacceptable risks exist which cannot be mitigated if the defendant is released in this climate of political unrest.\" Tinning's lawyer, Brendan Green, accepted his client's comments were \"completely inappropriate\" and could result in significant jail time, but stressed they were not directed at any particular people or group. There was no real suggestion the teen would follow through on the threats, he said. Neither Tinning nor his family have any access to firearms and he does not have a history of violence, Green told the court. Israel's president was controversially invited to Australia by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese after gunmen opened fire on a Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach, killing 15 people on December 14. During the five-day trip, he will meet with survivors of the terror attack, senior Australian politicians and Jewish community leaders. Thousands of Australians are expected to take to the streets in every capital city to protest his visit, citing his culpability in Israel's bombardment and starvation of Palestinians in Gaza. Among those planning to attend in Sydney is NSW Labor backbencher Sarah Kaine, who said she was concerned about Herzog's visit. \"Given that he has signed bombs that have targeted civilians and have killed Gaza's children, I don't think it's appropriate,\" she told AAP on Thursday. \"I understand that the Jewish community is grieving but there is a large population of Palestinians in Australia who are also grieving and this is traumatic for this man to be in our country.\" Herzog has previously said Palestinians bore collective blame for Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, before later clarifying his remarks. A United Nations Human Rights Council commission of inquiry in September found the statement might reasonably have been interpreted as inciting genocide. A genocide case against Israel has been brought to the International Court of Justice, and the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his alleged responsibility for war crimes of starvation as a method of warfare.

He is reportedly the last person to have seen her.\n\nEarlier in the week, authorities had returned the $1 million adobe-style property to the Guthrie family. However, the situation took a dramatic turn when law enforcement re-entered the home on Wednesday night.\n\nThat evening, a pickup truck from the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, accompanied by two carloads of FBI agents, arrived at Nancy’s house. The property has since been secured with police tape, and as of 5:30 p.m. local time, agents remained inside conducting their investigation.\n\nFox News reports that K-9 units were also seen scouring the interior of the home, adding a new layer of urgency to the search.\n\nSimultaneously, another team of investigators visited the home of Savannah Guthrie’s sister, Annie. Witnesses observed detectives removing equipment resembling a tripod and lights from their vehicle before entering the house.\n\nOfficers were previously spotted at the house, where the Today Show anchor is believed to be holed up, on Tuesday. \n\nWednesday’s visit came shortly after a detective from an online pedophile unit showed up to talk to the Guthrie family. \n\nSeen outside the house in Daily Mail photos, the man was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force badge.\n\nThe FBI affiliate specializes in combating online grooming and technology enabled child abuse. \n\nThe uptick in activity comes shortly after a source told a local ABC News affiliate that the FBI is rushing in outside experts – including hostage negotiation specialists.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the case had been handled entirely by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department who called in extra help after realizing the devout grandmother had been abducted.\n\nSigns of a struggle can still be seen at her home, with her Ring doorbell removed and a splatter of blood by the entrance door.\n\nThe 84-year-old mother-of-three lives alone at the house in the affluent Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where authorities found her phone, wallet and car following her mysterious disappearance on January 31.\n\nAn Apple Watch was also found inside the property, which investigators say stopped syncing with her pacemaker at around 2am – suggesting she was taken from her home at around that time.\n\nOfficers are now looking into Savannah’s superfans who have piled her with gifts and mail before her mother was abducted, the Daily Mail revealed earlier on Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators specifically asked NBC whether there were any troubling fan interactions that could be relevant to the case, a senior source claimed.\n\nNo suspect has been identified and police insist there is no danger to the wider public. However, investigators have not ruled out that Nancy may have been targeted because she is the mother of the famous Today show host.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department is looking into the possibility that Nancy’s kidnapping may be linked to a trespassing case in January, TMZ reports. \n\nIn that case, one of her neighbors told authorities he noticed a suspicious person outside of his own home. \n\nBut when the unidentified lurker triggered a motion sensor, causing floodlights to switch on, he fled the scene and witnesses were unable to provide a description of the suspect.\n\nPolice are now going door-to-door collecting security camera footage from neighbors as they attempt to identify a suspect and are searching for a vehicle of interest, a law enforcement source said.\n\nThey are also investigating the possibility that a ransom demand has been made. \n\nDespite the lack of answers, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has faith that Nancy is still alive.\n\n‘We have nothing else to go on but the belief that she is here,’ he said in an interview with NBC’s Liz Kreutz. ‘She’s present. She’s alive, and we want to save her.’\n\nHe noted that his department is taking all tips and leads very seriously.\n\n‘The leads we’ve got coming in are critical to us. They’re valuable, and we’re sharing those with the FBI and others,’ Nanos said.\n\nTo aid in the investigation, President Donald Trump announced he was allocating additional federal support for the search.\n\nHe said on Tuesday he planned to call Savannah, noting that his thoughts were with the news anchor amid the ‘terrible’ situation.\n\n‘I’m going to call her later on, I think it’s a terrible thing,’ Trump said. ‘Very unusual situation, but we’re going to find out.’\n\nThen, on Wednesday, the president made good on his promise, NBC News anchor Tom Llamas reported on air.\n\nHe said that Trump took the moment to ‘offer words of support for her and her family as they search for her mother.’\n\nAuthorities are expected to provide another update into the investigation on Thursday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe FBI intensified its search efforts on Wednesday by arriving at the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Police Reinstall Crime Scene Tape at Home of Missing Nancy Guthrie first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/police-reinstall-crime-scene-tape-at-home-of-missing-nancy-guthrie/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Crime-scene-tape-goes-back-up-outside-missing-Nancy-Guthries.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:26:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.023},{"id":399497818,"title":"STEPHEN GLOVER: It's laughable to say Labour's been betrayed by Mandelson. Blair, Brown and Starmer were the ones who nurtured this monster","text":"The downfall of Peter Mandelson is an immense event in British politics. This bad, and now disgraced, man has been a key figure in the Labour Party for over 30 years.\n\nWhen he published his memoirs in 2010, he simply called them The Third Man – the suggestion being that, after Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, he was the next most important figure during Labour’s rule from 1997 to 2010.\n\nFor once in his life Mandelson told the truth. He was Blair’s most influential lieutenant and did more than anyone else to help him achieve power. Later, from 2008, he served Gordon Brown, although the two men had hated each other.\n\nIn Mandelson’s memoirs (in which his friend the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein had a hand, as emails released by the US Department of Justice show) Brown comes across as virtually psychotic.\n\nMandelson occupied three senior positions in the Cabinet and ended up as First Secretary of State, which meant that he was effectively deputy prime minister to Brown.\n\nHe has been central to Labour, serving not only Blair and Brown but also Keir Starmer, as British ambassador to Washington, before revelations about his close relations with Epstein forced his resignation last September.\n\nNow that it has become apparent not only that Mandelson hero-worshipped the dreadful Epstein, but that he was also passing him state secrets about the British economy, Starmer and the rest of Labour’s leadership are turning on him.\n\nThis is a monumental diversion. Of course Mandelson is a treacherous and dishonest person but that has been clear to dispassionate observers since the final decade of the last century.\n\nWes Streeting is in the forefront of Labour figures portraying themselves as hapless victims of Mandelson’s dastardliness when in fact it should have long been obvious that he was a slippery and self-serving rogue. The Health Secretary was himself an acolyte of the Prince of Darkness.\n\nStreeting, who hopes to be our next prime minister, toured the broadcasting studios yesterday morning, possibly with a bag of onions in his pocket to help him sound authentically stricken. He might as well have had a string quartet in the background scratching out some doleful dirge.\n\nHe declared that he couldn’t state ‘strongly enough how bitterly [Mandelson’s] betrayal feels for those of us in the Labour Party who feel very personally let down and also feel that he, as well as betraying two prime ministers, [was] betraying our country and betraying Epstein’s victims’.\n\nEpstein’s victims have certainly been betrayed, but Labour and two prime ministers (he means Starmer and Brown) haven’t been. They nurtured the monster Mandelson. It’s the British people who have been betrayed.\n\nBecause Starmer is still – just – Prime Minister, his indulgence of the Prince of Darkness should outrage us most. When he appointed him ambassador to the United States, with the eager support of his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, the charge sheet against Mandelson already ran to many pages.\n\nEveryone in politics knew he had been sacked from the Cabinet in 1998 for not declaring a £373,000 interest-free loan for a mortgage from multi-millionaire Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson.\n\nMandelson had the unusual distinction of being sacked from the Cabinet for a second time after he intervened to expedite an application for a British passport by the Indian billionaire S.P. Hinduja.\n\nStarmer knew all this when he decided to give Mandelson the top diplomatic job, where his alleged expertise in trade matters would supposedly be useful in dealings with the tariff-obsessed Donald Trump.\n\nThe Prime Minister was also aware that the new ambassador had raised eyebrows as a European Union Commissioner after it was revealed that he had been a guest on the yacht of Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, while he was at the centre of an EU investigation.\n\nA quick Google search would have shown that as an EU commissioner, Mandelson also spent time on the yacht of his wealthy chum Nat Rothschild before flying in Rothschild’s private jet from Switzerland to Moscow, and then on to Siberia as a guest of Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire Russian industrialist.\n\nWasn’t there more than enough to worry about here for Starmer to take a pass on Mandelson and appoint someone reliable with a less controversial track record? Most of us wouldn’t put such a person in charge of a village tombola.\n\nBut Starmer had more – much more. He knew that Mandelson had been close to Epstein, and he should have known about reports in the Press that in 2009 he had stayed at the paedophile financier’s house in Manhattan while he was serving a prison sentence for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.\n\nAfter forensic examination by Kemi Badenoch during yesterday’s Prime Minister’s Questions, Starmer finally admitted that vetting had revealed Mandelson’s continuing relationship with Epstein. Why, then, was the ambassador appointment made?\n\nStarmer’s apologists claim the vetting process was defective. This is a piece of nonsense deployed by the likes of Streeting. The truth is that the PM should have had no need of any vetting in the first place because Mandelson’s utter unsuitability for high office was blindingly obvious even to the pigeons in Parliament Square. The fact that the PM still went ahead is further proof of his bad judgment – and I would say his lack of moral discernment – in a prime ministership littered with disastrous decisions. It is absurd to claim that he was ‘betrayed’.\n\nBy focusing on supposed betrayal, Labour apologists such as Streeting are attempting to absolve Starmer, successive Labour leaders and the party itself of fostering a crooked politician for three decades.\n\nGordon Brown has the cheek to ask why Sir Chris Wormald, the Cabinet Secretary, didn’t launch an investigation when he approached him last September over his suspicions that Mandelson may have been responsible for leaks.\n\nDoubtless Wormald and the No 10 machine should have done more. But Gordon Brown is gravely at fault for handing his old enemy Mandelson a peerage, and making him de facto deputy PM, despite being fully aware of the man’s dodgy past.\n\nBrown was in difficulties because of the financial crisis and his own declining popularity, and he misguidedly believed the Prince of Darkness could shore him up. Why should he now be surprised that the man he so unwisely succoured has finally been exposed in all his moral depravity?\n\nTony Blair has even greater cause to hang his head in shame. He virtually invented Mandelson, depended on him and promoted him. He had to sack him once but soon had him back before being obliged to despatch him a second time. Yet the two men remained close conspirators. Blair has so far failed to criticise his old friend.\n\nIn recent days, comparisons have been made with the Profumo affair. John Profumo was forced to resign in 1963 as Tory Secretary for War after he had lied to the Commons about his affair with Christine Keeler.\n\nMandelson’s downfall may turn out to be as momentous in political terms as Profumo’s – perhaps more so. But actually there is no comparison between the two men.\n\nJohn Profumo was a war hero. Until his disgrace, his political career hadn’t been characterised by scandals and moral lapses and seedy relationships. After it, he gave himself selflessly to charitable works. Who can imagine Mandelson ever doing that?\n\nHere is a man who, more than any other politician in recent decades, has taken politics into the sewer. But he wasn’t some irrelevant, rotten backbencher. He was a pillar of New Labour.\n\nThe betrayal wasn’t that of Labour leaders. They knew perfectly well the kind of man he was, and they both countenanced him and encouraged him.\n\nNo, the people who have been betrayed are the voters. Mandelson is a political mountebank who has disfigured public life. And, until the dramatic repudiations of the last couple of days, he was safe and secure at the heart of the Labour Party.","summary":"The downfall of Peter Mandelson is an immense event in British politics.

Speaking at the White House this week, Trump said it was “really time for the country to get on to something else”, adding: “Nothing came out about me.” Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing linked to Epstein. His comments came after the US Department of Justice said it had completed its review of millions of documents related to Epstein’s sex-trafficking investigation. Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said the material did not justify new prosecutions. “There’s a lot of correspondence… but that doesn’t allow us necessarily to prosecute somebody,” he said.

The House of Representatives has scheduled testimony from former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton later this month, after lawmakers threatened contempt proceedings. According to the BBC, Trump’s name appears more than 6,000 times in the released files, mainly in references by Epstein and his associates. Trump and Epstein were photographed together at social events in the 1990s. Trump has said their relationship ended in the early 2000s. One email from 2011, written by Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, mentioned Trump in connection with a victim, though Trump has denied any involvement. The justice department also released a list of unverified FBI tips, including allegations made during Trump’s 2016 campaign. Officials said these claims were “unfounded and false”. Some Epstein survivors say they are dissatisfied with the justice department’s actions. One victim told the BBC that key documents had not been released and said survivors felt “they’re playing some games with us”.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump held extensive discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of an anticipated visit to China in April, following Xi’s virtual meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.On the economic side, US private sector hiring fell short of expectations, with ADP data showing just 22,000 jobs were added in January, compared with forecasts of 48,000.The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said the January employment report will be released on February 11. The data release had been delayed due to a temporary U.S. government shutdown, which ended on Tuesday.Precious metals surged last month, driven by speculative buying, geopolitical tensions and worries over the Federal Reserve’s autonomy.

The recent decline has helped reset momentum indicators, allowing the broader uptrend to gradually re-emerge.“Prices have stabilised, reclaimed key moving averages, and are now signalling trend resumption rather than exhaustion. Strong buying interest continues to emerge in the $4,600–$4,800 support band, reinforcing this zone as a critical demand base. A sustained consolidation above $5,000 could set the stage for the next leg higher, while a decisive breakout above $5,100–$5,200 would reopen upside toward prior peaks,” Ponmudi said.On the silver outlook, Ponmudi added that COMEX Silver is consolidating within the $79–$90 zone after testing record highs above $121.6. The metal has regained upward momentum and continues to trade within its broader rising structure.“Prices are holding above key moving averages, suggesting healthy consolidation rather than trend exhaustion. Support is placed at $74–$80, while a sustained breakout above $100–$105 could trigger the next impulsive move toward $116–$121 over the intermediate term.

The house has since been taped off, and agents were still inside as of 5.30pm local time.\n\nK-9 units were also spotted combing the inside, according to Fox News.\n\nMeanwhile, a second pair of investigators were at the home of Savannah Guthrie’s sister Annie. The detectives were seen collecting what looked like a tripod and lights from their car before going back inside.\n\nOfficers were previously spotted at the house, where the Today Show anchor is believed to be holed up, on Tuesday. \n\nWednesday's visit came shortly after a detective from an online pedophile unit showed up to talk to the Guthrie family. \n\nSeen outside the house in Daily Mail photos, the man was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force badge.\n\nThe FBI affiliate specializes in combating online grooming and technology enabled child abuse. \n\nThe uptick in activity comes shortly after a source told a local ABC News affiliate that the FBI is rushing in outside experts - including hostage negotiation specialists.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the case had been handled entirely by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department who called in extra help after realizing the devout grandmother had been abducted.\n\nSigns of a struggle can still be seen at her home, with her Ring doorbell removed and a splatter of blood by the entrance door.\n\nThe 84-year-old mother-of-three lives alone at the house in the affluent Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where authorities found her phone, wallet and car following her mysterious disappearance on January 31.\n\nAn Apple Watch was also found inside the property, which investigators say stopped syncing with her pacemaker at around 2am - suggesting she was taken from her home at around that time.\n\nOfficers are now looking into Savannah's superfans who have piled her with gifts and mail before her mother was abducted, the Daily Mail revealed earlier on Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators specifically asked NBC whether there were any troubling fan interactions that could be relevant to the case, a senior source claimed.\n\nNo suspect has been identified and police insist there is no danger to the wider public. However, investigators have not ruled out that Nancy may have been targeted because she is the mother of the famous Today show host.\n\nAt the same time, though, the Pima County Sheriff's Department is looking into the possibility that Nancy's kidnapping may be linked to a trespassing case in January, TMZ reports. \n\nIn that case, one of her neighbors told authorities he noticed a suspicious person outside of his own home. \n\nBut when the unidentified lurker triggered a motion sensor, causing floodlights to switch on, he fled the scene and witnesses were unable to provide a description of the suspect.\n\nPolice are now going door-to-door collecting security camera footage from neighbors as they attempt to identify a suspect and are searching for a vehicle of interest, a law enforcement source said.\n\nThey are also investigating the possibility that a ransom demand has been made. \n\nDespite the lack of answers, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has faith that Nancy is still alive.\n\n'We have nothing else to go on but the belief that she is here,' he said in an interview with NBC’s Liz Kreutz. 'She's present. She's alive, and we want to save her.'\n\nHe noted that his department is taking all tips and leads very seriously.\n\n'The leads we’ve got coming in are critical to us. They’re valuable, and we’re sharing those with the FBI and others,' Nanos said.\n\nTo aid in the investigation, President Donald Trump announced he was allocating additional federal support for the search.\n\nHe said on Tuesday he planned to call Savannah, noting that his thoughts were with the news anchor amid the 'terrible' situation.\n\n'I'm going to call her later on, I think it's a terrible thing,' Trump said. 'Very unusual situation, but we're going to find out.'\n\nThen, on Wednesday, the president made good on his promise, NBC News anchor Tom Llamas reported on air.\n\nHe said that Trump took the moment to 'offer words of support for her and her family as they search for her mother.'\n\nAuthorities are expected to provide another update into the investigation on Thursday.","summary":"Federal agents were spotted removing items from Nancy Guthrie's home on Wednesday as investigators continue to probe what may have happened to the 84-year-old mother of three.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15529439/FBI-Nancy-Guthrie-Savannah-home-Tucson-missing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/05/00/106116307-0-image-a-19_1770251113644.jpg","video":"https://video.dailymail.com/video/mol/2026/02/03/1025529336164797762/1024x576_MP4_1025529336164797762.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:16:27","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig,Ruth Styles","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig","Ruth Styles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":399498460,"title":"US must be prudent when supplying arms to Taiwan, Xi tells Trump","text":"US must be prudent when supplying arms to Taiwan, Xi tells Trump\n\nChina's leader Xi Jinping called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in China-US relations during a phone call with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday. \n\nXi had told Trump to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the island, state media reported, adding that he \"attaches great importance\" to ties with Washington and hoped both sides will find ways to resolve their differences.\n\nTrump cast the call as \"excellent\" and \"long and thorough\".\n\nWednesday's call follows a flurry of visits by Western leaders, including UK's Keir Starmer, to China in recent months, hoping to reset relations with the world's second-largest economy.\n\nTrump himself is due to visit China in April, a trip he says he \"very much looks forward to\". \n\nHe added that Beijing is considering buying 20 million tonnes of US soybeans, up from the current 12 million tonnes.\n\n\"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post. \n\nThe two leaders last spoke over the phone in November about a range of issues including trade, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, fentanyl and Taiwan, according to Trump and China's foreign ministry.\n\nApart from Taiwan and soybeans, Trump and Xi also discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, the current situation in Iran, and China's purchase of oil and gas from the US in the call on Wednesday, the US president wrote.\n\nOn Taiwan, Xi said the self-governed island was \"China's territory\" and that Beijing \"must safeguard [Taiwan's] sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\n\n\"The United States must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence,\" he warned, according to the state's Xinhua news agency.\n\nChina has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.\n\nThe US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades.

One minister said it was only the fact that Mr Starmer’s best-placed rivals have reasons to hold back from a challenge that is keeping the prime minister in his post.\n\nThe furor seemed certain to distract from Mr Starmer’s latest effort to refocus the discussion on issues more resonant with voters. The prime minister was due to give a speech about patriotism and community pride on Feb 5, while unveiling funding designed to revitalise the country’s most deprived areas.\n\nQuestions, however, will surely focus on the fallout from one of Mr Starmer’s worst days yet in Parliament.\n\nThe drama began with a parliamentary session in which Mr Starmer struggled to parry questions from Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch. She asked what he knew when about the relationship between the late pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and Mr Mandelson, the former Labour power broker who he brought back into a plum diplomatic role soon after winning election 18 months ago.\n\nThe prime minister was forced to acknowledge that the material used to vet Mr Mandelson for the post of ambassador to the US did contain details of his relationship with Epstein. A tranche of emails freshly released by the US Department of Justice showed those ties remained close even after the financier pleaded guilty to child sex-trafficking charges in 2008.\n\nOne minister who sat close to Mr Starmer said they saw his hands trembling as \n\nMs Badenoch zeroed-in on Mr Starmer’s powerful chief of staff, Mr Morgan McSweeney, who had advocated Mr Mandelson’s appointment as the government sought someone skilled in realpolitik to manage US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Some Labour MPs described Mr McSweeney’s position as untenable and speculated that the only reason Mr Starmer had not fired him was that he realised doing so could hasten his own downfall.\n\n“The prime minister chose to inject Mandelson’s poison into the heart of his government on the advice of Morgan McSweeney,” Ms Badenoch said. Mr Starmer said “of course” he continued to have confidence in Mr McSweeney, whom he described an essential part of his team.\n\nThe dispute about Mr Mandelson’s vetting picked up steam when members of Mr Starmer’s own Labour Party allied with Conservatives to seek the release of papers relating to Mr Mandelson’s appointment. That was an attempt to override the broad carve-outs the prime minister had sought for documents relating to matters of national security and international relations.\n\nWith several Labour MPs standing in the Commons to say they could not back Mr Starmer, the government was forced to concede that sensitive documents would instead be reviewed by the cross-party Intelligence and Security Committee.\n\nThe scandal arrives as Mr Starmer battles record-low popularity ratings. On the horizon are May local elections in which the government is predicted to do badly against an ascendant Reform UK, which could also prove a vulnerable moment for a prime minister losing the support of his backbenchers. \n\nSome 95 per cent of Britons were aware of \n\n“In situations like this, change can go from unlikely to inevitable very rapidly indeed,” said Professor Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester. \n\nIt will come as a relief for the prime minister that Mr Wes Streeting, one of his best-placed rivals, is a close Mandelson ally. That makes it hard for him to resign in disgust over the premier’s judgment in keeping Mr Mandelson close, two senior Labour officials said.\n\nOthers who command support of broad sections of the Party – Mr Andy Burnham, Mr Ed Miliband and Ms Angela Rayner – have reasons of their own to delay. Mr Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, was recently blocked by Mr Starmer from standing for the parliamentary seat he would need to mount a challenge for the leadership post.\n\nMs Rayner’s tax affairs are not yet in order after she resigned as deputy prime minister over them in September. And Mr Miliband, the energy secretary, has always publicly professed his loyalty to the premier after trying and failing to win a general election himself.\n\nMany on the left of the party have said they warned Mr Starmer that rehabilitating Mr Mandelson would be a bad decision. Their fury makes the chance of a leadership challenge more probable than it was on Feb 3, as the gilt curve steepened and the pound weakened against the euro through the afternoon.\n\nMs Rayner’s influence was on display when she stood up to pressure the government to run disclosures through the security committee. A Labour official said she had made clear she was a serious player ahead of any leadership contest.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police entered the fray in an evening statement in which they said they asked the government “not to release certain documents at this time”, owing to its ongoing investigation into Mr Mandelson. The police said on Feb 3 they would be investigating the former ambassador’s conduct in public office.\n\nDespite that 11th-hour intervention, Mr Starmer’s appointment of a man – who, in his own words, “betrayed our country”, “lied repeatedly”, and was “responsible for a litany of deceit” – is forcing one of the most dangerous moments of his premiership yet.

His detention was part of a large-scale immigration enforcement initiative under the Trump administration.\n\nFollowing his release, Guan was joyfully reunited with his mother on Tuesday. This came nearly a week after an immigration judge granted him asylum, acknowledging the genuine threat of persecution he would face if he returned to China.\n\n“I’m feeling fantastic,” shared 38-year-old Guan with The Associated Press on Wednesday. “Yesterday, the excitement hadn’t sunk in, as it still felt like I was imprisoned. But today, many friends have visited, making it feel real.”\n\nCurrently residing temporarily in Binghamton, New York, Guan mentioned that he hasn’t yet mapped out his long-term plans.\n\nHis mother, Luo Yun, traveled from Taiwan to the U.S. to support her son and expressed a sense of relief at his release.\n\n“For five and a half months, I struggled to sleep peacefully, but today I finally feel at ease,” Luo remarked.\n\nIt was a rare successful outcome for an asylum seeker since President Donald Trump returned to office. At one point in detention, Guan was faced with deportation to Uganda, but the Department of Homeland Security dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. DHS, which has 30 days to appeal the immigration judge’s Jan. 28 ruling, did not immediately respond to a request to confirm if it has decided not to appeal.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Guan should not have had to spend months in detention for the right outcome to be reached.\n\n“His release is a reminder that the rule of law and our moral duty to protect those who expose human rights abuses go hand in hand,” Khanna said, vowing to press for transparency in similar cases.\n\nGuan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the Chinese region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.\n\nThe Chinese government has denied allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts. Beijing has silenced dissenting views on its practices in Xinjiang through a range of coercive means.\n\nThe State Department, while declining to comment on Guan’s case because of confidentiality rules, said it condemns the Chinese ruling party’s “genocide, religious persecution, and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and others in Xinjiang.”\n\nDuring his asylum hearing last week, Guan said he didn’t set out to document the detention facilities Xinjiang so he could claim asylum in the United States. He said he sympathized with the persecuted Uyghurs and wanted to bear witness to their plight. \n\nGuan knew he had to leave China if he wanted to publish the footage. He went first to Hong Kong and from there to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could travel without a visa, and then to the Bahamas. He released most of his video footage on YouTube shortly before arriving in Florida by boat in October 2021.\n\nGuan told the immigration judge he didn’t know whether he would survive the boat trip and wanted to make sure the footage would be seen.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – After spending over five months in federal detention, Guan Heng,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chinese Whistleblower Secures Freedom: Granted U.S. Asylum After Exposing Human Rights Abuses first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/chinese-whistleblower-secures-freedom-granted-u-s-asylum-after-exposing-human-rights-abuses/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Chinese-national-who-exposed-rights-abuses-is-freed-from-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:06:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":399498210,"title":"START To Finish: As US-Russia Nuclear Weapons Treaty Expires, What Does This Mean For The World?","text":"The world has entered a precarious new era of nuclear uncertainty on Thursday, with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) officially expiring. The lapse of this landmark agreement between the United States and Russia marks the first time in over 50 years—since the SALT I negotiations of the early 1970s—that the two largest nuclear powers are not bound by a legally enforceable framework to limit their strategic arsenals.\nThe Final Stand of New START\nSigned in 2010 and extended for five years in early 2021, New START was the last surviving pillar of a bilateral arms control regime that once successfully reduced global nuclear stockpiles from a Cold War peak of 70,000 to approximately 12,000.\nThe Limits: The treaty capped both nations at 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 deployed delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers.\nThe Verification: It provided a robust system of 18 on-site inspections per year and biannual data exchanges to ensure mutual predictability.\nThe Road to Expiry\nThe collapse of the treaty was not sudden but followed years of deteriorating relations.\nSuspension (2023): Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western military aid to Kyiv, President Vladimir Putin formally suspended Russia’s participation in February 2023. This halted on-site inspections and data sharing, though both sides claimed they would informally adhere to the numerical caps.\nThe ‘Better Deal’ Ambition: In the months leading up to the expiry, President Donald Trump maintained that “if it expires, it expires,” suggesting that the US would pursue a “better agreement” that includes China. Beijing, however, has consistently refused to join such talks, arguing its arsenal—estimated at roughly 600 warheads—is dwarfed by the US and Russian stockpiles of over 5,000 each.\nThe Final Offer: In late 2025, Putin proposed a one-year “informal” extension of the treaty’s limits without the verification regime.

That’s what this individual tried to do” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Shipley told the judge. Defense attorney Martin L. Roth argued that “at the moment of truth, he chose not to pull the trigger.” The judge pushed back, noting Routh’s history of arrests, to which Roth said, “He’s a complex person, I’ll give the court that, but he has a very good core.” Routh then read from a rambling, 20-page statement. Cannon broke in, said none of what he was saying was relevant and gave him five more minutes to talk. “I did everything I could and lived a good life,” Routh said, before the judge cut him off. “Your plot to kill was deliberate and evil,” she said. “You are not a peaceful man. You are not a good man.” She then issued his sentence: Life without parole, plus seven years on a gun charge. His sentences for his other three crimes will run concurrently. In a statement on the social platform X, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked prosecutors for ensuring that Routh “will never walk free again.” “Ryan Routh’s heinous attempted assassination of President Trump was not only an attack on our President — it was a direct assault against our entire democratic system,” Bondi said. Routh's sentencing was initially scheduled for December. But Cannon agreed to move it back after Routh decided to use an attorney during the sentencing phase, instead of representing himself as he did for most of the trial. Routh was convicted of trying to assassinate a major presidential candidate, using a firearm in furtherance of a crime, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm as a felon and using a gun with a defaced serial number. “Routh remains unrepentant for his crimes, never apologized for the lives he put at risk, and his life demonstrates near-total disregard for law,” prosecutors said in their sentencing memo. His defense attorney had asked for 20 years plus the mandatory seven for the gun conviction. “The defendant is two weeks short of being sixty years old,” Roth wrote in a filing. “A just punishment would provide a sentence long enough to impose sufficient but not excessive punishment, and to allow defendant to experience freedom again as opposed to dying in prison.” Prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican presidential candidate played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. At trial a Secret Service agent helping protect Trump on the golf course testified that he spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and run away without firing a shot. In the motion requesting an attorney, Routh offered to trade his life in a prisoner swap with people unjustly held in other countries and said an offer still stood for Trump to “take out his frustrations on my face.” “Just a quarter of an inch further back and we all would not have to deal with all of this mess,” Routh wrote. He added, “but I always fail at everything (par for the course).” In her decision granting Routh an attorney, Cannon chastised the “disrespectful charade” of Routh's motion, saying it made a mockery of the proceedings. But the judge, nominated by Trump in 2020, said she wanted to err on the side of legal representation. Cannon signed off last summer on Routh’s request to represent himself . The Supreme Court has held that defendants have the right to represent themselves in court proceedings as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to an attorney. Routh’s former federal public defenders served as standby counsel and were present during the trial. Routh had multiple previous felony convictions , including possession of stolen goods, and a large online footprint demonstrating disdain for Trump. In a self-published book, he encouraged Iran to assassinate him and at one point wrote that as a Trump voter, he must take part of the blame for electing...","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/man-gets-life-sentence-for-trump-golf-course-assassination-attempt-1935089","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/05/2006837-ani-20260204233607.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:05:01","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":399495914,"title":"Epstein files explained: Who’s named, what’s redacted, and where to find them","text":"Millions of pages of records linked disgraced financier Jefferey Epstein have been unsealed and released publicly by the U.S. Department of Justice, renewing attention on the late sex offender’s social and professional network.\n\nReferred to as the “Epstein files,” the records are drawn from multiple legal cases and contain a wide range of names, allegations and references, many of which were never tested in court. Their release has prompted questions about where the documents came from, what they contain and what conclusions can and cannot be drawn from them.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nWhere can I see the Epstein files?\n\nThe files are publicly available on the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) website under the “Epstein Library,” as part of the FBI’s online record vault.\n\nThe documents are hosted on a dedicated Epstein page that contains investigative files, interview summaries, correspondence and related material released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe DOJ has said the records may be updated over time, with documents temporarily removed and reposted if redaction issues are identified. \n\nHow do you search through the Epstein files?\n\nThe Epstein files can be found on the DOJ’s website through the FBI’s public records portal, referred to as the “Epstein Library.”\n\nThe records are published in “data sets,” 12 so far as of Wednesday, but are posted as individual PDF files rather than a single searchable database.\n\nAs a result, searching through them requires downloading documents and using keyword searches within each file.\n\nSome commonly used search terms include:\n\nEpstein’s email addresses, like jeevacation@gmail.com, which appears repeatedly in correspondence;FD-302, referring to FBI interview reports - these documents summarize interviews conducted by agents with victims and perpetrators;flight-related terms, such as “Gulfstream,” tail numbers, or pilot names, which may reveal travel references; andnames of known associates or staff, which may appear in interviews or email chains.\n\nBecause many files are heavily redacted, keyword searches may not always return complete results. In some cases, names or entire passages are blacked out, limiting what can be confirmed.\n\nWhat do redactions mean?\n\nRedactions are used to withhold information that the U.S. government says cannot legally or ethically be made public.\n\nEmails are often redacted to remove personal email addresses, message content or identifying details of people who were not charged with a crime. In some cases, entire email chains are partially blacked out to protect third parties whose names appear only incidentally in the emails.\n\nNames are frequently redacted to protect victims and minors, as well as witnesses and private individuals. The DOJ has also said redactions are necessary to avoid unfairly harming people mentioned in investigative files where allegations were unproven or never pursued. \n\nThe department has stated that many redactions are required under U.S. privacy laws, especially when releasing investigative material that was never presented in court.\n\nThe redactions have drawn criticism from transparency advocates and some victims’ lawyers, who argue the blacked-out passages make it difficult to fully understand how investigators assessed Epstein’s conduct and relationships.\n\nCritics say the volume of redactions, particularly involving names and correspondence, limits public accountability and leaves key questions unanswered about the scope of the investigation.\n\nAdditionally, some records were temporarily taken down after victims and their lawyers alerted the DOJ that identifying information had not been redacted appropriately. \n\nThe department said the withdrawn material included documents and media containing exposed names, email addresses and other personal details, which it attributed to “technical or human error.”\n\nWho is in the Epstein files?\n\nThe FBI records in the “Epstein Library” include references to a wide range of public figures, based on emails, interview summaries, calendars and other investigative material. Inclusion in the files does not mean a person is accused of a crime.\n\nAmong those named are:\n\nDonald Trump: Appears in FBI records reflecting Epstein’s social and political connections, including a birthday album compiled for Epstein that contains a handwritten poem and drawing attributed to Trump. The U.S. president has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years before Epstein’s arrest. Bill Clinton: Referenced in connection with Epstein’s social circle and travel-related material, including references to a painting kept at one of Epstein’s residences depicting Clinton in women’s clothing and in suggestive settings. The former U.S. president has said he was unaware of Epstein’s crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Bill Gates: Files include draft emails found in Epstein’s account referencing Gates, their relationship and personal matters. A Gates spokesperson has said Epstein was attempting to entrap or defame him and denied the claims reflected in the drafts.Elon Musk: Appears in email correspondence where he and Epstein discussed a possible visit to his private island. Musk has denied ever going to the island or attending Epstein events.Former Prince Andrew: Referenced repeatedly in investigative material. Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied. Amid the royal fallout, Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages and stepped back from public life, ultimately losing his role as a working member of the royal family and leaving royal residences. The files also include references to his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, who has acknowledged a friendship with Epstein and denied wrongdoing.Martha Stewart: Referenced in emails involving requests for Epstein’s contact information and a dinner invitation. It is unclear whether she attended any events.Steve Bannon: Featured in text messages and a recorded interview with Epstein discussing politics and Epstein’s legal status. Bannon has not been accused of involvement in Epstein’s crimes.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/epstein-files-explained-whos-named-whats-redacted-and-where-to-find-them/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/WNEG7ATT4JEOJLVQIHWL3EXEBI.jpg?auth=dd9ed04c5a192b0e7939ceea08d8b5f655793e0f323ba0f9cf24ee51780284f2","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:03:36","author":"Lynn Chaya","authors":["Lynn Chaya"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":399496154,"title":"Supreme Court lets California’s Proposition 50 maps stand — with implications for 2026 and possibly beyond","text":"With the U.S. Supreme Court clearing the way for California’s newly gerrymandered congressional maps to be used in this year’s midterm elections, the stage is set for California Democrats to try to notch five new House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Republican seats is expected to be slashed by roughly half.\n\nThe nation’s highest court on Wednesday, Feb. 4, denied an emergency appeal by a group of California Republicans and the U.S. Department of Justice, which made a last-ditch effort to have the Proposition 50 maps that voters approved in November overturned ahead of the 2026 elections.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court chose not to grant an emergency injunction to block the new maps from going into effect this year, the legal challenge does not end here.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, which include the California Republican Party, plan to continue challenging the constitutionality of the maps, though any future ruling to overturn them — should the court render such a decision — wouldn’t apply until later: the 2028 elections.\n\nFollowing Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision, Michael Columbo, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said although there won’t be an emergency injunction to stop the Proposition 50 maps “from being used in this year’s elections, our case persists, and we will continue to vigorously argue for Equal Protection under the law for all of California’s voters.” (The plaintiffs had argued that the Proposition 50 maps were drawn to favor one race — Hispanics — and that racial gerrymandering is illegal.)\n\nOf California’s 52 House seats, 43 are represented by Democrats. Only eight are held by Republicans, and one seat is vacant. That seat, in Northern California, was held by Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who died last month. A special election for his successor will take place in August.\n\nBut with the new Proposition 50 maps, Republicans in California — already disproportionately represented in Congress — will likely only hold a handful of House seats based on voter registration data.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, who led the charge to draw new, gerrymandered maps as a counter to a similar effort by Texas Republicans last year, at the behest of President Donald Trump, celebrated Wednesday’s court decision.\n\n“Donald Trump said he was ‘entitled’ to five more congressional seats in Texas,” Newsom said. “He started this redistricting war. He lost, and he’ll lose again in November.”\n\nNeither the White House nor the Department of Justice responded immediately to a request for comment.\n\nState Sen. Tony Strickland, R-Huntington Beach, meanwhile, called the court decision “unfortunate.”\n\nUnder the new maps, Huntington Beach and parts of Newport Beach — two Orange County communities — are lumped into the same congressional district as Los Angeles County’s Long Beach. That district, the 42nd Congressional District, is represented by progressive Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach.\n\nAlthough the Orange County cities are currently represented in the House by a Democrat, some conservative voters moving into the 42nd District under the new maps are concerned that if Garcia is reelected, they would be represented by someone whose values or political views do not align with their own.\n\n“Our Constitution is built on competitive elections and voter choice, not predetermined outcomes,” Strickland said. “When elections are engineered in advance, Democrats, Republicans and independents all lose, and our democracy is weakened.”\n\nOn the other hand, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Suzan DelBene hailed the Supreme Court decision as “a victory for the people of California, and those who believe in fair representation in Congress.”\n\n“By ensuring the voter-approved map will be used in 2026, the court today acknowledged that in our democracy, power belongs to the people, not Donald Trump and Republican party bosses,” she said in a statement.\n\nLongtime Republican strategist Jon Fleischman said that with the new maps, perhaps only one congressional district remains competitive; the rest are either solidly blue or solidly red.\n\n“It’s not good for democracy,” said Fleischman, who previously served as executive director of the California Republican Party. “At the end of the day, if you’re a voter, you want a robust discussion about the ideas and have a real opportunity to make a decision about which direction you think the country should be going.”\n\nThe one district that Fleischman believes is still competitive is the 48th Congressional District, currently held by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-San Diego.\n\nAnd with the Proposition 50 maps now settled for this year’s races at least, it sets up an intraparty contest between Reps. Young Kim and Ken Calvert, both Republican incumbents who have said they will vie for California’s 40th Congressional District in Orange and Riverside counties.\n\nRedistricting expert Matt Rexroad said that although he wasn’t completely surprised by the Supreme Court’s decision, he had thought there was a chance it might rule in favor of the plaintiffs.\n\nThat aside, Rexroad said, even before Wednesday’s ruling, candidates had been campaigning under the assumption that the Proposition 50 maps would stand.\n\n“It’s already changed behavior,” Rexroad said. “Ken Calvert’s already campaigning in the new seat. People accepted that this (lawsuit) was a Hail Mary effort.”\n\nDespite all the headlines about the shake-up caused by California’s mid-decade congressional redistricting, Huntington Beach City Councilmember Andrew Gruel, who describes himself as a libertarian-leaning Republican, had a bit of a different take on its impact.\n\nAfter all, as Gruel put it, he had already “baked (the outcome) into the mental cake.”\n\nNew congressional maps don’t have any bearing on city governments, where, Gruel said, communities see the most impact. Sure, congressional representatives can bring federal funding back to their districts, but it’s the local officials who fix potholes and low-hanging branches and design economic development plans.\n\n“This, to me, is a testament as to why it’s so important you get involved in local politics,” Gruel said.\n\nFor Strickland, the concern stretches beyond the next couple of election cycles, when the new Proposition 50 maps are in place.\n\nHe’s worried that California ultimately will do away completely with the independent commission established to draw maps after each Census update.\n\n“Once you give politicians the power to draw their own seats and pick their own constituents, they’re not going to give it back,” Strickland said. “I’m fearful if Republicans don’t get within that one-third (margin) in the (California) Legislature, they’ll do Proposition 50 for the next decade’s elections — and not just Congress, but also for legislative seats.”\n\nIn terms of Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision, no justices dissented from the brief order, which denied the appeal without explanation, as is common on the court’s emergency docket.\n\nThe justices had previously allowed Texas’ Republican-friendly map to be used in 2026, despite a lower-court ruling that it likely discriminates on the basis of race.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote in December that it appeared both states had adopted new maps for political advantage, which the high court has previously ruled cannot be a basis for a federal lawsuit.\n\nFiling for congressional primaries in California begins on Monday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"The stage is set for California Democrats to notch five new House seats as Republicans see their numbers slashed by half.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2026/02/04/supreme-court-lets-californias-proposition-50-maps-stand-with-implications-for-2026-and-possibly-beyond/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Supreme_Court_87835-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:03:21","author":"Gqlshare,Kaitlyn Schallhorn,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Kaitlyn Schallhorn","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":399496128,"title":"Trump might have lost the political plot — but here’s how he can still win the midterms","text":"Donald Trump did not win the 2024 election because America suddenly became meaningfully more Republican.\n\nHe won because voters, many of them independents and crossover Democrats, many of them young, had lost trust in the system and believed he was willing to confront it. I’m the head pollster for Rasmussen Reports. In our final 2024 polling, 42% of Trump’s electorate came from independents and Democrats.\n\nThat is not a MAGA monoculture. It is a fragile coalition built on one thing: accountability.\n\nVoters did not elect Trump to manage decline. They elected him to fix things that were not working. That is why DOGE mattered. For a brief moment, it validated what Americans, particularly younger voters, already believed: that the federal government is bloated, corrupt, self-dealing and largely insulated from consequences.\n\nThe path to victory\n\nUnder-40 voters, the most disillusioned cohort by many measures, were the most supportive of DOGE, the most open to arrests for corruption and the most likely to agree with the statement that “he who saves his country violates no laws” (57%).\n\nTrump’s approval among voters under 40 briefly hit 60% almost exactly when Google search interest in DOGE peaked. That alignment should have frozen Republican politics in Washington in place.\n\nInstead, DOGE was quietly sidelined, and Trump’s approval among younger voters has since fallen sharply into the low 40s. That is not coincidence. It is a signal.\n\nRather than doubling down on systemic accountability, the last few months have felt unfocused, with counter-signaling on affordability and jobs, infighting, the Epstein saga, renewed foreign entanglements and a governing posture that feels reactive rather than intentional.\n\nVoters are noticing.\n\nDespite Trump’s unsurprising personal approval rating today (net -7), the Democratic lead on the generic ballot has steadily widened to D+6. That should set off alarms. The November 2024 election was Trumpy, not Republican, and off-cycle special elections continue to reinforce that reality. Momentum, enthusiasm and turnout are not automatic for Republicans.\n\nThe Republican Party has not helped. Its legislative output is thin. Its ability to deliver tangible wins is questionable. Even the bare minimum — serious accountability investigations — has largely failed to materialize. There is no clear path to a 2026 victory if this continues, which is why what happened in Minnesota mattered so much.\n\nLosing focus\n\nThe discovery of rampant alleged fraud in Minnesota was a gift. It offered a rare opportunity to shift the national conversation away from Republican dysfunction and toward something Americans overwhelmingly agree on.\n\nThree-quarters of voters are angry about the level of waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has cited figures as high as $300 billion to $600 billion annually. That is not budget trimming. That is empire-fatal kleptocracy.\n\nThis was the moment for a full-scale, anti-blue-state fraud push. Follow the money. Subpoena everything. Make examples. Send every agency in, even the 80,000 armed IRS agents we should have fired. If fraud is that widespread, maybe austerity is not the answer. Maybe arrests are.\n\nInstead, the focus shifted.\n\nICE was surged into Minneapolis. What could have been a systemic fraud investigation became a performative deportation spectacle. Predictable protests followed. Then escalation: more ICE presence, masks, tear gas, aggressive enforcement.\n\nWithin days, the headlines were no longer about uncovering fraud. They were about clashes, optics and ultimately the tragic shooting deaths of two protesters.\n\nThe ICE red meat might be cathartic for some. But politically effective, no.\n\nOur polling has been consistent for years on this point. Americans want illegal immigration stopped. That is not in dispute. They want criminals deported. They want the border enforced. But they also want fairness, not brutality, and they recoil when enforcement looks indiscriminate, theatrical or excessive.\n\nA plurality of Americans now say ICE tactics are too harsh, even while still supporting deportation in principle. That tension is not ideological. It is emotional.\n\nTrump made matters worse by signaling a narrowing of deportations to only the “worst criminals,” while simultaneously negotiating with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who reportedly has an active criminal referral at the Department of Justice. To many in Trump’s coalition, this likely feels like a rug pull, as my barrage of private X messages imply. A betrayal of expectations. Something uncomfortably close to “read my lips.”\n\nHere is what should worry the White House most: Voters trust big business almost as little as they trust the federal government itself. By a five-to-one margin, voters say businesses have too much influence in the Trump administration, not too little.\n\nWhat voters want\n\nAmericans do not just want illegal immigrants removed. They want the hiring magnet destroyed. They overwhelmingly support punishing companies that employ illegal labor. That policy outperforms Trump’s personal approval by nearly 30 net points. It is not even close.\n\nSo the obvious question follows: What is stopping this administration from going after the employers? Likewise, a federal E-Verify mandate is ridiculously popular. Why have Republicans been unable to pluck this low-hanging fruit?\n\nIs it donor pressure? Fear of market volatility? Is Trump, the tribune of the forgotten voter, being restrained by plutocratic interests? From the outside, it increasingly looks that way.\n\nThere was a clean path forward. Keep DOGE front and center. Launch relentless investigations into blue-state fraud hubs. Hammer corporate lawbreaking and worker exploitation. Restore trust through accountability. Instead, the administration chose theatrics over results, and is paying the price politically.\n\nThis can still be fixed, but only if Trump remembers why he was elected. Not to manage the system. Not to appease donors. Not to chase viral moments. Make the System Fear Consequences Again.\n\nAmericans are not asking for chaos. They are asking for justice.\n\nAnd they are still waiting.\n\nFrom RealClearPolitics.

He previously served as ambassador to the Netherlands and Canada and as Turkey’s special envoy for Syria.\nTurkey, a Nato member, officially applied for full Brics membership in 2024. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had repeatedly expressed interest in joining the group, said Turkey could become prosperous and respected if it “simultaneously develops relations with the East and West”.\nAnkara was instead offered “partner country” status in 2024 amid reported concerns about how Turkey’s Nato membership would align with Brics, which sees itself as a counterweight to the Western-led global order.\nFounded by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, the bloc later expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. If admitted, Turkey would become the first member of the transatlantic security alliance to join Brics.\nTurkey, which boasts the second-largest army in Nato after the United States, has long leveraged its geography and diplomacy to balance regional affairs.\nMost recently, Ankara has been exploring a trilateral defence pact with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, with Islamabad confirming last month that a draft agreement was under discussion.\n\nIn the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East, Turkey has deepened cooperation with Beijing and Moscow, with Erdogan visiting China in August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.\nAccording to Unal, Beijing and Ankara are also working to strengthen dialogue on security and counterterrorism, a priority established during Erdogan’s meeting with Xi on August 31.\nDescribing the two countries as “important members” of the Global South, Xi urged Erdogan to strengthen multilateral coordination, offer support on issues concerning each other’s core interests and major concerns, and “enhance counterterrorism and security cooperation”.\n“Both countries have been hit by terrorism in the past. I think we have a common ground to talk and to have dialogue on terrorism issues as well. These talks will continue this year,” Unal said.\nBeijing has expressed concerns about the large Uygur Muslim diaspora in Turkey and the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group China has accused of carrying out terrorist attacks in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.\nTurkey has deep cultural and religious links with the Uygurs in Xinjiang, and in 2019 it stood out as one of only a few Muslim-majority countries to voice concerns at the United Nations over Beijing’s treatment of the ethnic minority group.\nBut as economic ties have expanded following Erdogan’s trips to China last year and in 2019, Ankara has largely refrained from openly criticising Beijing over the issue.\nDuring a rare visit to Xinjiang in 2024, Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Hakan Fidan was quoted as saying that Ankara did not allow activities within its borders that endangered China’s security and territorial integrity, nor did it support or take part in anti-China activities using ethnic issues.\nUnal said the Uygur issue was “always a cultural issue” from Turkey’s perspective.\n“Everything goes through dialogue. We understand the sensitivities of our Chinese friends, and we continue our dialogue with them,” he said.\n“Of course, this issue is also two-way. We also have our sensitivities as well,” he added, without elaborating.\nThe Turkish diplomat declined to comment on how Ankara would address Washington’s concerns over its warming ties with Beijing, or how Erdogan’s government managed its delicate balancing act between the two superpowers amid heightened tensions between US President Donald Trump and his European and Nato allies.\nUnal listed promoting high-level visits, reciprocal visa arrangements and expanded trade as his priorities for ties between Turkey and China this year, the 55th anniversary of bilateral relations.\nHe said both sides were planning several high-level visits this year. He added that he hoped Xi would visit Turkey again, noting there was “an open invitation” for the Chinese leader from Erdogan. Xi last visited the country in 2015.\nHe added that Turkey continued to welcome increased Chinese investment across a broad range of sectors such as transport, agriculture, technology, finance and energy.\n\nChina is Turkey’s third-largest trading partner globally and its largest in Asia, with annual trade nearing US$50 billion.\nTurkey is also the only Nato member that has not banned Huawei Technologies from its telecoms networks, and was among the first countries to use Chinese Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\nUnal acknowledged the persistent trade deficit was “always a big issue”, citing frequent ministerial-level exchanges to seek Chinese investment and promote trade “in a more fair and equitable manner”.\nHowever, he rejected the suggestion that Turkey was too economically dependent on China.\nUnal called on Beijing to ease visa requirements for Turkish travellers. Ankara implemented a visa-free policy for Chinese citizens in January.\n“We have always asked countries with which we value relations to ease visa issues for our citizens – merchants, tradesmen, businessmen, students, scholars. China is one of them,” he said.\n“We have been in talks with Chinese authorities to facilitate visas for Turkish citizens doing business here. Our dialogue will continue.”\nHe stressed that Turkey’s unique geography made it a key gateway to markets beyond its borders.\n“We have free-trade agreements with several countries. Chinese companies investing in Turkey would be well positioned to expand their trade with countries in adjacent regions.”\nTurkey has played a key role in China’s Belt and Road Initiative thanks to its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, serving as a hub for the land and sea routes connecting China’s western regions with European markets.\nCooperation between Beijing and Ankara also extends to the Middle Corridor, a Turkish-led trans-regional infrastructure project that aims to connect Central Asia and the Caucasus with Europe.\nWhile touting his country’s growing power, greater connectivity and status as an emerging industrial production centre, the diplomat rejected the idea that Turkey harboured ambitions to rise as a unique Eurasian power.\n“We have been working as a connecting power between East and West for decades. This is not a new thing, but it’s not an ambition. I think maybe we have to correct that narrative,” he said. “It’s our sincere wish to contribute more to world peace, stability and the global economy.”\nEchoing Erdogan’s call that “the world is bigger than five”, Unal said reform of the United Nations and “a fair international system” were necessary, including an enlarged UN Security Council with more permanent members from different regions.\nOn the Middle East, he said China “could always play a bigger role” in ensuring a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, but stopped short of urging Beijing to intervene in Ukraine.\n“I am sure other countries are doing their part to stop this war, but it will be up to them, including China, to do whatever they would like to do,” he said.\nUnal also highlighted Hong Kong’s role as a commercial and cultural hub, noting that its strategic and geographic importance, similar to Turkey’s, would make it an important player in Turkey-China relations.\nCooperation between Hong Kong and Turkey has been underpinned by agreements to avoid double taxation and to protect investments.\nLast week, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu met visiting Turkish Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Simsek. Lee encouraged Turkish enterprises to use Hong Kong as a gateway to Chinese and Asian markets and invited Turkish youth to pursue education and careers in the city.\nUnal said one of his priorities during his tenure would be strengthening relations between academic institutions in Turkey and China.\nThere are now around 1,200 Turkish students studying in China – a number Unal said was good but “not that sizeable”. He added that he intended to increase the figure with more exchange programmes.\nChina has roughly 12 Turkish and Turkish literature departments across its universities, while Turkey is home to four Confucius Institutes, according to the ambassador.\n“In every bilateral relationship, [people-to-people exchanges are] the most important part so that you can talk and know each other’s language, culture, history, tourism and more.

The MSCI index that tracks them rose by 34% in 2025, compared with 21% for its developed-markets equivalent. With this year barely a month old, EMs are already up by another 9%. Currencies from the Mexican peso to the Malaysian ringgit have surged against the dollar. The returns of local-currency EM bonds have trounced those of risky “high-yield\" American or European debt. Can the stellar run continue?\n\n A big part of the answer depends on what happens next with the dollar. Since the late 1960s, when the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates began to fall apart, the greenback has been through four major bear markets. Each time, note analysts at Bank of America, EM stocks have roared. Their recent success has come as, once again, the currency’s strength has waned. So far, measured against a basket of rich-world peers, it is only 11% below its high point of 2025—a mild dip compared with a fall of 41% between 2002 and 2008.\n\n If traders carry on dumping dollars, EM assets have much more to gain. Though the governments of emerging economies increasingly borrow in their own currencies, especially in Asia, plenty still have hefty dollar-denominated debts. A weaker greenback makes those cheaper to service and repay. All else equal, it should also give a boost to international trade priced in dollars, such as commodity exports. And capital flowing out of America has to flow somewhere. The average portfolio allocation to EM stocks of active fund managers is close to its lowest in two decades, making such assets an obvious choice for those looking to diversify.\n\n Yet the bull case for EMs does not rest solely on the “sell America\" trade continuing. To see why, consider three reasons for even the most ardent America First investor to give them a look: the stocks’ cheapness, their resilience and their potential to benefit from global growth.\n\n Cheapness is the most obvious draw. True, EM shares look pricey compared with their own history: at 13 times expected underlying earnings for the coming year, they have rarely been dearer. This valuation nevertheless represents a 40% discount to that of America’s S&P 500 index. America’s tech giants might well mint extraordinary profits from artificial intelligence, but so too will firms in China, South Korea and Taiwan. Investors buying a broad basket of EM stocks can bet on the same trend for a far lower price—and with more diversification in case AI disappoints.\n\n What is more, in the event that a shock knocks the world economy off-kilter, EMs are far better placed than they once were to cope with it. Middle-income countries across Latin America and Asia have spent decades building stronger institutions, amassing foreign-exchange reserves and empowering their central banks. Their resilience was on full display when prices surged globally in 2022 and many raised rates well ahead of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, successfully reducing inflation. Investing in EMs remains riskier than betting on advanced economies, but much less so than it used to be.\n\n In fact, the global economic backdrop looks about as close to EMs’ sweet spot as it could be. The IMF forecasts global GDP to rise steadily in 2026, albeit more slowly, with EMs outpacing rich economies by 2.4 percentage points. America’s Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates further, but few fear a recession. In other words, things look not too hot and not too cold: ideal for encouraging investors to deploy capital in places that are a bit riskier but that will probably grow a bit faster and generate higher returns. It would certainly help if Donald Trump, America’s president, gave investors yet more reasons to shun American assets—but regardless, EMs’ bull run may only be beginning.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/can-emerging-markets-stellar-run-continue-11770253149935.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/02/05/1600x900/logo/g0c0590289bfe0ba52025cadefd91fb407b1843dc7223f67f1_1770253196562_1770253196691.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-05 01:00:50","author":"The Economist","authors":["The Economist"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":399497858,"title":"'India Free to Buy Oil From Any Supplier': Russia Rejects Trump's Claim","text":"India is free to buy oil from any country, and there is nothing new about its decision to diversify its crude suppliers, the Kremlin said on Wednesday. This was the Kremlin's response to US President Donald Trump's claim that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and switch to purchasing crude from the United States and, potentially, from Venezuela.,\"We, along with all other international energy experts, are well aware that Russia is not the only supplier of oil and petroleum products to India. India has always purchased these products from other countries. Therefore, we see nothing new here,\" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, as quoted by PTI. ,A day earlier, Peskov said that Russia has not received any statements from India regarding the cessation of Russian oil purchases.,Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova on Wednesday said that the hydrocarbons trade is beneficial for both India and Russia. \"We remain convinced that India's purchase of Russian hydrocarbons is beneficial to both countries and contributes to maintaining stability in the international energy market. We are ready to continue close cooperation in this area with our partners in India,\" Zakharova said at a press briefing.,Private Kommersant FM business radio noted that, unlike President Trump, PM Modi did not mention any agreement on stopping Russian oil imports.,,How Much India Buys From Russia? ,,India buys about 88 per cent of its crude oil, which is converted into fuels like petrol and diesel, from overseas.,Russian oil made up hardly 0.2 per cent of all crude oil that India imported till 2021. India, the world's third-largest oil importer, became the largest buyer of discounted Russian crude after Western countries shunned Moscow following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.,India's import of Russian crude oil dropped to around 1.1 million barrels per day in the first three weeks of January, from an average of 1.21 million bpd in the previous month and over 2 million bpd imports in mid-2025, according to data from real-time analytics company Kpler.,US Crude to Prove Costly to India: Expert ,,Igor Yushkov, a leading expert at the National Energy Security Fund, said that Indian refiners cannot fully stop the import of Russian crude. \"The American shale oil they export is light grades, similar to gas condensate. Russia, on the other hand, supplies relatively heavy, sulfur-rich Urals. This means India will need to blend US crude with other grades, which incurs additional costs, meaning a simple substitution won't be possible,\" he said.,\"Russia typically exports 1.5 million to 2 million barrels per day to the country. America won't be able to cover that volume. So, one gets the sense that Trump is simply trying to show that he won these trade negotiations and the deal was concluded entirely in line with US demands,\" he said.,Last time, when Russia switched to the Indian market from European and American markets in 2022, it cut production by 1 million barrels per day. This led to prices rising to $120 per barrel, and the US set an all-time high for gasoline and diesel prices, Yushkov recalled.,(With inputs from PTI) ,For the Latest news, India News and breaking stories from around the world, visit Times Now for live coverage and in-depth reporting.","summary":"India buys about 88 per cent of its crude oil, which is converted into fuels like petrol and diesel, from overseas.
