The US would cut by 50 percent and we would cut by 50 percent and then China would join if it wanted,\" Putin said in a televised interview.Russia has significantly increased military spending since launching its offensive in Ukraine in 2022, fuelling economic growth but also inflation. Putin said that in 2024, defence and security spending would reach about 8.7% of GDP.While he could not speak for China, Putin indicated that Russia was open to negotiations with Washington on the issue. \"We could come to an agreement with the US (on cutting spending), we're not against it,\" he said. \"We think it's a good proposal and we are ready for a discussion about this.\"European role in Ukraine peace talksPutin also addressed the role of European nations in potential peace negotiations for Ukraine, saying their participation was \"in demand,\" despite past reluctance.\"I see nothing wrong with this,\" Putin said when asked about European involvement in talks. \"Well, probably no one can demand anything here. Especially not from Russia.\" However, he added, \"If they want to come back, they're welcome.\"The Russian leader claimed that European countries had \"themselves rejected contacts with us,\" believing Ukraine could secure a military victory. He added that Russia also valued the perspectives of BRICS nations, including Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.\"We are grateful to all our partners who raise these questions, who aim for peace to be achieved. And that's why I'm saying that not only Europeans but other countries have the right and can take part. And we view this calmly,\" he said.Reactions to US -Russia talksPutin dismissed European concerns over last week's meeting between Russian and US officials in Riyadh, calling their reaction \"emotional.\" He framed the discussions as an effort to \"improve the level of trust\" between Moscow and Washington.\"Both in his recent phone conversation with Trump and at the meeting in Riyadh, problems related to the Ukrainian crisis were touched on,\" Putin said. \"But it was not discussed in essence. We just agreed that we will approach this.\"He described Trump's stance on Ukraine as \"cold reasoning\" and suggested that, if re-elected, the former US president would have \"his hands free\" to pursue his proposals.Putin mocks Zelenskyy, calls him ‘toxic’Putin also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , echoing Trump’s claim that he is unpopular and a \"dictator.\" He suggested that Zelenskyy was losing credibility among Ukraine's military for giving \"ridiculous orders\" and had become \"toxic in society as a whole.\"The Russian leader contrasted Zelenskyy with Ukraine’s former military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny, who was recently appointed Kyiv’s ambassador to London. Calling him a \"possible rival,\" Putin claimed Zaluzhny enjoyed higher approval ratings than the Ukrainian president.Putin’s comments come amid continued tensions over Ukraine and growing uncertainty over the future of US and European military aid to Kyiv.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/putin-calls-donald-trumps-proposal-to-halve-defence-spending-a-good-proposal-us-cuts-50-we-cut-50/articleshow/118543108.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-118543130/118543130.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:54:32","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":293982520,"title":"Making Ukraine’s Minerals Deal More Sustainable","text":"SLOVIANSK, UKRAINE - FEBRUARY 9: In an aerial view, a chalk quarry on Mount Karachun is seen in ... [+] front of the city on February 9, 2025 in Sloviansk, Ukraine. Such minerals may well be just as much in demand as rare earths (Photo by Viktor Fridshon/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images)\nGlobal Images Ukraine via Getty Images\n\nAt the press briefing today with French President Emmanuel Macron, President Donald Trump indicated that a deal on mineral resources with Ukraine was imminent. There were even suggestions that President Zelinsky could make a visit to Washington within a week to sign an agreement on the deal. As the negotiators work their way through the deal, it may be instructive to consider historical precedents for such a deal. Resource-backed financing is not a new idea. The Natural Resources Governance Institue evaluated 52 such agreements in 2020 (30 in Africa and 22 in Latin America) that were financed largely by China and some by Russia. What is different about the proposed deal between the United States and Ukraine is that it is taking place after the funding was given with no such strings attached. Indeed, the presumption had been that any payments to Ukraine’s allies for expenses would come from the $300 billion in Russia’s frozen assets in Western banks instead. Instead, these assets might now be used for reconstruction in Ukraine as well as those areas in the Russian controlled parts of the country.\n\nThe Minerals Deal could potentially be a win-win for both Ukraine and the United States if the agreement is framed around a broader plan for reconstruction and infrastructure development. While “rare earths” (as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey) are fashionably presented as the crown jewel in this deal, let us not lose perspective that the total rare earths market globally in 2023 was is only around $3.39 billion. Even if we use galloping growth rates for their demand, and include critical metals like gallium for chips, this will not come even close to the $500 billion estimates being presented for the deal. Other minerals which have been proposed for the deal due to their strategic importance for defense, energy generation or for infrastructure for artificial intelligence include graphite, uranium, titanium and lithium. All of these would be export-oriented minerals that the United States could potentially get preferential extraction rights for as well.\n\nThe wildly generous estimates of Ukrainian mineral reserves that are presented in some writings of around $26 trillion are unsubstantiated. In economic geology the difference between a “resource” (what may exist geologically) versus a “reserve” (what can be extracted with current technology in economically viable ways) is crucial. While Ukraine has extensive reserves of titanium, manganese, base metals and coal, there is no clear economically viable path for the extraction of the sum of half a trillion dollars being proposed in the deal for potential export to the United States. Furthermore, many of the mineral reserves are in Russian-controlled parts of the country and resource nationalism was clearly an additional reason for the war in the eastern part of the country.\n\nUkraine itself will need enormous quantities of minerals for its reconstruction and development and the United States should also include such minerals in its negotiations. Having American mining and construction companies involved in responsibly resourcing these minerals with environmental and social safeguards for domestic usage could help the Ukrainians while also boosting American investments. This would also create more of a multiplier effect for jobs in Ukraine and the United States, and has been studied for the country’s titanium industry. We need to configure the conversation in this mineral deal more broadly around industrial minerals, most of which will likely be base metals like copper, zinc, nickel but also other industrial minerals like chalk, gypsum, and aggregates. Such a wider canvass will also more likely add up to the $500 billion amount that President Trump wants recovered while helping Ukraine rebuild as well.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

But Macron had obviously been prepping with maybe a little weight training because he gripped Trump's hand so hard you could see the outline of his fingers in the flesh of Trump's hand for several moments after,' James recalled. \n\nShe then turned her attention to Monday's display noting that the leaders' 'rictus grins being performed shouldn't divert from the real action going on at waist height' as both Trump and Macron 'wanted to register superiority here.' \n\n'Trump's power-pat on Macron's shoulder is a control and pinning gesture that also hints at a parental-style dominance,' James said. 'Macron responds at once with a hand-clamp on Trump's bicep, suggesting he is not intimidated by the President's alpha posturing.'\n\n'The two men then lock hands in a \"death clasp\" muscular clamping of the hands,' James noted. \n\n'Macron slaps his left hand over the clasp to suggest control and then performs a Trump classic, the \"Shake and Yank,\" where the clasp is suddenly and relatively violently yanked either forward or backward, de-stabilizing your \"opponent\" by taking them off-balance,' James observed. \n\nIn this instance, Macron yanked backward, with Trump leaning forward, so Macron can re-position his hand on top. \n\n'As the two men turn to face the cameras Trump keeps a grim grip on Macron's hand, forcing the shake to last for several seconds and several extra shakes longer,' James noted. 'We can see how this firm clasp is more like a tussle than a gesture of mutual respect.' \n\nJames also noted that the next foreign leader to meet Trump needed to 'study the footage in detail.'\n\nTrump will host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House on Thursday. \n\n'Trump appears to be back in power-play body language mode again and Starmer has so far shown nothing like the level of Macron's skills when it comes to dealing with it,' James warned.","summary":"President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have again grabbed hands in such a way that the encounter has gone viral.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14431499/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-death-clasp-handshake.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/23/95547703-0-image-m-30_1740440839055.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2017/05/25/7899942192312830762/1024x576_MP4_7899942192312830762.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:43:30","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":293981544,"title":"Anthony Albanese insists his relationship with Donald Trump is 'rock solid'","text":"READ MORE: Voters abandon Albo in shock poll as support plummets to new low\n\nPODCAST: All the biggest news and insider gossip from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy ANTOINETTE MILIENOS FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 00:41 GMT, 25 February 2025 | Updated: 00:43 GMT, 25 February 2025\n\nAnthony Albanese has insisted the United States would defend Australia if the country was under attack despite a change in leadership. \n\nThe Prime Minister appeared on the ABC's Q&A program on Monday night and was grilled over a series of topics by 240 voters in the studio audience. \n\nHe faced topics on anti-Semitism, social cohesion, the cost of living, housing, immigration, extremism, climate change, foreign policy and even Donald Trump.\n\nHost Patricia Karvelas asked whether the US is an unequivocal ally to Australia. \n\n'We do, because we have an Anzus agreement and an alliance with the United States,' Mr Albanese said. \n\nAsked whether he believed the alliance was 'rock solid', Mr Albanese replied 'yes'.\n\nMs Karvelas asked: 'Nothing has made you question it?', to which Mr Albanese responded to with a resolute 'no'. \n\n'We of course need to ensure that we look after our own security, he continued. \n\nAnthony Albanese (pictured) said he believed the US would defend Australia despite having a change in leadership and having a different stance on the war between Ukraine and Russia\n\n'The US is an important ally of Australia, but we need to make sure our defence is up to scratch.'\n\nHe reinforced Australia's commitment to supporting Ukraine defend its sovereignty against Russia, despite the US moving to join North Korea and Belarus in voting against a United Nations resolution that blamed Russia for the war in Ukraine. \n\n'Australia decides what our position on Ukraine is,' Mr Albanese said. \n\n'The Australian position is very clear and that is we understand the struggle of the Ukrainian people is about their national sovereignty and it is also about the international rule of law.\n\n'If a big, powerful country can just go across borders, then the implications are global. We stand with the Ukrainian people.'\n\nMr Albanese was also queried over his government's response to a series of anti-Semitic attacks across the country. \n\nJewish mother-of-four Janet Abadee claimed 'nothing was done' in response to hate speech following the October 7 Hamas attack in Israel. \n\n'You have to understand, we're a broken community now,' she said. \n\nMr Albanese said Australia's relationship with the United States was 'rock solid'\n\nAnthony Albanese makes a stunning admission about his good mate Dan Andrews\n\n'We are hurting. You're our leader. There was hate speech and nothing was done. The hate speech happened after October 7, at the Sydney Opera House. Nothing was done. We've suffered because nothing was done.'\n\nShe asked Mr Albanese when it would be safe for members of the Jewish community to openly identify as Jews. \n\nThe prime minister said he 'unequivocally condemned' hate speech, labelling it as 'abhorrent' and 'completely unacceptable to the Australian ethos'. \n\nHe defended his government, arguing it was the first to pass laws outlawing Nazi symbols and hate speech, adding those who had broken the laws by attending anti-Semitic marches in capital cities had been prosecuted. \n\nMr Albanese told another Muslim audience member who was concerned about an escalation in violence that their 'family should feel safe here'. \n\nMuslim man Ahmad Al Shaimari said safety had been 'stripped away' after a Muslim women was strangled with her own hijab at a shopping centre earlier this month. \n\n'A woman should not be attacked for wearing a hijab. We need to work on social cohesion and respect for each other,' Mr Albanese said.\n\nOn Indigenous policy, the prime minister walked back his commitment to a truth-telling commission and treaty - the two parts of the Uluru Statement. \n\nEarlier in the segment, Jewish mother-of-four Janet Abadee (pictured) grilled Mr Albanese over his response to anti-Semitic attacks in Australia\n\nThe failure of a referendum to enshrine an Indigenous voice in the Constitution had to be respected, Mr Albanese said.\n\n'We've heard the statement from the Australian people, we're concentrating on economic empowerment,' he said.\n\n'We do need another direction.'\n\nMr Albanese's appearance on Q&A comes as Labor struggles in the polls and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton continues to gain ground. \n\nBut Roy Morgan has given Labor a light on the hill, putting it ahead 51-49 on a two-party preferred basis after the Reserve Bank cut interest rates.\n\nThe poll predicted a minority government with Labor's primary vote increased 3.5 per cent to 31.5. The coalition took a three per cent hit, dropping to 36.5 per cent, while support for independents remained at 10 per cent.\n\nAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpUkraine\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAnthony Albanese insists his relationship with Donald Trump is 'rock solid'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Anthony Albanese was asked if anything had made him question Australia's relationship with the United States.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14431365/Anthony-Albanese-donald-trump-australia.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/23/95547147-0-image-m-18_1740438823268.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:43:01","author":"Antoinette Milienos,Editor","authors":["Antoinette Milienos","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.175},{"id":293983946,"title":"Former US Rep.

I wouldn’t have wasted my time rooting for them. Eagles fan? Your team sucks,” the X user with the handle “Toxic Cowboy” wrote.\n\nKelly concurred, writing: “SAME. GO F YOURSELVES EAGLES.”\n\nThe TV and radio host wrote that she backed the Eagles because her husband, author Doug Brunt, “is a fan,” which was why she “got onboard.”\n\n“But F this BS,” Kelly added.\n\nA White House official told The Post that invites “haven’t even gone out.”\n\nThe Eagles declined to comment.\n\nClay Travis, founder of the sports news site Outkick, cited a White House source on Monday as telling him that the Eagles have not rejected an invite.\n\n“The reports that have gone viral on social media are fake news. The White House has not even sent the official invite to the Eagles yet,” Travis wrote on X.\n\nAn Eagles source told the US Sun earlier this month that the team plans to snub an invitation to the White House.\n\nThe newspaper cited a “well-placed insider” who said recent discussions between players and the front office resulted in a “massive no” over the question of whether the team would accept an invite from Trump this time around.\n\n“We focus on the game for now, but if we win the Super Bowl, we wouldn’t go to the White House,” the US Sun quoted one of the team’s owners as saying.\n\nA current player who remained anonymous told the publication that “pretty much everyone” decided they would refuse a Trump invite.\n\n“We represent a city and a state that is pushing for equal rights, respect, and values that respect every human being,” the Eagles star told the US Sun.\n\n“We won’t forget what happened and the criticism we received for taking a stand against racism, and we won’t back down from our values of respect, integrity, and equality.”\n\nIn 2018, during Trump’s first term, the Eagles, who had just come off their Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots, turned down an invitation from the White House.\n\nAt the time, the team released a statement saying that it disagreed “with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honour of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.”\n\nThe anthem controversy stems from an incident in 2016 when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt during the song in protest of policing tactics and racism.\n\nWhile many athletes joined the protest, critics — including Trump — argued it was disrespectful to the flag and military, prompting the NFL to implement policies aimed at discouraging on-field protests.\n\nKaepernick, who went unsigned after the 2016 season, later accused the league of blackballing him, leading to a settlement with the NFL in 2019 but leaving his football career effectively over.\n\nJeffrey Lurie, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, is known for his liberal political leanings and support for Democratic candidates and progressive causes.\n\nHe has donated to Democratic politicians, including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, and has spoken out on social justice issues, such as racial equality, LGBTQ rights and criminal justice reform.\n\nLurie has also allowed the Eagles organisation to be active in social justice initiatives, supporting players who have engaged in activism, including those who protested during the national anthem.\n\nUnlike some other NFL owners who have been aligned with Trump and conservative politics, Lurie has positioned himself as a progressive voice in the league, though he tends to keep his political views measured and not overly publicised compared to some other owners.\n\nHis political stance has sometimes led to controversy, particularly in a league where many owners lean conservative, but he has remained steadfast in his support for social change and player activism.\n\n— This story originally appeared on The New York Post and has been republished with permission","summary":"There has been an angry backlash against the Super Bowl champions with the team told to “go f*** yourselves” over Donald Trump rumours.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/sport/nfl/philadelphia-eagles-torched-as-donald-trump-rumours-swirl/news-story/03ee2c971114b55b838ed9f827c936df?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/88408870248e2397e4f306ed8de2060e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:37:32","author":"Emilee Chinn","authors":["Emilee Chinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":293978162,"title":"BBC Verify","text":"Skip to contentHomeNewsIsrael-Gaza WarWar in UkraineUS & CanadaUKUK PoliticsEnglandN.

A group called the State Democracy Defenders Fund and the California-based Altshuler Berzon law firm represent them.\n\nMusk's latest tactic to cull federal employees has raised concerns it could reveal classified information or violate government procedures.\n\n\"Federal employees have a duty to ensure that sensitive information, data, and records are only used and disclosed for authorized purposes,\" American Federation of Government Employees president Everett Kelley wrote to OPM leadership.\n\nMusk and his Department of Government Efficiency have taken aggressive action to cut down the federal workforce.

There are early indications that his term will end with a whimper. Trump’s latest tariff salvo has been on pharmaceuticals. He said drugs imported into the US could face an import duty of 25%. At the same time, he also said that he would give American drug companies some time to phase in domestic manufacture of the drugs currently being imported. Indian drug company stocks fell, irrationally. After all, the only immediate effect of US import duty on drug imports would be to raise the cost of healthcare in that country. There are no substitutes at present for the generic drugs that India supplies in large quantities. Indian drug exports should continue apace till local producers come up with similar drugs that are competitive against imports that bear a 25% import duty. And that would not happen anytime soon, if ever. Trump’s threat of reciprocal tariffs might force the government to lower some import duties, provided the tariffs are levied on product classes, rather than individual tariff lines. India levies an import duty of 50% on apples but exports none to the US. So, if the Trump administration were to levy a reciprocal duty of 50% on apples from India, it would not matter.

The Wisconsin-born Cardinal who could become the first American Pope","text":"Pope Francis' biggest critic, an anti-vaccine traditionalist papal lawyer who would be the first American pontiff, is among the frontrunners to replace him.\n\nCardinal Raymond Leo Burke, 76, is diametrically opposed to the pope's views on nearly all the contested issues facing the Catholic Church.\n\nDe-facto leader of the church's conservatives, he is outspoken against any softening of its policy towards LGBTQ people, divorce, and the role of women.\n\nFrancis became so at odds with Burke that he stripped him of his role as head of the Catholic courts, the panel that chooses judges, and even his free Rome apartment.\n\nAs the pope's health worsens amid a battle with pneumonia, Burke is likely the cardinal he would least want to see succeed him.\n\nCardinals are only eligible to vote or become pope until they turn 80, but though they are usually elected in their 60s, Francis himself was 76 when inaugurated, and his predecessor Benedict XVI was 78.\n\nBurke was born in a rural town in Wisconsin, the youngest of the six children to Thomas and Marie Burke, both of Irish Catholic heritage.\n\nHe grew up on a dairy farm until his father was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1955 when he was in second grade.\n\nAs Thomas Burke lay dying, he was regularly visited by a local priest to receive communion, which had a 'tremendous impression' on his son.\n\nBurke joined the Holy Cross Seminary in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and served as a parish priest and high school teacher there after he was ordained in 1975.\n\nHis bishop then sent him to the Gregorian University in Rome to study canon law, which Burke admitted he at first wasn't enthusiastic about. \n\nThat was until an older priest noticed how glum he was and took him under his wing. Burke became 'hooked' on canon law, and is now considered one of the foremost scholars of it.\n\nEventually he became Archbishop of St Louis in 2004 until 2008 when Benedict XVI called him to Rome to become the prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura - the church's highest court.\n\nBurke was made a cardinal two years later by the fellow conservative pontiff.\n\nIncreasingly prominent as a hardline traditionalist, Burke clashed with new reformist pope Francis within a year of him being inaugurated.\n\nFrancis in December 2013 declined to renew his membership of the Congregation of Bishops, a panel that helps the pope select new bishops. \n\n'One gets the impression, or it's interpreted this way in the media, that he thinks we're talking too much about abortion, too much about the integrity of marriage as between one man and one woman,' Burke responded.\n\n'But we can never talk enough about that.'\n\nHe was so incensed in October 2014 that the Vatican Synod on the Family conference proposed relaxing papal approach towards homosexuality, that he spoke out.\n\n'Many have expressed their concerns to me. At this very critical moment, there is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder,' he said.\n\n'They are feeling a bit seasick because they feel the church's ship has lost its way.'\n\nA preliminary report released from the confidential meeting revealed a proposal to sideline the 'all or nothing' attitude currently held by Catholics in respect of 'irregular' set-ups such as unmarried parents.\n\nIt added that there are 'positive elements' in gay relationships that have 'gifts and qualities' the Church should not reject.\n\nFrancis himself earlier that year also declared that Darwin's theory of evolution does not contradict the belief that God created the universe, and when asked about gay marriage replied: 'Who am I to judge?'\n\nThe pope responded by sacking Burke from the Supreme Tribunal and named him patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a largely ceremonial role, instead.\n\nFrancis at the time insisted he planned to make the change months earlier and he wasn't punishing Burke, but the events were widely seen as connected.\n\nJust three years later, Francis stripped Burke of all but his figurehead role at the Order over his plot to oust a senior official for authorizing a purchase of condoms for the people of Burma.\n\nThe pope sent a 'special delegate' to exercise the duties of the patron, and it was later confirmed Burke was 'de facto suspended'.\n\nBurke was outspoken in his condemnation of pedophile priests as the crisis engulfed the church, but repeatedly blamed it on feminism and homosexuality.\n\nHe in August 2015 claimed it was the fault of 'radical feminism which has assaulted the Church and society since the 1960s'.\n\nThen in 2019 he and German Cardinal Walter Brandmueller claimed the 'primary fault' for the scandal was 'the plague of the homosexual agenda', not the priests themselves.\n\nBurke claimed those priests who perpetrated abuse on children, 'were feminized and confused about their own sexual identity'.\n\nBurke's next major blowup with Pope Francis was in 2016 when he was one of four conservative cardinals to publicly challenge him on doctrine.\n\nThey sent Francis a set of 'dubia', or doubts, which they later made public when he failed to send a formal response.\n\nAt issue are some of the teachings in a 260-page treatise called 'Amoris Laetitia' (The Joy of Love), a cornerstone document of Francis' attempt to make the church more inclusive and less condemning.\n\nFrancis called for a church that was less strict and more compassionate towards any 'imperfect' members, such as those who divorced and remarried, saying 'no one can be condemned forever'. \n\nUnder church law they cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex with their new partner, because their first marriage is still valid in the eyes of the church and therefore they are seen to be living in an adulterous state of sin.\n\nFrancis appeared to side with progressives who proposed an 'internal forum' in which a priest or bishop decide jointly with the individual on a case-by-case basis if he or she can be fully reintegrated and receive communion.\n\nConservatives contested this and the four cardinals asked the pope to 'resolve those doubts which are the cause of disorientation and confusion'.\n\nA dubia is generally seen as a politely worded challenge to a pope's words, to which the pontiff can choose to issue a 'responda' to clarify his position.\n\nBurke hardened his stance after Francis didn't respond, threatening to 'formally correct' the pope on multiple occasions.\n\n'It is something that is clearly quite rare. But if there is no response to these questions, then I would say that it would be a question of taking a formal act of correction of a serious error,' he said.\n\nHe restated this in April 2018, insisting 'As a matter of duty, the pope can be disobeyed'.\n\nBurke and fellow conservative Athanasius Schneider then published a retort of what they saw as errors in the 2019 Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region agenda.\n\nThey wrote that it seemed 'not only in dissonance with respect to the authentic teaching of the Church, but even contrary to it'.\n\nThey claimed it included 'implicit pantheism' in its openness to pagan rituals by indigenous tribes, especially following Francis' earlier statements that 'diversity of religions' was 'willed by God'.\n\nThe pair also objected to what they claimed was support for married clergy and a greater role for women in the liturgy.\n\nBurke made strong claims about the consequences of allowing women a greater role in the church - even girls serving as altar servers.\n\n'Young boys don't want to do things with girls. It's just natural. The girls were also very good at altar service. So many boys drifted away over time,' he said.\n\nHe claimed the church was being 'feminized' and that 'radical feminism' had 'assaulted the Church and society since the 1960s has left men very marginalized'.\n\nSo too was Burke's condemnation of same-sex marriage when the issue was being debated in the US, and he urged Catholics not to vote for any politician who supported it.\n\n'There is only one place these types of lies come from, namely Satan,' he claimed.\n\n'It is a diabolical situation which is aimed at destroying individuals, families, and eventually our nation.'\n\nBurke was also an outspoken critic of Covid vaccines during the pandemic, as some of them used stem cell research in their development.\n\nHe even amplified the bizarre and debunked conspiracy theory that the vaccines contained microchips that allowed people to 'be controlled by the state regarding health and about other matters which we can only imagine'.\n\nBurke also falsely claimed the vaccine was a sinister plot to 'advance their evil agenda' to help along another conspiracy their, the 'Great Reset'. \n\nHe later caught a serious case of Covid himself and was put on a ventilator for about a week, but eventually recovered.\n\nOne of the issues Francis and Burke are not at odds about is abortion, which Catholics widely condemn, but has criticized him for focusing more on other issues.\n\nBurke went so far as to call for American bishops to deny communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, such as John Kerry and Joe Biden, whom he singled out.\n\nHe claimed not doing so 'is weakening the faith of everyone. It's giving the impression that it must be morally correct to support procured abortion'.\n\nBurke's traditionalism extends to his insistence on using the Tridentine Mass, which dates to the 1500s and is delivered in Latin.\n\nFrancis in 2021 restricted the circumstances in which it was allowed to be used, claiming it was a rallying point for traditionalist resistance to the modernizing changes of the 1962 Second Vatican Council.\n\nBurke called the restrictions 'severe and revolutionary' and questioned the pope's authority to issue them in a lengthy rebuttal.\n\nSuch traditionalist positions led to a kerfuffle when he was photographed wearing a galero, an outdated brimmed hat that cardinals used to wear.\n\nBurke tried to clear this up to the National Catholic Register in 2015, saying it was a gift from the organizer of a conference on the liturgy he attended at a diocese in the south of Italy.\n\n'I have no idea where he got it from. I held it in my hand and obviously had no intention of wearing it regularly, but he asked me to put it on to take at least one photo,' he said.\n\n'This was the only time I put that hat on my head, but, unfortunately, that picture has been published all over the world, and some use it to give the impression that I go around like that. But I've never worn it, not even for a ceremony.'\n\nBoth the pope and Burke have repeatedly insisted they don't consider each other 'enemies', despite their frequent clashes.\n\nFrancis explicitly said 'I do not see Cardinal Burke as an enemy' in 2017 after the fallout from the previous year's dubia.\n\nThe pope later denied a report that he called Burke an enemy during a meeting with Vatican department heads on November 20, 2023, to discuss his punishment for his latest criticism of the pope.\n\nThe previous month, he had again challenge Francis on blessings for same-sex couples and communion for divorced Catholics.\n\nFrancis responded this time, with a letter doubling down by partially revoking a ban on priests giving blessings to gay couples - ruling they could do so as long as they didn't imply the relationship was equivalent to heterosexual marriage.\n\nThe meeting decided Burke had used his privileges against the church, and stripped him of his rent-free apartment in Rome, and €5,000 monthly stipend.\n\nBurke vowed to remain in Rome even if he had to fork out for his own accommodation, but continued to deny Francis was his enemy.\n\n'It's clear that the pope doesn't want me in any leadership position, that he doesn't see me as the kind of person he wants to be giving any strong direction to things,' he told the New York Times.\n\n'But I've never had the impression that he thinks I'm his enemy.\n\n'When I saw what I judged to be harmful directions in the church, when I saw this whole discussion in the synod on the family calling into question the foundations of the church's teaching on human sexuality, I had to speak up because it was my duty.'\n\nBurke in the same interview tried to play down his association with Donald Trump ally, and staunch Catholic, Steve Bannon.\n\nHe served on the board of Bannon's right-wing Catholic activist training group Dignitatis Humanae Institute, until he resigned in 2019 and cut ties with Bannon over his plan to make a film adaptation of In the Closet of the Vatican.\n\nBurke said they only met three or four times 'to discuss Catholic teaching', as any priest would with 'a member of the lay faithful'.\n\nWho are the other candidates?\n\nBurke is one of a handful of candidates from across the theological spectrum considered contenders to replace Francis if his illness proves fatal.\n\nFrancis' death would summon all cardinals under 80, currently 138 of the 252, to The Vatican for conclave, where they are locked inside for about two or three weeks to choose a new pope.\n\nThe last conclave was in March 2013, when Francis was chosen after Benedict XVI resigned, the first to do so in 600 years, citing ill health.\n\nCardinals repeatedly vote in secret ballots in the Sistine Chapel until one candidate has at least two-thirds support, and accepts their nomination.\n\nPietro Parolin\n\nParolin, 70, as Vatican secretary of state, is the highest-ranking eligible cardinal as everyone ahead of him in precedence is too old to qualify.\n\nThe Italian has held the role since 2013 and is considered a moderate, between Francis' liberal leanings and Burke's traditionalism.\n\n'Everyone can contribute to peace, but solutions must never be pursued through unilateral impositions that risk trampling on the rights of entire peoples, otherwise, there will never be a just and lasting peace,' he said in a recent interview.\n\nBurke and Erdö, 72, will likely split the conservative vote in early ballots as both are hardliners, and one will have to drop out and support the other.\n\nErdö, a Hungarian in the mold of his far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán, is such a hardliner he likened accepting refugees to human trafficking.\n\nLike Burke, he is opposed to supporting same-sex couples, and believes marriage is insoluble without an annulment granted by the church, thus banning remarried Catholics from communion.\n\nHe was made a cardinal in 2003 by Pope John Paul II.\n\nLuis Antonio Tagle\n\nTagle, a Filipino cardinal, becoming pope would be another first for the office, as there has never been a pontiff from Asia. \n\nHe is the youngest of the favorites at 67 and thus could have a longer papacy than his competitors and leave a bigger mark on the church.\n\nHe is pro-prefect for the section of first evangelization of the Dicastery for Evangelization, one of the church's departments.\n\nTagle is a liberal cardinal with similar views on contentious issues to Francis.\n\n'The harsh words that were used in the past to refer to gays and divorced and separated people, the unwed mothers etc, in the past they were quite severe,' he wrote in 2015.\n\n'Many people who belonged to those groups were branded and that led to their isolation from the wider society.' \n\nMatteo Zuppi \n\nZuppi, 69, would represent the strongest continuity between Francis as he is considered to be one of the pope's favorites.\n\nOnly made a cardinal in 2019, the Italian was sent on a peace mission to Ukraine where he met president Volodymyr Zelensky, and with then-US president Joe Biden.\n\nHe appears to have liberal leanings like Francis and Tagle, and once referred to LGBTQ Catholics as 'our LGBT brothers and sisters'.","summary":"Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, 76, is Pope Francis' biggest critic, an anti-vaccine traditionalist papal lawyer who

gossip from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy GEOFF EARLE, DEPUTY U.S. POLITICAL EDITOR\n\nPublished: 19:53 GMT, 24 February 2025 | Updated: 00:28 GMT, 25 February 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday there was ‘a lot of genius’ behind Elon Musk’s push to require every federal worker to submit five bullet points on what they did last week – and brandished the threat of firing people who don't comply.\n\nThat came just minutes before a government email told agency heads that the email demand that went out to 2 million federal employees was voluntary and wouldn't result in termination. \n\nTrump's comments at the White House, with French President Emmanuel Macron, came after Musk's extraordinary call for feds to justify what they did last week, under threat of termination.\n\nMusk's move prompted some of the first internal pushback against the DOGE head inside the Trump administration. New FBI Director Kash Patel and other agency heads told employees not to reply to the email. \n\nHowever, Trump himself called the idea for the email 'ingenious.' \n\nThe email from an HR address at the Office of Personnel Management began arriving in millions of federal employees' mailboxes on Saturday, setting off uncertainty and conflicting statements from top officials.\n\nGiving his backing on Monday, Trump said: ‘We're trying to find out if people are working, and so we're sending a letter to people: Please tell us what you did last week.\n\n'If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working,. And then if you don’t answer, like you’re sort of semi-fired, or you're fired, because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist.' \n\nMusk had posted on his X platform Saturday: 'All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' \n\nTrump appeared to back up Musk’s threat to fire people if they don’t comply.\n\nMusk spent millions helping to get Trump elected and now heads the Department of Governmental Efficiency, which is combing agencies for data and pushing for firings to reduce the size of the bureacracy. \n\nIf people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working,’ President Donald Trump said while defending Musk's post and the email to millions of federal workers\n\nThe President also connected the issue to his plan to visit Fort Knox to inspect U.S. gold supplies, a probe also pushed by Musk. \n\n‘Are we paying other people that aren't working…Where's the money gone? We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far, and we've just started,' he said. \n\n'We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold – tons of gold,’ Trump said.\n\nThere is no evidence that the 147.3 million troy ounces of gold stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky has been stolen,.\n\nTrump's Treasury secretary said last week there are annual audits, and there have been occasional high-profile visits.\n\nMusk's weekend email request rattled federal workers, who are already contending with firings of thousands of 'provisional' employees – those who joined the workforce in the last year or two who don't have the same protections of more senior workers.\n\nOne Pentagon official called it 'the silliest thing I've seen in 40 years' and said it 'completely usurps the chain of command.' \n\nThe email from the OPM did not contain the firing threat. 'Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,' it said.\n\nAdding still more confusion to the situation as a Monday midnight deadline approached, OPM told agency leaders that a failure to respond would not constitute resignation, the Hill reported. \n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called on OPM to clarify that failure to respond does not constitute resignation. \n\nMust posted the email demand on Saturday, after a week when federal agencies fired thousands of provisional workers\n\nMusk is also threatening to force out people who refuse to return to the office \n\nThe move drew pushback from employee unions\n\nMusk's email was titled 'What did you do last week?' \n\nThe email came from the human resources department at OPM, but some federal workers tell DailyMail.com that not all of their colleagues have received the message\n\nThe billionaire Tesla founder revealed on Sunday he was simply eager 'to see who had a pulse and two working neurons' amid concerns that some government workers have it so good that they don't even check their emails\n\n'This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants,' wrote Connolly, whose Virginia district includes many federal employees.\n\nPatel told FBI employees to 'pause any responses.'\n\nOther agencies telling their workers not to respond include the State Department, the Dense Department, the National Security Agency, and others. \n\nIn contrast, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy published his own five-point list of accomplishments, after a week where a Delta flight had a fiery upside down crash landing in Toronto. \n\nBorder agents issue blistering response to DOGE email demanding a list of 'accomplishments'\n\nTrump himself appeared to carve out an exception for classified information, while papering over any tensions between agency heads and Musk.\n\n'That was done in a friendly manner – only things such as perhaps Marco [Rubio] at State Department, where they have very confidential things, or the FBI, where they're working on confidential things.

New FBI Director Kash Patel and other agency heads had already told employees not to reply to the email. \n\nThe email from an HR address at the Office of Personnel Management began arriving in millions of federal employees' mailboxes on Saturday, setting off uncertainty and conflicting statements from top officials.\n\nGiving his backing on Monday, Trump said: ‘We're trying to find out if people are working, and so we're sending a letter to people: Please tell us what you did last week.\n\n'If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working,. And then if you don’t answer, like you’re sort of semi-fired, or you're fired, because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist.' \n\nMusk had posted on his X platform Saturday: 'All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.' \n\nTrump appeared to back up Musk’s threat to fire people if they don’t comply.\n\nMusk spent millions helping to get Trump elected and now heads the Department of Governmental Efficiency, which is combing agencies for data and pushing for firings to reduce the size of the bureacracy. \n\nHealth and Human Services employees were told to assume that 'what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly.' That came after the FBI Director told his employees to hit pause amid concerns about sending classified information\n\nThe President also connected the issue to his plan to visit Fort Knox to inspect U.S. gold supplies, a probe also pushed by Musk. \n\n‘Are we paying other people that aren't working…Where's the money gone? We have found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud so far, and we've just started,' he said. \n\n'We're actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there, because maybe somebody stole the gold – tons of gold,’ Trump said.\n\nThere is no evidence that the 147.3 million troy ounces of gold stored at the U.S. Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky has been stolen,.\n\nTrump's Treasury secretary said last week there are annual audits, and there have been occasional high-profile visits.\n\nMusk's weekend email request rattled federal workers, who are already contending with firings of thousands of 'provisional' employees – those who joined the workforce in the last year or two who don't have the same protections of more senior workers.\n\nOne Pentagon official called it 'the silliest thing I've seen in 40 years' and said it 'completely usurps the chain of command.' \n\nThe email from the OPM did not contain the firing threat. 'Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,' it said.\n\nAdding still more confusion to the situation as a Monday midnight deadline approached, OPM told agency leaders that a failure to respond would not constitute resignation, the Hill reported. \n\nRep. Gerry Connolly, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called on OPM to clarify that failure to respond does not constitute resignation. \n\nMust posted the email demand on Saturday, after a week when federal agencies fired thousands of provisional workers\n\nMusk is also threatening to force out people who refuse to return to the office \n\nThe move drew pushback from employee unions\n\nMusk's email was titled 'What did you do last week?' \n\nThe email came from the human resources department at OPM, but some federal workers tell DailyMail.com that not all of their colleagues have received the message\n\nThe billionaire Tesla founder revealed on Sunday he was simply eager 'to see who had a pulse and two working neurons' amid concerns that some government workers have it so good that they don't even check their emails\n\n'This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr. Musk is inflicting on the people’s government and its dedicated public servants,' wrote Connolly, whose Virginia district includes many federal employees.\n\nPatel told FBI employees to 'pause any responses.'\n\nOther agencies telling their workers not to respond include the State Department, the Dense Department, the National Security Agency, and others. \n\nIn contrast, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy published his own five-point list of accomplishments, after a week where a Delta flight had a fiery upside down crash landing in Toronto. \n\nBorder agents issue blistering response to DOGE email demanding a list of 'accomplishments'\n\nTrump himself appeared to carve out an exception for classified information, while papering over any tensions between agency heads and Musk.\n\n'That was done in a friendly manner – only things such as perhaps Marco [Rubio] at State Department, where they have very confidential things, or the FBI, where they're working on confidential things. And they don't mean that in any way combative with Elon. They're just saying there are some people that you don't want to really have them tell you what they're working on last week. But other than that, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea,' Trump said.\n\nFBIElon MuskPoliticsDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nOPM head undermines Elon Musk's productivity email despite Trump firing threat as HHS warns of 'malign foreign actors'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Minutes after President Trump said federal workers would be 'fired' or 'semi-fired' if they didn't employ with an Elon Musk email demand, they were told they would face no such sanction.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14432127/Elon-Musk-productivity-email-foreign-actors-warning-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/19/95540651-0-image-a-12_1740426784941.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/24/7205975190504620762/1024x576_MP4_7205975190504620762.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:27:41","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":293984732,"title":"Jamie Dimon says he hopes DOGE is successful because the US government is 'not very competent'","text":"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he has a \"wait-and-see attitude\" regarding the Trump administration and the White House DOGE office, but he's hopeful DOGE will succeed.\"More effective government — more efficient government — isn't bad.

Sir Keir has previously said he would be willing to put British troops on the ground as part of security guarantees that could end the war.\n\nAddressing reporters alongside Mr Macron, Mr Trump said of the Russian president’s reaction to peacekeepers in Ukraine: “Yeah, he will accept it.\n\n“I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for world war.”\n\nEarlier this month, Sir Keir wrote in The Daily Telegraph that the UK was “ready to play a leading role” in Ukraine’s defence and security.\n\n“It also means being ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary,” he said.\n\n“I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm’s way”.\n\nRussian officials have previously said that Moscow will not allow Nato or European troops to be deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers.\n\nMr Trump also expressed hope that Volodymyr Zelensky could come to the US to sign a deal to give the US access to Ukraine’s critical minerals in the coming weeks.\n\nSir Keir has been urged to follow Mr Macron and be “firm and robust” with Mr Trump after the French leader appeared to correct the US President on an assertion about European aid to Kyiv.\n\nFormer first minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf told BBC’s Newsnight that the PM should “look at Macron’s performance” and “see that Macron was forceful, robust, firm when he had to be and at the same time, clearly had a good relationship and rapport with President Trump”.\n\nMr Yousaf said that nobody would be expecting a “Hugh Grant Love Actually moment”, referring to the film scene where a fictional British prime minister stands up to the US, but added: “We do need him to be robust around correcting Donald Trump and any of the inaccuracies should he repeat them, such as Zelensky being a dictator”.\n\nSir Keir avoided directly criticising the US leader last week after he called Mr Zelensky a “dictator”, but did back the president in a call in which he called him the “democratically elected leader” of Ukraine.\n\nSir Keir marked the third anniversary of the conflict on a call with other allies of Kyiv, telling them that Mr Putin “does not hold all the cards in this war”.\n\nIt was an apparent response to Mr Trump’s remarks last week that Russia has “the cards” in any peace talks because it has “taken a lot of territory”.\n\nSeparately, he told G7 leaders that “a US backstop will be vital to deter Russia from launching another invasion in just a few years’ time”.\n\nMr Trump has been demanding Europe spend more on defence and Sir Keir is also facing pressure to use this week’s trip to confirm a timeline to raise UK spending to 2.5% of GDP.\n\nElsewhere, the president of the Ukrainian World Congress told a London crowd that “no ally should pressure Ukraine to surrender”.\n\nIn a pre-recorded speech, Paul Grod told a Trafalgar Square vigil marking the third anniversary of the invasion that “you cannot negotiate with someone who is seeking to destroy you”.\n\nThe president of the international non-governmental organisation (NGO), which represents Ukrainian communities in more than 60 countries, described “the horrors, the systemic kidnapping, the torture, and the abuse of Ukraine’s most vulnerable, its children”.\n\n“No tyrant can be allowed to redraw borders by force, no ally should pressure Ukraine to surrender,” he said.\n\n“This is not a conflict where deals can be made, you cannot negotiate with someone who is seeking to destroy you.\n\n“Today we face a troubling moment – for the first time since Russia’s full-scale invasion, the United States has begun to waver.\n\n“This week the US refused to co-sponsor a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s war – this is unacceptable.

He has no problem with it.’ \n\nIf confirmed by Russia, the move would represent the Kremlin’s first concession since talks began – and would suggest Putin was serious about ending the war. \n\nIt would also pave the way for a significant UK contribution, alongside France – but not the United States – to a multinational force in Ukraine. \n\nMilitary experts have suggested the British force could be as large as 15,000 personnel and would include RAF jets and a Royal Navy force in the Black Sea, as well as ground troops. \n\nSuch a commitment would cost billions annually and require an increase in UK defence spending. \n\nMr Macron said peace ‘must not mean a surrender of Ukraine, or ceasefire without guarantees’, adding: ‘It must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders regarding the issues that affects it.’ \n\nMilitary experts have suggested the British force in Ukraine could be as large as 15,000 personnel and would include RAF jets and a Royal Navy force\n\nDonald Trump with French President Emmanuel Macron. Mr Trump suggested that Vladimir Putin had told him he had 'no problem' with a post-peace deal stabilisation force\n\nMr Trump said the negotiations with Putin were ongoing, adding ‘My whole life is deals, that’s all I know’. \n\nHe said: ‘I really believe that he wants to make a deal. I may be wrong, but I believe that he wants to make a deal.’ \n\nMeanwhile, Putin has said he is ready to collaborate with the US on rare earth metals production. He told state TV that a US-Ukraine deal involving the minerals was not a concern. \n\nIt came as the US made history at the United Nations by voting with Russia and North Korea and against its allies. The US voted against a UN resolution proposed by Britain demanding the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and calling Russia an ‘aggressor’. \n\nThe resolution received 93 votes in favour, with the United Kingdom and most European nations supporting it. Eighteen countries opposed it. \n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office during Mr Macron’s visit, Mr Trump said: ‘I think the war [in Ukraine] could end soon, within weeks, if we’re smart. If we’re not smart, it will keep going. We don’t want that. Remember what I said – this could escalate into a Third World War and we don’t want that either.’ \n\nMr Trump reiterated that he intended to meet Putin for talks on Ukraine but added: ‘I don’t know when we’ll speak. At some point I’ll be meeting [him].’ \n\nMr Macron also said there was ‘good reason’ to re-engage with Putin. ‘Being strong and having deterrence capacities is the only way to be sure it [an agreement] will be respected,’ he added. ‘I believe that the US has the capacity to do so.’ \n\nBefore speaking to President Trump, Mr Macron spoke to Keir Starmer to coordinate European diplomatic efforts. The French president said Europe was willing to ‘step up’ on defence. \n\nSir Keir, who is due to visit the White House on Thursday, came under mounting pressure last night to prevent a ‘dirty deal’ between the US President and Putin – and to finally increase UK defence spending. \n\nMembers of NATO's Allied Reaction Force (ARF) take part in Exercise Steadfast Dart 25 in a Romanian camp on February 19\n\nMr Trump reiterated that he would at 'some point' meet Vladimir Putin for talks on Ukraine\n\nHow Trump and Macron's 'bromance' soured over Ukraine as Putin drives visible wedge between the leaders\n\nLast week, Mr Trump stunned allies when he described Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky as ‘a dictator’. \n\nWhen asked yesterday if he would characterise Putin similarly, Mr Trump declined, saying: ‘I don’t use those words lightly, we’ll see how it all works out.’ \n\nMr Zelensky is expected to visit Washington ‘this week or next’, according to Mr Trump, to sign a deal over US access to Ukrainian minerals. The agreement is expected to be tied to long-term security guarantees from the US. \n\nMr Trump and his team have been negotiating the deal with Ukraine to recoup some of the money the Biden administration sent to Kyiv in the form of weapons to repel Russia. \n\nMr Zelensky last week rejected US demands for $500 billion (£396 million) in mineral wealth, saying the US had supplied nowhere near that sum and offered no specific security guarantees. \n\nBut these issues have apparently been overcome. Mr Zelensky yesterday proposed an exchange of all prisoners of war with Russia as the ‘start’ of a process on ending the conflict. \n\nSir Keir remotely attended a meeting in Kyiv of heads of government who have supported Ukraine. \n\nIn his speech, the Prime Minister claimed Russia ‘does not hold all the cards in the war’. \n\nVolodymyr Zelensky (pictured) is expected to visit Washington ‘this week or next’, according to Mr Trump, to sign a deal over US access to Ukrainian minerals\n\nHe added: ‘This is a time for unity. In this crucial moment as talks begin we must work together to shape the outcome.’ \n\nFormer prime minister Boris Johnson called out Mr Trump’s ‘big, fat, steaming lies’ over Ukraine but said there was ‘method in [his] madness’. \n\nHe said: ‘You know how ugly and unpleasant it is, to hear some of the misrepresentations that have come out of Washington the last ten days or so, really peddling the Kremlin line. \n\n'But I remain optimistic nonetheless, that there is method in Donald Trump’s madness, and actually that by shaking things up in the way that he is, he can continue to drive the process of peace in Ukraine.’ \n\nRussiaNATOVladimir PutinDonald Trump\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nProspect of UK troops being deployed to Ukraine a step closer - as Donald Trump says Vladimir Putin backs a Nato peace force\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Military experts have suggested the British force could be as large as 15,000 personnel and would include RAF jets and a Royal Navy force in the Black Sea, as well as ground troops.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14432245/Prospect-UK-troops-deployed-Ukraine-step-closer-Donald-Trump-says-Vladimir-Putin-backs-Nato-peace-force.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/25/00/95548843-0-image-m-121_1740442687039.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:21:48","author":"Editor,Jason Groves,Mark Nicol","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves","Mark Nicol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":293979510,"title":"World News | Trump Reiterates False Claim That US Spent More on Russia-Ukraine Conflict Than Europe","text":"Washington DC [US], February 25 (ANI): US President Donald Trump in a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron said that the US is spending much more money on the war in Ukraine than other countries in Europe on Monday (local time), CNN reported.\n\"The United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other nation,\" Trump said at a joint news conference with Macron, as per CNN.\nAlso Read | American Airlines Plane Bomb Hoax: Flight AA-292 Travelling From New York to Delhi Diverted to Italy After Threat Email, FIR Registered.\n\"We've spent more than USD 300 billion, and Europe has spent about 100 --USD 100 billion.

The question of his popularity was raised last week by US President Donald Trump, who branded Zelensky a “dictator without elections” who is “down at a 4% approval rating.”\n\nSpeaking on Monday, Putin noted that Zelensky’s popularity is significantly lower than that of potential rival General Valery Zaluzhny, the former commander of Ukraine’s armed forces. In an interview with journalist Pavel Zarubin, Putin suggested that if other political figures backed Zaluzhny, Zelensky’s chances of reelection would be “absolutely zero.”\n\n“They are equal to zero. Unless, of course, something is grossly rigged, but this is also bad for him – it will be very noticeable,” Putin stated.\n\n“The fact is that the current head of the Kiev regime is becoming a toxic figure for the Ukrainian armed forces because he gives absurd orders dictated not by military considerations, but by political ones, and it is unclear what they are based on,” Putin said. He added that Zelensky’s leadership had resulted in “unjustifiably large or catastrophic losses,” making him “toxic for society as a whole.”\n\n“Therefore, [Zelensky] is a factor in the disintegration of the army, society, and the state. And President Trump certainly understands this and is pushing him toward elections,” Putin said, adding that Trump apparently “wants to improve the political situation in Ukraine, consolidate society, and create conditions for the survival of the Ukrainian state.”\n\nPutin has repeatedly said that he no longer considers Zelensky the legitimate head of state. Trump has also recently questioned Zelensky's leadership, accusing him of mismanaging the conflict with Russia and misusing American financial aid.\n\nZelensky accused Trump of falling for “Russian disinformation,” citing a January poll that allegedly indicated 57% of Ukrainians trusted him. However, data cited by The Economist last week suggested that Zelensky would lose to Zaluzhny by a wide margin if elections were held today, as many Ukrainians are “clearly frustrated with their war leader.”\n\nAccording to Putin, Zelensky – who has banned himself from talks with Moscow – is actively sabotaging any peace process, as it would require lifting martial law, which allows him to remain in power. Without martial law, the country would be compelled to hold elections, a scenario Putin believes Zelensky is determined to avoid.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has “absolutely no chance” of winning a fair election \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/russia/613257-zelensky-elections-zero-chance-putin/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67bd0ab22030274bce514177.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:19:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":293982360,"title":"Rachel Zegler Says Backlash for ‘Snow White’ Comments Is “Passion” for the Disney Character","text":"Rachel Zegler acknowledged the backlash against her years-old comments about Disney’s Snow White live-action remake, attributing the kerfuffle to fan passion for the princess. \n\n Zegler will star as the titular Snow White in the upcoming film. Her casting, first announced in 2021, was met with outrage due to her Colombian descent. The racism was then fomented when Zegler called the original 1937 version of the film “dated” and said the prince “literally stalks” the princess. When the actress spoke out against Donald Trump’s election last year, the MAGA coalition vowed to boycott the film’s release. \n\n “I interpret people’s feelings about this film as a passion for it,” Zegler said this week in an interview with Vogue Mexico (translated to English by The Hollywood Reporter). “What an honor to be part of something that people feel so passionate about,” she continued. “We’re not always going to have the same feelings as everyone around us, and all we can do is give the best of ourselves.” \n\n Zegler also added that it was a “beautiful experience” watching young Black girls see Halle Bailey helm the live action Little Mermaid in 2023. In the interview, Zegler spoke candidly about her Colombian heritage. \n\n “I understand that the community doesn’t want to be seen as a monolith, but the reality of being Latino and working in this industry is that we try to represent the entire diaspora,” she said. “I know where I have been, I represent it in my narrative and I carry it in my heart every day.” \n\n The West Side Story actress went on to speak about differences to expect between the 19th and 20th century versions of the Snow White film. “It’s very important for the public to know that Disney has found this beautiful and delicate balance between the animated classic that everyone knows and loves from 1937, and at the same time, introduces it to this new generation,” she said. \n\n This balance, Zegler said, comes from the princess’ character. “Her superpower is her heart,” she said. “There is no supernatural power that Snow White possesses beyond her love for humanity, for all living creatures and her fundamental belief that there is goodness in everything. That’s something I really believe the world could take advantage of more.” \n\n Snow White releases in theaters March 21.","summary":"\"All we can do is give the best of ourselves,\" Zegler said.","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/rachel-zegler-backlash-snow-white-comments-passion-1236145897/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RachelZeglerGettyImages-2198944515.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:17:07","author":"Zoe G Phillips,Zoe G.

Musk responded by having the Office of Personnel Management send an email to more than two million federal workers asking them to submit five bullet points explaining what they accomplished in their jobs over the last week.\n\nThe directive, however, quickly met resistance across several agencies where Trump-appointed and Senate-confirmed officials are now in place. The departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security all told workers to disregard the email or wait for further instructions, as did the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Department of Homeland Security told employees it would reply to OPM on their behalf.\n\nTrump downplayed the disconnect, saying that agencies were simply concerned about “confidential things” being revealed in the emails, rather than pushing back on the broader accountability effort. The email to employees warned not to include classified information in their response.\n\nMusk’s increasingly drastic efforts to put pressure on the federal workforce as part of DOGE’s broad push to scale back the size of the U.S. government have drawn protests from employee unions, Democrats in Congress and even constituents in Republican-leaning districts. But the productivity report mandate marked the first significant pushback from within the ranks of Trump allies running the government.\n\nMusk, who was the largest donor to efforts to elect Trump last year, has demonstrated he wields considerable access to the Oval Office in the president’s first month. In shielding Musk’s work from legal challenges, the government has said he’s only an adviser with no direct authority.\n\nStill, Musk’s hand has been evident. An earlier email asking employees to volunteer for a deferred resignation program had the subject “A Fork in the Road” — the same metaphor Musk used to downsize at Twitter, the social media site he has since rebranded as X. The subject of the weekend email was “What did you do last week?” — a frequent question he asks to executives at his private companies.\n\nMusk has also threatened federal employees with suspension if they don’t return to the office this week after four years of COVID-era work-from home policies.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Government lawyers ‘don’t know’","text":"Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t know, or won’t say, even in a courtroom when confronted by a judge, who is running the so-called U.S. DOGE Service, which Elon Musk and his team of engineers are using to wreak havoc across federal agencies.\n\nDuring a hearing in Washington, D.C. on DOGE’s access to Department of Treasury records on Monday, government lawyers couldn’t answer whether an administrator for the agency even exists.\n\n“Is there an administrator of DOGE at the present time?” asked Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.\n\n “I don’t know the answer to that,” Department of Justice trial counsel Bradley Humphreys replied.\n\nThe question is the latest failed attempt to get, on the record, a clear understanding of the role of the world’s wealthiest man within the Trump administration, which is deploying Musk to gut federal agencies of thousands of workers and block the transfer of congressionally approved funds in a crusade against “waste” and “fraud” with little evidence to show for it.\n\nA breakneck effort to hold the administration accountable in court has been met with what appears to be a rapid attempt among administration officials and government lawyers to obfuscate the true nature of Musk’s role. \n\nLast week, a judge in a separate case noted that DOGE is trying to “escape” the “obligations that accompany agencyhood” — including being subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedures Act — “while reaping only its benefits.”\n\nTrump’s administration is facing an avalanche of lawsuits alleging the president and Musk have launched a constitutional wrecking ball, flying in the face of checks and balances and usurping authority to dismantle entire federal agencies without any action from Congress.\n\nBut according to the White House, the buck stops with Trump.\n\nMusk is merely an employee of the White House, serving as a “senior adviser to the president,” who has “no greater authority other than other senior White House advisers [have], and has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” according to a sworn statement from a senior White House official on February 18.\n\nThe next day, when a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt who, then, exactly, is the administrator for DOGE, she called him a “special government employee within the executive office of the president, and the agencies are directing the cuts and … the wasteful spending.”\n\nThat same day, Trump himself appeared to contradict Leavitt and his own administration’s sworn statement when he stated: “I signed an order creating the Department of Government Efficiency, and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.”\n\nBy the weekend, Musk declared federal employees must answer an email from the government’s HR agency or they would be fired, throwing agencies into chaos and drawing a series of contradictory messages from agency officials.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump renamed the existing United States Digital Service to the U.S. DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency. Groups suing Musk and DOGE argue that Musk has assumed so much power that he appears to be violating the Constitution’s appointments clause, which requires senior executive branch officials to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Manhattan blocked DOGE from accessing the Treasury Department’s payment systems while a legal challenge plays out.\n\nA judge in Washington, D.C. last week declined to block Musk from his work, but noted that plaintiffs in that case “legitimately call into question what appears to be the unchecked authority of an unelected individual and an entity that was not created by Congress and over which it has no oversight.”\n\nAnd on Monday, another judge blocked DOGE from accessing Department of Education information.\n\n“Isn’t there some problem, if there’s no administrator, as to how USDS functions?” Judge Kollar-Kotelly asked Monday.\n\n“Who supervises them, who comes up with ideas?” the judge asked. “Who’s telling them what to do?”\n\nBased on the “limited record” in front of her, Kollar-Kotelly said she has “some concerns about the constitutionality of USDS structure and operations.”\n\nIn a letter to Trump last week, after the White House told a court that Musk is not even an employee of DOGE, House Oversight Committee Democrat Gerry Connolly demanded further clarification on Musk’s role.\n\nHe told the president either “you are lying” or a top White House official perjured himself — “a criminal offense that can lead to up to five years in prison,” Connolly wrote.\n\nAsked about the constitutionality of DOGE’s role during a White House meeting with Emanuel Macron on Monday, Trump fired back that DOGE “has nothing to do with the Constitution.”\n\n“The radical left, or whoever it may be, starts screaming about the Constitution, but has nothing to do with the Constitution,” he said.","summary":"Judges are raising constitutional alarms about the role of the world’s wealthiest man","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-doge-administrator-trump-b2703927.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/24/23/21/FILES-US-POLITICS-TRUMP-MUSK-uxujq6zo.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8YADukcK-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:14:19","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":293984416,"title":"Trump Supporter Asked Why He's Wearing A Fake ICE Uniform, And His Reply Is Gross","text":"It seemed like an impossibility, but a Donald Trump supporter proved to be even less funny than the president’s billionaire buddy, Elon Musk.\n\nOn Sunday, the political comedy duo “The Good Liars” — which consists of comedians Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler — posted a video on X, formerly called Twitter, of a man they interviewed at the Conservative Political Action Conference. The annual political conference took place last week in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the video, Selvig can be seen approaching a man wearing a fake U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementuniform and asking, “Do you actually work for ICE?”\n\n“No,” the man replied before revealing it’s a costume and the “hilarious” reason for wearing it.\n\n“Yeah, if you want some entertainment, wear this and go to a Home Depot in a sanctuary city,” said the man, who claimed to live in D.C., a sanctuary city. “And you’ll see all the illegals — not all of them — but you can maybe see a lot of them start to run away. And you feel like a group fitness instructor. It’s really good.”\n\n“And you actually think that’s funny?” Selvig asked.\n\n“I think it’s hilarious. Absolutely,” the man said. “What’s not funny is them illegally —”\n\nBut Selvig, who refused to give this man more of a platform to spew hate, swiftly cut him off.\n\n“There you have it, everybody!” Selvig said to the camera while physically distancing himself from the man. “One of the worst people I’ve seen here at CPAC. And that’s saying something.”\n\nThe “Good Liars” fans were pretty disgusted by the man’s idea of a prank. \n\nDespite how one may feel about this so-called “entertainment,” impersonating a federal officer is never a great idea. \n\nEarlier this month, HuffPost reportedthat multiple police departments across the U.S. have been arresting suspects who have been allegedly impersonating ICE agents to harass or commit crimes against immigrants. According to advocates, these alleged imposters have been emboldened to do this by Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. \n\nICE condemned the alleged impersonators in a statement to HuffPost. \n\n“This action is not only dangerous, but illegal,” the statement said. “Imposters can be charged with various criminal offenses both at the state/local level, as well as federally.”","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-supporter-asked-why-hes-001040836.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/e4cdd459fdd6673179c25f7b1aa0c3b2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:10:40","author":"Elyse Wanshel","authors":["Elyse Wanshel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":293975032,"title":"IN BRIEF: Ukraine, projects with US: Putin's statements after meeting on rare earths","text":"NOVO-OGARYOVO, February 25. /TASS/.

We should do more.\"\n\nRussia would be happy to work with any foreign partners in the rare earths industry, including American partners.\n\nMoscow is ready to offer American and other foreign partners to participate in rare earth mining projects, including in Donbass and Novorossiya: \"There are certain reserves there, too. We are ready to work there with our partners, including the Americans.\"\n\nRussia and the US could also consider joint work on aluminum production: \"For example, in the Krasnoyarsk Region, back in Soviet times, there were plans to build a new hydroelectric power plant and create additional aluminum production facilities.\"\n\nIf American companies work in Russia, \"they will make a decent profit, and the corresponding amounts of aluminum will be delivered to the domestic market at absolutely acceptable market prices. There is a lot to think about here.\"\n\nRussia, US, Ukraine\n\nThe forthcoming US-Ukraine agreement on rare earths and other resources does not affect Russia in any way. \"Of course, it would be necessary to assess this resource, how real it is, how many of these resources are there, how much they cost and so on.\"\n\nRussian and US companies are discussing major economic projects as part of the Ukrainian settlement: \"Yes, some of our companies are in contact with each other and are discussing such projects.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump's actions regarding the Kiev authorities are not based on emotions, but on rational cold calculation, \"a rational approach to the current situation.\"\n\n\"He can move forward and work toward a settlement of the conflict,\" the head of state said. \"And it's in his character, I guess - he acts straightforwardly and without much embarrassment.

Many attendees wore pro-Trump and pro-DOGE apparel.\n\nBorn to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book, “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, he outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book, ”Truths: The Future of America First.”\n\nRamaswamy has vowed to be a pro-business governor and referenced how, in the early 1900s, Ohio boasted six of the wealthiest cities (Akron, Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown) in the country because of industry.\n\nHe said Ohio will lead the nation’s second industrial revolution in the “sectors of the future.”\n\nRamaswamy also vowed to “break down income tax to zero.”\n\n“It is your money, not the government’s,” he said.\n\nHe also said that he will drive down property taxes.\n\n“It’s your land, not a lease from the government,” he said.\n\nReattaching work requirements to Medicaid and welfare will be another objective, he promised. He said this will help Ohioans “achieve independence.”\n\nRamaswamy said he would bolster Ohio’s education for students and noted he would support homeschooling along with public, private, and charter schools.\n\n“Ohio will be the first state in the nation that implements merit-based pay for every teacher, principal, and superintendent,” he added.\n\nRamaswamy will join a Republican gubernatorial primary field that includes Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and southern Ohio entrepreneur Heather Hill.\n\nDr. Amy Acton, who served as Ohio’s public health director during the COVID pandemic, is running as a Democrat.\n\nOhio is a state that Trump decisively won in 2016, 2020, and 2024. Republicans have a supermajority in the state Legislature.\n\nSpeculation from some Republican strategists is mounting that former Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel will eventually announce his candidacy to replace Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican who cannot run again because of term limits.\n\nEarlier this month, DeWine appointed Tressel as lieutenant governor to replace Jon Husted, who was tapped by DeWine to replace JD Vance’s vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nAt the press conference announcing his new role, Tressel was asked by reporters if he would run for governor.\n\n“I haven’t given any thought against it but I haven’t given any thought to it either,” said Tressel, who also served as president of Youngstown State University in northeast Ohio. “I have been focused on what the governor would like me to learn and what the governor would like me to do.”\n\nRandall Porter drove an hour from his home in Centerville, Ohio, to hear Ramaswamy speak. He told The Epoch Times that it marked his first appearance at a political rally.\n\n“I became familiar with him when he ran for president and liked a lot of what he said. He seems more like a Libertarian in some of his views, which is right up my alley,” Porter said. “We have some problems in this state that need solutions. I’m curious about what his platform will be.”\n\nPorter believes that DeWine’s appointment of Tressel was a “strategic move to make sure this guy [Ramaswamy] does not sit in the governor’s chair,” he said, pointing to the stage before Ramaswamy made his announcement.\n\nPorter believes that if Tressel decides to run for governor, he will represent the faction of the Ohio Republican party that’s not as supportive of Trump as Ramaswamy.\n\n“DeWine has shown he’s not a fan of Donald Trump, and likely, Ramaswamy will get Trump’s endorsement,” Porter said. “[DeWine] would rather have someone who thinks like he does than see one of Trump’s lead this state.”\n\nCiting popular TV shows, Ramaswamy said: “That doesn’t start in college, it starts young. A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.”\n\nYost released a statement minutes after Ramaswamy announced his bid.\n\nWhen Ramaswamy stepped down from DOGE, a spokesperson for the commission praised him for playing “a critical role in helping us create DOGE.”\n\n“He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of DOGE, based on the structure that we announced today,” Anna Kelly said in a statement. “We thank him immensely for his contributions over the last two months and expect him to play a vital role in making America great again.”\n\nIn social media posts, Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to run for Ohio governor.

Buck Elon Musk's Edict Amid Legal Fury in DC and Arizona","text":"In a recent development that's causing ripples throughout the federal workforce, high-profile federal agencies including the FBI, State Department, and Pentagon are standing up against Elon Musk’s directive for employees to report their weekly accomplishments. According to a report from AZ Family, these departments were instructed by their respective agency heads not to comply with Musk's deadline, set for the end of the day today, drawing a line in the sand against the business magnate's controversial cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), backed by Trump, has seen its aggressive approach toward federal budget slashing meet opposition, including from the Attorney General of Arizona, Kris Mayes, who has raised legal concerns about the actions. As stated by Mayes and reported by FOX 10 Phoenix, the flurry of cuts and demands is \"evidence in my case against Elon Musk and Donald Trump and DOGE because it demonstrates that he actually is in charge and that violates the separation of powers, and it violates the Appointments Clause in the Constitution.\"\n\nFederal employees, already grappling with the insecurity wrought by previous layoffs and funding freezes, are expressing anger and confusion in response to Musk's ultimatum. Richard Hernandez from the Federal Correctional Complex in Tucson stressed the feeling of instability among the workforce, saying, \"The response has been angry, has been confused,\" as quoted in the same report by FOX 10 Phoenix. Employees are awaiting clear instructions, with some encouraged to exaggerate their work achievements to avoid being fired, echoing the sentiments shared by local voters concerned about the real implications of these measures.\n\nHowever, not all politicians share the standpoint of resisting. Republican Congressman Eli Crane has vocalized his approval of DOGE and Musk's efforts stating, \"The American people have a right to know how THEIR money is being spent. Swampy politicians have hid their efforts for too long\". His thoughts coincide with GOP Congressman Abe Hamadeh and Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs who see the DOGE’s actions as a call for transparency and a necessity to tackle the nation’s staggering debt. Yet lines are blurring as some Republicans question the legality and compassion behind Musk's demands—with Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, urging for a \"dose of compassion in this\". Not to forget Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who openly tagged the actions as illegal, in a statement to CBS’ “Face the Nation”.\n\nWhile legal pushback gains momentum, the gravity of the situation intensifies as more federal employees face the prospect of job loss. Kelley, president of the 800,000-member American Federation of Government Employees, called on the administration to rescind Musk's request and issue an apology, labeling the businessman as \"unelected and unhinged.\" As the tug-of-war unfolds, federal workers and their unions ready themselves for potential legal battles, holding on hope for a resolution that safeguards their employment and dignity.","summary":"Key federal agencies are defying Musk's order for weekly employee reports as part of his cost-cutting measures.","url":"https://hoodline.com/2025/02/fbi-pentagon-and-state-dept-buck-elon-musk-s-edict-amid-legal-fury-in-dc-and-arizona/","image":"https://img.hoodline.com/2025/2/fbi-pentagon-and-state-dept-buck-elon-musks-edict-amid-legal-fury-in-dc-and-arizona-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:07:31","author":"Steve Wilson","authors":["Steve Wilson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":293983446,"title":"Judge denies emergency motion from Associated Press demanding access to White House","text":"A federal judge shot down a request from the Associated Press for an emergency motion to allow the outlet access to White House pool events after being banned by President Donald Trump. \n\nThe AP said it was shut out of events after it refused to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, as commanded in an executive order from Trump. \"The AP Stylebook\" is used by many journalists to standardize writing practices across many news outlets. \n\n'We are vigilant in standing against entities like the AP that refuse to put America first.' \n\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden declined to issue a temporary injunction the AP was requesting in order to regain access to the Oval Office and Air Force One.

In response, the USCCB filed a lawsuit in mid-February 2025, arguing that the administration’s action was unlawful and had already caused devastating financial consequences for organizations assisting refugees.\n\nAccording to catholic church bishops, the freeze has resulted in millions of dollars in unpaid reimbursements for services already provided, with additional financial losses mounting each week. The bishops sought an immediate temporary restraining order to lift the funding suspension, but on Thursday, February 20, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden denied the request.\n\nIn his ruling, McFadden emphasized that temporary restraining orders are granted only under exceptional circumstances. He noted that plaintiffs must demonstrate a strong likelihood of success in their case, the potential for irreparable harm, and that the injunction would be in the public interest.\n\n“The court finds that the plaintiffs have not met the necessary burden of proof and therefore denies the motion for a temporary restraining order,” McFadden wrote.\n\nWhile this initial request was rejected, the legal battle is far from over. The bishops had also petitioned for a preliminary injunction, which would block the funding freeze while the case proceeds. McFadden announced that the court would expedite further hearings on that matter but did not specify when they would take place.\n\nFor weeks, Catholic leaders have been warning about the broad consequences of Trump’s funding suspension. The freeze has affected both domestic and international aid programs, prompting the bishops to call on Catholics nationwide to pressure lawmakers to restore financial support for refugee assistance.\n\nIn January, the USCCB publicly urged Congress to intervene, warning that the funding pause would have life-threatening consequences for millions of people in need of humanitarian, healthcare, and development assistance.\n\nFollowing the court’s decision, USCCB spokesperson Chieko Noguchi reiterated the bishops’ longstanding commitment to refugee support, noting that Catholic organizations have helped nearly one million people rebuild their lives in the United States.\n\n“We urge the administration to fulfill its legal and moral obligations to refugees and reinstate the necessary funding,” Noguchi said in a statement. “Religious and community organizations must be able to continue this vital work, which embodies the values of compassion, justice, and hospitality that define our nation.”\n\nThank you for reading our content.

The Vatican confirmed that the pope, who has been battling a severe respiratory infection since February 14, has shown slight improvement but remains under close medical supervision.\n\nTrump was first briefed on the pope’s condition on Saturday, February 22. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the president’s concern, stating, “Trump has been informed, and we are praying for the pope.” She added that while the president would make his own statement in due time, his thoughts were with the Catholic leader.\n\nDuring a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Monday, February 24, Trump publicly addressed the situation, wishing Pope Francis a speedy recovery. “It’s a very tough situation. I hope he gets better soon,” he said from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump and Pope Francis have had a complex relationship, marked by both moments of mutual respect and political disagreements. Their first face-to-face meeting took place in 2017 during Trump’s initial term, where the two leaders discussed issues ranging from religious freedom to global conflicts.\n\nDespite political differences, the pope extended a warm message of prayer to Trump last month upon his second inauguration. However, tensions resurfaced when Francis recently criticized the administration’s aggressive deportation policies in a letter addressed to U.S. bishops.\n\nThe Vatican’s latest health update, released on Monday, indicated a slight improvement in the pope’s condition. Doctors reported stabilization in his kidney function, easing concerns about mild renal insufficiency detected the previous day. Laboratory tests have also shown progress, and the pontiff has been able to resume limited work duties.\n\nHowever, Vatican officials emphasized that his condition is still critical, and his recovery remains uncertain. The pope has been fighting bronchitis complicated by a polymicrobial infection, which later developed into bilateral pneumonia.\n\nThank you for reading our content.

Responding to rumors of a potential player boycott at the time, Trump disinvited the team from the customary White House visit amid his war with the NFL over players protesting during the national anthem. \n\n‘The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,’ read a 2018 Trump statement. ‘They disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\n\n‘The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better. These fans are still invited to the White House to be part of a different type of ceremony – one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem.’\n\nNow, though, the political calculus surrounding the NFL and the White House appears to have shifted. Only a handful of Eagles players remain in Philadelphia from the 2018 Super Bowl-winning team: Right tackle Lane Johnson, defensive end Brandon Graham, kicker Jake Elliott and long snapper Rick Lovato.\n\nIn fact, Johnson already said he hoped to visit Trump in Washington following the Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX win over the Chiefs. \n\n‘I’d be honored to go, regardless of who the president is, but we’ll see,’ team captain and right tackle Lane Johnson said, as quoted by Sportico. ‘It’s ultimately a team decision. I’ll do what’s best for the team.’\n\nThe President attended the Eagles’ victory over the Chiefs in New Orleans but left the game early to fly back to his home in Palm Beach, Florida at an estimated cost of somewhere between $8million and $20 million taxpayer dollars.\n\nCuriously, Trump has not yet congratulated the Eagles despite previously toasting the Kansas City Chiefs for their latest Super Bowl berth. He’s also praised Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, the latter of whom ‘liked’ a pair of Trump-related social media posts during the campaign.\n\n‘I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country,’ Trump wrote on his Truth Social network ahead of his electoral victory over Kamala Harris in November.\n\nThe Hunt family, which owns the Chiefs, also has a history of supporting conservative causes. \n\nEagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, on the other hand, has a record of supporting left-leaning politicians, such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, although he previously donated to Republicans George W. Bush and Arlen Specter as well.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles do plan on visiting the White House to celebrate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Eagles express willingness to visit the White House, despite Donald Trump supporting Chiefs for Super Bowl victory first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/eagles-express-willingness-to-visit-the-white-house-despite-donald-trump-supporting-chiefs-for-super-bowl-victory/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Eagles-would-be-honored-to-visit-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:03:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.328},{"id":293980616,"title":"How Happy Are Kamala Harris Voters With Donald Trump? What Poll Shows","text":"A month since President Donald Trump has officially been in office, voters of former Vice President Kamala Harris are sharing how satisfied they are with Trump, according to a Harvard University/Harris poll.Newsweek has reached out to the White House via email for comment.Why It MattersTrump took office January 20, 2025, after a decisive victory against Harris. Harris led a slightly over 100-day campaign with her running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the 2024 presidential election, following former President Joe Biden's withdrawal in July. Ultimately, she lost to now President Trump, who was previously in office prior to Harris and Biden. Trump won 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. The Republican also won every swing state.Since his inauguration, Trump has implemented sweeping change via swathes of executive orders, targeting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), immigration and most recently expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump's first weeks in office have also been filled with Cabinet nominations, domestic tragedies including wildfires in Los Angeles, and aviation disasters. Trump also managed to secure the safe arrival of Americans imprisoned overseas.What To KnowThe poll, released by Harvard University/Harris on Monday, shows 9 percent of Democratic Harris voters are now satisfied with how Trump is doing in office and 6 percent of GOP Harris voters are now satisfied with Trump.Meanwhile, 12 percent of Trump Democratic voters are satisfied with their choice, and 85 percent of GOP Trump voters are satisfied.In addition, the poll also found 6 percent of Trump voters say they wish Harris won the presidential election, which is not much compared to 37 percent of Harris voters who say they wish Harris won.Meanwhile, the poll also shows that 8 percent of Republicans think Trump is doing worse than expected while 63 percent of Democrats think he is doing worse than expected. However, 13 percent of Democrats think Trump's doing better than expected and 66 percent of Republicans also think he's doing better.The survey was conducted online within the United States on February 19-20, 2025, among 2,443 registered voters by the Harris Poll and HarrisX. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or minus 2.0 points.The poll comes after Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio is sounding the alarm about vulnerabilities congressional Republicans will face in next year's midterm elections.A memo from Fabrizio and his partner, Bob Ward said their polling finds that 59 percent of voters in 18 swing districts are concerned about their personal financial situation, including 61 percent of swing voters and 53 percent of President Donald Trump's voters.The memo said that polling found contests in 18 swing districts—eight held by Republicans and 10 by Democrats—are essentially tied.However, it said that in a generic ballot matchup, the survey has the \"generic Democrat winning by 5 points, so the Republicans have to play catch-up.\"The memo suggests voters, including those who chose Trump over Harris, remain concerned about their financial situation despite Trump repeatedly touting how much better off they are now that he is back in the White House. Some recent polls have shown support for Trump's handling of the economy has significantly declined since he returned to office.It comes as Republicans have been confronted by angry voters at town halls in recent days, while other polls have suggested growing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration's actions in the first month since he returned to office, including efforts to downsize the federal government that has seen thousands of federal government workers fired.What People Are SayingPolitical analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek last week: \"Trump's first month in office this time around is markedly different from his first term. Four years ago, he entered Washington as an outsider, disrupting the traditional political landscape with a flurry of executive orders and high-profile policy moves. This time, he's returning with experience, a clearer understanding of how the system works, and a more determined approach to advancing his agenda.\"Agranoff added: \"However, he also faces a more polarized political climate, legal challenges, and a Congress that may not always align with his priorities. The key question is whether he can translate his momentum into lasting policy achievements or if external pressures will slow his administration's effectiveness.\"Former Vice President Kamala Harris in her November concession speech: \"In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign—the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.\"President Donald Trump said in his Inauguration speech last month: \"I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a grilling, new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country. Sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before, but first, we must be honest about the challenges we face.What Happens NextWhile Trump's first 100 days in office will continue to unfold, it is unclear what other actions Trump will take or how voters will respond.","summary":"Last week's poll of more than 2,400 voters gives insight into how they feel about Trump's sweeping changes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/poll-shows-how-happy-kamala-harris-voters-are-donald-trump-2035625","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2594670/kamala-harris-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:03:18","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":293980530,"title":"Brazilian illegal alien charged with rape caught in Massachusetts, handed over to ICE in rare case","text":"In a rare case, a Massachusetts police department honored a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer request for a Brazilian illegal alien accused of rape.

firms achieve ‘gender-balanced’ boardrooms but lack women in top jobs","text":"The UK’s biggest listed companies have achieved gender-balanced boardrooms, but a lack of women in top jobs has seen the number of female FTSE 100 chief executives fall below 10, according to a Government-backed report.\n\nProgress comes despite more firms looking to “weed out” costly or ineffective diversity goals amid a string of companies scaling back initiatives in the US, the boss of the FTSE Women Leaders Review said.\n\nNew data from the report shows that women now occupy 43.4% of boardroom positions across FTSE 350 companies.\n\nThis is up from 42.1% last year, and marks a steep increase from the 24.5% representation recorded in 2017 when the report was launched.\n\nIt also means listed companies continue to exceed the 40% voluntary target set by the review.\n\nVivienne Artz, chief executive of the FTSE Women Leaders Review, said a lack of resistance to diversity initiatives among the biggest UK corporates had propelled change in recent years.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: “You can’t ignore the fact that there’s a lot of questioning going on, particularly from across the ocean, in relation to DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion).”\n\nBut she said the organisation was “really pleased and impressed” with the willingness of companies to share their data, “so we haven’t encountered any resistance in the UK”.\n\nThe latest report comes as a number of large businesses in the US, including Google, Meta, Amazon and McDonald’s, have scaled back diversity programmes amid political pressure after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory.\n\nMs Artz said companies that were setting diversity targets “to look good” were “probably having an existential crisis” over DEI programmes.\n\nBut she said it could be “healthy” for firms to review their initiatives and “focus on what is actually working to help the business versus fluffy stuff, extra stuff, things that actually might be more irritating than effective”.\n\n“I think it’s helpful to weed out those practices that are not working,” Ms Artz added.\n\nMeanwhile, the analysis also found that the proportion of women in leadership positions increased to 35.3% across FTSE 350 firms, from 34.5% the previous year, as of the end of October 2024.\n\nThis spans executive positions including chief executive and chief finance officer, as well as those directly reporting to the leaders.\n\nBut on the FTSE 100, the number of female chief executives decreased from 10 to nine, remaining “few and far between, with little progress in a decade”, according to the review.\n\nThere were 28 female finance directors and 16 chairs on the FTSE 100.\n\nAbout 100 of the top 350 listed companies still had fewer than a third of their leadership positions occupied by women.\n\n“Whilst FTSE 350 company boards are now gender-balanced, sustained effort and determination is required to achieve the 40% target for women in leadership by the end of this year,” Ms Artz said.\n\nThe listed firms with the highest proportion of female leaders include retailers Marks & Spencer, Next, and Burberry, and publishing giants Pearson and Bloomsbury, which all have more than 50% female representation.\n\nThose at the bottom of the rankings include miners Fresnillo and Antofagasta, and Games Workshop and CMC Markets, which all have less than 25% female representation.\n\nSome private companies such as chemicals giant Ineos, parcel firm Hermes and wholesaler Bestway have no women on their boards.\n\nAcross the G7 – the group of seven of the world’s most advanced economies – the UK’s FTSE 350 ranks in second place, behind France, for female boardroom representation.\n\nFrance has gender quotas for its top 40 company boardrooms, while the UK has voluntary targets.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said: “The UK is leading the charge for gender equality in boardrooms, but we cannot rest on our laurels.\n\n“We must break down the barriers that stop many women being represented in decision-making roles, so that top talent reaches the highest levels of leadership in businesses driving economic growth across Britain.”","summary":"New data from the FTSE Women Leaders Review shows that women now occupy 43.4% of boardroom positions across FTSE 350

This leaves Sir Ed with the highest net rating.\n\nThe survey also tested Donald Trump’s favourability but was conducted between February 7-11, before his controversial comments on the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe US president recorded a net rating of minus 32, with 25% of Britons holding a favourable view and 57% unfavourable.\n\nKeiran Pedley, director of UK Politics at Ipsos, said: “This polling shows the relatively competitive position Nigel Farage holds versus other party leaders.\n\n“More Britons are favourable towards Farage than Starmer, Badenoch or Davey. However, these poll findings were taken before Donald Trump’s recent comments about Ukraine, so it remains to be seen whether these – and Nigel Farage’s response – impact the numbers moving forward.”\n\nA focus on perceptions of political parties showed the Green Party had the best favourbility score of minus 5, followed by the Lib Dems with minus 12 and Reform UK with minus 14.\n\nHowever, Reform UK experienced the biggest positive swing since last month of 4%.\n\nLabour is seen as favourable by 24% and unfavourable by 52%, a net score of minus 28.\n\nThe Conservatives received the lowest party rating of minus 34, with 19% favourable and 53% unfavourable.\n\nBut this was a 1.5 point improvement for the Tories on last month and compares to a 3.5 negative swing for Labour.\n\nA significant majority of Britons continue to believe the country is heading in the wrong direction with 62% holding this view, a proportion unchanged since January. Only 15% said the country was heading in the right direction.\n\nWhen asked to rate the Government’s performance on a scale of one to 10, the average score overall was 3.5, down from 3.7 last month.\n\nThe survey also found 47% of voters think the Government is doing a bad job at running the country, while 28% gave it a moderate score and just 18% gave it a high rating.\n\nThose surveyed aged 18-34 overall scored the Government highest at 4.9, while those aged 55 and over scored the lowest at 2.7.\n\nThe monthly Ipsos Political Pulse survey interviewed a representative sample of 2,248 adults.","summary":"The proportion of people saying the UK was heading in the wrong direction has remained high.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-government-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-kemi-badenoch-b1213032.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/02/25/00/2052d893d69ef2107c25cddba10d1f2dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQwNDk2NjIz-2.78452378.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-25 00:01:00","author":"Jonathan Bunn","authors":["Jonathan Bunn"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.445},{"id":293983454,"title":"DOGE fight?

They are technically distinct wings of the media empire, however.\n\nFallica, who has previously commented on political topics, joined Fox from ESPN back in 2023. He has won multiple Sports Emmy awards.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been at the center of sports again on Monday, after it emerged that the Philadelphia Eagles do plan on visiting the White House to celebrate their second Super Bowl victory - provided the team receives an invitation.\n\nBoth NFL Network and ESPN reported that the Eagles would be 'honored' to visit the Trump White House. \n\nThere had been speculation the team would skip a meeting with President Trump. The Eagles famously did not go to Trump’s White House after winning their first Lombardi Trophy in 2018. \n\nResponding to rumors of a potential player boycott, Trump disinvited the team from the customary White House visit.\n\nPoliticsFox NewsRussiaVladimir Putin\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nFox star Chris Fallica launches shock attack on Donald Trump over Vladimir Putin and Russia-Ukraine war\n\nAdd comment","summary":"In a dramatic move on Monday, the United States split with its European allies by refusing to blame Russia for the invasion of Ukraine in votes on three UN resolutions seeking an end to the conflict.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14432131/Fox-Chris-Fallica-shock-attack-Donald-Trump-Vladimir-Putin-Russia-Ukraine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/24/23/95548041-0-image-m-17_1740441347228.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 23:58:41","author":"Associated,Daniel Matthews,Editor","authors":["Associated","Daniel Matthews","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.254},{"id":293983958,"title":"As Trump Highlights His Dealmaking Skills on Ukraine, Macron Cautions Against a ‘Weak’ Agreement","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron made an effort on Monday to ground President Donald Trump’s plans for resolving the Ukraine conflict in reality, emphasizing their mutual desire for peace while cautioning against Russia’s history of failing to adhere to international agreements.\n\n He repeatedly highlighted the importance of security assurances to ensure that Moscow honors its commitments this time, stating that any accord must be “verified and validated.” He also shared insights from his dialogues with Vladimir Putin, indicating that discussions with the Russian leader should be approached from a position of strength.\n\n “We desire peace. He desires peace,” Macron remarked regarding his American counterpart while standing beside Trump. “We want peace, swiftly, but we are not seeking a weak agreement.”\n\n “This peace should not signify Ukraine’s surrender,” he asserted.\n\n In contrast, Trump did not mention security guarantees during his remarks at the joint news conference and instead presented himself as a skilled negotiator aiming for a deal.\n\n “I have communicated with President Putin, and my team is in constant contact with him and his people, and they are eager to reach an agreement,” he stated from the East Room. “This is my forte: making deals. My entire life revolves around deals. I can tell when someone wants to negotiate and when they don’t.”\n\n Macron aimed to leverage his long-standing personal rapport with Trump to advocate for Ukraine and Europe’s interests in light of a week marked by a serious decline in transatlantic relations. The two appeared cordial, exchanging compliments and smiles throughout their meeting. Trump praised Macron for his rapid reconstruction of Paris’ Notre-Dame Cathedral, which was severely impacted by a fire.\n\n Macron also highlighted areas of consensus. He reiterated his ongoing position that European nations need to take on greater responsibility for their security, a view he shares with Trump in principle.\n\n However, their differences were still apparent, and by the conclusion of the meeting, it seemed Trump had not substantially shifted his views regarding accountability for the Ukraine conflict or Europe’s support for Kyiv.\n\n As the two leaders convened on Monday, a US-led resolution that avoided labeling Russia as the aggressor passed in the UN Security Council, supported by Moscow and lacking the endorsement of the US’ European allies.\n\n Additionally, in a notable exchange highlighting the tense dynamics of Monday’s discussions between the French and American leaders, Macron sought to correct Trump on the nature of European support for Ukraine, interrupting him to clarify what he believed to be inaccuracies.\n\n “Just so you know, Europe is lending money to Ukraine. They are expected to repay it,” Trump began, as he prepared to advocate for a new arrangement regarding Ukraine’s mineral revenues.\n\n At that moment, Macron reached out to grasp Trump’s arm to interject.\n\n “Actually, to be direct, we covered 60% of the overall efforts. Just like the US: loans, guarantees, and grants,” he stated, as Trump offered a rueful smile.\n\n Trump expressed a willingness to consider a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a proposal he plans to learn more about later this week during his meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He also mentioned having discussed the concept with Putin, noting that the Russian leader was also receptive to it.\n\n Later on, Macron described Europeans as functioning as an “assurance force” in Ukraine, while Americans would act “in solidarity,” although it was evident that the precise details of the scheme still need clarifying.\n\n Trump also indicated his readiness to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky soon to finalize a deal permitting US access to Ukraine’s mineral resources, which Macron acknowledged positively.\n\n “It looks like we’re approaching a resolution,” Trump stated.\n\n The president emphasized that the Ukraine conflict could be resolved within weeks, refraining from calling Putin a dictator — a term he’s used for Ukraine’s leader — and reiterated his intention to visit Moscow eventually.\n\n Even before the formal discussions commenced, Trump and Macron had already spent over two hours together during a virtual G7 meeting. They participated via teleconference, with Trump in the Oval Office and Macron beside him, marking the third anniversary of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n The G7 meeting occurred against a tense backdrop, with US officials resisting a proposal to include a reference to “Russian aggression” in the concluding statement. Trump has also revived his push to allow Russia to rejoin the group, echoing a debate he had in 2019 with Macron and other leaders during the summit in Biarritz hosted by the French president.\n\n After their morning meeting, both leaders indicated that the two-hour virtual summit was successful. As they departed the West Wing on foot, Macron described the talks as “perfect.”\n\n For Macron, who has had a complex relationship with Trump since 2017, Monday’s discussions were aimed at leveraging what he perceives as a unique connection with the US president to advocate for Ukraine and Europe.\n\n Macron expressed a degree of optimism last week, suggesting that Trump held him in high regard.\n\n “He is a person I respect,” Macron noted, “who I believe respects me.”\n\n The significance of this rapport during Monday’s talks wasn’t entirely apparent.\n\n Prior to the meeting, Trump lamented what he claimed were inadequate efforts by both Macron and Starmer to end the conflict, asserting they “haven’t accomplished anything,” despite their significant contributions to Ukraine’s defense.\n\n Macron has previously utilized his platform to urge Trump to support Ukraine, having organized a surprise three-way meeting in Paris last December with himself, Trump, and Zelensky to discuss the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral. According to one official, Trump was respectful and “in listening mode” during that meeting as Zelensky articulated the need for security guarantees for Ukraine following the war.\n\n Macron sought to clarify to Trump that Putin had changed since the last time the US president was in office. He cautioned that if Ukraine were to be defeated, the US could be viewed as weak by its other adversaries — particularly, China.\n\n Two months later, it appears that those discussions have not made a lasting impact on Trump, who recently criticized Zelensky and suggested that Ukraine initiated the conflict.\n\n Starmer, set to meet Trump on Thursday, is expected to inform his US counterpart about a developing plan to deploy as many as 30,000 European peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, aiming to reflect Europe’s commitment to taking on more of the security burden for the country moving forward. He may also specify a timeline for the UK to increase defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP.\n\n This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.","summary":"Washington UJ — French President Emmanuel Macron made an effort on Monday to ground President Donald Trump&#8217;s plans for resolving the Ukraine conflict in reality, emphasizing their mutual desire for peace while cautioning against Russia&#8217;s history of failing to adhere to international agreements.

Pipeline Under Great Lakes Straits","text":"The seven-year fight to keep oil and natural gas flowing under a major Michigan waterway may be headed to the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe straits are the narrow point in northern Michigan where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan come together.\n\nPlans call for the building of a new concrete-lined tunnel that will encase a four-mile stretch of Line 5—a 645-mile-long metal pipeline carrying light crude oil and natural gas liquids from Wisconsin, through Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, and across the Lower Peninsula—to refineries and distribution centers in Sarnia, Ontario.\n\nCurrently, that segment of the pipeline comprises two 20-inch metal pipes that move natural gas liquids and 540,000 barrels of light crude oil daily across the straits.\n\nOpponents of Enbridge point to the large crude oil spill that contaminated the Kalamazoo River in southern Michigan in 2010 as evidence of the danger posed by pipelines.\n\nThe litigation that resulted in the recent appeal began in 2023 when the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) conditionally approved Enbridge’s permit application to relocate its existing lake-bottom pipeline to an underground tunnel bored beneath the lakebed.\n\nThe two conditions were that Enbridge procure all necessary state and federal permits and prepare a detailed risk management plan.\n\nEnbridge first applied for the PSC permit in April 2020.\n\nThe appeal was filed by the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and a coalition of environmental groups.\n\nThe appellants contend that the PSC should not have approved Enbridge’s permit because they state the entire Line 5 pipeline is an environmental hazard that must be shut down.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is the plaintiff in a separate pending lawsuit against Enbridge to do just that.\n\nGoing subterranean with a tunnel lined with concrete eliminates that possibility and will be an effective barrier against oil spills, the company stated.\n\nIn October 2018, the U.S. Coast Guard banned large ships from dropping anchor in the straits citing continued damage to utility cables and the potential of rupturing the pipeline, which was struck several times but not breached.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s executive orders and policies regarding energy development put Line 5 on the shortlist to be fast-tracked for federal approval.\n\nCritics have alleged that Line 5 only benefits Canada and does nothing for the people of Michigan but expose its waters and land to the risk of a spill.\n\nAccording to the appeals court ruling, Enbridge officials replied that Line 5 benefits Michigan by sending natural gas liquids to a propane production facility in Rapid River and delivering light crude oil to facilities that interconnect with other pipelines in Lewiston and Marysville, Michigan, that supply many of the state’s industries.\n\nSixty-five percent of the residents of the Upper Peninsula rely on propane to heat their homes, according to Enbridge.\n\nThe appellants also contended that the comparison provisions of the Michigan Environmental Protection Act regarding alternatives to the project had not been properly followed.\n\nSome of the rejected alternatives to the pipeline transport of oil were rail cars, or tanker ships and barges.\n\nThe appellants also expressed concern about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions “as they relate to supply of and demand for petroleum products.”\n\nLater in 2018, Enbridge agreed to construct the tunnel and build and maintain the 30-inch pipeline within the tunnel at its own expense, but under the auspices of the authority.\n\nIn 2018, the MSCA also secured an easement from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources for the tunnel—a move hotly contested by environmentalists.\n\nUpon completion, Enbridge will sign a 99-year lease with the authority to operate and maintain the new 30-inch pipeline.\n\nThe MSCA was a co-defendant in the appeal.\n\nThe two underwater pipes of the old Line 5 that sit on top of the lakebed will be permanently shut down when the new pipeline is completed.","summary":"An oil pipeline giant may be

officer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in late January calling on the Defense Department to develop an “Iron Dome for America” — a more advanced version of Israel’s Iron Dome, designed to counter a range of missile threats, including hypersonic weapons.\n\nThe order highlights several space-based elements of this architecture that build on existing capabilities like the Missile Defense Agency’s Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor program and the Space Development Agency’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, which includes a constellation of missile warning and tracking satellites.\n\nChief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters Monday that given the executive order’s emphasis on space systems, it’s natural the service would play a key role in its development, adding that the service has established an integrated planning team, or IPT, to explore options in response to the order.\n\n“I think we have a central role to play,” Saltzman said. “We are leaning forward establishing this technical IPT to start thinking about it from an overarching perspective.”\n\nThe team is evaluating what systems the Space Force already has in development to support the president’s order and what capabilities it would need to build. From there, it’s exploring questions around technical feasibility and drafting cost estimates based on current programs, as well as its projections for what a more advanced architecture would require.\n\nThe IPT will likely finalize that early analysis in the coming weeks — a truncated timeline that will require “a lot of triage,” according to a senior Space Force official who spoke to reporters Monday on the condition of anonymity.\n\nOnce complete, the Space Force’s IPT work will be shared alongside similar analysis being conducted by U.S. Space Command, the National Reconnaissance Office and the Missile Defense Agency. Senior DOD leaders will then conduct a series of reviews to determine next steps, including what programs to start.\n\nThe official noted that the Space Force’s intent is to provide an honest assessment of where the technology stands today and what is feasible to deliver — particularly when it comes to fielding space-based interceptors.\n\n“One of the worst things to do is bite off a technical challenge that you can’t solve in a reasonable cost frame, a reasonable time frame,” the official said. “We’ll be very forthright with, ‘Here’s where we think the technology stands.’”","summary":"The Space Force is evaluating what systems it already has in development to support President Trump's order and what capabilities it would need to build.","url":"https://www.militarytimes.com/space/2025/02/24/space-force-will-play-central-role-in-iron-dome-service-chief-says/","image":"https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/YRZHBOF6Z5B67IXQFAT6MHHORQ.jpg?width=1200&auth=724d48f338f8dafef2123a9c5381215c2e1b0ad9d296896e5c674729cd51326f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 23:54:52","author":"Courtney Albon","authors":["Courtney Albon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":293974422,"title":"Eagles will accept White House visit as soon as President Trump extends invite","text":"INDIANAPOLIS – It's a different time in America and the idea that the Philadelphia Eagles would skip another trip to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory with President Donald Trump isn't the reality we're in anymore.

NFC TEAM SUBMITS PROPOSAL TO BAN EAGLES' FAMOUS ‘TUSH PUSH’ PLAY: REPORT Seems streamlining a bloated government, saving billions, trying to broker peace in the Middle East and Ukraine and rooting for the USA hockey team takes up a lot of time. But the invite will surely come, and this time it will be accepted. Report on shun incorrect There were rumors and a false report from earlier this month that the Eagles had voted against making the trip. OutKick founder Clay Travis put out that fire Monday morning. That report seemed plausible because the Eagles and Trump had failed to come to terms on a visit after they beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl in 2018. Amid the kneeling controversy, several players voted not to attend. The plan then had been to send a smaller contingent of players for the ceremony, but the visit was eventually canceled. Then the White House rescinded the invitation. In a statement from the White House at the time, the situation had been described as the Eagles players disagreeing \"with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\" So that trip never happened. But this is a new day in America, folks. EAGLES CAPTAIN LANE JOHNSON SAYS IT WILL BE ‘TEAM DECISION’ TO GO TO WHITE HOUSE IF TRUMP EXTENDS INVITE Well, feels that way for some folks. Black, Hispanic and other minorities voted for Trump in record numbers in the last election. There is no kneeling for the anthem controversy going on right now. And there is hope an economy that hurt a lot of people the past four years under Joe Biden – including a lot of people blue cities such as Philadelphia – can be fixed. Panthers first to visit Trump 47 The Florida Panthers became the first pro team to visit the White House since Trump began his second term to celebrate their 2024 Stanley Cup victory. And Tiger Woods, a 2020 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, has recently spent time with Trump as well. Trump, we believe, is a big-time sports fan. He attended the Super Bowl game the Eagles won. And he could be the most sports-minded president in memory. So, now that the Eagles have signaled they'll attend, you better believe Trump will issue the invite.

Described as a “marquee project” by councilmembers Preston Jordan and John Anthony Miki, the effort is meant to serve as a model for how entire communities can efficiently and equitably transition to green energy sources amid a growing climate crisis.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind project would need 100% buy-in from service users on whatever block is selected, which would require extensive public engagement. A $200,000 federal grant through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program was promised to Albany in October 2023 under President Joe Biden to help move that portion of the pilot program forward.\n\nThe terms of that grant were agreed upon by the city and the Department of Energy in September 2024 and that two-year engagement process was set to begin this year.\n\nThose plans may now be stalled after Trump issued an executive order freezing federal funding, a pause the current administration has argued is necessary to ensure programs align with new priorities.\n\nDespite a ruling in January that temporarily prohibited the financial freeze, Albany staff say they’re still unable to access the funds. Scheduled check-in meetings with the Department of Energy have also been cancelled, Transportation and Sustainability Manager Justin Fried said during a recent city council meeting.\n\n“We don’t have any direction to change what we’re doing, but we don’t have access to payment to get reimbursed project expenses at this point,” Fried said.\n\nIt’s still unclear if or when the city will receive the federal grant dollars given the ongoing legal battle, Fried said.\n\nTo keep the project moving as planned, staff has asked the council to allocate $125,000 from the city’s Climate Action and Adaptation Reserve Fund. A total of $143,469 is currently in the fund, which is supported by a tax on gas and electric utilities, known as Measure DD, passed by voters in 2020.\n\nStaff would either return at a later date to request the additional $75,000 or future work on the project would be paused, Fried said.\n\nJordan and Albany Mayor Robin Lopez were in favor of funding the effort with city dollars, with Jordan arguing that the project could have larger implications for California and its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2045.\n\nCompleting the study would also put the city in a good position to compete for additional grants to fund the next construction phase of the project, Jordan said.\n\n“As painful as it is, I’m in favor of allocating this funding. If we do this work, we’re going to be in a very good position to compete for grant funding to actually do the construction, which is way more than the cost of what we’re talking about here,” Jordan said.\n\nLopez also shared concerns the city would be penalized by the Department of Energy if it didn’t remain on schedule. Instead of pausing the project, he said reserve funds should be used for now as the city and other affected jurisdictions “put Agent Orange to task,” referring to Trump.\n\nAlternatively, Miki said he’s concerned the city would begin implementing an engagement process plan, which was also up for approval, without proper feedback from the Department of Energy, putting the grant into jeopardy anyways.\n\nCouncilmember Jennifer Hansen-Romero and Vice Mayor Peggy McQuaid also questioned whether the reserve funds would be better used on other projects like the city’s heat pump rebate program or installing electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nThose concerns were shared by two members of the Albany Climate Action Coalition, Nick Peterson and Lucinda Young.\n\n“As wonderful as this program is, I find myself questioning – this is a lot of money – is this the best use of the money here,” Young said during public comment.\n\nPausing the pilot program could cause issues, Fried warned. The cost for services could increase and Environmental Justice Solutions, the agency contracted to help with the outreach work, may not be able to hire the interns it needs to help facilitate the outreach this summer without adequate time, he said.\n\nCouncilmembers ultimately agreed to delay any official decision until staff provided additional information about the agreement the city entered into with Department of Energy.\n\nLopez said in an email Monday that the discussion has not yet been scheduled but argued that the decision should be unnecessary, reiterating sentiments shared during the meeting.\n\n“In an ideal world, we wouldn’t need to bring this conversation back to the City Council agenda because our leaders at the federal level would have agency to grow a spine to stand on business when it concerns opportunities to invest in communities that are moving in innovative ways to address the climate crisis,” Lopez said in email. “For now, the work rests on local leaders and incredible city staff to find creative ways to keep projects moving that have been impacted by federal executive orders.”","summary":"Despite a ruling in January that temporarily prohibited the federal financial freeze, Albany staff say they’re still unable to access the grant money for its Gas Line Decommissioning Pilot Project.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/24/trump-federal-funding-freeze-albany-ca-gas-line-decommissioning-stalled/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Climate_Trump_Orders_Environment_44544_6cc387.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 23:52:07","author":"Sierra Lopez","authors":["Sierra Lopez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.533},{"id":293983970,"title":"Scientists Warn That Trump’s Proposed Cuts to NIH Funding Could Endanger Medical Research: NPR","text":"A proposal from the Trump administration to alter the funding structure of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has left laboratories across the nation in turmoil.\n\nDr. Donald Milton’s laboratory at the University of Maryland, focused on how respiratory viruses are transmitted, stands to face significant reductions in funding and staffing if the new policy is enacted.\n\nThe core piece of his lab is a peculiar apparatus in a booth with plastic windows: a large silver cone reminiscent of an antique gramophone, connected to various wires and tubes.\n\nThis is the Gesundheit II, a device designed to gather and analyze particles from human exhalations (or sneezes).\n\n“Individuals infected with the flu or other respiratory viruses come in. The person places their face in the cone, and the air around them is sucked into it,” explains Milton, who is a professor of environmental health at the School of Public Health at the university.\n\nThis apparatus serves as one method for Milton and his team to explore how respiratory viruses, such as the flu and COVID-19, propagate from one individual to another.\n\n“Understanding the transmission route is crucial since the strategies to halt it depend on the transmission mechanism,” he states.\n\nHowever, Milton notes that his research is at risk due to the Trump administration’s plan to limit indirect costs related to medical research to 15%, whereas his university currently receives about 56%.\n\n“This would severely impact our research,” Milton expresses worryingly. “It would hinder our progress and could jeopardize the longevity of our projects.”\n\nThe NIH, which has recently let go around 1,000 employees in its Bethesda, Md., campus, remains the largest public funding source for biomedical research globally. The agency allocates a significant portion of its $48 billion annual budget towards external research, including roughly $9 billion designated for indirect expenses.\n\n“Since WWII, the U.S. has cultivated the most effective and successful research system in human history,” Milton points out. “This achievement was due to federal support providing the necessary infrastructure for research. Indirect costs play a crucial role in this support. Without it, the entire system could collapse.”\n\nThe Trump administration argues that many institutions could trim unnecessary expenses or utilize their endowments to meet funding needs. This would enable the NIH to allocate the potential $4 billion in savings towards further research outside prestigious academic institutions, according to the administration.\n\nSome experts agree with this perspective.\n\n“Indirect cost rates should be manageable for universities to support their overhead while also allowing a greater proportion of the NIH’s budget to be channeled directly into scientific inquiries,” remarks Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank.\n\n“Most individuals applying for NIH funding are well-directed. By redirecting additional funds toward scientists, we can finance more deserving research,” he adds.\n\nA federal judge in Boston has temporarily halted the initiative to cap NIH funding for indirect costs as of February 10, following two lawsuits that claimed the alteration would breach federal law. U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley is anticipated to make a ruling soon regarding the cap’s implementation. Lawyers representing the Trump administration, 22 state attorneys general, and a coalition of universities, medical schools, research hospitals, and other entities presented their cases for and against the cap during a two-hour hearing on Friday.\n\nShould the plan proceed, Milton predicts he would lose approximately $1.1 million from his $3.3 million NIH funding, potentially necessitating layoffs of up to 50% of his 21-member team.\n\n“This uncertainty is causing significant anxiety,” Milton admits. “It’s challenging to predict what the outcome will be.”\n\nThe Gesundheit II is merely one tool in one of the laboratories funded by the NIH, where Milton and his colleagues perform their investigations.\n\n“We’re in the process of replacing components of our Gesundheit II since it has been in use for nearly 20 years, and naturally, things wear out,” Milton explains.\n\nIn fact, about one-third of his NIH funding is applied to indirect costs.\n\n“This covers the lighting, equipment maintenance, heating, cooling, and administrative staff to handle payment invoices,” he clarifies.\n\nThe proposed funding adjustments are just one factor contributing to staff unease at NIH. Concerns are also mounting regarding Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s prospective appointment to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the NIH. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, another NIH critic, is the chosen candidate by President Trump to be the next NIH director.\n\nThe NIH is additionally advocating for the White House to lift a freeze it placed on the agency, prohibiting any new announcements in the Federal Register. This embargo is obstructing the NIH from convening new meetings essential for the advancement of fresh grant proposals, thereby suspending billions in research funding.\n\nIn the meantime, research continues in Milton’s laboratory. A student suffering from a fever arrives to undergo blood tests, nasal swabs, saliva collection, and participate in the Gesundheit II testing.\n\n“Are you doing okay?” one of Milton’s assistants queries the student once settled. “Could you please recite the alphabet slowly into the cone?”\n\nThe objective of this experiment is to ascertain methods to safeguard the population against potential outbreaks that could lead to the next pandemic, such as bird flu.\n\n“Is it airborne? Are masks effective? Are there supplemental measures we should consider, like ensuring proper ventilation and filtration?” Milton states.\n\nThese are critical questions that scientists and healthcare professionals urgently seek answers to.","summary":"A person breathes inside the Gesundheit II, a machine that allows scientists to study the behavior of pathogens when they&#8217;re exhaled.

Stein said applicable laws include the federal Freedom of Information Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.Those laws require public disclosure of many records and policy statements and include provisions for public notice before making major revisions to agency websites, Stein said.A spokesperson for the USDA declined to comment on record and instead referred questions to the Department of Justice, which also declined comment.Stein said climate researchers and public interest groups depend on tools such as the U.S. Forest Service's climate-risk viewer, one of the climate sites that was taken down by the USDA.Other climate-related sections that have been removed from public view, according to the lawsuit, include agriculture programs that had been funded by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Stein said are \"in the crosshairs\" of the Trump administration.Much of the climate-related spending under the IRA was frozen by an executive order, which is also the subject of legal challenges. Stein said the removal of the USDA information hampers the ability of farming groups to pursue those funding sources.\"At precisely this moment when farmers are fighting for funds that they are owed that have been illegally frozen, the Trump administration is purging the public record of information about those programs,\" he said.Gillingham said he has been in touch with other farmers who have made business decisions based in part on USDA grant funding, which is now frozen.\"There's a lot of farmers over the barrel,\" he said.The region where he farms in New York's Catskills has been severely impacted by climate-driven extreme weather, Gillingham said. Repeated floods washed away topsoil, eroded cropland and damaged his tractors, irrigation equipment and fencing, he said.\"Farmers are witnessing extreme weather events that never happened before, so we're all having to adapt to the new reality,\" he said. In addition to certifying farmers for organic practices, he said, the organization operates an educational program that makes frequent use of USDA data and guides, including assistance for climate-smart growing.\"We're trying to deal with the reality of climate change and, you know, it's not a hoax,\" Gillingham said. \"It's real, it's here and taking it off a website isn't going to fix anything, it's only going to make it worse.\"","summary":"Farmers dealing with extreme weather and other climate impacts say the Agriculture Department has removed important data and resources from its website.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/farmers-sue-agriculture-department-climate-information-government-website-2035619","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2594660/farmer-drought.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-24 23:50:32","author":"Jeff Young","authors":["Jeff Young"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.294}]}
