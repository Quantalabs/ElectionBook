Our objective is to enhance the strikes on Hamas until its decisive defeat.”\n\n“The people do not have money to move to the south or even to move internally,” said Youssef Shanaa, who had taken refuge at the hospital.\n\nPeople spoke of relentless bombing in Gaza City, much of which is already in ruins after nearly two years of Israeli strikes.\n\nOnly huge piles of rubble remained of a residential block in the north of the city hit by overnight bombing.\n\n“Why kill children sleeping safely like that, turning them into body parts?” said Abu Abd Zaquout. \n\n“We pulled the children out in pieces.”\n\n‘Gaza is burning’\n\n“Gaza is burning,” Defence Minister Israel Katz posted on X. “The IDF strikes with an iron fist at the terrorist infrastructure and IDF soldiers are fighting bravely to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas.”\n\nHamas called the assault “systematic ethnic cleansing targeting our people in Gaza” in a statement.\n\nUS President Donald Trump accused Hamas of using hostages as human shields.\n\nRubio offers US backing\n\nWhile the United States wished to see a diplomatic end to the war, “we have to be prepared for the possibility that’s not going to happen”, Rubio said. He endorsed the Israeli demand that Hamas surrender its weapons and free all remaining hostages at once, as the only way to end the war.\n\nMass displacement\n\nMuch of Gaza City was already laid to waste in the early weeks of the war in 2023, but around 1 million Palestinians had returned there to homes among the ruins. \n\nForcing them out means nearly the entire population of Gaza will now be confined to encampments along the coast further south in what Israel calls a humanitarian area.\n\nIsraeli forces had been operating on the outskirts of Gaza City for weeks, edging closer to the centre of the city. \n\nIsrael’s political leaders say the offensive is part of a plan to dismantle Hamas as a political and armed organisation. Netanyahu has insisted the group must lay down its weapons and have no future role in Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations and countries critical of Israel’s tactics say they amount to forced mass displacement and that conditions in the crowded southern areas where residents are being sent are dire, with little food.\n\nSome Israeli military commanders have also expressed concern about the operation, warning that it could endanger the remaining hostages captured by Hamas during the October 2023 attacks, and may be a “death trap” for troops.\n\nHostage families gathered outside Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem late on Monday as news of the intensified strikes in Gaza streamed in.\n\n“Our loved ones in Gaza are being bombarded by the IDF under the orders of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has decided to send IDF soldiers to areas where our loved ones are located, who might be harmed and not return alive,” said Anat Angrest, whose son Matan is among the 20 hostages believed to still be alive. \n\n“He is doing everything to ensure there is no deal and not to bring them back.”\n\nIsrael has bombarded Gaza since Hamas’s October 7 attack in 2023, in which more than 1,200 people, including an estimated 30 children, were killed and over 200 hostages taken, according to the Israeli government.\n\nMore than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s subsequent campaign against Hamas in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than two million people.\n\nThe October 7 attack was a significant escalation in the long-standing conflict between Israel and Hamas.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIsrael launched its long-anticipated ground offensive in Gaza City on Tuesday, targeting&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8216;Devastation&#8217;: Israel initiates significant military operation in Gaza first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/devastation-israel-initiates-significant-military-operation-in-gaza/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/01424c1/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6236x2865+0+702/resize/1234x567!/format/jpeg/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb7%2F9c%2F20be25fe498fbe7ce976e104c23a%2F20250916161001393837-origin","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-17 01:05:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":361103196,"title":"Stacey Abrams says Trump administration is using Kirk assassination to advance 'authoritarian rule'","text":"Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams appeared on CNN on Tuesday, where she said that the Trump administration is using the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk as an \"excuse for the advance of authoritarian rule.\" \"This is about American autocracy versus American democracy. And if we allow ourselves to be pulled into this false-flag conversation, what we risk is losing access to the democracy that gave us free speech. That will also invoke the rule of law to hold accountable anyone who undertakes the act of political violence,\" Abrams said. \"But we cannot allow this heinous murder to be exploited as an excuse for the advance of authoritarian rule, which is what we are watching happen.\" Abrams claimed that the Trump administration is currently at \"step nine in the playbook of autocrats,\" which, according to her 10-step framework of autocracy, is \"taking advantage of political violence.\" REP. JASMINE CROCKETT DEFENDS DEM RHETORIC LIKE CALLING TRUMP 'WANNABE HITLER' IN WAKE OF KIRK SHOOTING Kirk, 31, a father of two, was shot and killed Wednesday during a campus event at Utah Valley University. The TPUSA founder was struck in the neck as he spoke to a large crowd from under a white pop-up tent. He was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead that afternoon. When reached for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital, \"In the wake of the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk, two-time gubernatorial campaign loser Stacey Abrams has decided to double down on radical, left-wing rhetoric that drives Democrat supporters to violence. We won’t further dignify these deranged ramblings, but all you need to know is that every word that comes from her mouth is a lie and she should seek help for her late-stage TDS.\" Earlier this year, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate laid out her 10-step framework on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" similarly claiming that at the time, the United States was on step nine of the autocratic playbook. \"Step nine, you start to encourage and incentivize private violence. You send the U.S. Marines into spaces they should not be. You send the National Guard in. You kidnap people off of the streets and pretend that’s normal, because that’s how you quiet dissent, because you make everyone afraid that if they don’t do what you want, they might be next. And once you’ve done those nine steps, step 10 is easy. That’s when you decide there won’t be new elections because everyone is either afraid, poor, broken, or complicit,\" she told guest host Anthony Anderson. DONALD TRUMP JR. WARNS POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS 'NOT GOING BOTH WAYS' AS HE MOURNS CHARLIE KIRK'S DEATH Abrams made a similar argument in her Tuesday appearance on CNN, asserting that President Donald Trump and his administration have placed Washington, D.C., under \"military occupation,\" and that people are being \"kidnapped off of the streets\" by the government. When asked by CNN's Audie Cornish about recent comments made by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., expressing that Trump is not an autocrat or comparable to Adolf Hitler — Abrams expressed her disagreement with the senator's take. \"This is a president who has faced multiple lawsuits that he’s lost because he has overreached. It‘s the installation of loyalists and you all, in your earlier segment, talked about the fact that the FBI is being run by a podcaster, that the Department of Defense is being run by another podcaster that we have watched people who know how to do their jobs be summarily dismissed and replaced by loyalists who have vowed only to hold the authority of the president and not the people as their central responsibility,\" she argued. CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION LATEST CASE OF CONSERVATIVES BEING TARGETED FOR MURDER Later in the segment, Abrams took her argument a step further, arguing that due to American \"naivete,\" the public believes America is \"immune to what autocracy looks like.\" \"We are not as far in, as deep as other nations are, but we are already there. Scholars have pointed out there are ten steps. We have hit all ten steps,\" she contended. \"We just watched this administration, but also this political party, decide that it was okay to redistrict in the middle of the decade in order to explicitly seize more power.\" She added that when \"the president of the United States, suborned by his political party, announced that he intends to eliminate access to voting rights in this country, that he intends to go after his enemies in this country — that’s authoritarianism under anyone’s guise.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Stacey Abrams claimed that the Trump administration is using the assassination of TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk as an &quot;excuse&quot; to &quot;advance authoritarian rule&quot; on CNN Tuesday.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/stacey-abrams-says-trump-administration-using-kirk-assassination-advance-authoritarian-rule","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/Stacey-Abrams-2.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379592717112","publish_date":"2025-09-17 01:00:26","author":"Marc Tamasco","authors":["Marc Tamasco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":361101416,"title":"Four arrested after Trump, Epstein images projected onto Britain's Windsor Castle","text":"Four people were arrested on Tuesday following a projection of images of Donald Trump alongside sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the royal Windsor Castle, where the U.S. President is set to be hosted by King Charles during his state visit to Britain.\n\nTrump arrived in Britain late on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit, and will be greeted by Charles on Wednesday for a day of pomp at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles west of London.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, protesters unfurled a massive banner featuring a photograph of Trump and Epstein near Windsor Castle, and later projected several images of the two onto one of the castle's towers.\n\nThe police said in a statement four adults were arrested on suspicion of malicious communications following an \"unauthorised projection\" at Windsor Castle, which they described as a \"public stunt\".

They deal with:\n\nThe sacred right of every eligible citizen to vote.The integrity and honesty of the political system.The right of citizens to have an unrigged opportunity to choose their representatives.The idea that public officials should not be allowed to sell influence with their office.The foundational principle that no person is above the law.\n\nThe following opinions, written by Roberts and joined in all but one case only by the Republican-appointed majority on the Court, have done unprecedented harm to our democracy.\n\nShelby County v. Holder\n\nRoberts wrote the majority opinion for a 5–4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). It declared key sections of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, the most consequential voting rights law ever enacted, to be unconstitutional. The Act was reenacted periodically over decades until the Shelby County decision.\n\nThe Roberts opinion unleashed a wave of regressive and discriminatory voting changes by states and local jurisdictions that disadvantaged minority voters and impeded their voting rights and their ability to fully participate in the democratic process.\n\nMcCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission\n\nRoberts wrote the majority opinion for a 5–4 decision in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014) which struck down the aggregate limit on all contributions by a donor in an election cycle, a provision previously held constitutional by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976.\n\nIn Buckley, the Supreme Court had found that unlimited contributions given to support candidates were inherently corrupt. The McCutcheon decision, however, eviscerated the limits on individual contributions to candidates by unleashing billionaires, millionaires, and other big money donors to give unlimited, often huge, contributions to Super PACs to benefit specific candidates.\n\nRucho v. Common Cause\n\nRoberts wrote the majority opinion for a 5–4 Court decision in Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), in which the Court decided that it could not act on challenges to partisan redistricting plans. The decision claimed that the Court is incapable of establishing standards for determining when partisan maps become unconstitutional, no matter how extreme.\n\nThe Rucho decision means that there are no constitutional restrictions on partisan gerrymandering, no matter how rigged the plans are. The result is that politicians get to choose their voters rather than voters choosing their representatives.\n\nMcDonnell v. United States\n\nRoberts wrote the unanimous opinion in McDonnell v. United States, (2016), which vacated the conviction of former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell for honest services fraud and extortion. In his opinion, Roberts said that McDonnell’s actions did not constitute “official acts” under the applicable laws, including the bribery law.\n\nIn its decision, the Court adopted a narrow, unrealistic construction of the term “official act” to exclude various acts of an officeholder that should be covered, even when those acts are done in direct exchange for gifts or other benefits. For all practical purposes, the Court has left the country without effective bribery laws to prevent public officials from selling their office for financial benefits.\n\nTrump v. United States\n\nRoberts wrote the opinion for a 6–3 majority in Trump v. United States (2024), which gave Trump presidential criminal immunity. \n\nThe decision violated a guiding principle of our Founders that no person is above the law. The Roberts opinion placing Trump above the law and also giving him personal control of the Justice Department and FBI can be seen in such outrageous Trump pronouncements as the statement that he has “The right to do anything I want to. I’m the president of the United States,” and “I run the country and the world.”\n\nIt is unlikely that any Chief Justice in history played more of a role in destroying more of our nation’s democracy rules than Roberts.

However, the links between the housing crisis, homelessness, and the resulting abuse are not being connected with sufficient emphasis.\n\nWomen entombed in a violent and abusive domestic scenario may have no safe alternative housing options. Meanwhile, the dearth of accommodation has seen some landlords seek sex for rent. Both issues are entwined wholly with the housing crisis. The threat for some of losing your home is an essential element of coercive violence. That risk, and the difficulty many have to find a safe haven, are part of a downward spiral many women find it impossible to escape.\n\nThe figures are stark. Focus Ireland maintains there has been a 45% rise in the number of homeless women between 2022 and 2024, while Women’s Aid statistics for last year alone indicate the highest number of disclosures in more than 50 years of operation.\n\nThat the Central Statistics Office figures for 2023 estimate that 52% of Irish women will experience sexual violence in their lifetimes is damning.\n\nThis “cycle of vulnerability” is becoming more and more difficult for women and children to escape from.\n\nA National Women’s Council conference in Dublin laid bare the links between homelessness, the housing crisis, and increasing violence against them — and the lack of sufficient refuge spaces is exacerbating the problem.\n\nThe absence, too, of long-term housing solutions for women and children running from abusive relationships is not helping.\n\nThat sex-for-rent exploitation has not been outlawed, and the near non-existence of trauma-informed housing for trafficking victims and those women exiting the sex trade is creating further obstacles to stemming the tide of horror.\n\nIf we are to paint ourselves as a fair and just society, we need to find solutions quickly — everyone should have the right to feel safe in their own home.\n\n Do-nothing Dáil needs to work\n\nAs our elected representatives return today after the summer recess, the tag that has haunted the Coalition during its time in power as a “do-nothing Dáil” will have to be shed quickly if the administration is to regain any traction as a credible one.\n\nAll the main parties held their pre-season think-ins over the past week, all aware that thinking and proposing is one thing — 'doing' is something far different.\n\nThere are no easy subjects in the Government’s inbox. Far from making inroads on the key issues of housing, health, homelessness, the energy crisis, the cost-of-living crisis, the crisis within disability, to name but a few — the statistics are all going in the wrong direction. To Joe and Joan Public, the numbers don’t lie, no matter how you try to spin it.\n\nThe first major hurdle for the Government is Budget 2026 early next month, and no matter how hard they try to dampen expectations, everyone will be looking for something.\n\nThis year’s budget package of €9.4bn, made up of €1.5bn in tax cuts and a €7.9bn spending, has been well flagged, but already the Government is warning that there may be less wiggle room on the personal taxation side, which will be difficult to explain away. So too will be the repeated warnings that there will be no one-off measures this time around with energy bills and food prices again on the increase.\n\nPerhaps scared by the potential for a voter backlash against their presidential candidates, there has been a sudden push from both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for tangible action.\n\nAt Monday’s Fianna Fáil parliamentary party brainstorming session in Cork, Micheál Martin threatened to use governmental powers to force the rezoning of land for housing construction if local authorities refuse to do so, sidelining council bosses up and down the country.\n\nStating he was “taken aback” by the number of city and county councils refusing to rezone land in the midst of a housing crisis — and singling out Dublin City Council for particular opprobrium — the Taoiseach said he simply could not comprehend this. He also gave Wicklow County Council the sharp end of his tongue for dezoning land earmarked for housing, and said councils had been given clear instructions to rezone but were seemingly inured to doing so.\n\nA continued failure to do so, he said, would result in the Government sidelining council executives and using legislation to zone land.\n\nWe’ve heard versions of this before — what’s been missing is any follow-through — not just on housing, but the myriad of other issues that the opposition will be only too willing to remind the Government that it has so far failed to get control of.\n\n Genocide in Gaza\n\nAs the UN confirmed what everyone already knows by stating that ‘evidence was mounting’ of an Israeli genocide against Palestinians, US president Donald Trump has greenlighted their land assault on Gaza City, saying Hamas was now using the estimated 20 remaining hostages as human shields.\n\nTrump’s failure to stop the government of Benjamin Netanyahu’s continued assault on the Palestinian people is now tantamount to complicity, as is the lack of action from the EU to penalise the continuing Israeli barbarity.\n\nHistory has taught us many lessons — all too many of which we persistently ignore — and primary amongst them is the fact that might is rarely right.\n\nIt could easily be surmised that the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and elsewhere demonstrated just that over and over again. Israel, not alone with its savagery in Gaza, but also with its unprovoked attack on Qatar, has demonstrated a thirst for mayhem and atrocity like few others in the modern era.\n\nWith the numbers of dead in this conflict fast approaching 65,000 and destined to worsen, any remaining hope of a peace deal seems further away than ever.","summary":"The explosion in violence against women is a heinous fallout from this country’s housing and homelessness crisis.The numbers of female victims of ...","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41706890.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9568/4784204_2_seoimage1x1_iStock-1589667733.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-17 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.029},{"id":361098174,"title":"Trump Tells ABC News' Jonathan Karl That He'll 'Go After People Like You' to Crack Down on Apparent 'Hate Speech'","text":"President Donald Trump suggested he may \"go after\" ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl and \"people like\" him.\n\n Karl, 57, asked the president about Attorney General Pam Bondi's intentions to \"go after hate speech\" on Tuesday, Sept. 16. \"A lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,\" Karl said.\n\n The president, 79, responded, \"I'd probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe I'll come after ABC.\"\n\n He continued, going on to reference the 2024 settlement between himself and ABC, in which the company agreed to donate $15 million to the future Trump library, plus $1 million in legal fees. The settlement was agreed upon after anchor George Stephanopoulos incorrectly said Trump was found civilly liable for the \"rape\" of writer E. Jean Carroll when he was actually found liable for \"sexual abuse,\" a lesser offense.\n\n Trump continued, \"ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech. So, maybe they'll have to go after you.\"\n\n Karl's question came after Bondi's appearance on The Katie Miller Podcast, released on Monday, Sept. 15. “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech, anything — and that’s across the aisle,\" the attorney general said in the interview.\n\n Bondi later clarified her comments on X, writing in part, \"Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime. For far too long, we’ve watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over.\"\n\n Trump's comments come a week after MSNBC political analyst Matthew Dowd was reportedly fired on Wednesday, Sept. 10 after making comments about the death of Charlie Kirk.\n\n Kirk, a right-wing political commentator and Trump administration ally, was fatally shot during a campus event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.

And I think that is the environment we are in.\"\n\n \"You can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and not expect awful actions to take place,\" he continued. \"And that’s the unfortunate environment we are in.”\n\n Variety, Deadline and The Wall Street Journal later reported that Dowd was fired, citing network sources.","summary":"The comments come a week after MSNBC's Matthew Dowd was fired over his comments about Charlie Kirk","url":"https://people.com/trump-tells-abc-news-jonathan-karl-that-he-will-go-after-people-like-you-to-crack-down-on-apparent-hate-speech-11811575","image":"https://people.com/thmb/wfGiAmVXW77E9BwhRFAMO8I9WDg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(740x260:742x262)/jonathan-karl-donald-trump-091625-6ffecfe5fa194664b1bb507abc1f9a6c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:56:42","author":"Madison E.

We'll have officers patrolling the area and monitoring everything from outside the stadium,\" Police Administrator Jose Santiago explained. \n\nKirk was assassinated on September 10 while speaking to college students in Utah.'Same Kind of Ordeal'President Donald Trump, a close friend and ally of Kirk's, will be in attendance, which means a significant Secret Service presence will be on hand at the event. \n\nSantiago notes that the Arizona Department of Public Safety will be working with the Secret Service inside the venue. At the same time, the Glendale P.D. will coordinate with the federal law enforcement agency outside.\n\n\"We're going to handle this as we would any other major event,\" Santiago explained.\n\nHe added: \"We obviously had a very successful Super Bowl when it was here, and we handle major events when it comes to concerts, sporting events, and that's basically how we'll handle this as well...the same kind of ordeal for us.\"\n\nThe stadium, which is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, hosted Super Bowls in 2023, 2015, and 2008. It also served as the kickoff venue for Taylor Swift's Eras tour in March 2023.High Alert for DisruptorsThe Glendale P.D. will be on high alert for any troublemakers trying to disrupt Kirk's celebration of life, as one person already cruelly attacked a memorial to the late Republican crusader.\n\nMourners gathered at Turning Point USA's headquarters in Phoenix on September 13. The popular podcaster founded the conservative youth politics organization in 2012. \n\nFans left flags, flowers, photos, and other memorabilia in Kirk's memory. Still, a 19-year-old man was arrested for attempting to vandalize the site by kicking over vases and stomping on floral displays. Ryder Corral even wore a black shirt with the identical logo that Kirk's alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, wore when carrying out the assassination.'Sunday Best' AttireState Farm Stadium has a capacity of 63,400, and Kirk's funeral is open to the public. Still, attendees have been asked to register at a website set up by Turning Point USA.\n\nDoors will open at 8 a.m. Mountain Standard Time, with the service starting three hours later. The dress code is \"Sunday Best – Red, White, or Blue,\" according to the memorial's site. \n\nKirk was assassinated while kicking off his fall campus tour at Utah State University, with a bullet piercing his neck as he was in the middle of debating a student. Robinson, 22, was later arrested and charged with aggravated murder in Kirk's death, claiming to his alleged transgender lover that he'd \"had enough of his hatred.\"Secret Service PlansSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement: “The Secret Service joins the nation in offering our deepest condolences to the Kirk family and friends. Joint security planning is underway for the memorial and funeral of Charlie Kirk, and appropriate public safety-related information will be provided as the process matures in the coming days.\"\n\nThe service came under fire in July 2024, after Trump, 79, was nicked by a would-be assassin's bullet while at an outdoor presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. As in Kirk's killing, it was fired from a faraway rooftop with a long-range rifle. Trump had turned his head to look at a sign at the last second, narrowly missing being struck in the head, while the bullet grazed his ear. \n\nShooter Thomas Matthew Crooks was killed at the scene by law enforcement, while the Secret Service would later undergo a series of reforms and leadership changes.","summary":"Glendale, Arizona, police will be on high alert for Charlie Kirk's funeral, revealing it will be an 'ordeal' like the Super Bowl.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/charlie-kirk-funeral-preparations-glendale-police-high-alert/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/YgV8JzA6b/0x0/charlie-kirk-funeral-security-1758065507692.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:45:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.06},{"id":361102406,"title":"Judge dismisses charge against ex-Antioch cop who shot suspected car thief with less-lethal launcher","text":"OAKLAND — As Antioch’s lengthy police corruption scandal draws to a close, a federal judge has added another twist to the saga, dismissing a felony charge against a former Antioch officer who has long-maintained that this case and a successful steroids prosecution were retaliation for him attempting to expose police corruption.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Senior U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White dismissed a deprivation of rights charge against Devon Wenger, who still faces a charge of conspiring with two Antioch-officers-turned-felons to deprive the civil rights of people they came across in their jobs. White held off ruling on a defense motion to throw out the conspiracy charge until after Wenger’s trial, meaning that even if a jury convicts Wenger, the judge may overrule it.\n\nThe decision is only the latest stunner in the federal government’s prosecution of Wenger, a former Sonoma County Sheriff’s deputy and military combat veteran in Pakistan, who was one of 14 ex-Antioch and Pittsburg officers rounded up and charged in August 2023. Wenger is the only remaining officer whose case remains unresolved. Along the way he has gone through several defense attorneys, publicly accused various government officials of corruption and claimed repeatedly to have been targeted for his status as a “whistleblower” of excessive force and sexual harassment at the Antioch Police Department.\n\n“I broke the blue wall of silence and spoke out against law enforcement corruption and now those same people are targeting me and prosecuting me for doing the right thing,” Wenger wrote last May 23 in an email to President Donald Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, and other government officials, which copied this news organization on the message. He later accused White, the judge who dismissed the charge, of “jury tampering, misconduct, and failure to address prosecutorial retaliation in my federal whistleblower case.”\n\nBut on Tuesday, White agreed with Wenger’s lawyers who argued the federal government failed to prove that Wenger committed a crime on Oct. 26, 2021, when he shot 31-year-old Dajon Smith with a less-lethal rubber round launcher. At the time, Smith was surrounded by police next to a suspected stolen car with raised hands, but arguing as officers yelled “put your hands on your head.”\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys stipulated that Smith had stolen a vehicle from a dealership in East Contra Costa hours earlier.\n\nThe case boiled down to video of the incident and dueling theories by defense and prosecution experts on police use of force. One of the expert witnesses was originally hired by federal prosecutors, who changed their mind about calling him as a witness, then he ended up on Wenger’s witness list, according to court records, suggesting his professional opinion may not have comported with the prosecution’s theory.\n\nThe conspiracy charge is built on text messages exchanged between Wenger and ex-Antioch officers Morteza Amiri and Eric Rombough. Last March, a jury convicted Amiri of deprivation of rights and falsifying records for unleashing his dog, Purcy, on a man during a traffic stop in Antioch, but acquitted him of conspiracy and other deprivation charges. Rombough, who was described by Wenger’s former lawyer as the most violent of the three, took a plea deal and became a government witness with the hope of leniency.\n\nWenger was supposed to go on trial with Amiri, but just two days in, his lawyer, Nicole Lopes, insisted on a mistrial blaming her law firm and struggles with mental health. After she appeared on a podcast bragging about getting Wenger a mistrial when White had denied a motion to sever the co-defendants, White accused her of a “lack of candor” to the court and kicked her off of Wenger’s case. A new lawyer from Los Angeles, Michael Schwartz, has taken on Wenger’s defense.\n\nWenger was convicted in May of distributing steroids, based on text messages, the testimony of another former Antioch officer, Daniel Harris, who admitted to selling steroids to several law enforcement officials. In the email to Trump, Bondi, and others, Wenger accused White of ignoring “manipulation” by technicians working for a Contra Costa District Attorney investigator “to inject text messages not native to my phone.” Wenger still faces sentencing in that case, regardless of how the civil rights trial pans out.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys are scheduled to make their closing arguments on Wednesday, court records show. The jury instructions make it clear that they only have one charge to decide on now.","summary":"Devon Wenger, convicted of steroids distribution this year, has long maintained the prosecutions against him are retaliation over him attempting to expose corruption at the police department.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/16/judge-dismisses-charge-against-ex-antioch-cop-shot-suspected-car-thief-with-less-fired-lethal-launcher/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SJM-L-APDVIDEOS-11XX-18-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:43:55","author":"Nate Gartrell","authors":["Nate Gartrell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.281},{"id":361094724,"title":"Australia news LIVE: Albanese to meet Trump in US visit next week; Suspect in Kirk killing charged with aggravated murder","text":"Four people were arrested on Tuesday after images of Donald Trump and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto the royal Windsor Castle, where the US president is set to be hosted by King Charles during his state visit to Britain.\n\nTrump arrived in Britain late on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST) for an unprecedented second state visit, and will be greeted by Charles on Wednesday for a day of pomp at Windsor Castle, near London.\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters unfurled a massive banner featuring a photograph of Trump and Epstein near Windsor Castle, and later projected several images of the two onto one of the castle’s towers.\n\nOther images projected include a birthday letter Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein more than 20 years ago – the authenticity of which the White House has denied – pictures of Epstein’s victims, news clips about the case and police reports.\n\nThe police said in a statement that four adults had been arrested on suspicion of malicious communications following an “unauthorised projection” at Windsor Castle, which they described as a “public stunt”.","summary":"Follow our national news blog for live updates from Australia and beyond.","url":"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/australia-news-live-albanese-to-meet-trump-in-us-visit-next-week-suspect-in-kirk-killing-charged-with-aggravated-murder-20250917-p5mvmr.html","image":"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.353%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/ed687dd6a51e63d07d176108cd57ccf1a270cb21","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:43:16","author":"Emily Kaine","authors":["Emily Kaine"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.146},{"id":361095858,"title":"Labour faces questions over what concessions were made to secure a £30billion deal with US tech giants","text":"Labour was facing questions last night about what concessions were made to secure a multi-billion-pound deal with US tech giants.\n\nAs part of Donald Trump's State visit this week, Sir Keir Starmer has struck an agreement that could bring billions of pounds of investment to the UK.\n\nIt will enable both countries to cooperate on areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear power.\n\nSir Keir said the deal showed 'a general step change' in Britain's relationship with the US that would deliver 'growth, security and opportunity up and down the country'.\n\nBut the Tories asked what the Prime Minister has offered in exchange for the £30 billion deal.\n\nUS tech firms have lobbied to scrap the digital services tax and for copyright exceptions so they can use material from the UK's creative industries.\n\nJulia Lopez, the shadow technology secretary, said: 'Labour must be open about what concessions they have made to get this deal over the line, and who instead they'll be trying to tax to make up for lost revenue.'\n\nThere are concerns that the digital services tax could be on the table as the price for any deal on technology with the US. The tax is a 2 per cent levy on online search engines and social media which raises about £800 million a year.\n\nThe US President has made clear he sees it as an unfair tax targeting American firms.\n\nThere are also concerns the UK could side with AI firms who want to use copyrighted material – including from artists and publishers – for free.\n\nAlongside the deal, Britain will benefit from £31 billion of investment from the US's leading technology companies, including £22 billion from Microsoft. The outlay will help fund an expansion of AI infrastructure.\n\nThe 'tech prosperity deal' could speed up the development of medicines, life-saving treatments and improved cancer care.\n\nGoogle will invest £5 billion in AI over the next two years, which will go towards a data centre in Hertfordshire.\n\nBut there are concerns about the energy such centres use and whether they imperil Labour's Net Zero goals.\n\nTory energy spokesman Claire Coutinho said: 'Britain will not grow or make the most of AI or advanced manufacturing without access to cheap, reliable and abundant energy.

Gretchen Whitmer said in an economic speech Tuesday.\n\n“Michigan understands the negative consequences of unfettered trade with other countries that don’t play fair,” Whitmer said. “Decades of offshoring and outsourcing shipped hundreds of thousands of good-paying, middle-class jobs overseas and shuttered hundreds of factories. The ripple effects were devastating. Fewer people, empty main streets, crumbling roads, and shrinking schools.”\n\nThe speech, delivered at Michigan’s Heritage Hall in Lansing, had two goals: addressing the state’s budget impasse and detailing the damage Trump’s tariffs would continue to have on the state.\n\n“I hear this from employers in Michigan and in every meeting on the investment mission to Japan and Germany,” Whitmer said. “Companies that have invested in Michigan for decades brought up uncertainty caused by our national tariff policy. They want to invest in Michigan, but tariffs are keeping them on the sidelines. Uncertainty breeds paralysis. And paralysis costs jobs.”\n\nWhitmer’s address came following a weeklong stint in Japan on a venture to secure job deals. The Democrat has made trips like this since she started her second term in 2023.\n\nThe governor said no industry is more at risk from tariffs than automakers and suppliers, with 1.2 million Michiganders employed in the automotive supply chain. That equates to one in five Michigan jobs.\n\nWhitmer toughens budget talk against Michigan Republicans with shutdown looming\n\n“Canada and Mexico are our biggest auto trading partners, with car parts crossing both borders an average of eight times,” she said. “But now, additional 25% tariffs have been slapped on foreign-made auto parts, including those from Canada and Mexico. Even higher tariffs on steel and aluminum, two materials crucial for building cars, exacerbate the problem. ”\n\nUncertainty, Whitmer said, has been crippling manufacturing from making investments. It was in that vein that Whitmer also hinted at new policies for job creation in Michigan, noting that the state needs new tools to leverage its workforce in manufacturing to compete with other states and nations.\n\nThe governor outlined three goals toward that aim: make it easier to build factories in Michigan, create and retain jobs to run them, and make it easier to incentivize innovation.\n\nA key tool Michigan has tried in the last few years was in the form of economic and monetary incentives for companies, which have mixed results, especially in the face of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nWhitmer seemingly acknowledged the difficulty of using incentives or other proverbial carrots to spur innovation and business growth on Tuesday.\n\n“No tool is perfect, but we have to do something to deliver more wins for Michigan, because competition is fierce,” she said.","summary":"Tariffs lodged by President Donald Trump would have an outsized impact on Michigan’s economic standing, particularly its manufacturing and automotive sectors, Gov.

In a cynical act of self-service, UC’s leadership has given the names of those who practiced free speech, endangering their lives and livelihoods.\n\nAs a Berkeley alum, I am appalled by this decision. One would think that the regents, president and senior council would know their history enough to recognize the moment we are in and know that this presidential administration does not act in good faith.

But all too often, private equity thrives by raising prices or pushing unnecessary services. That is especially true of its substantial involvement in health care facilities and medical practices.\n\nBecause private equity firms enforce silence on their investors, it is impossible to know how much CalPERS invests directly or indirectly in health care, but it’s probably substantial.\n\nWhat we do know is that a large systematic review found that PE ownership of health care facilities is generally associated with higher costs to patients, in some cases, up to 32%. As for physician practices, fees increased substantially in many specialties.\n\nThat means our pensions profit from increasing our health care costs. It’s worse for non-pensioners who don’t get the increased income, just the increased costs.\n\nJames Wolpman\nWalnut Creek\n\nProgressives’ speech\nthreatens democracy\n\nRe: “Masked agents a step toward dictatorship” (Page A6, Sept. 12).\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer has uttered some very divisive rhetoric over the years, including calling Donald Trump and his supporters “threats to democracy” (as President Biden and many other Democrats have done). But after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, I give him credit for calling it an attack on democracy. This is true no matter what you think about Kirk’s views and his influence.\n\nSo, it was quite disturbing that the day after the assassination, the Times printed a letter restating a recently popular progressive rallying cry that progressives “should not bring a knife to a gun fight.” Well, Kirk’s assassin brought a gun and used it. But he brought it not to a gun fight or a knife fight or any type of fight. He brought it to an open debate led by an American exercising his First Amendment rights. And there will never be anything more anti-democratic than that.\n\nChristopher Andrus\n\nIf schools allow God,\nwhose will it be?\n\nLet’s discuss something rarely openly talked about. Much has been made in some quarters of the “loss of God” in public schools, and laws have been passed in some states to post the Ten Commandments in all classrooms.\n\nMy question is, whose God? The Christian God? Are Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and atheists all forbidden? Those arguing the loudest for a return to God ignore the fact that most people on the planet are not Christians. I encourage further thought on the matter.\n\nChris Ackerman\nCastro Valley\n\nKirk’s legacy mired\nin divisive speech\n\nRe: “Story ignored full measure of Kirk” (Page A8, Sept. 14).\n\nIn his letter to the editor, Michael Macfarlane assigns an apt — if unintended — moniker to Charlie Kirk: “the Pied Piper of the conservative movement.” In the original story, the Piper has a grievance with a village that doesn’t pay him for services rendered, so he lures away the children of the village, and they’re never seen again.\n\nPolitical violence is never the answer. Kirk’s assassination will only further divide Americans. As Macfarlane implies, we should reflect on “the great things this man stood for.” His “incredible movement within the Republican Party” included homophobic, racist, sexist — and yes, antisemitic — rhetoric.\n\nJust one example of his overt bigotry: “Black women do not have brain processing power to be taken seriously. You have to go steal a white person’s slot.”\n\nHow many of the village’s kids now espouse that belief? That’s Kirk’s legacy.\n\nRobert Vorkapich\nWalnut Creek\n\nTrump offers nation\na poor role model\n\nWe currently have a president living in the White House who has demonstrated the following character traits: liar, cheater, one who makes fun of another’s appearance, one who makes fun of another’s name, one who blames others for his actions and the list goes on.\n\nAs a retired elementary teacher for almost 40 years, I am proud to say our staff members worked diligently to help nurture positive traits in our students, students who would grow up to be productive, responsible citizens who respect others and who would be willing to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nIt is obvious our current president failed the course on humanity and ideals of democracy. He stands before us as a perfect example of a citizen who does not demonstrate the traits of kindness, common decency and manners.\n\nVoters, change is vital.\n\nRoxanne Le Blanc","summary":"Also: Public pensions &#124; Democracy threatened &#124; Whose God? &#124; Legacy mired &#124; Poor role model.

Pastor Goes Viral for Anti-Charlie Kirk Sermon","text":"The Reverend Howard-John Wesley has gone viral online after he spoke about right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in a sermon. Wesley is a senior pastor of the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Virginia.His remarks have been met with a mixed response online, as some social media users have criticized the sentiments he expressed toward Kirk, while others have praised them, and the clip of his sermon has amassed millions of views online.Newsweek has reached out to the Alfred Street Baptist Church via email for comment.Why It MattersKirk, 31, was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University on September 10. He was the co-founder and CEO of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth movement.Kirk's assassination has sent shockwaves through the country, and there has been an outpouring of grief from his supporters, as well as President Donald Trump and his administration, plus high-profile Democrats and celebrities.Despite this, there have been some social media posts and videos that have celebrated his killing, while others have responded to his death by sharing criticism of his political beliefs. This is something that the Trump administration has quickly responded to, with Vice President JD Vance encouraging people to report those who may be celebrating his killing to their employer.The response to Kirk's death has been divided and has prompted a conversation about free speech and cancel culture, something about which there are disparate views on both sides of the political aisle.What To KnowIn a sermon that has circulated widely on social media, Wesley said: \"Charlie Kirk did not deserve to be assassinated, but I'm overwhelmed seeing the flags of the United States of America at half-staff, calling this nation to honor and venerate a man who was an unapologetic racist and spent all of his life sowing seeds of division and hate into this land.\"\"How you die does not redeem how you lived. You do not become a hero in your death when you are a weapon of the enemy in your life. I can abhor the violence that took your life, but I don't have to celebrate how you chose to live,\" he said in the sermon.The Alfred Street Baptist Church is one of the oldest and largest African American Baptist churches in the country.Wesley is the eighth pastor in the church's more than 200-year history, and represents the fifth generation of Baptist preachers, according to information on the Alfred Street Baptist Church website. He graduated magna cum laude from Duke University in 1994, majoring in biomedical and electrical engineering.He has a prominent following on social media, with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, where he primarily posts religious content, like videos of sermons, but over the years he has used the platform to speak about politics.In a clip of the sermon in which he spoke about Kirk, shared to his Instagram page, he said: \"I'm overwhelmed with the culture of division and violence that this administration fuels and fertilizes, with an inability to show compassion for those who are in need.He previously criticized Trump on his Instagram, writing in a post in October 2021 about Trump: \"This is EXACTLY why this [clown emoji] has no business being in leadership in America. He can't honor anyone who didn't kiss his behind.\" In a different post, dated December 2017, he wrote that Trump is: \"A liar who can't take an L and creates fake wins for himself—he's unfit and unqualified for his office.\"In August 2021, he shared a post wishing a happy birthday to former President Barack Obama. The image featured him with the former president as well as former first lady Michelle Obama and their two children, Sasha and Malia. On November 7, 2020, when it was announced that President Joe Biden had won the 2020 presidential election, he wrote on Instagram that he was \"So grateful and happy. Let's make America better.\"In 2020, he shared posts on social media in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and shared images of himself and his two sons at protests.In 2022, he shared a post on Instagram in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that read: \"The Supreme Court's decision that overturns Roe v. Wade discards nearly 50 years of precedent and will compromise the health and wellbeing of many. I am saddened by this reckless decision, which is an affront to human rights in general and the right to reproductive choices for women in particular.\"On November 5, 2024, Wesley shared a picture of himself with an \"I voted\" sticker with the caption: \"What's understood doesn't need to be explained #vote.\" He followed this post with one encouraging people to vote.In February, a post to Instagram from the church and Wesley announced that they would cancel hosting their annual Christmas performances at the Kennedy Center. The post read: \"We believe that the new leadership's opposition to the Kennedy Center's long-standing tradition of honoring artistic expression across all backgrounds is misaligned with our unwavering commission to proclaim and practice the transformative and redemptive love of Jesus.\"Trump appointed himself as chair of the Kennedy Center in February. He also announced that he was firing most of the Board of Trustees and said that he would be in charge of programming going forward and told reporters that he was going to ensure that programming at the center was \"good\" and \"not woke.\"What People Are SayingThe Instagram account @dr.smrtmouth responded to a clip of Wesley's sermon: \"Thank God for you. Your courage is refreshing.\"@TheOfficerTatum in a post on X viewed 4.3 million times, responding to the sermon: \"I knew Charlie Kirk personally. Worked with him for nearly 10 years.

CCSD responded that it had no further statement.\n\nClark County Education Association, which represents the district’s teachers and other licensed professionals, said in a brief statement that the “situation is live and pending.”\n\n“CCEA has no comment on this matter until our investigation is complete,”said CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita.\n\nMoms for Liberty Clark County days earlier publicly called for four CCSD teachers to be fired. The Nevada Current is not naming the teachers who are not public figures.\n\nOne of the teachers on his private Facebook page posted that he could not think of many people “more deserving” of a gunshot wound to the neck.\n\nThe second teacher, also on his private Facebook page, posted he had “watched the video over and over like 50 times by now,” that he loved “every fraction of a second of it” and that “it gets better with every watch.”\n\nRepublican state Sen. Lori Rogich, whose husband is the namesake of the school where that teacher works, released a statement saying “glorifying a political assasination is never acceptable.” She did not identify the individual but said she supports his removal.\n\nThe third teacher left a Facebook comment saying he was “not celebrating” Kirk’s death but that he “won’t feel sorry for the guy either.\n\n“I feel bad for his kids that their dad was murdered for being a piece of trash human,” that teacher wrote.\n\nThe final teacher targeted by the Moms for Liberty group left a comment reading “you reap what you sow” on a post asking people to pray for Kirk.\n\nClark County School Board Trustee Lydia Dominguez, who until taking office was a member of Moms for Liberty Clark County, said in a social media post that anyone mocking Kirk’s murder “should never be trusted with children.”\n\nShe added, “I understand the process is painfully slow, but the district has begun it, and it must be done by the book so no lawyer can twist the outcome, because the last thing our students need is a lawsuit draining money from their classrooms.”\n\nThe Current found additional public calls for ousting teachers at Washoe County School District, which as of Tuesday morning had limited comments on its social media, and at least one state-authorized charter school. WCSD did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Gov. Joe Lombardo last week, when asked about reports that public employees were celebrating Kirk’s death, said agencies who determine their employees acted inappropriately should remove those employees as soon as possible.\n\nRealtor, radio producer fired\n\nMeanwhile, in the private sector, Las Vegas realtor Mark Sivek was fired from Realty ONE Group Las Vegas, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Sivek was set to lead the Las Vegas REALTORS board of directors but has been removed from the position.\n\nAccording to screenshots circulating on social media, Sivek called Kirk “an evil POS” and said “no thoughts no prayers for this POS.”\n\nSivek also posted that Kirk’s “harmful ideologies have been silenced.” That post continued, “While violence is never an acceptable solution, it’s essential to acknowledge the damage caused by his racist and discriminatory beliefs. Kirk used religion to justify his prejudices, promoting Christian Nationalism, which is a thinly veiled form of white supremacy. This ideology has no connection to the values of compassion and empathy that are central to Christ’s teachings.”\n\nLotus Communications, parent company of Fox Sports Radio, last week announced they had terminated local radio producer Bobby Machado for a social media post about Kirk.\n\nOne of his since-deleted posts, according to screenshots circulating online, read: “i’m just gonna say one more thing about charlie kirk… good f—— riddance…i’ve watched his show…way too much…he’s a piece of human s— and i glad as f— the world is without him…f— him all the way to hell…goodnight.”\n\nTrattoria Reggiano, a restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, and Bonanno’s New York Pizza Kitchen posted identical statements on their social media pages stating one of their employees was “no longer with the company, effective immediately” because of comments made on social media.\n\nThe Current is not naming the worker, who is not a public figure.\n\nAccording to a TikTok video being shared by those calling for her firing, the worker said that when she watches the video of Kirk, she isn’t thinking of him.\n\n“I don’t think of him. I think of the little children in school who had to deal with that, watching that happen to their friends, or watching it happen to themselves. … Children who are not even old enough to form an opinion about any of this stuff. And he lobbied for guns to stay in circulation and said they were necessary deaths. Just like car accidents.”\n\nThe post was evidently referring to Kirk’s remarks during one of his shows in 2023, in which he said: “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”","summary":"An unknown number of public school teachers, a realtor, a radio broadcaster and a pizzeria worker are among the Nevadans who’ve been fired or are facing reprimand for social media posts about the death of Republican activist and influencer Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe actions all appear to have been prompted by mass reporting of the employees to their employers and mirror efforts happening across the country in the aftermath of Kirk’s fatal shooting last week during a speaking event at a Utah university.\n\nThe motive of Kirk’s alleged shooter is still unknown, though politicians and political pundits on both sides have been quick to assign blame.

That ruling had allowed Willis to stay on the case after Wade resigned.\n\nA Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 of his allies in August 2023, charging them with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results after Trump narrowly lost in Georgia. It’s now the last criminal case against Trump still pending.\n\nJustice Andrew Pinson, who wrote the concurring opinion, said Willis’ appeal was too narrowly focused for the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\n“Even if one believes that the Court of Appeals erred in reaching that decision, granting review to answer that question would be mere error correction, and this Court generally does not exercise our certiorari jurisdiction merely to correct errors that do not have some broader impact on Georgia law,” Pinson wrote in the concurring opinion.\n\nJustices Sarah Hawkins Warren, Charlie Bethel and Shawn Ellen LaGrua joined Pinson in the concurring opinion. Justices John Ellington, Carla Wong McMillian and Verda Colvin dissented.\n\nWillis said in a statement she respects the court’s decision and the legal process, despite disagreeing with the outcome, and will work to ensure the prosecutor assigned to the case has access to the case material.\n\n“My office will make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council for use in the ongoing litigation. I hope that whoever is assigned to handle the case will have the courage to do what the evidence and the law demand,” Willis said.\n\nPeter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, said in a statement that while the council will be notified of the Supreme Court’s decision once the case is remitted back to the Fulton County Superior Court, the search for a new prosecutor started immediately.\n\n“PAC will fulfill its duty … to appoint another prosecutor to take over the cases. When that decision is made, it will be announced at the appropriate time. Until then, any action on PAC’s part is premature, and we have no further comments,” Skandalakis said in a statement.\n\nTrump’s return to the White House also adds another complication to the case, with legal experts skeptical that a trial could be held while he is in office. But the case could still proceed in the meantime against the other defendants, like Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nPinson wrote that the court’s review is reserved for cases of “gravity or great public importance” and is not for “mere error correction.” He argued that whether a prosecutor can be disqualified based “solely upon an appearance of impropriety” was not directly addressed in the appeal, as Willis had not cross-appealed the trial court’s finding of an appearance of impropriety. The Court of Appeals’ decision was a narrow ruling about the specific solution — Willis’ disqualification — to the admitted problem of impropriety in this case, Pinson wrote, rather than a broad legal issue requiring the Georgia Supreme Court’s opinion.\n\n“Rather than deciding any broader question about whether an appearance of impropriety can serve as an independent ground for disqualification of public prosecutors, the Court of Appeals’ decision appears to have resolved a narrow, case-specific dispute about the trial court’s choice of disqualification remedy,” Pinson wrote.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, McMillian argued that the court should have agreed to review the case. She wrote that the issue of whether an attorney can be disqualified based on the appearance of impropriety alone affects every active lawyer in Georgia. McMillian pointed out that the Court of Appeals’ decisions on this point are in conflict and that Georgia Supreme Court precedent, which the Court of Appeals’ ruling relied upon, warrants reconsideration.\n\nMcMillian also raised concerns that a new state law creates a financial incentive for defendants to seek the disqualification of prosecutors, and that the “amorphous” appearance-of-impropriety standard is easy to meet.\n\nLawmakers passed a measure during the 2025 legislative session that allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. The proposal’s main sponsor said the bill was inspired by Trump’s case in Fulton County.\n\n“This case requires the resolution of a novel issue of gravity about which the state of the law is confused and conflicted — both in Georgia and across the country — and thus warrants consideration (or reconsideration) by this Court. Moreover, the issue affects the bench and bar across the board and will likely recur such that guidance from this Court is desirable,” McMillian wrote.\n\nJosh McKoon, chair of the Georgia Republican Party, celebrated in a statement, saying that Willis “wasted millions of tax dollars harassing patriotic and law abiding Americans, embarrassing herself and our state, and overwhelming our system of justice with the stench of her mendacity” and called for the United States Attorney, the Attorney General of Georgia and the State Bar of Georgia to open investigation on her conduct.\n\n“But now it is time for a reckoning. She must be held accountable for her actions … This can never be allowed to happen again in our State,” McKoon said.\n\nAttorney General Chris Carr called the Georgia Supreme Court’s decision “the correct one,” saying Willis was disqualified due to a “self-inflicted mistake,” but he did not call for further investigation. He concluded his statement by stating that “‘lawfare’ of any kind cannot stand.”\n\n“When prosecutors use their office to advance a political agenda, the system as a whole suffers,” Carr wrote in an online post.\n\nTrump’s lead attorney Steve Sadow also said in a social media post that the Georgia Supreme Court “correctly denied” reviewing the lower court’s decision.\n\n“Willis’ misconduct during the investigation and prosecution of President Trump was egregious and she deserved nothing less than disqualification. This proper decision should bring an end to the wrongful political, lawfare persecutions of the President,” Sadow wrote.\n\nBut Charlie Bailey, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said in a statement that people “deserve full accountability for the election deniers who tried to subvert their votes and silence their voices,” saying that out of the 19 people indicted, four have already pleaded guilty.\n\n“The prosecution of this case must continue so that it can be decided the way all criminal cases must be — according to the evidence and the law,” Bailey said in a statement.","summary":"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis remains disqualified from prosecuting President Donald Trump’s election interference case after the Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal over her removal.\n\nThe 4-3 decision issued Tuesday means the state’s highest court will not review the Georgia Court of Appeals’ December ruling that disqualified Willis from prosecuting the case involving Trump and his remaining co-defendants due to a “significant appearance of impropriety,” which stemmed from a romantic relationship she had with a special prosecutor she hired, Nathan Wade.\n\nThat decision had tossed aside the trial court’s ruling last spring that there was no “actual conflict of interest” on Willis’ part, but had noted a “financial cloud of impropriety and potential untruthfulness” related to the testimony of certain witnesses.

Others disagree with that sentiment so much that they're offering free barbecue for the troops before they even arrive.\n\nBefore Trump signed an order on the deployment Monday, the White House sent out a list of news reports, some of them documenting residents' support for the measure and others chronicling instances of violent crime in the city.\n\n“They want us to be there. They don't want to be mugged. Who would say, ‘Gee, I don’t want the National Guard?’” the president said in the Oval Office.\n\nBut Britney Thornton, the commissioner representing Orange Mound, one of the oldest Black neighborhoods in majority-Black Memphis, has a different perspective. She said there's a “huge disconnect” between the decision-makers deploying the guard and Memphians who know the needs of the community.\n\nLax state gun laws combined with a lack of access to basics like education and food are the true drivers of crime, said Thornton, who also runs a nonprofit that provides necessities to low-income people in the area.\n\nIf the National Guard focuses solely on punitive measures like handing out tickets or increasing traffic stops, she said, it could make problems worse by “putting more pressure on working-class individuals.“\n\nStill, she feels there could be opportunities for the guard to be helpful if deployed in the right way: Specifically, they could help empower organizers to canvass in areas where they might otherwise feel unsafe. Or they could help pick up trash.\n\n“If you’re going to invest those dollars, make it a real investment,” Thornton said.\n\nMayor Paul Young, a Democrat, has said he didn’t ask for the deployment and doesn’t think it’s the way to reduce crime. But he hopes he can help drive how it will operate.\n\n Supporting, and feeding, the guard \n\nMortimer’s Restaurant, a well-known bar and grill in East Memphis that opened in 1981, was one of several restaurants across the city that took to social media to offer free or discounted meals for National Guard members. Owner Christopher Jamieson said he wanted to show support for the troops, who he hopes will help address crime.\n\n“I think our local government definitely needs help,” Jamieson said.\n\nThese days in Memphis, most people try to avoid staying out past dark out of fear of crime, Jamieson said, and he has made emergency calls on numerous occasions to help people overdosing on drugs. The dampened late-night traffic has led to his kitchen starting to close two hours earlier.\n\n“We’ve all grown up in it, but we’ve never seen anything like this,” Jamieson said.\n\nAfter posting the offer, Jamieson said he has received support from neighbors, family members of National Guard soldiers and people offering to donate to cover the costs of the free meals. He hopes they will show the troops that “there are a lot of good people here, and a lot of people who want to see our city fixed and see it safer.”\n\n A ‘Band-Aid solution’ \n\nRichard Massey, a University of Memphis student and activist, said the city is not where it wants to be in terms of crime but is making progress. While discussing the deployment, both Republican and Democratic officials have noted recent decreases in some crime metrics.\n\nBut gun violence issues have been a problem for years. In 2023 the city saw a record of more than 390 homicides. \n\nMassey also said there should be further investments into schools, after-school programs and affordable housing in underserved neighborhoods. Deploying the National Guard is a “Band-Aid solution” rather than a long-term fix, he said, and he doesn't think eating at restaurants with troops stationed outside will raise morale.\n\n“This is exploiting people’s fears and public safety concerns in Memphis,” Massey said.\n\n The governor's plans \n\nSpecifics about the number of troops, their tasks and their arrival are still being revealed. \n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Lee told The Daily Memphian on Tuesday that he did not think there would be many more than 150 National Guard personnel deployed, but he stressed that the number is not final while preparations and planning continue. He said 150 is about the number of Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers assigned to Shelby County. The new operation will involve numerous law enforcement agencies.\n\nHe said guard members would arrive “sooner than later,” adding that he would request that they mostly be military police trained in law enforcement. He also prefers them to be troops that the state recently sent to Washington for Trump's crackdown there. Lee said he will advocate for local leaders to help determine how they are used to support officers fighting crime.\n\nThe early suggestion would be a small fraction of the roughly 2,000 who were deployed to Washington from seven states and the D.C. guard.\n\nRiddle reported from Montgomery, Alabama.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s plan to send the National Guard into Memphis for a crime-fighting push has stirred mixed feelings among the populace","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/national-guard-donald-trump-thornton-nashville-white-house-b2827910.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/17/00/APTOPIX_Trump_54245.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:16:46","author":"Jonathan Mattise","authors":["Jonathan Mattise"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.049},{"id":361091682,"title":"Police update following 'public stunt in Windsor' during Donald Trump visit","text":"A number of people have been arrested after Thames Valley Police were called to a public stunt in Windsor yesterday evening.

President Trump's legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Trump himself told NBC News on Tuesday that the matter was a \"dead issue.\"What to KnowOn Tuesday, The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, released new documents in the Epstein investigation, including a transcript of Barr's August deposition. In it, Barr explained why some materials remain unpublished under legal principles. Oversight Chair James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, also released unredacted estate materials—cash ledgers, message logs, calendars, flight logs—and released portions of Epstein's \"birthday book,\" naming contributors like Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz.Barr testified that he also discussed Epstein's sex trafficking charges with Trump on another occasion. He said Trump told him he had cut ties with Epstein years earlier.Democrats on the committee said Barr's testimony did not clear Trump of possible wrongdoing.Also Tuesday, FBI Director Kash Patel told U.S. senators on Tuesday morning that there is \"no credible information\" in case files that Epstein trafficked young women to anyone other than himself.The remarks came during a heated hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Republican Louisiana Senator John Kennedy asked Patel about his knowledge of the Epstein files.What People Are SayingBarr testified in August that he acknowledged why some Epstein records remain sealed, the transcript shows, \"The general principle is, if you have enough evidence to charge someone, you put that evidence out through the process, but you don't just open your files. \"So, I understand why there is reluctance to do it. And, as I say, the Attorney General has to make a balance.\"Patel told senators Tuesday, \"There is no credible information, none [that Epstein trafficked women to anyone other than himself.] If there were I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals. And the information we have, again, is limited.\"Senator Kennedy told FBI Director Patel Tuesday that his explanation was unlikely to satisfy calls for greater transparency: \"This issue is not going to go away. The central question for the American people is this: They know Epstein trafficked young women for sex with himself. What they want to know is whether he trafficked them to anyone else.\"What Happens NextThe Oversight Committee said it will continue pressing the Justice Department and Epstein's estate for additional records. Comer said the panel intends to review those materials as they are turned over in the coming weeks. The Justice Department has signaled that more documents will be produced, though victim identities and sensitive evidence will remain redacted.Update: 9/16/25, 7:39 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"Barr said in a deposition released by the House Oversight Committee that he called Trump immediately after learning of Epstein's death.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/epstein-update-barr-trump-attorney-general-2130936","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2723979/trump-barr.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=34706457a9dcf30f7fdc43b00affb014","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:10:42","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.622},{"id":361100974,"title":"Jefe de la Patrulla Fronteriza de California, Gregory Bovino, llega a Chicago prometiendo más arrestos de ICE","text":"Un funcionario de la Patrulla Fronteriza que lideró las agresivas redadas del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en California anunció el martes que está expandiendo su operativo de deportación en Chicago, un aumento significativo de una campaña impredecible de la administración de Trump que ha alimentado cada vez más el miedo dentro de las comunidades inmigrantes de la ciudad.\n\n“¡Bueno, Chicago, hemos llegado!” escribió Gregory Bovino en una publicación en redes sociales, acompañada de un video de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza en Chicago. “El operativo ‘At Large’ está aquí para continuar la misión que comenzamos en Los Ángeles: hacer la ciudad más segura al apuntar y arrestar a inmigrantes ilegales [que son] criminales”.\n\nMientras hablaba con los reporteros, el gobernador JB Pritzker mencionó que fuentes le informaron a su oficina que la administración de Trump tenía como objetivo aumentar las redadas mientras los habitantes de Chicago celebraban el Día de la Independencia de México el martes. El operativo también ocurre mientras el presidente Donald Trump volvió a prometer que la Guardia Nacional sería desplegada en Chicago a pesar de la oposición de Pritzker.\n\nLa secretaria adjunta del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), Tricia McLaughlin, escribió en redes sociales que los arrestos en Chicago el martes incluyeron a personas detenidas por asalto violento, acoso grave o manejar bajo la influencia (DUI). No dio nombres. Según Pritzker, la secretaria de DHS, Kristi Noem, también estuvo en el área de Chicago durante unas horas el martes, pero se fue al mediodía.\n\nBovino, que típicamente viste equipo táctico, lideró el último esfuerzo de deportación en Los Ángeles que resultó en más de 5,000 arrestos. Llamada “Operativo At Large”, el plan nacional es un esfuerzo intensificado que apunta a aquellos que no tienen estatus legal. Las redadas en California incluyeron a agentes de ICE saliendo de un camión alquilado sin marcas y arrestando a personas en un estacionamiento de Home Depot. El operativo, llamado “Operativo Caballo de Troya”, fue documentado en un video editado en redes sociales, acompañado de música rap. Los agentes en California también son vistos rompiendo ventanas de autos y patrullando un parque a caballo.\n\nLa acción del martes en Chicago y los suburbios circundantes es distinta delOperativo Midway Blitz del DHS, que fue anunciado hace dos semanas.\n\nLos defensores de la inmigración dicen que el esfuerzo está diseñado en gran medida para difundir miedo entre la población inmigrante del área y empujar a las personas a la autodeportación.\n\nLa administración tiene una campaña bien diseñada para aumentar la expectativa en torno a sus esfuerzos de cumplimiento de la ley, al incorporar influencers mientras los oficiales federales de inmigración realizan operativos de cumplimiento, y al confiar en redes sociales y medios conservadores afines.\n\nRespondiendo a una publicación en redes sociales de Matt Hill, Jefe Adjunto de Gabinete de Comunicaciones del Gobernador JB Pritzker, quien criticó que ICE no ha llamado a Pritzker pero tiene “el tiempo para crear un video en TikTok mostrando la hermosa escenografía de Chicago”, Bovino escribió: “¡Tik tok, tik tok, se acaba el tiempo!”.\n\n“Ya hemos arrestado a varios criminales esta mañana. Vendrán muchos más, así que está atento, amigo”, escribió Bovino. En otras publicaciones, mencionó que “se dirigía a McKinley Park” y al suburbio de Franklin Park.\n\nMás de una docena de personas fueron detenidas por agentes federales de inmigración el lunes en redadas cerca de una estación de policía en un suburbio del oeste y en una corte de Chicago, según un legislador estatal y funcionarios de la corte. Los agentes federales también fueron vistos cerca de las cortes en Chicago el lunes.\n\nHablando en WBEZ el martes por la mañana, el alcalde Brandon Johnson dijo que planeaba firmar una orden ejecutiva el martes “para proteger el derecho de la gente de protestar” mientras continúa la campaña de deportación de ICE. Llamó a los operativos de deportación del presidente Donald Trump una “provocación de terror y ansiedad”. El mes pasado, Johnson también firmó una orden ejecutiva destinada a que las fuerzas del orden federales en la ciudad cumplan con las reglas municipales sobre la policía, mientras que también monitorean los nuevos despliegues e informan a los ciudadanos sobre sus derechos.\n\n“Es lamentable que este presidente se niegue a cooperar y trabajar con las municipalidades de este país”, dijo Johnson. “Queremos que los criminales salgan de las calles. Hay formas en las que puedes coordinar”.\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump insinuó el lunes que Chicago es “probablemente la siguiente”, para que un grupo federal —y la Guardia Nacional— puedan combatir el crimen. Sus comentarios se produjeron mientras anunció un grupo federal en Memphis, que también incluye el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional y fuerzas del orden del Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), la Agencia de Alcohol, Tabaco, Armas de Fuego y Explosivos (ATF), la Administración para el Control de Drogas (DEA), ICE y DHS.\n\nTrump hizo declaraciones similares el martes en el Jardín de la Casa Blanca, diciendo que planea enviar tropas a Chicago, a pesar de la oposición del gobernador JB Pritzker.\n\n“Así que voy a ir a Chicago temprano, en contra de Pritzker. Pritzker no es nada”, dijo Trump. “Si Pritzker fuera inteligente, diría ‘por favor, ven’.”\n\nPritzker respondió que “no puedes tomar en serio nada de lo que [Trump] dice de un día para otro.

Creo que podría estar sufriendo de alguna demencia... y al día siguiente se despertará del otro lado de la cama y dejará de hablar sobre Chicago”.\n\nPritzker dijo que las redadas intensificadas del martes parecían más generalizadas, pero aún seguían el manual de Trump “para causar desafíos y caos en el terreno”.\n\n“Cuanto más hostiguen los agentes de ICE, más personas quieren intervenir y ponerse en su camino. Y cuando eso sucede y hay algún tipo de contacto o compromiso con esos agentes de ICE que implique un posible ataque físico real, bueno, esa será la excusa”, destacó Pritzker. “Y está mal, por cierto: ellos lo están causando”.\n\nEl gobernador demócrata ha afirmado durante semanas que la estrategia de la Casa Blanca es aumentar la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, provocando protestas que luego podrían usarse para justificar un despliegue de la Guardia Nacional.\n\nRechazando la afirmación de Trump de que las redadas están destinadas a reducir el crimen —que ha disminuido en Chicago en los últimos años— Pritzker dice que se trata de normalizar la presencia militar en las comunidades para disminuir la participación electoral en las elecciones intermedias de 2026.\n\nPritzker dijo que Bovino “tiene un historial de actuar de maneras bastante violentas contra personas, muchas de las cuales no son criminales.”\n\n“Están arrestando a personas que tienen piel morena, o que hablan con acento, o que hablan en otro idioma, y no a personas que sean culpables o acusadas de cometer un crimen violento”, destacó el gobernador.\n\n“Piensa en esos niños que están en la escuela en este momento, que llegarán a casa a una casa vacía porque sus padres han sido llevados con una orden administrativa, no una orden judicial. No porque alguien haya cometido un crimen, sino por una orden administrativa emitida por un agente de ICE”, destacó Pritzker. “Ahora un niño llega a casa... Esto es lo que está haciendo ICE. Esto es lo que está haciendo el presidente de los Estados Unidos. Está mal”.\n\nLas redadas de inmigración esta semana parecen haberse centrado en los suburbios, aunque Pritzker dijo que su oficina sigue en la oscuridad sobre los planes federales. Las redadas también crean confusión para los departamentos de policía locales que “ven enfrentamientos, [y] no saben si esos son funcionarios reales de ICE, especialmente si están usando máscaras y andan en vehículos sin marcar y no llevan o muestran su identificación”, destacó Pritzker.\n\nContribuyó: Mariah Woelfel \n\nTraducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por La Voz Chicago","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/09/16/gregory-bovino-llega-a-chicago-prometiendo-mas-arrestos-de-ice","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eb43f71/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F83%2Ff64882354db3a6bfae7b9df12215%2Fimmig","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:05:37","author":"Mitchell Armentrout,Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Mitchell Armentrout","Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.506},{"id":361096476,"title":"Trump hails UK as ‘very special place’ ahead first full day of state visit","text":"US President Donald Trump has hailed the UK as a “very special place” ahead of the first full day of his historic second state visit.\n\nMr Trump landed at London Stansted airport on Air Force One on Tuesday evening before taking the Marine One helicopter to Winfield House in Regent’s Park, central London, where he will stay the night.\n\nThe US president told reporters on Tuesday evening he “loves” the UK.\n\n“I have a lot of things here that warm my heart,” he said. “I want to tell you. It’s a very special place.”\n\nThe American leader is being feted with a stay in Windsor Castle, where he will be hosted by the King and treated to a ceremonial welcome on Wednesday and later, a lavish state banquet.\n\nSecurity will be paramount, with Mr Trump confined to the private Windsor estate on the first full day, before heading to the Prime Minister’s country residence Chequers on Thursday.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales will play a key role in entertaining the president, who is known for his love of the royal family, and First Lady Melania Trump.\n\nWilliam and Kate will meet the American couple in the grounds of the Windsor estate on Wednesday.\n\nThe Queen – who spent Tuesday afternoon resting at Windsor Castle, having pulled out of attending the Duchess of Kent’s funeral on Tuesday after suffering from acute sinusitis – is said to be hopeful she will recover in time to attend the busy run of royal events including the glittering banquet.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales are expected to escort Mr and Mrs Trump a short distance to see the King and Queen for an open air greeting nearby.\n\nThe proceedings are aimed at extending a personal, family-centred welcome to the Trumps ahead of the official ceremony in the castle quadrangle after a carriage ride through private Home Park.\n\nThere are no public-facing engagements for the president throughout his visit, with thousands expected to take part in a major protest against his stay in central London on Wednesday.\n\nA small group of campaigners from the Stop Trump Coalition were in Windsor on Tuesday evening protesting against the US president’s visit, and later two protesters from the activist group Fossil Free London were escorted out of a dinner organised by Republicans Overseas UK in the Berkshire town.\n\nThe man and woman chanted “how many will you kill if you drill baby drill” and unfurled a banner that said: “Oily Money Kills” at the event in Windsor Guildhall.\n\nThames Valley Police said the pair were removed by the event organisers and no arrests were made.\n\nThe force said it arrested four people on suspicion of malicious communications after images of the US President and paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto Windsor Castle, and two men for breaching airspace restrictions in place for Mr Trump’s visit.\n\nThe mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan, who has previously been criticised by Mr Trump as “a nasty person” who has “done a terrible job” said on Tuesday night that “President Donald Trump and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Sir Sadiq added: “We must also tell President Trump and his supporters to stop talking down and denigrating our great capital city. London is a global success story, no matter how much he wants to pretend otherwise. It’s open, dynamic and safer than every US state in terms of homicide rates.”\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said it is preparing for “a significant operation” with as many as 50 protest groups expected to take part in Wednesday’s march in central London.\n\nMore than 1,600 officers will be deployed on Wednesday, including 500 assisting from other forces, Scotland Yard said.","summary":"Donald Trump said he ‘loves’ the UK after he arrived in London ahead of his second state visit.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-london-windsor-castle-sadiq-khan-winfield-house-b1248105.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/17/00/f651b94fc116bceb86372e114f2ffd10Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU4MTQ4Nzgw-2.81636531.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:01:28","author":"Pa Reporters","authors":["Pa Reporters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.207},{"id":361102412,"title":"Letters: Column never addresses CTA arguments against AB 715","text":"Column avoids CTA’s\narguments against bill\n\nRe: “California must make schools safer for Jews” (Page A8, Sept. 7).\n\nDaniel Klein, CEO of Jewish Silicon Valley, argues that teacher unions are not operating in good conscience in opposing AB 715 to reduce antisemitism. He likens their opposition to that of the segregationists of the 1960s.\n\nKlein says the Jewish community is not seeking special treatment, just equal treatment under the law. However, he turns a blind eye to uniquely complex provisions prohibiting an “antisemitic learning environment” and establishing an “Antisemitic Prevention Coordinator” with wide-ranging independent powers.\n\nFortunately, the California Senate struck these draconian provisions out of the bill now awaiting the governor’s signature.\n\nThe teacher’s unions opposed AB 715 because it compromised their autonomy and authority when there are already anti-discrimination laws on the books.\n\nIt’s sad that Klein could not engage the teacher unions on the merits of their arguments.\n\nOscar Rosenbloom\n\nGrowing SJSU must\nprovide parking relief\n\nSan Jose State University is growing, which is exciting for the institution, but unfortunately, parking on campus hasn’t matched the rise in enrollment. Every day, students, staff and faculty spend crucial learning or teaching time circling parking garages, hoping to find a spot. It is stressful, especially for those attempting to balance multiple responsibilities, from work to classes and personal obligations.\n\nEven those who pay for costly parking permits face frustration, as having a permit does not guarantee a spot. On top of that, the daily parking rate has gone up, making it even more expensive for students who rely on daily parking. SJSU prides itself on being a commuter school, yet the current parking situation makes commuting unnecessarily difficult.\n\nThe university should expand parking, improve shuttle services or implement adjusted rates. Students and faculty should not lose time or energy just trying to park. Education must come first.\n\nPerla Rangel\nSan Leandro\n\nState should fund\nurban fire safety\n\nRe: “Landmark study gives pathway to fire safety” (Page A1, Sept. 7).\n\nAs Ethan Baron’s article on the study of home hardening points out, “Keeping insurance is a major impetus for people to take action to protect their homes.” I can’t stress enough how much I believe that the focus of government should turn from forest thinning in remote areas to home hardening in urban areas.\n\nAs this study points out, home hardening and Zone 0 clearing can help up to 40% more than not observing these precautions. And if you can get a community to participate rather than just one home, you are really helping homeowners to survive a wildfire.\n\nAs insurers take a stricter approach with fire-prone Californians, helping homeowners with government funding becomes even more important. Talk to your representatives about switching from far-flung forest “raking” to helpful, scientifically effective home hardening for the best bang for your tax dollars.\n\nJanet Doherty\n\nOfficials’ stock trades\nneed higher standards\n\nIn an effort to limit the probability of our public servants using their elected office to enrich themselves, the U.S. Congress stated that stock trading by its members was legal as long as such trades were made public. It hoped that such required public disclosure would limit, but not eliminate, aggressive stock trading for personal enrichment.\n\nThe effectiveness of such disclosure to achieve this objective is questionable after the Wall Street Journal on Sept. 13, 2025, revealed that Rep. Ro Khanna made an astounding 2,883 stock trades in the first eight months of 2025. (Khanna and other members of Congress told the publication that they don’t make these trades themselves; their financial advisers do the buying and selling without any input from the members of Congress.) Higher ethical standards should be imposed on all three branches of the federal government now.\n\nK. R. Kummerer\n\nE-scooters, robotaxis\nbring novel problems\n\nI’m a lifelong resident of San Jose, and I strongly object to the City Council’s endorsements of rental scooters and robotaxis.\n\nI live on Stokes Street, about a block from the intersection with Southwest Expressway. When scooters were allowed in the neighborhood, I’d see schoolchildren using them, often two at a time. Rarely were obvious adults using them. The school kids would ride on the sidewalk, and against traffic, and leave scooters in the middle of sidewalks when done, creating numerous safety hazards and eyesores.\n\nToday, for the first time, I saw my first Waymo robotaxi. It had parked in a red zone, stayed there for a couple of minutes, and pulled out in front of a vehicle already on the road. Two infractions in five minutes.\n\nThis is no way to solve transportation issues, especially the scooter companies that can’t, or won’t, even prevent illegal use by minors.\n\nAl Dorshkind\n\nKirk’s polish misused\non divisive rhetoric\n\nRe: “Charlie Kirk practiced politics the right way” (Page A7, Sept. 12).\n\nCannot Ezra Klein see the politics of Charlie Kirk in the larger sense of who he promoted? Successful pitchmen have polished deliveries, and Klein sees only that polish when writing of Kirk “practicing politics the right way.” Kirk was a front man for the lawless and immoral Donald Trump. Kirk advanced the destruction of our democracy by using his skills to support that destruction. While his speech is free, aiding in the destruction of our democracy is anything but “right.”\n\nOf course, we feel saddened by the loss of a life. But for Kirk to have spent his adult life polishing the pedestal of the insurrectionist of Jan. 6, the adjudicated sexual abuser and defamer, the convicted finance fraud, the patsy of Putin and so much more is to have wasted a life.

This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish, OK?\" Kimmel said. Kimmel’s comments came one day after both FBI officials and Utah Gov.

The new drug in pill form saw people lose over a tenth of their body weight and could be key to offering the drugs to more people on the NHS . The tablets suppress appetite by mimicking the same GLP-1 fullness hormone targeted by weight loss injections. A global trial of 3,127 obese patients saw those on the pill called orforglipron lose an average of 11.2% of their body weight over a 17 month period. Lead researcher Dr Sean Wharton, of McMaster University in Canada, said: \"This could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups who are currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications.\" Orforglipron has been developed by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly which produces the injection Mounjaro, which was dubbed the “King Kong” of weight loss drugs after trials showed users lost 21% of their body weight on average. Weight loss jabs have been hailed as transformative in tackling obesity in people carrying dangerous amounts of excess weight but there are global shortages. The NHS does not have the capacity to offer them to everyone who is eligible so is starting with those dangerously obese via specialist NHS weight loss services. It has been estimated that around 1.5 million Britons are having weight loss jabs, mostly through costly private prescriptions. Experts believe that making appetite-suppressing drugs available on the NHS in pill form is key to widening access to more of the population. The trial of orforglipron included patients in the US, China , Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Taiwan. As well as weight loss, other health outcomes also improved including better blood pressure , a smaller waist circumference and a reduction in bad cholesterol levels. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal \"which were mild to moderate\", researchers said. Dr Wharton added: “Weight reductions were associated with improvements in levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as blood fats, blood sugar profiles and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein – a marker of systemic inflammation.” The findings are being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Eli Lilly has recently said the UK price of Mounjaro will increase to be more in line with higher prices in Europe and the US. US President Donald Trump had previously complained about the high cost of drugs in the US, compared to other countries, and threatened the pharmaceutical industry if they didn't act. The price to buy the jabs privately has more than doubled from £122 a month. Weight loss jabs slow digestion and reduce appetite by mimicking hormones which regulate hunger and feelings of fullness. They must be provided alongside specialist diet and lifestyle support, which the NHS has limited capacity to provide. Research shows users of GLP-1 injections lose muscle as well as fat. Without drastic changes to diet and activity levels, users tend to pile the fat back on if they stop taking them - but not the muscle mass.","summary":"New drug in pill form saw people lose over a tenth of their body weight and could be key to offering the appetite-suppressing medication to more people on the NHS","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/new-weight-loss-pill-makers-35913158","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35913365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_Round-white-pills-and-plastic-pill-bottle.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 23:00:00","author":"Martin Bagot","authors":["Martin Bagot"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":361101190,"title":"'Lucky Loser': Trump's 'psychotic' NYT lawsuit ridiculed by legal experts","text":"US President Donald Trump on Monday evening filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times that was quickly ridiculed by legal experts for entirely lacking merit.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Trump accused the Times of conspiring to prevent his victory in the 2024 election through a campaign of “election interference” that included, among other things, its editorial board’s decision to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“It came as no surprise when, shortly before the election, the newspaper published, on the front page, highlighted in a location never seen before, its deranged endorsement of Kamala Harris with the hyperbolic opening line ‘[i]t is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump,‘” the lawsuit states.\n\nPointing to what it claimed was defamatory material published by the Times, the lawsuit singled out “a malicious, defamatory, and disparaging book written by two of its reporters and three false, malicious, defamatory, and disparaging articles, all carefully crafted by Defendants, with actual malice, calculated to inflict maximum damage upon President Trump.”\n\nThe book in question is ”Lucky Loser,” written by Pulitzer Prize-winning Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig, which did a deep examination of the president’s finances and contrasted it with what it described as his false claims of unprecedented success in business.\n\nThe three articles cited by the lawsuit include one that quotes Trump’s own former chief of staff, John Kelly, warning that he would rule “like a dictator” in his second term; a news analysis piece that described Trump as facing a well documented “lifetime of scandals”; and an article by Buettner and Craig that is an adapted excerpt from their book.\n\n“The book and articles are part of a decades-long pattern by The New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump,” the complaint stated. “Defendants maliciously published the book and the articles knowing that these publications were filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump.”\n\nThe lawsuit then demanded the Times pay $15 billion in compensatory damages.\n\nThe Times issued a brief response to the lawsuit in which it defended its reporting and labeled Trump’s defamation allegations as baseless.\n\n“This lawsuit has no merit,” said the paper. “It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting. The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”\n\nSome experts who examined the lawsuit were quick to side with the Times in this dispute, and many of them flat-out ridiculed Trump for filing the suit in the first place.\n\nHolger Hestermeyer, chair of international and EU law at the Vienna School of International Studies, wrote on Bluesky that the lawsuit was “a full frontal attack on free speech” that also “almost reads like a parody.”\n\nIn addition to lampooning the suit’s specific defamation claims, Hestermeyer also mocked the suit for being loaded with hyperbolic statements, including one that said “The Apprentice” reality TV series “represented the cultural magnitude of President Trump’s singular brilliance, which captured the zeitgeist of our time.”\n\nAttorney George Conway delivered an even pithier dismissal of the suit.\n\n“Is it possible for a legal pleading to be psychotic?” he asked rhetorically. “I think we have an answer.”\n\nChris Geidner, a journalist who publishes the “Law Dork” newsletter, similarly expressed astonishment at the contents of Trump’s lawsuit.\n\n“I honestly thought there was a chance that I’d fallen asleep and was dreaming the most absurd, childlike, ego-maniac lawsuit when I tried to read this Trump defamation complaint against the Times, Penguin Random House, and individual journalists,” he wrote. “Like, seriously.

Trump has praised the deal but also has described it as “transitional” and has questioned whether it’s still necessary.\n\nThe continental deal has shielded Canada and Mexico from the worst of Trump’s efforts to realign trade through massive duties on nations around the world.\n\nWhile Canada and Mexico were early targets of Trump’s tariffs, those duties do not apply to goods compliant under the trade pact.\n\nThere’s been a surge in the number of businesses looking to ensure their CUSMA compliance. Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the deal puts Canada in an enviable spot compared to other nations — even nations like the United Kingdom and South Korea which have signed bilateral agreements with the Trump administration.\n\nCanada and Mexico are being hammered by Trump’s separate tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles. Canadian officials have said their priority is to find an off-ramp for these sectors through a bilateral economic and security agreement ahead of the CUSMA review.\n\nThe consultations and review are required under American law but businesses have been waiting for the process to officially begin.\n\nDavid Paterson, Ontario’s trade representative in Washington, said he’s been in talks with many American sectors and businesses that rely on CUSMA and have been anticipating an opportunity to make their case for the trade pact.\n\nHe said he doesn’t expect the federal government or provinces to submit comment, as the consultations are meant to allow American businesses to make their case.\n\nPaterson had meetings with officials at the White House this week and said there’s ongoing interest around critical minerals, aviation, defence, automobiles and others sectors that rely on trade with Canada.\n\n“I’m very glad that these things are moving ahead right now because the thing that we all need is predictability and certainty for investment,” he said.\n\n“Because probably the biggest concern is that it’s very hard for people to make investment decisions in any sectors when there’s the uncertainty of tariffs and there’s uncertainty around these issues.”\n\nRichard Madan, Manitoba’s representative to the United States, said that now the timeline is more clear, “the goal for Manitoba is to encourage U.S. partners that benefit from Manitoba’s supply chains and market access through (CUSMA) to share success stories, economic data, or examples of seamless collaboration that (CUSMA) provides that strengthens both economies.”\n\nWhile a lot of the national focus has been on Trump’s sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum and cars, Madan said Canada — and Manitoba — provide a lot of food that Americans consume, from pork and beef to various seeds.\n\nAgri-food trade has been largely seamless under CUSMA, Madan said, and it’s critical that integration remains uninterrupted.

University of Krakow, Poland psychology professor Katarzyna Jasko said the president's argument was \"not justifiable\" given the ample examples of right-wing political violence in recent years. She noted that her past research found that far-right political violence was not only more frequent than violent acts carried out but the left, but the intensity of violence committed by right-wing actors was far greater.\n\n\"Among radicalized individuals in the United States, those adhering to a left-wing ideology were markedly less likely to engage in violent ideologically motivated acts when compared to right-wing individuals.

Kirk was shot dead during a speaking engagement at a university campus in Utah.\nAuthorities allege that Robinson used a rifle to fire a single shot from a rooftop, striking Kirk in the neck. He was apprehended following a 33-hour manhunt.\n“After reviewing the evidence that law enforcement has collected thus far, I am… charging Tyler James Robinson, age 22, with the following crimes,” Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced at a press conference.\n“Count one, aggravated murder, a capital offence, for intentionally or knowingly causing the death of Charlie Kirk under circumstances that created a great risk of death to others.”\nIn addition to aggravated murder, Robinson faces two counts of obstruction of justice, for hiding the weapon and disposing of clothing, two counts of witness tampering, and one count of committing a violent offence in front of children. The obstruction and tampering charges stem from Robinson allegedly instructing a roommate to delete text messages and remain silent.\nGray also confirmed that his office had filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, meaning Robinson will remain in custody without the possibility of bail.\n“I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney, based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime,” Gray said.\nProsecutors said the case against Robinson includes surveillance footage, digital evidence from social media, and information provided by his own family. Investigators also linked Robinson to the weapon and ammunition through DNA evidence.\nGray emphasised potential ideological motives, citing both Robinson’s statements and family testimony that point to increasing political radicalisation.

Additionally, Arizona’s annual budgets from 2021 to 2025 gave the Arizona Department of Public Safety and local sheriffs $145 million for border-related enforcement. \n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act authorized $10 billion for the costs states absorbed for border security during the Biden administration. \n\n“In all our years serving the people of Arizona, never have we seen such an abject failure of the federal government in protecting its citizens on the southern border as we did during the past four years under the Biden administration,” last week’s letter said.\n\nThe Arizona GOP leaders wrote they wanted to use the requested money to provide “tax relief for Arizonans.”\n\n“Each year, Arizona updates its income tax code to changes made by the President and Congress,” the letter said. “This upcoming year, the Legislature is interested in conforming to those tax changes to the greatest extent possible.”\n\nPetersen told The Center Square that this legislative action on tax changes could cost Arizona “several hundred million dollars.” \n\nFurthermore, he said federal money from the reimbursement would be invested in public safety and transportation. \n\nDuring the Biden administration, Arizona spent a significant amount of money on uncompensated medical care and law enforcement programs, the Senate president said. \n\nPetersen said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not provided an exact timeline on when the state will get its money, but he added the state expects to hear back “within a few months.”\n\nHe noted the federal funds are available through fiscal year 2029.\n\nArizona prefers the Department of Homeland Security send the money in one sum rather than in multiple payments, Petersen told The Center Square.\n\nAccording to Petersen, Arizona is working alone and not with other border states on reimbursement efforts. He added he thinks border states will receive a “majority of the funds,” which he called “appropriate.”\n\nWhen Arizona does receive its money, it will be deposited into the state’s general fund, Petersen said. He called that the most “accountable way” to handle the money and noted it will allow the public the ability to give its input about the reimbursement.\n\nHe said the Republican-led Legislature will have “full oversight and control” over the money. \n\nAs for the current state of the southern border, Petersen called it “the most secure it’s ever been.”\n\nHe added that the difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration’s border policies is “night and day.”\n\nTo illustrate, with Joe Biden as president, encounters of illegal immigrants at the southern border in July 2024 stood at 104,000. However, as of this July, the number decreased to 7,832, according to Border Patrol data, under President Donald Trump. \n\nCONGRESSMAN SAYS NATIONAL DEFENSE BILL WILL HELP ARIZONA\n\nThis represents a 92.5% decrease in the number of foreign nationals encountered at the southern border. \n\n“ We didn’t need a new law; we just needed a new president,” Petersen said. “And that is the difference of what we’re seeing between Republican leadership and Democrat leadership on a lot of the issues that deal with crime.","summary":"(The Center Square) &#8211; Arizona legislative leaders sent a letter to the Trump administration seeking reimbursement for border security costs.  Arizona Senate President Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, and House Speaker Steve Montenegro, R-Surprise, requested $599 million in their letter to get back the money the state spent on southern border security during the Biden administration.&#160; Arizona spent this [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3810700/arizona-seek-599-million-to-pay-for-illegal-immigration/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25205752159248.jpg?w=696","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 22:53:22","author":"Center Square","authors":["Center Square"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":361101172,"title":"'Paying the price of his reckless policies': How 'Trump is making your life more expensive'","text":"US consumers are increasingly feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and the head of the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that they are fueling inflation.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNBC, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) director Phillip Swagel said that the president’s tariffs have pushed up inflation more than the agency initially anticipated, although he emphasized that their impact on inflation so far was “not by a lot, but by enough to show” in the numbers.\n\nSwagel also said that the higher-than-expected inflation was a surprise because there are signs that the US economy has slowed significantly since January.\n\nCNN on Tuesday published an analysis using numbers from the Yale Budget Lab estimating that Trump’s tariffs will cost US households an average of $2,300 extra per year, which is nearly three times as much as the $800 US households are projected to receive on average from new tax provisions contained in the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that passed earlier this year.\n\nThe combined distributional impacts of the Trump tariffs and the GOP tax law are also highly regressive. According to CNN‘s analysis, a household with annual earnings of $38,840 would be $2,560 worse off thanks to the tariffs and the tax law, while households earning $517,700 would be $8,180 better off.\n\nThe Washington Post on Tuesday reported that Trump’s tariffs aren’t just hurting Americans in the US, but those living abroad as well. \n\nAs explained by the Post, Americans living abroad have been unable to send mail to the US without paying hefty fines thanks to the chaos being caused by Trump’s tariffs. The reason for this, writes the paper, is that Trump earlier this year canceled a policy known as the de minimis exemption, effective August 29, that “allowed the tariff-free flow of goods under $800 into the United States.”\n\nThis has led not just to increased shipping costs for Americans living abroad, but has also resulted in foreign nations slowing or even outright halting shipments to the US because they are unsure about how to calculate the costs.\n\n“Confusion about the rules have led to issues since the exemption was lifted on August 29,” the Post wrote. “At first, national postal services in more than 30 countries temporarily suspended sending some or most US-bound packages. Since then, restrictions have eased, and the Universal Postal Union deployed a tool this week to help operators calculate duties and resume services.”\n\nReacting to fresh revelations about the impact of the tariffs, many progressive Democrats hammered Trump for increasing the cost of living for working-class families.\n\n“Under Donald Trump’s economy: coffee is up 26%, beef is up 14%, oranges are up 17%, bananas are up 6%, chicken is up 6%, chocolate chip cookies are up 5%, potato chips are up 4%, milk is up 4%,” wrote Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “But average worker pay is only up 2%. Trumpflation is eating up your paycheck.”\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) added that “from school supplies to gas to groceries, Trump is making your life more expensive.”\n\n“Poor and working people are paying the price of his reckless policies,” said the congresswoman.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, took to the Senate floor on Monday to single out a different Trump policy that he said was also raising prices for US consumers—namely, his attacks on green energy projects.\n\n“This administration is shamelessly working to block one of our best defenses against rising energy bills: renewable energy,” Padilla said. “And I say so because renewable energy is absolutely affordable, renewable energy is abundant, and whether you want to admit it or not, renewable energy sources are our future.”\n\nThe senator also pointed to his home state of California as an example of what can happen when the government encourages the development of green energy projects.\n\n“[California is] harnessing the power of solar and wind and hydroelectric power and nuclear, geothermal, even hydrogen power to our state,” he said. “And it’s exactly because of those investments that even in a year like 2024, just last year, when we experienced record heatwaves that we also saw record renewable energy generation, and we kept the lights on.”\n\nNOW READ: Team Trump launches 'biggest assault on the First Amendment' in modern US history","summary":"US consumers are increasingly feeling the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and the head of the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday that they are fueling inflation.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNBC, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) director Phillip Swagel said that the president’s tariffs have pushed up inflation more than the agency initially anticipated, although he emphasized that their impact on inflation so far was “not by a lot, but by enough to show” in the numbers.\n\n\nSwagel also said that the higher-than-expected inflation was a surprise because there are signs that the US economy has slowed significantly since January.\n\nCNN on Tuesday published an analysis using numbers from the Yale Budget Lab estimating that Trump’s tariffs will cost US households an average of $2,300 extra per year, which is nearly three times as much as the $800 US households are projected to receive on average from new tax provisions contained in the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that passed earlier th","url":"https://www.alternet.org/economy-under-trump-2674000687/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60354249&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C106%2C0%2C107","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-16 22:53:03","author":"Brad Reed","authors":["Brad Reed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":361100198,"title":"“She should be put in jail”: Trump celebrates Willis’ removal from Georgia case","text":"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is officially off the case against Donald Trump.\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal on Tuesday, leaving in place a lower court’s ruling that disqualified her over her romantic relationship with a former special prosecutor.

'I promise I'll make Turning Point USA the biggest thing that this nation has ever seen.'\n\nWearing an emerald green shirt and white blazer, Erika thanked President Donald Trump and his family for their support following the shooting during her roughly 16-minute remarks.\n\n'Mr President, my husband loved you.

WashU is far more egregious than Harvard or UNC because its unlawful discrimination extends beyond admissions and pollutes every corner of medical education.”\n\nThe complaint alleges violations of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX, and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, as well as multiple executive orders signed by President Donald Trump prohibiting race- and sex-based policies in federally funded institutions. Among the policies highlighted are a “holistic review” admissions process that evaluates applicants using subjective criteria such as “lived experiences” and “social mission alignment,” a framework AFL says is designed to use racial proxies while evading the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. That decision barred universities from using race as an admissions criterion.\n\nOn Exhibit 43 of the 117-page complaint, AFL highlighted an MIR Summer Research Program application that asked applicants to check off whether they qualify “as a member of an underrepresented minority.”\n\nThe complaint also highlights a long term pattern of the school promoting DEI ideology dating back to 2020. An Instagram account from the college’s Division of Dermatology posted on Oct. 17, 2020 an image of Ibram X. Kendi’s How To Be An Antiracist, promoting it as a book of discussion for a resident book club at the time. In May last year, the college was honored with a “diversity, equity & inclusion award” by the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. \n\nThe complaint also documents more than 30 “pipeline” and “pathway” programs run by WashU Medicine’s Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which explicitly prioritize applicants from preferred identity groups beginning in middle school. The school’s Internal Medicine residency program reportedly increased its share of underrepresented minority enrollees from 9.7% to 27% in just three years in an effort to “promote equity in hiring,” according to a since-removed section of its website.\n\nFollowing the filing, WashU Medicine quietly removed a “Progress” section from its DEI office page on its website.

We hope the game we’ve created will be what locals have wished for,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrisbane’s Supreme Court has shot down an appeal from controversial Brisbane landlord Edward Amos to stop the state from seizing several of his Brisbane properties to repay decades-old court costs.The Brisbane-based landlord has had the court costs from the dismissed appeal – which was not detailed in the ruling handed down – as well as outstanding legal costs from a 2014 land tax case filed against him by the government.LoadingThe state originally took Amos to court over $487,994 in unpaid land tax in 2014, which he was ordered to pay alongside legal costs of about $122,000.The state received an order to seize and sell Amos’ properties in 2017, and in late 2024 Amos began launching appeals, including a claim the properties were not his own, but instead belonged to his children and were held in trust.After a judge ruled against that claim in April this year, Amos launched an appeal, seeking to stay the seizure order – which would keep government auctioneers away from his properties – on the basis of the state delaying action too long.The three-judge panel dismissed Amos’ appeal, stating the panel was “not satisfied Mr Amos suffered any real prejudice” from the delays.“If [Amos] had wished to avoid uncertainty as to whether, or at what time, the Commissioner might seize and sell any of his properties to enforce the costs orders, all he had to do was pay the amounts as ordered,” the court decision read.The warmest day of the week – and no, summer hasn’t arrived early – has been forecast for Brisbane today, with the expected maximum temperature an unseasonal 30 degrees.That said, the apparent (or “feels like”) temperature should remain around the low 20s, but humidity is quite high.It should be a mostly sunny day, which is how the rest of the week is looking until the weekend, with rain on the cards for Saturday.Reporter William Davis spoke with a bureau meteorologist earlier this week about the unusual heat.

And the CIA has a unit that goes around and talks to people who are well-connected and asks them questions,” Barr told the House Oversight Committee in an August deposition.\n\n“So my supposition, when I saw things about him being connected to U.S. intelligence, maybe, like many other businessmen, he talks to them, but this is not, in my opinion, based on what I saw, I didn’t think it was an intelligence operation, and I never received any information that led me to believe that.”\n\nThe former attorney general said that he doesn’t believe that the pedophile was formally “working for” the agency, according to a transcript made public Tuesday.\n\nThe CIA did not immediately offer comment for this story.\n\nBarr started his career working for six years at the CIA in the 1970s and served two stints as attorney general, first from 1991 to 1993 under President George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director, and then under President Trump in 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe former attorney general, who broke with Trump after the 2020 election, said he only had two unremarkable conversations about Epstein with the president during his first term.\n\nBarr attempted to swat down conspiracy theories during his deposition, including about his own family, saying that the connection between his father, former Dalton School headmaster Donald Barr, and former Dalton schoolteacher Epstein was “not pertinent at all.”\n\nEpstein was indicted on federal charges for sex trafficking minors in July 2019 when Barr led the Justice Department. He died one month later in what authorities say was a prison suicide.\n\nBarr testified that he is convinced Epstein was not murdered and cited the fact that he had one prior suicide attempt in custody. He said that he was unaware of a missing minute of security camera footage near the cell, which current Attorney General Pam Bondi has blamed on antiquated technology.\n\nEpstein’s possible connection to spy agencies roared back into public focus with Bondi’s July memo saying that Epstein “harmed over one thousand” girls and young women — but that there was no evidence to charge anyone besides accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence.\n\nThat memo controversially said that “no further disclosure” about the case “would be appropriate or warranted” — sparking the House Oversight Committee inquest for more documentation on Epstein’s associations.\n\nBoth Bondi and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard have said they are unaware of whether Epstein worked with an intelligence agency, but neither ruled it out when questioned by reporters.\n\nFormer Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta allegedly explained a lenient 2008 plea deal for Epstein by saying, “I was told Epstein ‘belonged to intelligence’ and to leave it alone,” prompting years of speculation about whether Epstein helped US or foreign spy agencies gain leverage on powerful men.\n\nThere’s also significant speculation about Epstein’s links to Israel’s Mossad due to the fact that Maxwell’s father, Robert, was a reputed agent of the Israeli spy agency. Epstein was also a close associate of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak with about 30 documented interactions between 2013 and 2017.","summary":"The former attorney general said that he doesn’t believe that the pedophile was formally “working for” the agency, according to a transcript made public Tuesday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/16/us-news/former-ag-bill-barr-floats-supposition-on-jeffrey-epstein-cia-link/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/newspress-collage-gv2cny9hb-1758054133982.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1758039752&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tTCCYJgj-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-16 22:34:25","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.491},{"id":361089380,"title":"Trump’s Reforms to Asylum System Need to Be Codified Into Law, Immigration Experts Say","text":"The Trump administration has made major changes to the U.S. asylum system, but a future administration could immediately reverse those reforms, cautions immigration expert Lora Ries. \n\nEven if the Trump administration issued a rule to change the way asylum claims are processed, “a future administration can overdo a rule, and so what’s really needed is statute for more permanency,” Ries, director of The Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center, told The Daily Signal. \n\nWhen President Donald Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, there were about 3.5 million pending asylum claims before the immigration courts, according to the Congressional Research Service. Today, there are still more than 2.3 million asylum claims before the immigration courts, and another 1.5 million pending with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to Art Arthur, a former immigration judge. \n\nIn the early months of his second term, Trump has made changes to the U.S. asylum system to allow for asylum claims to be processed more quickly. \n\nChanges to Asylum System Under Trump \n\nIn April, the Justice Department issued guidance to the Executive Office for Immigration Review allowing for asylum claims to be dismissed if a migrant fails to provide sufficient evidence to meet the standard for an asylum hearing. \n\nThis month, Attorney General Pam Bondi took two immigration cases and used them to issue guidance on how immigration judges should interpret a key asylum statute. \n\nThe U.S. asylum statute allows asylum to be granted if a person’s life is believed to be at risk in their home country due to their “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” \n\nRace, religion, nationality, and political affiliation are “pretty straightforward,” Arthur explains, but “membership of a particular social group is wide open.” \n\n“Probably, you know, 80% to 90% of the cases the clog up the [immigration] courts are people who allege that they are part of a particular social group,” said Arthur, who serves as a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. \n\nWhat Bondi has done is narrow the definition of who is included in the “social group” category by saying migrants claiming asylum due to fear of gangs back home or fear of domestic violence do not constitute being a part of a specific social group and are therefore not eligible for asylum. This clarification is a return to an understanding of the U.S. immigration code held during the first Trump administration, but reversed during the Biden administration. \n\nAs such, permanent reform to the U.S. asylum system will require Congress to act. \n\nCongress and Asylum Reform \n\nPassing legislation to further define what is meant by a “social group” within the U.S. asylum statute would simply “become a Christmas tree with respect to various special-interest groups,” Arthur contended. Instead, “it may be better for Congress to just cut ‘particular social group’ from the definition.” \n\nRies agrees with Arthur, arguing that the U.S. asylum code needs to “get rid of membership in a particular social group, and just stick with the original objective: race, religion, nationality, [and] political opinion.” \n\nThe 119th Congress has not introduced a bill that would remove the “social group” category from the asylum statute, but Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., did introduce a bill in January aimed to reforming the U.S. asylum system. Her bill is called the Refugees Using Legal Entry Safely Act, or RULES Act, and it requires migrants to apply for asylum at a port of entry and denies parole into the U.S. while an asylum claim is being processed.\n\nFurthermore, the bill would make illegal aliens apprehended in the U.S. ineligible for asylum and would deny asylum to those who have already applied and been denied. \n\nThe RULES Act is currently under review in the Judiciary committees of the House and Senate. \n\nBroader reforms to asylum were included in the immigration bill known as HR 2 that first passed through the House in May 2023, but was stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The current Congress has yet to take action on HR 2, but Ries predicted a new version of the bill will be introduced next year.","summary":"The Trump administration has made major changes to the U.S. asylum system, but a future administration could immediately reverse those reforms, cautions immigration expert Lora...

He was also convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was a registered sex offender, a decade prior.\n\nThe recent incident in Windsor comes as Mr Trump landed for his second state visit to the UK today, where he spoke of how being in Britain 'warm[ed]' his heart. \n\nThames Valley Police have since confirmed four adults were arrested on suspicion of malicious communication after what they called a 'public stunt'.\n\nChief Superintendent Felicity Parker said: 'We take any unauthorised activity around Windsor Castle extremely seriously.\n\n'Our officers responded swiftly to stop the projection and four people have been arrested.\n\n'We are conducting a thorough investigation with our partners into the circumstances surrounding this incident and will provide further updates when we are in a position to do so.'\n\nThe Republican leader arrived at Stansted Airport on Air Foce One and held his 55-year-old wife First Lady Melania's hand as he walked down the aircraft steps. \n\nMelania sported a trench coat from British designer Burberry and black riding boots as she and her husband were greeted by the Viscount Hood, Lord-in-Waiting, on behalf of King Charles.\n\nForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who opposed his first state visit, shook Trump's hand for about five seconds.\n\nAfter landing on British soil, the US President also made several glowing remarks about the King. \n\nHe also praised 'outstanding' job his US Ambassador to the UK Warren Stevens had done as he stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him outside Winfield House where he will spend the night.\n\nAnd while onboard Air Force One, Trump gushed about the expected pageantry awaiting him.\n\n'Enjoy yourselves. You're going to have some great pictures today,' he told reporters. 'It's going to be a beautiful event. Everyone's looking forward to it. And we'll just relax and have a good time.'\n\nTrump earlier boasted about heading to the UK and spoke of his excitement to see the 76-year-old monarch, whom he described as 'an elegant gentleman'.\n\nThe President's allies have vowed he would 'go easy' on struggling Sir Keir Starmer during his visit following a series of domestic hits to the Prime Minister's leadership. \n\nOne source said: 'This trip will be about the splendour of Windsor Castle, inspecting the troops, the big banquet. This is a big deal for him. And the plan is to keep it about that.' \n\nYet despite a series of political scandals, with Lord Mandelson being dismissed as US ambassador and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner resigning over underpaid stamp duty, Trump praised the PM saying he represents the UK 'so well'.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.
