Josh Shapiro told Kristen Welker on “Meet the Press.”\n\n“I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said. \n\n“That is deeply concerning. Look, Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views. He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t – obviously, we have a difference of opinion. I don’t deny him that right. But when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions that folks may want to take a look at.”\n\nShapiro stopped short of calling Musk’s plan illegal, but noted he believes “it’s something that law enforcement could take a look at.” He previously served as the state’s district attorney.\n\nWhile speaking at a Trump campaign event on Saturday, Musk said he would give $1 million a day to one registered voter who has signed his America PAC petition. Some experts have commented that it could be against the law to offer a cash payout for signing a petition the requires the signee to be registered to vote.\n\nBut others have noted that internet regulations, First Amendment boundaries and even campaign finance laws don’t offer enough evidence that Musk had broken the law with his earlier support for Trump that included paying people to sign up for his PAC, before announcing the new giveaway. “That’s where the Musk critics run into a wall,” Matt Bilinsky, an L.A.-based attorney and Fox News contributor, told TheWrap.\n\nThe petition in question is in support of the First and Second Amendments to the U.S. Constitution — the right to freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, respectively. Musk’s PAC is currently touring the state of Pennsylvania, and the tech CEO is registering voters for Trump.\n\nWhile on the topic of Pennsylvania, Shapiro admitted that the electoral race is likely to be close. “Let me explain: 2016, the race was decided by 44,000 votes. Donald Trump won here in Pennsylvania. In 2020, the race was settled by 80,000 votes. Joe Biden won. In both instances, it came down to a point or less. So the fact that you have polls showing that it’s, you know, a jump ball, a statistical dead heat, maybe Kamala Harris is up a point or so – that is not a shock,” he explained.\n\n“We understand these races are close,” Shapiro added. “You’ve got to compete for every vote. And while we’re a big state, we’re still a retail state. You’ve got to show up. And I’m encouraged by the fact that the vice president has been here so much and is committed to coming back here many times before Election Day.”\n\nYou can watch the interview with Gov. Josh Shapiro in the video above.","summary":"The Pennsylvania governor stops short of calling the Tesla CEO's million-dollar-a-day giveaways to Pennsylvania voters \"illegal\" but suggests law enforcement could take a look\n\n\nThe post Elon Musk’s Money Flowing From His SuperPAC and $1 Million Giveaways Is ‘Deeply Concerning,’ Josh Shapiro Says | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/josh-shapiro-elon-musk-dark-money-million-dollar-giveaway/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kristen-welker-josh-shapiro-pa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-21 00:59:17","author":"Stephanie Kaloi","authors":["Stephanie Kaloi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":260440846,"title":"60 Minutes denies it engaged in ‘deceitful editing’ in Harris Oct. 7 interview","text":"In a statement posted Sunday evening, the news program said the claims of “deceitful editing” are “false.”\n\n“Former President Donald Trump is accusing 60 Minutes of deceitful editing of our Oct. 7 interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. That is false,” the statement said.\n\nThe news program proceeded to lay out its rationale for the disparity in the responses Harris gave to the question.\n\n“60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment,” it said.\n\nThe statement closed by saying that 60 Minutes would be “happy” to have Trump on the show to “discuss the issues facing the nation and the Harris interview.” Trump’s team previously rejected the offer of a sit-down interview with the show.\n\nThe question at issue is when CBS host Bill Whitaker asked Harris about whether the U.S. has failed to influence Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s actions in the war in Gaza.\n\nIn the 60 Minutes interview aired on Oct. 7, Harris said, “We are not gonna stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nBut in a teaser clip of Harris answering the same question prior to the full interview’s release, she offered a significantly different response that many derided as a “word salad.”\n\n“Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,” she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe complaint filed by the Center for American Rights accused CBS News of “significant and intentional news distortion.” \n\nFormer President Donald Trump slammed 60 Minutes a few days after the interview’s release, calling the interview “an unprecedented scandal” and “election interference” to “make her [Harris] look better.”","summary":"Days after being hit with an FCC complaint, CBS&#8217;s 60 Minutes responded to claims that it engaged in &#8220;deceitful editing&#8221; when it aired two different responses that Vice President Kamala Harris gave to one question during an interview in early October.

Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.”\n\n“A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal.

The Dems got them to do this and should be forced to concede the Election?

She was blasting former President Donald Trump for nominating the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v Wade. \n\n‘Oh you guys are at the wrong rally,’ Harris said with a frown as her supporters cheered, before smiling and waving at them from the podium.\n\n‘No I think you meant to go to the smaller one down the street,’ she continued, a direct dig at the ex-president who has been very defensive over campaign rally crowd size.\n\nTwo of the protesters, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse juniors Grant Beth and Luke Polaske, say that Harris’ reaction was ‘evil’ and they were inspired by God to show up. \n\nBeth said that not just the vice president but her entire crowd were cruel to the students.\n\n‘I was pushed by an elderly woman. We were heckled at, we were cursed at, we were mocked, and that’s the biggest thing for me personally,’ Beth said. \n\n‘In reflection of the event, Jesus was mocked. You know, his disciples were mocked, and that’s OK. \n\nHe added that at one point, Harris waved to them mockingly and gave them what he called ‘an evil smirk’ as he held up a cross.\n\n‘She was actually waving to me. I took this cross off my neck that I wear, and as we were getting asked to leave, I held it up in the air and waved at her and pointed at her, and she looked directly in the eye, kind of gave me an evil smirk,’ Polaske said. \n\nBeth says that no matter what people thought of them, they were there for the right reasons. \n\n‘In reality, we did God’s work, and we were there for the right reasons, and God is watching us in this moment,’ Beth added. \n\n‘I’m all about being a cordial person no matter your beliefs, but I do believe that we were sent there by God.’\n\nBeth says that this mockery of Christians and her decision to skip the Catholic charities benefit Al Smith Dinner show her disdain for the faithful \n\n‘This is what you are going to get with a Kamala Harris presidency,’ he told Fox News. \n\n‘You are going to get the Kamala Harris that alienates over 50% of the US population that is Christian. You’re going to get the Kamala Harris that skips the Al Smith Memorial Dinner.’\n\nDemocrats in the room were over the moon with Harris’ treatments of Beth and Polaske.\n\n‘Come on,’ the vice president said with a shrug before she moved on.\n\nHarris supporters praised her quick response to the hecklers on social media. \n\nOne X user called it ‘Obama level wit’ while another wrote ‘OH SNAP!!!!! Kamala Harris shut them down so hard!’ \n\nA third supporter wrote ‘she smoked them!’\n\nVice President Harris put Trump on blast throughout her rally in La Crosse including slamming him for his remarks at the Univision town hall this week. \n\n‘I want and intend to be a president for all Americans,’ Harris said. ‘And no matter their political party, where they live or where they get their news.’\n\n‘And on that point, last night you may have seen, I went on Fox News,’ she said with a smile.\n\n‘And while I was doing that Donald Trump was at a Univision town hall where a voter asked him about January 6,’ she said as the crowd booed.\n\n‘We here know January 6th was a tragic day. It was a day of terrible violence. There were attacks on law enforcement. 140 law enforcement officers were injured, some were killed, and what did Donald Trump say last night about January 6th?

It’s a great company … look at the crowd over there. Look at how happy everyone is. They’re happy because they want hope.”\n\nHe added: “I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala.”\n\nIn what his campaign dubbed the “October surp-fries,” McDonald Trump worked the counter and bantered with customers who drove up. \n\nHis campaign also released footage of him jubilantly preparing the Happy Meals. \n\n“We got the salt on it. Never touches the human hand. Nice and full,” he said while filling a container of fries — a nod to his germophobic tendencies. \n\nWell over a thousand MAGA-Donald’s faithful lined Street Road in an effort to meet Mr Trump and say “hail to the chef”.\n\n“I’ll just take whatever he gives me,” one man told the New York Post.\n\n“Love him or hate him, I just feel it’s really cool to see this moment in history,” Caitlin Hanlon, 33, a hairdresser from Feasterville who was wearing a pink MAGA hat, told The Post. “It’s a really cool moment, but I obviously support him.”\n\n“Wow, thank you Mr. President,” an excited man told Mr Trump from his SUV after being handed two bags. “You made it possible for ordinary people like us to meet you.”\n\nMr Trump later quipped “I like this job” and explained that he would be eager to come back and do it again. \n\nHe also handed out fries to members of the press stationed outside the drive-through window.\n\n“That’s sort of a bribe. But a fry for a buck is okay,” he joked. “Somebody come up here and take them.”\n\nMs Harris, 60, has repeatedly maintained that she worked at the fast food joint while studying at university and used the tale to highlight her middle-class roots, seeking to juxtapose it with her billionaire foe.\n\nHer campaign has specified that she worked the cash register, fry station and ice cream machine at a McDonald’s on Central Ave in Alameda, California, in 1983, during the summer between her freshman and sophomore year at Howard University.\n\n“Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s in our country who are trying to raise a family,” Ms Harris told MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle last month. \n\n“I worked there as a student.\n\n“I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility, then, is to meet those needs.”\n\nMr Trump and his allies have harped on how her 1987 resume made no mention of her purported stint at McDonald’s as well as the overall lack of proof that she did. \n\nHer campaign has shot back, accusing him of making a baseless allegation.\n\nSunday was Ms Harris’ 60th birthday, something that Trump was told by the press during a brief gaggle. \n\n“Happy birthday Kamala! She’s turning 60. I think I’ll get her some flowers. Maybe I’ll get her some fries … I’ll get her a McDonald’s hamburger. Happy birthday Kamala,” he riffed. \n\n“That’s a strange place to do a news conference,” he told his new-found co-workers after wrapping up that presser. \n\nThe 45th president has long been a fan of McDonald’s. \n\nFamously during the government shutdown that spilt into 2019, he ordered over 300 burgers in addition to fries and other menu items from McDonald’s to honour the Clemson Tigers for winning the national college football championship that year because the White House chefs were on furlough.\n\nMr Trump said he personally paid for the meal, which was decked out on silver platters in the State Dining Room.\n\nThroughout his time in the political limelight, Mr Trump has been seen smiling next to various orders from McDonalds that he’s received from aides and occasionally gotten in personal as well.\n\nLast year, for instance, he stopped by a McDonald’s in East Palestine, Ohio, in the aftermath of a toxic chemical spill that unleashed harmful substances into the nearby environment and created a health crisis.\n\nDonald Trump Jr once joked: “I think my father knows the McDonald’s menu much better than Kamala Harris ever did.”\n\nThe McDonald’s campaign stop comes amid a pitched battle to win Pennsylvania, which has the largest quantity of Electoral College votes among the seven major battleground states.","summary":"With two weeks left in the campaign, Donald Trump donned a yellow McDonald’s apron and got to work at his favourite fast food joint.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/trump-works-at-mcdonalds-and-maga-faithful-line-up-to-order-whatever-he-gives-me/news-story/617a2790a1eec55b031c279167486e34?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f9b23b0a6113cbd9ba8147cc7d24205d","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-21 00:17:36","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.132},{"id":260440042,"title":"Josh Shapiro calls on cops to look into Elon Musk’s $1 million giveaways in Pennsylvania","text":"Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Sunday that Elon Musk’s plans to give $1 million to registered voters who sign his super PAC’s petition is “deeply concerning” and should be looked into by law enforcement.\n\n“I think there are real questions with how he is spending money in this race, how the dark money is flowing, not just into Pennsylvania, but apparently now into the pockets of Pennsylvanians,” Shapiro said in an interview with NBC’s Kristen Welker on Meet the Press. “That is deeply concerning.”\n\n“I think it’s something that law enforcement could take a look at,” he added. “I’m not the attorney general anymore of Pennsylvania. I’m the governor, but it does raise some serious questions.”\n\nA day earlier, Musk made the announcement that would give away $1 million a day, at random, until the November 5 election, to one person who has signed his PAC’s petition supporting the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, and the Second Amendment, with its right “to keep and bear arms.”\n\nThe first million went to a man identified as John Dreher during an event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\nFrom now until the election, the signees could be picked from Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin or North Carolina.\n\nThe billionaire founder of Tesla and Space X and owner of X who’s gone all-in on Republican Donald Trump’s candidacy for the White House, had already committed at least $70 million to help the former president.\n\nBut the giveaway is raising questions and alarms among some election experts who say it is a violation of the law to link a cash handout to signing a petition that also requires a person to be registered to vote.\n\n“Look, Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views.

That is false.\n\n 60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to Face the Nation that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on 60 Minutes was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.\n\n Remember, Mr. Trump pulled out of his interview with 60 Minutes and the vice president participated.\n\n Our long-standing invitation to former President Trump remains open. If he would like to discuss the issues facing the nation and the Harris interview, we would be happy to have him on 60 Minutes.\n\n In response, the Trump campaign released its own statement: “60 Minutes just admitted to doing exactly what President Trump accused them of doing,” said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary. “They edited in a different response — from another part of her answer — to make Kamala Harris sound less incoherent than she really was. Their statement is not a denial, it is an admission that they did exactly what they were accused of. This is another reminder of how hopelessly biased 60 Minutes is, and how correct President Trump was to decline their invitation to be subjected to their fake news hackery. Release the transcript!” \n\n Trump has called the show’s broadcast of the Harris interview a “giant fake news scam” and has suggested that CBS was trying to help her. The accusations arose after it was pointed out online that Harris gave a different answer to a question in a teaser clip that aired CBS’ on Face the Nation from what was shown on 60 Minutes. The question in question was about the Biden administration’s sway on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n\n “It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,” 60 Minutes’ Bill Whitaker says to Harris in the interview.\n\n In the teaser clip, Harris briefly pauses and then says, “The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.”\n\n During the 60 Minutes broadcast, Harris quickly responds, “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\n On his Truth Social feed, Trump wrote, “Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, to make her look better.”\n\n Trump has since called for CBS to lose its FCC license over the interview. FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed that idea, adding that Trump’s “threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored.”\n\n Meanwhile, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley recently said that the Trump campaign offered “shifting explanations” for why the former president was backing out of the interview.","summary":"\"Former President Donald Trump is accusing '60 Minutes' of deceitful editing of our Oct. 7 interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.

After weeks of staying mum despite mounting backlash over the interview, CBS published a statement Sunday evening addressing the outrage that ensued after airing two different answers to the same question in the \"60 Minutes\" interview earlier this month with the Democratic nominee. \"Former President Donald Trump is accusing 60 Minutes of deceitful editing of our Oct. 7 interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. That is false,\" the statement began. \"60 Minutes gave an excerpt of our interview to ‘Face the Nation’ that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer.

She gave a horrible, incompetent answer on a news program… and so she gives an answer that shows that she's dumb or incompetent or something's wrong with her,\" Trump said earlier Sunday. \"It's so bad that the people at CBS say we're going to do a little editing… They take the whole ridiculous answer out, and it was a long answer and replace it with a much shorter answer that you had to do with a totally different subject, which also didn't make sense, but it wasn't as incompetent.\" CBS News has taken heat in recent days for airing two different answers to the same question in its \"60 Minutes\" interview earlier this month with Harris. Harris was mocked by conservatives when footage of her offering a lengthy \"word salad\" was aired by CBS' \"Face the Nation\" to promote the \"60 Minutes\" sit-down, when Bill Whitaker asked why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t listening to the U.S. CBS ACCUSED OF 'SIGNIFICANT AND INTENTIONAL NEWS DISTORTION' IN FCC COMPLAINT OVER '60 MINUTES' EDIT However, the vice president’s lengthy answer didn’t make the version that aired on Monday night on \"60 Minutes\" and a shorter Harris answer to the same question was shown instead. The Center for American Rights, also known as CAR, argued that the discrepancies \"amount to deliberate news distortion — a violation of FCC rules governing broadcasters' public interest obligations,\" and formally complained to the FCC. Former President Trump called for CBS to lose its broadcasting license last week, writing on Truth Social, \"A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes. \"Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better.

The Harris campaign immediately blasted out the clip. \n\nHe also mistakenly thought he heard someone say St. Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial was in the audience. Musial died more than a decade ago, and it was Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Meuser who was being referenced. Trump brought Meuser on stage after clearing up the situation.\n\nTrump also complained that his chair was uncomfortable and abruptly stood up halfway through the interview, and described his age of 78 as ‘not that close to 80.’\n\nIf Trump was a bit out of sorts, he had definitely shaken up his typical routine. Hours earlier, he was manning the fryer at a McDonald’s in suburban Philadelphia in a bid to troll Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump renewed his call for the mental acuity tests after vouching for his own cognitive ability, pointing to his recent lengthy sit-down with the Wall Street editorial board. He said his conduct won plaudits from the writers.\n\n‘The one thing we know is that he’s got no cognitive problem. She may have,’ Trump said, summing up their conclusion. He has repeatedly attacked Kamala Harris’ IQ and intelligence.\n\n‘I have no cognitive – she may have a cognitive problem. But there’s no cognitive problem,’ Trump told Steele, a former ESPN anchor who asked him friendly questions at a town hall in central Pennsylvania organized by the Trum campaign.\n\n ‘And I actually call for a cognitive test for all people wanting to run for president. Not based on age. Some of the greatest leaders in the world – and I’m not 80 and I’m not that close to 80,’ Trump explained.\n\n‘In the Biden case, he’s 81 or 82.’ Then Trump brought up his meeting with News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch.\n\n‘By the way a man who’s very successful is Rupert Murdoch and he’s 93 or 94. He’s sharp and he’s in his 90s’ said Trump. ‘I’ve done cognitive tests and I’ve aced both of them.’\n\n‘I’ve done cognitive tests and I’ve aced both of them,’ Trump said, referencing a basic screening he has taken. \n\nDescribing his pitch for the tests as a requirement, he said: ‘They say it’s unconstitutional which I say is too bad or ridiculous.’\n\nAge was a major issue earlier in the campaing after a series of gaffes by Biden, 81. Trump was the oldest president to serve when he was elected, a record that soon passed to Biden. Trump would be the oldest person to take the oath in January if reelected.\n\nTrump showed one sign of his longevity when someone interrupted his town hall to mention a Pennsylvania Republican lawmaker.’\n\n‘Stan Musial? Oh I see [Rep.} Dan Meuser. Is Dan here? I thought he said Stan Musial – Stan the Man, remember?’ Musial, the St. Louis Cardinals great, died in 2013 at 92.\n\nTrump seemed completely at ease during the questioning, joking with one audience member about her tattoo and another about his goatee.\n\nBut one thing he couldn’t tolerate was the furniture.\n\n‘Let me get up. These are the most uncomfortable chairs. I think I’ll get up. There is no chair like that chair,’ Trump said, standing suddenly more than halfway through the interview.\n\nIt was a minor problem compared to what he’s been dealing with at live events. On Friday night in detroit, his mic stopped functioning for more than 15 minutes, forcing Trump to pace the stage while the problem was fixed. At another town hall days ago, Trump had aides play music for about 40 minutes rather than taking additional questions.\n\nAge was on Trump’s mind after he was reminded that Sunday is Kamala Harris’s birthday while standing at the drive-thru McDonald’s in suburban Philadelphia.\n\n”It’s Kamala’s birthday? She’s 60 years old. I would say Happy Birthday, Kamala. She’s turning 60. I think I’ll get her some flowers. Maybe I’ll get her some fries. Give her some McDonald’s- I’ll get her a McDonald’s hamburger. Happy Birthday Kamala!’ Trump said – pronouncing her name correctly. \n\nTrump once again expressed sympathy for former rival President Joe Biden, calling it a ‘coup’ when he stepped back under pressure from fellow Democrats.\n\nAfter previously railing against Biden following his debate disaster, Trump was almost sympathetic. ‘We had a debate, and he didn’t do great in the debate, but that’s understand … Didn’t do well, and his poll numbers went down, but that’s okay, because you come back from that stuff.’\n\nHis comments about Biden reflect how the race was suddenly upended by Biden’s withdrawal. Now it is Trump, 28 years his rival’s senior, whose utterances are getting scrutinized for any sign of aging. Harris has done her best to turn on the spotlight by calling him ‘unhinged.’ \n\nTrump lavished praise on his interviewer’s skills during the event – as well as her looks, even while saying he probably shouldn’t.\n\n‘She’s a brave woman. A great woman. Beautiful, too – but I’m not allowed to say that,’ Trump mused.\n\nHe said such a comment can be ‘the end of your political career. But she’s beautiful.’\n\nHe also heaped praise on prize-winning New York Times photographer Doug Mills when snappers came close to the stage to take pictures.\n\nHe called him ‘the only thing good about the New York Times.’\n\nThe interview came on a whirlwind day in Pennsylvania. Hours earlier, Trump passed through the golden arches and got behind the fryer at a McDonald’s in the Philadelphia suburbs – in a move designed to troll Kamala Harris.\n\n‘I’m looking for a job. And I’ve always wanted to work at McDonald’s but I never did,’ Trump said as he introduced himself to franchise owner Derek Giacomantonio. ‘I’m running against somebody that said she did, but it turned out to be a totally phony story.’ \n\n‘So, if you don’t mind, I want to work the French fry counter. How much are you paying me?’ the billionaire ex-president said with a laugh. \n\nTrump then proceeded to don a black and yellow apron and learn the process of making French fries at the Bucks County, Pennsylvania restaurant. \n\nTrump also took a turn at the drive-thru counter – catering to a handful of prearranged ‘customers’ who were supporters. Trump said the meals were taken care of, which speeded processing.\n\n‘I’m having a lot of fun here, everybody,’ he declared. \n\nAsked about his own first summer job and entry-level positions, Trump told DailyMail.com through the drive-thru window: ‘It requires expertise, I’m going through the whole french fry stuff. It’s a whole process.’\n\n‘I’ll never forget this experience,’ he said, without divulging anything about his time working for his father’s business.\n\nHe dodged most policy questions, including whether he backs an increase in the minimum wage. Asked what he’s getting paid, he quipped, ‘Not enough – I want more money.’ \n\n‘I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,’ Trump said, revisiting his claim that his rival didn’t work at McDonald’s as a student as she says she did.\n\n‘It’s a good job, isn’t it? Not bad. You have a nice owner?’ Trump asked inside the restaurant. ‘Be careful, he’s right there,’ the ex-president said with a laugh. ‘Be careful. Eight years, that’s the end of that.’\n\nWith the boss looking on, the employee said that franchise owner, Giacomantonio, was great. \n\nAsked by a reporter why Harris would lie about working at the restaurant, Trump replied, ‘Because she’s “lying Kamala,”‘ applying a moniker. \n\nWhen a reporter through the window if he would accept the election results regardless of the outcome, Trump dodged. ‘Let’s not talk about that,’ he said, saying he would if it was fair.\n\nDuring his extended turn at the drive-thru window, Trump found himself in customer service mode, answering repeated questions from reporters.\n\nHe even fielded a question from DailyMail.com about his latest chat with Benjamin Netanyahu, although he didn’t reveal anything about plans a potential IDF attack on Iran. \n\n‘Bibi called me this morning. And he’s obviously got things going well. He likes to hear what I have to say,’ later clarifying that the call was Saturday.\n\nStanding in his his blue apron with yellow straps, he wouldn’t say if Netanyahu would hold off on attacking Iran. ‘It would be very inappropriate. But they’re certainly in a better position, and fortunately they didn’t listen to Biden and Harris,’ he said. ‘They didn’t want him to do this,’ he said.\n\nTrump even had birthday greetings for Harris when prompted. \n\n‘It’s Kamala’s birthday? She’s 60 years old. I would say Happy Birthday, Kamala. She’s turning 60. I think I’ll get her some flowers. Maybe I’ll get her some fries. Give her some McDonald’s- I’ll get her a McDonald’s hamburger. Happy Birthday Kamala!’ Trump said – pronouncing her name correctly. \n\nTrump’s supporters got wind of the event and lined the street north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike long before Trump was set to appear. Tractor trailer trucks sounded their horns when they drove by hundreds of supporters who cheered and raised Trump flags.\n\nGiacomantonio posted a sign on his store, announcing the closure and writing that ‘while we are not a political organization, we proudly open our doors to everyone.’ He said the visit gave the chance to ‘shine a light on the positive impact of small businesses.’\n\nThe Trump camp carefully shielded McDonald’s employees when they were outside the restaurant, and asked a photographer to delete images of them for security purposes.\n\nThe Republican nominee is spending the entire day campaigning in Pennsylvania, most likely a must-win state for him or Harris. \n\n‘We’re going to the Pittsburgh game tonight. Pittsburgh Steelers. Should be good,’ said Trump at McDonald’s \n\nThe eastern part of the state roots for the Philadelphia Eagles, but there isn’t a strong rivalry between the teams. \n\nAsked his favorite menu item, Trump – known for his love of fast food – responded: ‘I like it all … I like every ounce of it, everything. But I do like the French fries, where I’ll be working.’ \n\nPrior to the ex-president’s arrival, the first customer at the drive-thru was anything but random. \n\nHe identified himself to DailyMail.com only by his first name of Jim, and called himself a Trump supporter. He said he didn’t believe Harris ever worked at the chain. ‘I don’t believe her at all,’ he said. \n\nAs for his own order for a packed SUV, ‘I think we’re going to surprise with some chicken nuggets,’ he said. \n\nA massive security presence guarded the fast-food stop. Secret Service agents and local law enforcement secured the exurban corridor, with snipers on a nearby roof. \n\nThe throngs of MAGA fans booed loudly when cars brandishing Harris-Walz flags occasionally drove buy. Fans let out chants of ‘Trump! Trump! Trump!’ in anticipation, even with little hope of catching a close-up glimpse of their favorite candidate. \n\nThe Trump campaign took extraordinary measures to control the event, letting in just a small ‘pool’ of reporters with no representative from print or online media for the photo-op. It was a sign of the high stakes of the symbolism the campaign is deploying in an effor to peel away Blue Wall states by prying away working class voters from the suburbs and exurbs.\n\nTrump had been teasing the visit for weeks as a way to turn up the heat on his rival, as he did again at a rally in Latrobe near Pittsburgh Saturday night, when he once again accused his rival of faking her own claim to have worked there as a student.\n\nTrump claimed she ‘lied about working at McDonald’s,’ then added: ‘That’s like not a big thing, but can I be honest with you, it’s terrible,’ he said at an event where he spoke about the size of golf legend Arnold Palmer’s manhood.\n\n‘I’m going to McDonald’s to work the french fry,’ Trump said. ‘I think I’m doing it tomorrow, and I think it’s in a place in Pennsylvania, and I’m going to stand over that french fry.’\n\nTrump’s team has also been raising doubts about Harris’s resume. \n\nTrump senior advisor Jason Miller said Trump was doing the visit ‘so that one candidate in this race can actually have worked at McDonald’s.’\n\n‘Since Kamala Harris has not, President Trump by the end of tomorrow will have worked at McDonald’s. He’ll have done fries more than Kamala Harris ever has,’ he said. ‘I think it shows he connects with hard-working Americans.’ \n\nHarris has said did fries and worked the cash register at a California McDonald’s while she was a student at Howard University. Her campaign has said she worked at an Alameda franchise in 1983. \n\nHarris also referenced her time working there in her 2019 presidential campaign. Her camp hasn’t furnished any photos of her youthful job there, although Trump has not provided any evidence that she lied about it. \n\nTrump’s own jobs early in life were working for his father’s real estate company at construction sites and offices, which he did along with brothers Fred Jr. and Robert, according to the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. \n\nIt is just the latest effort by Trump to undermine Harris. In Atlanta last month and again during a podcast interview days ago, Trump raised questions about her racial identity (Harris’s father is from Jamaica and her mother was of Indian descent). \n\nTrump has good reason to be hitting Bucks county, located north of the city of Philadelphia.\n\nIt is a populous ‘purple’ county whose votes are up for grabs.\n\nHillary Clinton narrowly edged Trump there in 2016, beating him 48.4 to 47.6 percent.\n\nJoe Biden widened the margin in 2020, garnering 52 percent of the vote. \n\nTrump carried the state with its 19 electoral votes in 2016, but Biden snatched it from him in 2020, winning by just 1 percent of the vote. \n\nHarris highlighted her time at mickey D’s during the Democratic convention.\n\nShe spoke about it again last week as Trump was accusing her of faking it.\n\n‘Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald’s is because there are people who work at McDonald’s in our country who are trying to raise a family and pay rent on that,’ she told MSNBC.\n\n‘And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people, and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.’\n\n‘But it was not a small job, like, I did the fries. I mean, you know, I did,’ she said.\n\nTrump has been building up the appearance since a rally in Reno October 10. ‘\n\n‘Do you know what I am doing next week? I am going to a McDonald’s to work!’ he told the crowd. \n\nHe mentioned it again in Arizona, saying he would work the fryer ‘so I can see how hard her job that never turned out would be.’\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro spoke to the closeness of the race on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ Sunday.\n\n”Well, I think if past is prologue, we’re set for another close race here in Pennsylvania. Let me explain: 2016, the race was decided by 44,000 votes. Donald Trump won here in Pennsylvania. In 2020, the race was settled by 80,000 votes. Joe Biden won. In both instances, it came down to a point or less. So the fact that you have polls showing that it’s, you know, a jump ball, a statistical dead heat, maybe Kamala Harris is up a point or so – that is not a shock,’ he said.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump renewed his call for cognitive tests for presidential&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-78-claims-no-cognitive-issues-followed-by-confusing-remarks/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Trump-78-boasts-about-having-039no-cognitive-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-21 00:00:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":260439730,"title":"US poll shows strong support for Kamala Harris from Asian-Americans – will it be pivotal?","text":"Strong Democratic support from Asian-American voters as shown in an opinion poll could prove pivotal for Vice-President Kamala Harris in November’s US presidential election, analysts say, with many from the community backing her approach to US-China relations and concerned about Republican candidate Donald Trump’s more erratic policies.\nA survey conducted in September by the NORC research organisation at the University of Chicago found most Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters would support Harris in the election, with 66 per cent of Asian-American respondents saying they planned to vote for Harris, while 28 per cent said they would back former president Trump.\nBased on answers from 1,123 respondents, it was the first major survey of AAPI voters since President Joe Biden exited the presidential race in July, leading to Harris receiving the Democratic nomination.\nThe NORC results showed a stark increase in Democratic support among AAPI voters compared with the Asian-American Voter Survey (AAVS), conducted from April to May, which found 46 per cent of Asian-American voters backing Biden and 31 per cent supporting Trump.\nWhen it came to issues that were top of special importance to AAPI voters, the NORC report found that 47 per cent of respondents believed Harris would handle US-China relations better versus 28 per cent for Trump. Meanwhile, 49 per cent said Harris would fare better in managing ties with Taiwan, compared with 23 per cent for Trump.\nBeijing views Taiwan as a renegade province that should be reintegrated into mainland control, by force if necessary. While many nations, including the US, do not officially acknowledge Taiwan as an independent state, they oppose any use of force to alter the status quo.\n\nAsian-Americans have become one of the most influential voting demographics in the United States, with the number of eligible voters growing by 15 per cent – or 2 million – over the past four years, according to the Pew Research Centre. With recent polls showing Harris and Trump in a virtual dead heat nationally, Asian-American support could prove crucial.\n“This November, approximately 15 million Asian-Americans are expected to represent about 6 per cent of all eligible voters in the US,” non-profit organisation APIA Vote noted in its report on the NORC survey.\nObservers say Asian-American and Pacific Islander voters are traditionally more likely to vote for Democratic nominees, noting that they helped contribute to Biden’s victory over Trump in 2020.\nVincent Wei-cheng Wang, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of political science at Adelphi University, told This Week in Asia that Asian-American voters leaned towards Democratic candidates mainly on economic and civil rights issues. They also would likely expect Harris’ approach towards China ties to show more predictability, affirming the success of Biden’s stance on what Washington considered as its largest competitor, Wang said.\nAt the Democratic National Convention speech in August, Harris said she would ensure that “America – not China – wins the competition for the 21st century” and that the US did not abdicate its international leadership.\nObservers believe that Harris’ stance on China and Asia would allow more predictability for countries in the region to calibrate their relationship with the US while navigating Beijing’s growing influence in their backyard.\n\n“This support may increase or wane when Harris begins to unveil her policy. The same [Asian-American] voters are concerned that Trump will increase tariffs, ignore or berate allies and friends, and may even ‘cut a deal’ with China [such as over Taiwan],” Wang said.\nTrump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on Beijing if the superpower were to “go into Taiwan”. He had previously imposed stiff tariffs against certain goods from China during his term.\nAsian-American voters will support continuity of policies in the region and are concerned that potential tariffs could further heighten tensions between Washington and Beijing amid their ongoing trade war, according to observers.\n“The main difference in the Indo-Pacific policies of the candidates is that Harris will prioritise working with allies and partners to balance Chinese power while Trump will pursue a more unilateral approach,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Centre for China Analysis.\nMeanwhile, Kaewkamol Karen Pitakdumrongkit, head of the Centre for Multilateralism Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said Harris was also likely to continue engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) through its platforms and prioritise a multilateral approach with like-minded countries.\nOn the other hand, Trump would likely continue with his aggressive use of tariffs in addressing issues related to US trade deficits if elected, and work on “strategic decoupling” from China, she said.\n“For Trump, the likely main characteristics include the resurrection of the ‘America First’ policy, preference for bilateral deals rather than multilateral ones, which can lessen Asean’s role in affecting international affairs,” Pitakdumrongkit added.\n\nNot a ‘political monolith’\nNeil Ruiz, head of New Research Initiatives at the Pew Research Centre, said 68 per cent of Asian registered voters in a separate Pew poll valued national leaders who addressed the concerns of Asian communities outside the US.\nThat would explain why this voter group has paid more attention to US foreign policy, Wang said. However, he also noted that foreign policy issues paled in comparison with “bread-and-butter” issues in terms of concerns for Asian-American voters.\n“These communities have a greater sway on congressional and local politics,” Wang said, adding that there was general agreement between Democrats and Republicans on the US adopting a tougher policy towards China.\nUS politicians should not mistake the Asian community for a political monolith, Wang warned.\nNonetheless, Wang said that should Harris win the top post, she might draw more attention to AAPI communities and their concerns.\n“An immigrant daughter, if elected, she would become the first Black woman and the first Asian President of the US – a historic milestone.”","summary":"About 66 per cent Asian-American respondents say they will vote for Harris compared with 28 per cent support for Trump, a survey shows.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3283114/us-poll-shows-strong-support-kamala-harris-asian-americans-will-it-be-pivotal","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/20/848518bd-a2c8-4269-9e18-a2d4240612ce_d35c7806.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-21 00:00:11","author":"Sam Beltran","authors":["Sam Beltran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":260438392,"title":"Vance met with applause after echoing rally attendee’s ‘Jesus is King’ shout","text":"Vance’s comment comes a few days after Vice President Kamala Harris was interrupted by rally attendees yelling “Jesus is Lord” at one of her campaign events, prompting her to stop her speech and say, “Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally.”\n\nVance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, was speaking at his own rally in Wisconsin when someone could be heard shouting “Jesus is King.”\n\n“That’s right.

And Brown, who took the stage for a speech in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, where he mocked the Democrat candidates, nominee Kamala Harris and running mate Tim Walz, continued to show his love for Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, with \"Terrible Towels\" featuring their names on it with the election less than a month away. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Brown was wearing a black hat that had Trump’s signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan across it, which comes after he wore a similar red hat and MAGA shirt during the rally on Saturday. Steelers Nation still holds love for Brown after he grew into a superstar receiver with them after being drafted out of Central Michigan in 2010. Brown made seven Pro Bowls with the Steelers, including six in a row from 2013-2018, and led the league in receiving twice (2014, 2017) as well as receiving touchdowns (2018). STEELERS ADD SECURITY MEASURES FOR TRUMP'S ATTENDANCE AT GAME AGAINST AARON RODGERS' JETS Brown’s football career took a turn for the worse, though, after that 2018 season and he joined the New England Patriots for a single game before moving on to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who he infamously left at MetLife Stadium with his jersey and pads torn off while a game against the Jets in 2021 was ongoing. Since then, Brown has made headlines for all the wrong reasons, including multiple arrests and sharing his unfiltered opinions through his unofficial brand known as \"CTESPN,\" which he consistently hashtags on social media. That game in MetLife Stadium was the last time Brown played in the NFL, but he showed up Sunday night in Pittsburgh to reunite with Steelers fans while making the difference he preached he wanted to for Trump’s campaign. Brown, who was accompanied by former Steelers teammate Le’Veon Bell in Latrobe on Saturday, took the podium and ripped Harris and Walz. \"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, did you really know they want to put tampons in the boys' bathroom?\" Brown asked the crowd. \"That's really insane, right?\" Brown was referring to Walz being called \"Tampon Tim\" by Republican opponents after signing a Minnesota law that mandated tampons be free of charge in public schools in 2023. As Brown continues to show his support of Trump, the Steelers and Acrisure Stadium security team have bolstered protocols while warning fans of delays getting in and out of the stadium with the former president’s arrival scheduled. \"With former President Trump expected to attend Sunday night's game as a guest of an individual suite holder, we are working with Secret Service and local authorities to ensure the safety and security of all our fans,\" a statement from the team read. \"As always, we will work to make the fan experience the same as it always is for every Steelers home game at Acrisure Stadium. \"We encourage fans to arrive early to the parking lots and to the gates so that they can enjoy our pregame experience and our celebrations throughout the game that will honor the 50th anniversary of our Super Bowl IX team.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It is expected that Brown and Bell will be with Trump for the game as well.

Trump, almost as frequently and again today, has suggested she is making up the past summer job but offered nothing to support the claim.\n\n“She said what a tough job it was, only to find out, much to everyone’s chagrin, that she never worked there,” Trump proclaimed via his Truth Social media account just before his “shift” began.\n\nTrump’s “work” at the closed McDonald’s included at least one pass at moving fries from the fryer to the warmer, adding salt, and then filling a few fry containers. The former President later took to the drive-thru, where he handed supporters bags of food.\n\nTrump, whose decades-old love of the company’s food is well documented, apparently learned a few things during his brief and entirely unofficial tenure as a McDonald’s employee.\n\nTrump discovered, for example, that the French fries are not shoved into the carton by hand, a fact he revealed he’d realized only after preparing a few orders himself. He noted that the job was difficult, and that the employees needed to be skilled to succeed at their craft.\n\n“It requires great expertise, actually, to do it right and to do it fast,” Trump said.\n\nThe former president said the experience was one he’d long hoped to have, and it seemed to be one he enjoyed.\n\n“This is fun, I could do this all day. I wouldn’t mind this job. I like this job. I think I might come back and do it again,” he said.\n\nAccording to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, Trump’s brief and controlled impersonation of a wage worker was an act of desperation.\n\n“When Trump feels desperate, all he knows how to do is lie. He can’t understand what it’s like to have a summer job because he was handed millions on a silver platter, only to blow it,” Harris-Walz spokesman Ian Sams said.\n\nThe owner of the McDonald’s franchise, Derek Giacomantonio, said in a statement that the event was held to allow the former President to “observe the transformative working experience that 1 in 8 Americans have had: a job at McDonald’s.”\n\n“It is a fundamental value of my organization that we proudly open our doors to everyone who visits the Feasterville community,” he said.\n\nThe campaign stop wasn’t just about serving up fast food, Trump also used it as an opportunity to conduct an impromptu and truly surreal press conference from the McDonald’s drive-thru window, in which he made clear, yet again, that he’ll only accept the results of the 2024 election if he thinks that it’s “fair.”\n\n“It’s gotta be a fair election,” the former commander-in-chief said, still wearing the apron he’d had help tying on.\n\nTrump’s appearance outside of Philadelphia was followed with a trip to Lancaster for a town-hall style rally, and a stop in Pittsburgh to catch the Sunday night Steelers – Jets game.\n\nHerald wire services contributed to this reporting.","summary":"Trump, whose decades-old love of the company’s food is well documented, apparently learned a few things during his brief and entirely unofficial tenure as a McDonald's employee.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/20/trump-works-a-closed-mcdonalds-drive-thru-in-clear-attempt-to-troll-harris/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AP24294661369461.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 23:46:05","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":260437740,"title":"Elon Musk Is Giving Away $1 Million to a Donald Trump Supporter Every Day Until Election Day: ‘Kind of Fun’","text":"Elon Musk is giving away money to Donald Trump supporters every day until Election Day on Nov. 5.\n\n Musk, 53, announced the daily giveaway on Saturday, Oct. 19, at an America PAC event in Harrisburg, Penn., where he explained he plans to randomly award $1 million every day to a swing state supporter of the Republican presidential candidate.\n\n “I have a surprise for you,\" Musk told the crowd before bringing out a giant check. \"We are going to be awarding $1 million to people who have signed the petition — every day, from now until the election.”\n\n During the event, the Tesla CEO handed attendee John Dreher a check for $1 million.

He’s certainly not positioned to name his successor, the way President Biden did when he quit his reelection run and anointed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nInstead, the ultra-liberal Democrats who dominate every major office in California and run both houses of the state Legislature will be glad to see him go.\n\nAfter all, Newsom is the man who vetoed state-funded home loans for undocumented immigrants and immediately afterward forced legislators to come back to Sacramento earlier than they wanted for a special session aimed at preventing sudden large gasoline price spikes.\n\nNo one in the field to succeed him has come close to doing some of the things he’s done: debate a governor from another state who seems to delight in taunting California and doing the opposite of whatever this state does, from allowing almost all abortions to keeping schools and businesses open during the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nInstead, we have the likes of Toni Atkins, longtime legislator who pushed through a lot of laws, very few of which are on the tip of anyone’s tongue. There’s also Betty Yee, the termed out state controller. And Tony Thurmond, two term state school superintendent who can’t point to many ways he’s improved public education during eight years in the office. Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, who has done about has much in her current office as Newsom did while he held it – virtually nothing – is also running. Add in ex-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, beaten handily by Newsom when he ran in 2018. There will possibly be Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, best known for tough enforcement of state laws mandating huge amounts of dense new housing.\n\nAnd there could be outgoing U.S, Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, defeated in her quest for the Senate last spring.\n\nNone but Porter is exactly a household name. Yet. All are Democrats, with nary a Republican in sight. The closest thing to a GOP candidate is Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, now being sued for claiming his deputies prevented an assassination attempt when they arrested a man with guns and ammo in his car outside a Donald Trump presidential rally in Coachella.\n\nIn that way, the gubernatorial race looks a lot like this year’s run for the U.S. Senate did before former baseball player Steve Garvey got into it.\n\nIn short, the state GOP’s extreme lack of a bench – to use a baseball term – is painfully obvious.\n\nThe party not only holds no statewide offices, but it will not for at least another two years, and there’s no clone of Arnold Schwarzenegger waiting to pounce on Democrats as the muscleman actor did to ex-Gov. Gray Davis in a 2003 recall election.\n\nSchwarzenegger is proof the Republican label does not have to be poison in California. But where are Republicans with experience in public policy who could govern as a bit of a counterweight to the big majorities held by legislative Democrats?\n\nBut the “Make America Great Again” tag has been pure anathema in California. When 2018 GOP candidate John Cox adopted it while running against Newsom in 2018, he lost by the widest margin in almost 70 years. Running again in the 2021 attempt to recall Newsom, Cox drew just 4.4 percent of the vote.\n\nSo much for MAGA in California, which Trump has never come close to carrying.\n\nThe reality is that there are not many differences among the current corps of candidates to take Newsom’s place in the state Capitol’s “horseshoe” executive area in 2027.\n\nThat’s what California gets for having a Republican Party almost fully impotent at the state level.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.","summary":"In short, the state GOP’s extreme lack of a bench – to use a baseball term – is painfully obvious.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/20/republican-candidates-missing-so-far-from-californias-next-race-for-governor/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RPE-L-MEMORIAL-0509-07.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 23:27:25","author":"Thomas D.

Most of them are staunch backers of Israel, while Ocasio-Cortez has been a persistent critic.\n\nLawler and the GOP camp are claiming that Jones and Ocasio-Cortez are too far left for the district.\n\n“He is the pride of New York right now, Mondaire Jones,” Ocasio-Cortez is seen saying in a video clip used in a series of 30-second ads, which are bankrolled by the Congressional Leadership Fund PAC.\n\nThe narrator chimes in, “AOC is proud of Mondaire because they share the same radical agenda.” \n\nThe clip then shows an interview of Jones saying, “we need to end mass incarceration … and defund the police.”\n\n“Jones wanted to defund the police — just like AOC,” the narrator says. “He’ll do anything to make AOC proud.”\n\nThe CLF said it has reserved $8 million in spending on the race to aid Lawler, with AOC playing heavily in the ad rotation.\n\nBy comparison, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan considers Ocasio-Cortez a campaign asset. She has stumped for Ryan in the swing 18th District, where he faces off against Republican Alison Esposito, retired NYPD deputy inspector and commanding officer. \n\nOn the other side, the Democratic Congressional Campaign is seeking to tie Lawler to former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nOne 30-second ad shows a clip of Trump calling Lawler “spectacular” and then blasts his votes against abortion rights.\n\n“Maybe Trump thinks Mike Lawler is spectacular because he voted to restrict abortion … at least 10 times,” the narrator says. “Really spectacular.”\n\nThe Jones campaign rapped Lawler on health care, claiming in an ad that he opposed lowering prescription drugs for seniors and objected to prohibiting insurance companies from discriminating against New Yorkers with pre-existing conditions like cancer and asthma. \n\nLawler disputed the ads.","summary":"The House Republican Leadership PAC is running millions of dollars in TV ads linking Democrat Mondaire Jones to lefty firebrand Ocasio-Cortez to aid first-term GOP Rep.

The possibility that Harris could become the first female president, and where Walz would be stepping into uncharted waters as the No. 2 serving under her, suggests that some of the same tensions seen during this White House race could resonate into a potential Harris administration.\n\nVoters are certainly getting their fair share of gender-minded messaging.\n\nMore:The bro vote: Trump and Harris duel over what it means to be a man in America\n\nConsider the battle of who has the more macho merchandise, which ensued after the July assassination attempt on Trump — \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" shirts depicting Trump raising his fist in the air being hauled off stage by Secret Service quickly went viral. After Walz's elevation to the national stage, the Democratic campaign hawked 'Harris Walz' branded camo hats with bright orange lettering resembling something for sale at a hunting store.\n\nWalz hasn't always come off as a natural Midwestern dad to all Americans.\n\nA brief video clip of Walz fumbling with shotgun shells and a photo of him without his weapon in a southern Minnesota field during the annual pheasant home opener last Saturday prompted the MAGA-aligned internet to question whether his years of experience as a hunter were little more than a campaign tactic. The former Democratic U.S. representative has long prided himself of being the top shot in the Congressional Shootout, often using the anecdote on the stump to push for gun reform.\n\n\"He talks about this, 'I'm a big hunter, I had a gun in my car' and then you see a photo and he looks like a moron loading a shot gun,\" Sean Spicer, the former Trump administration White House press secretary, told USA TODAY. \"It was like he was dressing up for Halloween and said, 'I'm going to be a man this year.'\"\n\nMore:Tim Walz faces new question: How many 'misspeaks' can a 'knucklehead' get away with?\n\nTrump has specifically tried to woo younger, male voters.\n\nHe's appeared on \"bro\" podcasts with comedians like Theo Von and Andrew Schulz, video game streamer Adin Ross and Bar Stool Sports' \"Bussin with the Boys.\" The former president and his campaign have leaned into a wide variety of masculinity messages, from chest-thumping appearances by Hulk Hogan and UFC CEO Dana White to Trump threatening military action against his political opponents and picking a running mate in Vance who has faced widespread backlash for his past comments about women who don't have children.\n\n\"It's just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children,” Vance said in a 2021 interview with Fox News's Tucker Carlson. “How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nMichael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a frequent Trump critic, told USA TODAY the former president's strongarm approach to leadership, dated views and treatment of women showcases the worst that manhood has to offer.\n\n\"We have gotten to the point where we can show our leadership and our strength through other means than our fists or harsh words,\" said Steele, who also served as Maryland's lieutenant governor. \"We're not cavemen anymore. We don't have to do that anymore.\"\n\nMore:Josh Shapiro is rewriting the playbook. Will he deliver a win in Pennsylvania for Harris?\n\nWalz presents an alternate version of masculinity in American politics, Steele said, while also reaching out to voters who don't align with Trump and Vance's version of gender presentation.\n\n\"What Walz offers is probably the more traditionally and actually appropriate view of what a 'real man' is. He's a father, he's a coach, he's at times a disciplinarian, he's the guy who's going to help you fix your car,\" Steele said, adding: \"I think he's a phenomenal role model.\"\n\nAn unsuspecting messenger\n\nWalz's version of virility embraces the male-dominated spaces of football fields, veterans' groups and hunting grounds, but also classrooms, Pride parades, and abortion clinics.\n\nMore:Not just a women's issue: More men speaking out, and voting on, abortion in 2024\n\nEarlier this month during his debate with Vance in New York, Walz told the story of Hadley Duvall, a Kentucky woman who was 12-years-old when she was raped and impregnated by her stepfather. He also reflected on Amber Thurman, a 28-year-old Georgia woman who died in August of 2022 after she waited hours for a hospital to treat complications from an abortion pill.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography?” Walz said. \"There's a very real chance had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today.\"\n\nAmy Diehl, a sexism researcher and author of the 2023 book \"Glass Walls,\" told USA TODAY that men like Walz who are intentional about rejecting traits and beliefs commonly dubbed as toxic masculinity are the \"tonic\" to harmful stigma associated with expectations of men and boys.\n\nIt's something that may be coming through in the polling numbers.\n\nA recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Trump leads with male voters by 12 points in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that could decide who wins the White House. Another survey also found that Walz and Harris scored much higher points with women than Trump and Vance. More than half of women polled said they have an unfavorable view of Vance while just 28% said the same of Walz.\n\nThough more women than men identify as Democrats, Walz's advocacy for women before and after joining the 2024 presidential ticket is not to be missed, Diehl said.\n\nDemocrats praise Walz, a former teacher, for codifying the right to abortion in Minnesota, openly talking about his family's infertility issues, being the first faculty advisor for his high school's gay-straight alliance and mandating menstrual products be put in all school bathrooms. Trump and his allies have tried to turn the tables on that last policy by spreading the nickname \"Tampon Tim\" for the Minnesota governor.\n\nMore:Mr. Walz to VP Walz? Former students react to seeing their teacher on presidential ticket\n\n\"He shows you can be masculine, but also not threatened by women as equals, or women who are in positions of power,\" Diehl said. \"In fact, you can be cheerleaders for them.\"\n\n'We all experience the same emotions'\n\nTrump and his allies have taunted Walz since he joined the Harris campaign in August over his exaggerated gestures, his emotive addresses and his ever-present grin.\n\n\"You think because you throw on a flannel shirt or are in camo that makes you a man? I just think that reeks of desperation,\" said Spicer, the former Trump aide who now hosts his own podcast that routinely promotes his ex-boss' presidential campaign.\n\nBut Walz's intentional approach to positivity and gender is appealing to some voters.\n\nDespite having already cast his vote for Trump, Philadelphia resident Tim Nguyen told USA TODAY the former president's rough rhetoric and mudslinging shows a tired side of \"manliness.\"\n\nNguyen, a 26-year-old accountant, said seeing non-aggressive displays of emotion from politicians is encouraging, including the VP debate where Vance openly sympathized with Walz after he mentioned his teenage son had witnessed a shooting. Exhibiting non-macho emotions toward one another, Nguyen said, should be a sign of humanity, not weakness.\n\n\"Lowkey, they should be running for president,\" he said. \"I think they're really well spoken and were there for one another.\"\n\nAt the DNC, Walz talked about his children when his son Gus, then 17, jumped out of his seat, visibly weeping and pointed at his father, saying \"I love you Dad! That's my dad!\" Walz embraced his son after the speech when his family came on stage.\n\nMore:Gus Walz broke the internet with his tearful love for his dad. Then the bullying began\n\n\"He displays being a loving father to his kids, he displays being helpful and neighborly,\" Diehl said. \"These are all things that make him relatable to so many men in America.\"\n\nVance, a father of two young children, has also put his fatherhood in the spotlight and made increasing the birth rate a top talking point of the Trump campaign. The Ohio senator often details the struggles Americans undergo for getting affordable child care, agreeing with Walz in the debate to put more government spending toward the issue.\n\nThough the reception was largely positive to Gus' reaction in Chicago, right-wing commentators and Trump supporters shared a different tenor of comment on social media.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a member of the USA TODAY Network, reported Jay Weber, a conservative radio host, made a now-deleted post on X in response to the interaction.\n\n\"If the Walzs (sic) represent today's American man, this country is screwed: 'Meet my son, Gus. He's a blubbering b---- boy. His mother and I are very proud'.\"\n\nFirst-time voter and University of Michigan student Daniel Simpson told USA TODAY watching this interaction between father and son was \"refreshing.\" To get criticized for showing emotions, Simpson said \"causes a lot of mental health issues, because men feel like they have to hide any form of feeling depressed or anything like that.\"\n\n\"Men are supposed to be the tough ones and fight (emotions) off and be angry as opposed to sad,\" he said. \"I think that really needs to change and I think we all experience the same emotions.\"\n\nFor Simpson, Walz embracing a joyful approach to politics while working to promote equity makes him hopeful for the future. It's one of the reasons he cast his ballot early for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"To me, that shows a real man, someone who sticks with the country's (values),\" Simpson said. \"The Pledge of Allegiance says 'freedom and justice for all.'\"\n\n— Sam Woodward is the Minnesota elections reporting fellow for USA TODAY focusing on Minnesota Gov.

They share garden produce. \n\nIn some ways she said the makeup of the community makes them more communicative, but there are topics they also do not talk about. One of them being Trump.\n\nPort Angeles is the largest city in the county and is home to around 20,000 residents. Based on the signage around town, it appears deeply purple. \n\nAt the Dungeness Crab Festival in the heart of town, local voters could be found from both sides of the aisle, with attendees spotted sporting both Democrat and Republican presidential gear.\n\nOne passerby was overheard complimenting a man’s Trump hat. Another man had on a camo Harris-Walz cap. With just over 20 days to go before Election Day, multiple people sported Trump and Harris t-shirts.\n\nThe festival has been going on annually since 2003 and more than 10,000 people were expected to stop by over the course of three perfect fall days.\n\n‘I think people are careful to remember that we are all neighbors here living, working and playing on the peninsula, and so for the most part, we try and be respectful of everybody’s views,’ said Erin Kirkland who is on the marketing team for the festival.\n\nWhen it comes to Kirkland’s personal politics, she is a Democrat and will be supporting Harris in November. \n\nThe most important issues for her are health care and a woman’s right to choose.\n\n‘We’re feeling pretty good about it,’ she said of the election. ‘However, we saw what’s happened previously, so I won’t say we’re not nervous, we are.’\n\nHer comment was echoed by others supporting the Democratic ticket. While Republicans are projecting confidence, Democrats are fearful.\n\nRepublican Chris Anderson, a retiree, felt life was better with Trump in office.\n\n‘He can be a little bit difficult, but I liked his policies when he was in office,’ Anderson said. She mentioned illegal immigration as a top issue for her.\n\nMarcus Gunderson voted for Trump 2016 and 2020 and will support him again in November. He retired in 2020 but came out of retirement again in 2022.\n\n‘The cost of living is so outrageous that it takes four of us in one house to support ourselves. It’s horrendous,’ he said. ‘Trump has all the answers.’\n\nBut Kellyanne Kirk disagreed. While some voters like to argue the economy was better under Trump, she rejected blaming challenges stemming from the pandemic on President Biden and noted deficit spending also increased under his predecessor. Kirk also pointed out her 401K is doing quite well.\n\n‘My retirement is doing fabulous right now, and it’s been better than it was under Trump,’ she said with a smile.\n\nShe said if it were Nikki Haley or late Senator John McCain running, she would be voting for a Republican, but she will vote for Harris in November because she does not trust Trump. Her husband Ray Kirk agreed.\n\n‘I’ll vote for Harris. In terms of credential, competency, experience. She has it hands down over Donald Trump, he said. ‘Donald Trump does have his competencies, but they’re not in running the government or bringing people together at all, and I believe his interests are not in the interests of the people.’\n\nWhen it comes to running as a Republican in the county itself, candidates have been keeping it local.\n\nOn Saturday, county Republicans held their Oktoberfest candidate event at the Fairview Grange. GOP men and women of all ages showed up to hear candidates speak about a number of issues and ask their own questions.\n\nMore than a handful of attendees were wearing Trump hats or shirts. But the conversation and questions remain largely focused on issues impacting the community such as the cost of living, housing and homelessness and the fentanyl crisis.\n\nKara Selby, from Sequim, is one of the people who showed up. In the presidential election, she will vote for Trump and praised what she called his ‘strong leadership.’\n\nShe is feeling pretty optimistic that Trump will come out on top and claimed more people are expressing support for Trump the former president than in previous years. \n\nBut Democrats there insist enthusiasm has remained strong since the shake up at the top of their ticket with Harris taking over for Biden in July.\n\nChristy Holy is a volunteer with the county Democrats and has been living in the county for eight years. \n\nShe said the feeling after Biden’s debate performance was ‘disappointment’ and ‘fear’ but with Harris taking the reins, she said people became really excited.\n\nThere have been questions on whether the enthusiasm over Harris has stalled out nationally, but Holy said excitement remains up in Clallam County.\n\n‘It’s been constant. We’re still getting people. We’ve had to order signs several times because we keep running out of them,’ she said.\n\nHoly said people in the community take politics seriously and really care about what is going on. \n\nThe top issues when she’s out knocking on doors has been the soaring cost of housing and people expressing concerns over reproductive rights. \n\nRepublican state Senate candidate Marcia Kelbon has also been out knocking on doors, some 7,000 of them in the district so far. \n\nFor her, the number one issue that comes up is the economy including what Democrats out canvassing have also been hearing about: the cost of housing.\n\nThere is a significant older population on fixed incomes in the area where higher costs have been a serious burden. \n\nThere are also young people who cannot afford homes in the region with prices going up.\n\nWhen it comes to the presidential race, Kelbon said she voted for Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary. But she would not share who she plans to vote for in November. \n\nShe claimed she has been focused entirely on her own race and staying local. She also criticized the divisiveness she’s seen in the presidential race.\n\nKelbon cannot be certain which way the race is headed in the county. Ahead of the first presidential debate, her campaign commissioned polling that showed Trump leading Harris in the district which includes parts of Clallam County. But since then there has been notable changes in the race.\n\n‘I have no idea. I really don’t,’ she said of what she expects. ‘If I was able to call bets like that I would have way more money in the bank from buying stock.’\n\nBut head out of Port Angeles into more rural parts of the county, and the region appears to turn a deeper shade of red.\n\nAlong winding roads are Trump flags and signs. But at one remote location, someone must have pulled over along the highway to paint an ‘x’ across a large sign for the former president.\n\nAbout an hour southwest from Port Angeles is Forks, Washington, of Twilight fame. The vampire books and blockbuster movies were set in the town of less than 4,000 and fans pilgrimage to the area on a regular basis.\n\nStorefronts along the Main Street have posters of characters Bella Swan and Edward Cullen in windows and sell a variety of Twilight inspired merchandise. \n\nVisitors can see the pickup truck Swan drove parked outside the visitor center or swing by the Swan House to take pictures.\n\nBut besides the name and a few referenced locations, the town bears little resemblance to the one featured in the movie franchise. Based on the number of signs alone, it feels like Trump country.\n\nPeople in Forks are far less inclined to talk politics. But at the diner The In Place, a few people were willing to give it a go. They too reflected on a county divided.\n\nServer Kim, 39, said she and her husband are all in for Trump in November.\n\n‘I’m voting for Trump because I want to see changes made,’ she said but declined to share specifics. ‘I feel he is the only candidate that can move forward with that change.’\n\n‘I feel like when you live here, it’s almost like we don’t matter,’ she added. ‘Our voices aren’t heard as much out here, but people have strong beliefs, and they stand by that.’\n\nBut Sandy, who was there enjoying lunch, said she would be voting for Harris as the only ‘sane’ choice.\n\n‘The thing that bothers me is that people who support Trump have no idea in my opinion that they’re not going to get anything that they think Trump is going to give them,’ she said. ‘I think they’ll be the most disappointed people in the world if he gets elected.’\n\nSandy believes Trump will help the rich and himself, but she worries Democrats need to do more so people where she lives do not feel ignored.\n\n‘I have a lot of Trump friends that are wonderful people, and I don’t want to see them written off by anybody,’ she said. ‘We’re good people. We need to come together. We need to find commonality. We need to listen to each other, and I don’t know how to make that happen,’ Sandy said.\n\nTwenty minutes outside Forks, and visitors hit the beach in La Push, also featured in Twilight. It sits on Quileute Tribal land. \n\nAt least one home there has a Harris sign prominently displayed out front on a truck. It was the only Harris sign spotted in the area after hours of driving.\n\nBut even back in Port Angeles, questions remain about Harris’ ability to lock down the county just as the race nationally is looking like a nail-biter. And there is another unknown variable in play this fall.\n\nOutside Crab Fest, Ron Coffman was handing out t-shirts that promote Robert Kennedy Jr. for president. \n\nThe shirts are leftovers from the Independent candidate’s presidential bid before he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump. A Trump sticker had been slapped on the front of every t-shirt.\n\nCoffman was going to vote for Kennedy in November. He was never really a Trump supporter and described him as the kind of person he would not want at his house. But now he plans on voting for the Republican nominee for president.\n\n‘I will now because that puts Bobby [Kennedy] in a position to actually make the changes that America needs, not just what I want,’ he said.\n\nIt is not clear if there are enough Kennedy supporters to sway the outcome in this bellwether alone, but Coffman’s table of Kennedy turned Trump t-shirts has been a popular stop for festival-goers.","summary":"Tucked away in the far northwest corner of country just before the&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/the-county-that-has-correctly-predicted-the-last-11-presidents-is-revealing-who-they-are-supporting-in-the-2024-election/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Inside-the-only-county-thats-predicted-the-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 23:14:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.308},{"id":260437018,"title":"Strictly's Chris McCausland 'leaves BBC bosses with a big headache' - as he remains the bookies' favourite to win the show","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 20th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStorm Ashley brings travel chaos to Britain as high winds cancel dozens of flights and see planes forced to abandon landings while heavy flooding blocks roads\n\nLiam Payne's ex Danielle Peazer reveals the singer contacted her just weeks before his tragic death as model shares heartfelt tribute\n\nFears of 'tsunami' of deaths from asbestos in UK schools: Poisonous building material could kill hundreds of thousands of former pupils and teachers, damning report says\n\nUrgent hunt launched after a woman was 'raped at a children's playground' as police search for 'teenage attacker who approached victim with three other men'\n\nI didn't know how lonely and isolated country life could be when you're single - I was delusional to think leaving London for the Cotswolds would be easy\n\nTempted to have Botox, filler, lasers or a thread lift?

How can Chris be in two places at once? \n'As things stand, Chris can't do it because every show on his comedy tour from January 17 clashes.' \nChris is currently positioned as the firm favourite with Love Island's Tasha Ghouri next in line with odds of 4/1, followed by Miranda actress Sarah Hadland at 10/1 and EastEnders' Jamie Borthwick at 16/1. \nA spokesperson for Ladbrokes said: 'Chris McCausland seems to be running away with the competition this year after he extended his lead at the head of the Strictly betting. \n'Tasha is his main rival as things stand, but punters only see one winner.' \nThe Strictly live tour first launched in January 2009 with 2008 winner Tom Chambers among the line-up. Every winner since has taken part. \nIn a statement last month confirming the return of the Strictly live event for 2025, hosted once again by It Takes Two's Janette Manrara, judge Craig Revel Horwood declared: 'Strictly fans are in for a huge treat on the live tour - it's going to be bigger and better than ever before. \n'Audiences will be able to enjoy all of the glitz and glamour of the TV show and see their favourite celebrities and dancers up-close and personal. And with Motsi joining us for the first time, it's going to be even more FAB-U-LOUS!'\n\nThe bookies currently have him as the 9/4 favourite to win the show - but if he does it could leave the show in a predicament as The Mirror reports he is unable to do the Strictly live tour\n\nThe publication claims that his show, Yonks, which has dates throughout January and February will clash directly with Strictly's live theatre show \n\nIf he did win many fans would be expecting him to take part in the tour which the top stars of each series always participate in \nThe BBC and Chris have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. \nA spokesperson for the tour told The Mirror: 'Casting for the Strictly Live Tour 2025 is still being decided.'\nIt comes after fans were left 'in tears' after watching Chris and Dianne's 'perfect' dance routine on Saturday's episode.\nChris and the Aussie pro, 35, stunned viewers as they performed a waltz as they paid a tribute to Liverpool.\n\n Strictly Come Dancing RECAP as Chris sparks tears and Jamie tops the leaderboard \nDianne looked incredible in a navy shimmery gown while Chris rocked a dapper suit co-ord and a red shirt.\nFans were 'sobbing' over the very emotional routine, flooding X - formerly Twitter - with praising comments, begging to 'just give Chris the glitterball trophy'.\n'Dianne 'I'm so proud of you' Chris 'did I do ok?' Dianne 'you did good yeh really really good' Chris & Dianne FTW #Strictly';\n'This moment was everything. Chris dancing on his own to a song that means so much to so many. This man is extraordinary. He has danced his way into our hearts with the immense support of wonderful Dianne #strictly';\n'Chris just said 'did I do okay?' #strictly #StrictlyComeDancing';\n'I am still bawling with this Waltz from Chris & Dianne It was just absolutely beautiful and so emotional. Never watched anything so meaningful & poignant.. Just give them the GlitterBall just now as far as I'm concerned';\n'Every week you think this will be the dance Chris McCausland has not got…it's not this week #Strictly …& his hand on Dianne's back was perfect';\n\nA spokesperson for the tour told The Mirror: 'Casting for the Strictly Live Tour 2025 is still being decided'\n'Chris asking Dianne 'did I do ok?' Yes fella… you absolutely smashed it up again #Strictly';\n'Now why am I teary over Chris walking alone?! #Strictly';\n'Just give Chris McCausland the glitterball trophy NOW not only is he inspirational he is incredible keep voting for him strictly family #Strictly #StrictlyComeDancing';\n'Well we all know Chris should win Strictly. I cry every week. #strictly';\n'Ohh goodness! Chris is just smashing it. I'm so in awe of him.

There’s a lot of tension,” Delia O’Malley explained.\n\n“It’s fascinating to see how people can be so divided.”\n\n Delia O'Malley pictured in Atlanta in September Órla Ryan\n\nDelia was born in North Carolina in 1996 to an American mother and Irish father. Her family moved to Ireland in 1998 and she grew up in Kildare.\n\n“I’m Irish-grown, very much identifying with being Irish more so than American, but I am both at the end of the day,” she explained.\n\nDelia, her mother and her sister all decided to relocate to Atlanta in recent years. It’s quite a liberal city, but the wider Georgia state typically votes Republican.\n\nJoe Biden turned it blue in 2020 by just 12,000 votes out of some five million cast.\n\nTwo weeks out from the election, nationwide polls place Donald Trump and Kamala Harris neck-and-neck with a handful of swing states like Georgia set to decide the outcome.\n\nMany voters in the key battleground state remain undecided. Individual polls have generally given Trump a lead of between one and six points in Georgia, with most polls putting his lead within the margin of error.\n\n Donald Trump and Kamala Harris pictured during a televised debate last month Alex Brandon / AP/PA Images\n\n Alex Brandon / AP/PA Images / AP/PA Images\n\nDuring a recent trip to Atlanta, The Journal met Delia and her mother Amy.\n\nIf they look familiar, you may have seen them on First Dates back in 2019. They both moved to Atlanta in 2021. \n\nDelia said many people in the US see their political allegiance as a major part of their identity, in a way that is typically less common in Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, we’re proud of our political views at times. But it’s not our identity.\n\n“People (in the US) hold their political views so dear to them, it’s their identity, they have stickers on their car. Have you ever seen a Fianna Fáil sticker on the back of someone’s car?”\n\n Delia and Amy pictured at Fadó Irish Pub in Buckhead, Atlanta Órla Ryan\n\nAhead of relocating three years ago, Delia spent time in the US in the lead up to the 2016 election – where the eventual winner Donald Trump was then running against Hillary Clinton.\n\nDelia said this was also an “intense” time, but the divisions between right and left run much deeper now.\n\nThe last election Amy was in the US for was the 1996 runoff between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. She said she had been “dreading” the current election campaign.\n\nIrish Network Atlanta\n\nDelia and Amy are both members of the Irish Network Atlanta, a group that has been growing in numbers since it was established in 2016.\n\nAnnie Greenwood, the president of the network, said the Irish community in Atlanta is “so much bigger than anyone would think”.\n\nThe St Patrick’s Day parade is one of the longest-running events in the city – 2025 will mark its 141st year.\n\nAnnie was born in Boston, but her father’s family is from Cork and she has been to Ireland a few times.\n\n Annie became president of Irish Network Atlanta in January Órla Ryan\n\nShe told us Atlanta is still finding its footing as an “Irish stronghold”, but many expats have lived there for years.\n\nOthers who previously lived in New York or Boston, cities with well established Irish communities, are choosing to move south because it’s a cheaper alternative. \n\n“There’s a massive number of Irish in the southeast in general. The southeast is one of the fastest growing regions for Irish businesses to come over and set up shop,” Annie said.\n\nReproductive rights \n\nSpeaking about the political climate, Amy said Trump has, for many people, changed “what the American flag means”.\n\n“I wouldn’t fly the American flag in front of my house right now.”\n\nShe is not a fan of Trump for several reasons, but cites his views on women’s equality and reproductive rights as a major factor.\n\n Amy pictured in Altanta in September Órla Ryan\n\nDelia said it was somewhat strange to move from Ireland – a historically Catholic country which has become more liberal, voting in favour of marriage equality and abortion rights – to the US, a place where some of these rights are being stripped away.\n\nEarlier this month, a judge in Georgia lifted a six-week abortion ban after the deaths of two women who couldn’t access medical care. The lifting of the ban would likely be reversed if Trump is re-elected.\n\n A sign in a shop window in Decatur, Atlanta Órla Ryan\n\nThere are also concerns that rights granted to the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as IVF legislation, could be rolled back.\n\n“I’m queer, I don’t know if I’m going to marry a man or a woman,” Delia told us.\n\n“I do know that I would love to be a mother one day. Whether it’s biological, adopted, I know that I want to be viewed legally as that child’s mother.”\n\nDelia wanted to move abroad for better opportunities, noting she is “very fortunate to have dual citizenship”. \n\nShe is somewhat “nervous” about coming back to Ireland for Christmas – she’s excited to see her family, but many of her friends have emigrated.\n\nI have more friends now in Australia and London than I do in Ireland.\n\nWhen asked why they left Ireland, she said: “Better opportunities, more money, we can’t afford houses.”\n\nMonthly shooting drills\n\nBoth Delia and Amy work in the disability and inclusion sectors. Delia works at a school for children who are neurodivergent.\n\nShe loves her job, but said one of the most difficult aspects of it is the fact she has to take part in monthly active shooter drills – where staff and pupils practice what they would do if a school shooting takes place.\n\nShortly before we met last month, four people were killed in a school shooting in nearby Winder. \n\n An active shooter drill in a high school near Los Angeles, California, in 2018 (file photo) Alamy Stock Photo\n\n Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDelia said shooting drills are particularly difficult because many of the children don’t understand what’s happening. \n\n“I have to fully fake it and make sure they think everything is okay. I was like, ‘Alright guys, we’re gonna play a game. And the game is we’re going to be really, really quiet’.\n\nI’m sitting here looking in this little eight-year-old’s eyes while she’s verbally swimming and shaking her hands and doesn’t understand what’s happening, thinking to myself – what if this was real?\n\nDelia said the prevalence of mass shootings weighed heavily on her mind when deciding to move to the US. She said it will also play a factor when deciding whether or not she will raise a family there.\n\n“My biggest worry going to school when I was growing up was whether I had done my homework from the night before, not whether I was going to make it home or not.”","summary":"“People here hold their political views so dear to them, they have stickers on their car.

Even though the battleground state offers only 10 electoral votes, pollsters and political pundits believe those votes could be enough to tip the scales in either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris's favor.Exactly who Wisconsin might vote for is much harder to pin down.To get a sense, 60 Minutes traveled to the Badger State, where the margins have been razor-thin for years. Wisconsin was the only state where the margin was less than 1% both times Trump has been on the ballot, and, in fact, the difference between victory and defeat was a fraction of a percent in four of the last six presidential elections.A purple state with purple peopleAs its presidential voting history might suggest, Wisconsin is politically purple. Its senators are split by party: Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin represent the state. But one thing that might set Wisconsin apart from other battleground states is that the voters themselves are something of a shade of plum. Many split the ticket on election day and say they vote for a person, rather than a party, ping-ponging between Republicans and Democrats over the years. \"I don't vote Republican or Democrat or anything,\" a Wisconsin voter named Joe Conlon told 60 Minutes. \"I vote for who I like the best. And that's how it ends up.\"Conlon went on to explain that he voted for George W. Bush twice, then Barack Obama twice, then Donald Trump twice. He intends to vote for Trump again this year.For Brian Schimming, Wisconsin's Republican Party chair, this kind of cross-party voting history is not surprising.\"There's a pretty good independent streak here in Wisconsin,\" Schimming said. \"That has been shown over and over and over again.\"Schimming told 60 Minutes the Democratic and Republican Parties each have a reliable base of voters, but independents frequently vote on the issues of the moment and the concerns they feel when they go to the ballot box. \"I always tell candidates who run statewide here, 'Don't make a lot of assumptions about what the voters are going to do,'\" he said.As the candidates vie for these toss-up supporters, geography may matter. While Wisconsin often ends up being a state where the elections are decided by fewer than 25,000 votes, the individual counties themselves are not as evenly split. In 2020, more than 80% of Wisconsin's 72 counties had a double-digit margin for either Trump or President Joe Biden.In Kewaunee County, where Barack Obama won by 11 percentage points in 2008, Trump defeated Biden by almost 33 percentage points â an almost 44-point swing in 12 years.According to Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, this shift does not come down to the makeup of the county's residents.\"It's not demographics that are changing,\" Franklin told 60 Minutes. \"It's how we think about our candidates, how we think about the parties. It's Trump's appeal to working class, to lower education voters, those who didn't go beyond high school or at least not beyond junior college. And his appeal there is a change for the Republican party compared to where we were 20 years ago.\"Dane County tells another story. The fastest growing county in Wisconsin, Dane County is home to the capital city of Madison, the University of Wisconsin, and high-tech companies that have moved in and brought jobs. Just one of these companies, Epic Systems, employs more than 12,000 people in Wisconsin alone. Here, the Democrats are running up the score. Biden won 50,000 more votes in 2020 than Barack Obama did in 2012.Wisconsin's political historyA look through Wisconsin's history books shows how the political pendulum has swung in the state for decades.A one-room schoolhouse in Ripon boasts the birthplace of the Republican Party itself, a group organized in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Shortly thereafter, the state's supreme court made Wisconsin the first state to declare the Fugitive Slave Act unconstitutional. A faction of Wisconsin's Republicans created the Progressive movement, a group of reformers who pushed, among other things, for safer workplaces and cleaner cities.In 1919, Wisconsin became the first state to ratify the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote, and two years later, Wisconsin passed the country's first equal rights legislation, providing women with full legal equality to men.Wisconsin enacted the first state unemployment insurance law, Wisconsinite Wilbur Cohen was a key architect of the Medicare and Medicaid Act, and Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson championed the very first Earth Day.On the political flip side, Wisconsin was home to Sen. Joseph McCarthy, a Republican whose attempts to root out communists led to the nation's \"Red Scare\" during the early Cold War. Also headquartered in Wisconsin is the John Birch Society, a conservative advocacy group that promotes a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and has been criticized for its extremist views and conspiracy theories.Political pollster Charles Franklin said this rich political history has played out in the state's government.\"Whereas many states have been lopsided and had all Democratic governments or all Republican governments, our history is very much a mixture of divided government,\" Franklin said. He also went on to explain that, after the Tea Party hit the national scene in 2010, Wisconsin began to get more and more polarized. The 2016 election magnified it. \"Trump added to that polarization,\" Franklin said. \"And now it's a more nationalized polarization as opposed to one based mostly in state politics as it was for us early.\"The sprint to the finishIn the last two presidential elections, Donald Trump's support has been underestimated in Wisconsin. One complicating factor in predicting voter's opinions is that the state has same-day registration, meaning residents can register to vote on Election Day, thereby eliminating them from any preliminary estimation of registered voters. In 2020, more than 219,000 did just that â and a majority of those same-day voters swung toward Donald Trump.For Ben Wikler, Wisconsin's state Democratic party chair, this is an anxiety-inducing proposition.\"I absolutely lose sleep at night thinking about folks who are in nobody's polls, in nobody's models who show up and cast ballots for Trump,\" Wikler said. \"I need to find the same kinds of voters to make sure that they vote for Kamala Harris.\"From Green Bay to Eau Claire to Milwaukee, the Trump and Harris campaigns have been barnstorming Wisconsin in a last-minute sprint to Election Day. As they try to make their case to voters, one thing is certain: No one knows the way this race will go in the Badger State.\"It's very, very close,\" Republican chair Schimming said. \"And I think both sides would say that.\"To watch Jon Wertheim's 60 Minutes report on Door County, Wisconsin, click here.The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer.

Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and then Joe Biden. Door County, home to around 30,000 people, has a streak of backing the winning candidate in every presidential election for decades. One of a handful of competitive counties in the state, Door County could offer a clue into the eventual outcome as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump vie for Wisconsin's crucial 10 electoral votes. \"All eyes are on Wisconsin, all eyes have been on Door County,\" Cox said. \"And it feels like there's pressure for us to deliver.\"What makes Door County, Wisconsin, uniqueSeven swing states, home to 513 counties, hold the key to next month's election. Door County, located on a peninsula wedged between Lake Michigan and Green Bay, is the only one of those counties where voters have selected the winning candidate in each election this century. In 2020, President Biden carried the county by just 292 votes, the tightest margin in any Wisconsin county. Yet even as the Trump and Harris campaigns crisscross the state, neither candidate has made a stop in Door County. Republican Joel Kitchens, who represents the county in the State Assembly, said Door tends to pick the winner in every statewide election. \"I think a lot of it is that we are such a cross section of the state,\" he said. \"We have a lot of people that came from the cities and from the suburbs and retired. We have a strong agricultural community. We have heavy manufacturing.\"The county is 92% White, but diverse politically. In the rural south, signs of support for Trump dominate the landscape. What voters in Door County are focused onCox, who runs a boutique in the Door County tourist town of Sister Bay, is focused on reproductive rights and their role in the election. Despite political differences, she said people in the county get along.\"You don't want to alienate your neighbors,\" Cox said. \"You don't want to alienate your fellow business owners. You all come together.\"Further south in the county, Austin Vandertie, a sixth-generation dairy farmer, is focused on inflation. \"You know, inflation affects the cost of my feed, my fuel, my seed, my fertilizer, everything that it takes for me to grow a crop and feed it to my cows to get a good product,\" Vandertie said.The 25-year-old south Door County resident plans to vote for Trump, with many of his neighbors leaning the same way. Further north in the county, cows and deer blinds give way to artists and rainbow flags. In Sturgeon Bay, the county seat, sensibilities vary from one yard to the next with signs for both Trump and Harris.John and Annette Vincent, now retired, moved to Sturgeon Bay from Chicago. \"We are very purple,\" Annette said. \"That is our impression from moving up here, is that we are very, very purple.\"How the poll and party workers see Door CountyWisconsin was decided by less than 1% in the last two elections, even though around 80% of the state's counties were decided by a double-digit margin. Charles Franklin is the director of the Marquette Law School Poll, widely considered Wisconsin's best. His most recent poll has Harris up 4%, but he acknowledges that there were major issues with polling in 2016 and 2020.Most polls in those years, including ones by CBS News, fell short in accounting for Trump's voters. The Marquette Law School's polling during the midterm elections closely mirrored the final results but had greater discrepancies during the presidential elections.\"The people that Trump mobilizes to vote really do turn out for him. But they seem to drop out of the electorate in the midterm,\" Franklin said.Wisconsin Republican Party Chair Brian Schimming is working to identify those hidden Trump voters, determined to get them to the polls on Nov. 5.\"Well, I spoke at President Trump's rally the other day, and I said to the folks there, 'Look, there are hundreds of thousands of people in this state who think like us, they act like us, they live like us, they believe like us, but they don't vote.' And I truly believe that,\" Schimming said.For the Democrats, the strategy entails running up the numbers in Milwaukee and Dane County, home to Madison — the state capitol and the University of Wisconsin. Biden won more than 75% of the vote there in 2020. Democrats are also trying to stanch the bleeding in rural swaths that have swung heavily towards Trump.The state's vote is pivotal, State Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler said.\"Wisconsin was the state that tipped the Electoral College for Donald Trump in 2016,\" Wikler said. \"There is every possibility that Wisconsin could tip the presidential election again in 2024.\"Wikler took a look at Door County data and found that the race was almost perfectly tied there.\"Whoever wins in Door County is probably the next president of the United States,\" he said.The search for the mystery swing voterWhile the county has swung back and forth between voting for Democrats and Republicans, 60 Minutes wanted to find out if there was anyone in the county who'd followed the same path, voting for the winning candidate for six elections in a row. The search began with a bulletin broadcast by the local radio station. It continued at a restaurant, famous for goats that graze the grass roof, where correspondent Jon Wertheim asked patrons if they knew anyone who'd voted for the winning candidate six elections in a row, but he was out of luck. Next stop was the local watering hole, where Wertheim found trucker Joe Conlon. He came close, voting for five of the last six winners. Conlon, who thinks he'll be voting for Trump this year, also voted for him in the last two elections. At a local Rotary Club, a woman thought she might have voted for the winning candidate in all six elections, before realizing she hadn't. After scouring Door County, 60 Minutes came up empty in its search for that singular voter. Still, one thing was made clear during the search: in the swingiest part of Wisconsin, family and community come before politics, and everyone will be invited to Thanksgiving, regardless of their political affiliations. \"We're a little different in Wisconsin, I guess. We got that Midwest nice going on,\" Vandertie said.","summary":"Residents of Door County, Wisconsin, have a decades-long streak of presidential elections in which they have voted for the winning candidate.

His poll, widely considered Wisconsin's best, currently has Kamala Harris up four—but, not so fast….Jon Wertheim: What is it like being a pollster these days?Charles Franklin: It's challenging, because we've seen polling errors in 2016 and 2020. And those were major issues.Memorably, in 2016 and 2020, most polls—CBS included— fell short when accounting for the Trump vote.Jon Wertheim: There's something specific, particular to Trump that makes his support hard to capture.Charles Franklin: In these four most recent elections, the two big errors have both come when Trump's on the ballot. And the two elections without him on the ballot, we've been as good or better than our long term average.Jon Wertheim: Say more about why you think that is.Charles Franklin: The people that Trump mobilizes to vote really do turn out for him. But they seem to drop out of the electorate in the midterm.Brian Schimming: My suspicion is it keeps the Kamala Harris campaign up all night long.Jon Wertheim: That there's this cohort that hasn't been capturable.Brian Schimming: Correct.Brian Schimming, Wisconsin's Republican Party chair, is shaking the trees to identify those hidden Trump voters… and, crucially, get them to the polls.Jon Wertheim: How many potential Trump supporters are there in Wisconsin who have never voted before?Brian Schimming: Well, I spoke at President Trump's rally the other day, and I said to the folks there, \"Look, there are hundreds of thousands of people in this state who think like us, they act like us, they live like us, they believe like us, but they don't vote.\" And I truly believe that. Jon Wertheim: Is it risky to rely on this sector, these low-propensity voters who have been so unreliable in the past?Brian Schimming: It's risky not to.For the Democrats the strategy entails running up the numbers in Milwaukee…. and booming Dane County - home to Madison, the state capitol and the University of Wisconsin - where Biden won more than 75% of the vote in 2020…. meanwhile, they'll try to stanch the bleeding in rural swaths that have swung heavily towards Trump….Ben Wikler - state Democratic Party chair - thinks it's a complete jump ball right now for Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes.Ben Wikler: So on Election Night, expect to stay up very late. And when you find out who won Wisconsin, which might happen at 4:00 in the morning, you probably know who won the presidential election.Jon Wertheim: It's that pivotal?Ben Wikler: Wisconsin was the state that tipped the Electoral College for Donald Trump in 2016. There is every possibility that Wisconsin could tip the presidential election again in 2024.Wisconsin was decided by less than 1% in the last two elections. But get this: around 80% of the state's counties were decided by a double digit margin… which only magnifies Door County's uncanny distinction.Ben Wikler: I think in Door County this election's almost perfectly tied as well. I was just looking at the county-by-county data before I joined you today. Whoever wins Door County on Election Day probably wins the state of Wisconsin yet again.Jon Wertheim: You say whoever wins Door County likely wins Wisconsin. You also just said whoever wins Wisconsin likely wins the national election.Ben Wikler: Yes--Jon Wertheim: Not an exaggeration.Ben Wikler: But--Jon Wertheim: Door County, Wisconsin--Ben Wikler: --historically the case. Whoever wins in Door County is probably the next president of the United States.It got us thinking, is there one person in Door County who's actually picked the winning candidate in each of the last six presidential elections?.....The county did collectively; but did any single voter? If so, finding this mystery figure might provide a heck of a clue into how this presidential election will go…. So we went on a search….We started with an APB at the local radio station…TIM KOWOLS: If you or someone you know in Door County has voted for the presidential winner of every election going back to the year 2000, please reach out to 920…But no response…. from the airwaves to the rooftops, Al Johnson's swedish restaurant is best known for the goats that graze on the grass roof…Inside, we found the locals who beat the sunrise and the tourists, let themselves in through the back door and pour their own coffee…Jon Wertheim: Do you know anyone that's voted for presidents six straight years now and gotten it right?Male Voice (unidentified): No. No--Female Voice (unidentified): No. (laughter)We were told to go to another table and ask the guy in the hat…Jon Wertheim: We got a hot tip it was…Male Voice (unidentified): No, I had some of them. George H. W. was-- was my vote. But-- not his son. Next stop in our pursuit, the local watering hole.Jon Wertheim: Do you know that person?Female Voice: I'm out.Female Voice: I did not. Female Voice: You have your work cut out for you. (laughter) Then suddenly: a promising lead… Female Voice: I hear you found your voter. (laughter)Jon Wertheim: Seriously?Female Voice: Right over there. He's down there--Jon Wertheim: Seriously? There at the end of the bar…sitting before something called a Badger Melt and a tall glass of milk—trucker, Joe Conlon.Jon Wertheim: Bush, Bush, Obama, Obama, Trump, Biden.Joe Conlon: I came close. Five out of six.Jon Wertheim: Five out of six?Joe Conlon: Yeah. Yeah, I didn't vote for Biden. Jon Wertheim: Can I ask you how you're–gonna be votin' this year?Joe Conlon:: I think I'm gonna be voting for Trump again.Jon Wertheim: Three times in a row?Joe Conlon:: Yes.We had come agonizingly close…Our last stop: the Rotary Club of Sturgeon Bay.Jon Wertheim: I'm curious: does anyone know someone, a voter, who actually voted for the winning candidate all six years? Anyone?Female Voice: I think I did. (laughter) Now that you ask the question, yes, I think I did.Behold! our Door County unicorn….Female Voice: No, no, now-- no, I didn't, now that I'm thinking about it. (laughter) Jon Wertheim: We thought you had all six?Female Voice: I thought I did. But, no, now I'm thinking back, I didn't.After scouring Door County, we came up empty… which shows the improbability of it all…But in our quest, maybe we stumbled across something even more rare, we found a place in America where family and community outrank party loyalty. In this divisive election season, we came to America's ultimate battleground….except there was no battle … as they say here with pride, we live above the tension line. Jon Wertheim: What's your sense of how the tone in Door County compares to the tone nationally?Emma Cox: You don't wanna alienate your neighbors. You don't wanna alienate your fellow business owners. You all come together.Jon Wertheim: Do you have family members that are gonna vote differently from you?Austin Vandertie: Oh, absolutely.Jon Wertheim: Everyone invited to Thanksgiving, regardless?Austin Vandertie: Absolutely. Politics is, you know, if we can't talk about it that means it's gone way too far in the wrong direction.Jon Wertheim: You recognize that's not necessarily the, the vibe in the country at large?Austin Vandertie: Hey. We're a little different in Wisconsin, I guess. We got that Midwest nice going on.

But if Trump is depending on that incel-edgelord crowd, he could be in real trouble. \n\nIn March, The Economist published a downright terrifying article: \n\nThe Economist analysed polling data from 20 rich countries, using the European Social Survey, America’s General Social Survey and the Korean Social Survey. Two decades ago there was little difference between men and women aged 18-29 on a self-reported scale of 1-10 from very liberal to very conservative. But our analysis found that by 2020 the gap was 0.75 … For context, this is roughly twice the size of the gap in opinion between people with and without a degree in the same year.\nPut another way, in 2020 young men were only slightly more likely to describe themselves as liberal than conservative, with a gap of just two percentage points. Young women, however, were much more likely to lean to the left than the right, with a gap of a massive 27 percentage points.\n\nThis isn’t just in the United States. It’s happening globally, and it feeds into dangerous right-wing nationalist movements across the globe. \n\nWhat is going on? The most likely causes of this growing division are education (young men are getting less of it than young women), experience (advanced countries have become less sexist, and men and women experience this differently) and echo chambers (social media aggravate polarisation). Also, in democracies, many politicians on the right are deftly stoking young male grievances, while many on the left barely acknowledge that young men have real problems.\nBut they do, starting with education. Although the men at the top are doing fine, many of the rest are struggling. In rich countries, 28% of boys but only 18% of girls fail to reach the minimum level of reading proficiency as defined by [Programme for International Student Assessment], which tests high-school students. And women have overtaken men at university. In the [European Union], the share of men aged 25 to 34 with tertiary degrees rose from 21% to 35% between 2002 and 2020. For women it rose faster, from 25% to 46%. In America, the gap is about the same: ten percentage points more young women than men earn a bachelor’s degree.\n\nReactionary politicians like Donald Trump are undoubtedly stoking those grievances. There’s a reason Trump fraternizes with the worst conservative male influencers, including Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and right-wing influencers Adin Ross, Tim Pool, and Logan Paul. And it doesn’t just massage Trump’s dainty ego, but also it makes electoral sense for a candidate who struggles to expand his existing base of support. Remember, he never hit 47% of the national vote in either of his presidential bids. \n\nThe Economist is also right that the left hasn’t acknowledged the problems young men face. In fact, we often mock them for finally having to compete in a world where they have less of an advantage than they used to. That sentiment isn’t wrong, but it’s politically self-sabotaging. We’ve given the right a new demographic weapon to wield against us for generations. \n\nThat’s a challenge we’ll need to tackle in the future. But for now, just how dangerous are these young MAGA men to Democratic chances in November? \n\nIn 2016, 55% of voters ages 18 to 29 voted for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while 36% went for Trump. However, white voters in that age group leaned toward Trump, with him winning 47% to Clinton’s 43%. Young Black voters, on the other hand, voted for Clinton 85-9, and young Latinos went for Clinton 68-26. \n\nIn 2020, Biden did even better with young voters, 60% to Trump’s 36%, but Trump won young white voters by more this time: from 4 points in 2016 to 9 points in 2020. Biden did slightly improve on Clinton’s numbers among young Black voters while holding steady among young Latinos. \n\nIndeed, men brought down the Democrats’ margins across the board in 2020. That year, Trump won white women by 11 points and white men by 23 points, while Biden won Black women by 81 points and Black men by 60 points. And Biden won Latino men by 23 points but Latinas by 39 points. \n\nWhile there is no public exit-poll data that ties in sex, age, and race all together, it’s clear that this gender gap exists at all age groups. The latest Ipsos poll for the Harvard Public Opinion Project didn’t just find a gaping gender gap among voters ages 18 to 29, but it’s been increasing throughout the cycle. \n\nNotably, the gender gap, which stood at 17 points in the Spring poll, has nearly doubled to 30 points. While both men and women are moving toward Harris, the rate of female support eclipses male support.\n\n Likely male voters: Harris 53% - Trump 36%\n\n Likely female voters: Harris 70% - Trump 23%\n\nGiven his woeful support among young women, Trump appears to have decided to just bypass them and pin his hopes on young men. \n\n“The [Trump] campaign has homed in on a group of undecided voters that makes up 11 percent of the electorate in battleground states, according to an analysis that Trump advisers presented to reporters in August,” The Washington Post reported in September. “Those voters are mostly men under 50 who identify as moderates, and they are predominantly White but include more Latinos and Asian Americans than the general population, said campaign officials.”\n\nProblem is, young men are not exactly the most reliable voters. \n\n“Young women (55%) voted at a higher rate than young men (44%), and that was true for every racial/ethnic group for which we have reliable data,” concluded a 2021 study of the 2020 election by Tuft University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. “According to estimates based on Catalist voter file data, young white women had the highest turnout rate (60%), followed by young Latinas (56%). The gender gap in electoral participation was 7 points among white and Asian American youth, but much more pronounced for Black and Latino youth, among whom there were 16- and 17-point gaps, respectively, between the voter turnout of young men and women.”\n\nAnd there are a few early warning signs regarding Trump’s gamble on young men:\n\nThe data for (very) early voting in Pennsylvania and Michigan shows not just dramatically low voting numbers overall for these young voters relative to the broader electorate, but young men are behind their female counterparts by double digits (14 points in Pennsylvania and 13 points in Michigan, as of Friday morning)—both slightly larger margins than in 2020. But again, this is very early data.\n\nDemocrats have long suffered from their reliance on young voters, the lowest-turnout age demographic. It is kinda funny seeing Republicans now put their eggs in that basket. \n\nYoung men look unlikely to bail out Trump. The effort he’s putting into wooing them may very well be wasted this year. \n\nThat doesn’t negate the problem these young men will give us in the future, though, as they get older and turn out at higher rates. But for now, based on the limited data we have, young men don’t seem to be the source of votes Trump will need to offset the massive pissed-off female electorate. \n\nLet's get to work electing Kamala Harris our next President! Sign up for as many shifts as you can between now and November 5 to talk with progressive voters in key states who might not turn out without hearing from you!","summary":"There’s a new theory of the case for Donald Trump’s path to the White House, and it goes like this: young men. \n\n\n\nAnd it’s based in truth: Young men are drifting rightward, presenting challenges both at home and abroad.

It has since become a centerpiece of the middle-class origin story she has made key to her pitch to voters as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee.\n\nTrump, whose deep affection for the Golden Arches and its offerings is well documented, has meanwhile grown fixated on Harris’ employment there. In interviews and on the campaign trail, he regularly accuses Harris – without evidence – of making up the factoid. His visit to the restaurant is his latest attempt to sow doubt about the Democrat’s work history.\n\n“I’m looking for a job,” Trump said to the owner of the McDonald’s in Feasterville-Trevose on Sunday. “And I’ve always wanted to work at McDonald’s, but I never did. I’m running against somebody that said she did, but it turned out to be a totally phony story.”\n\nHarris has largely ignored Trump, as well as calls from his supporters and inquiries from conservative news outlets to provide proof of her time there. Her campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment about Trump’s accusation and his upcoming visit to McDonald’s.\n\nA campaign official told CNN that Harris worked at a McDonald’s in Alameda, California, during the summer of 1983 when she was still a student at Howard University in Washington. She worked the register and manned the fry and ice cream machines, according to the official.\n\nOn Drew Barrymore’s talk show earlier this year, Harris told the actor, “I did fries. And then I did the cashier.” \n\nAnd as a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris mentioned her work at the fast-food chain while joining striking McDonald’s workers on the picket line.\n\nHer time there was repeatedly referenced onstage at this summer’s Democratic National Convention as her allies contrasted her upbringing with Trump’s upper-class roots. Former President Bill Clinton joked that Harris would “break my record as the president who has spent the most time at McDonald’s.” \n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett asserted that “one candidate worked at McDonald’s,” while “the other was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.”\n\n“Can you simply picture Donald Trump working at a McDonald’s?” said Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “He couldn’t run that damn McFlurry machine if it cost him anything.”\n\nTrump over the years has repeatedly questioned the biographies of his rivals, often without merit. He was one of the loudest voices in the debunked “birther” movement that falsely questioned Barack Obama’s citizenship and eligibility for the White House, eventually leading the Hawaiian-born president to release his long-form birth certificate. During the 2016 Republican primary, Trump pushed an unfounded conspiracy theory that Sen. Ted Cruz’s father aided in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This election cycle, Trump wrongly suggested his Republican primary opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, wasn’t a natural-born US citizen and falsely claimed that Harris has only lately embraced her Black heritage.\n\nYet, even as he lobbed these accusations, Trump littered his own personal story with exaggerations and fabrications. He coined the phrase “truthful hyperbole” in his best-selling autobiography “The Art of the Deal,” an oxymoronic term that nevertheless illustrates his relationship with facts about himself.\n\n“It’s an innocent form of exaggeration,” he wrote, “and a very effective form of promotion.”\n\nDuring a 2007 deposition, lawyers caught Trump lying at least 30 times over two days, mostly over mundane facts about his businesses such as the size of his workforce, a payment for speaking fees and the cost of his golf membership. He also once claimed that he stood on the rubble at ground zero after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and that he paid his workers to clear away the debris, neither of which is backed by public record.\n\nAnd there are multiple accounts of Trump calling reporters under the alias “John Barron,” a supposed executive at his company who once duped a Forbes reporter into inflating Trump’s fortune on the magazine’s list of wealthiest people.\n\nIt’s unclear why Trump has latched on to Harris’ McDonald’s employment or why a visit there was warranted during one of his few remaining weekends before Election Day. But in recent interviews, Trump has suggested that a small detail about his rival’s past shouldn’t be dismissed.\n\n“We would say, well, that’s not a big lie. It’s a huge lie,” Trump said, “because McDonald’s was part of her whole thing.”\n\nTrump also visited a McDonald’s early in his presidential campaign, this one in East Palestine, Ohio, after a train carrying hazardous materials derailed there, sparking an environmental and public health crisis. There, he joked to a woman working the register, “I know this menu better than you do. I probably know it better than anybody in here.”\n\nThe former president has long stated his affinity for fast food. During a 2016 CNN town hall, Trump, a self-described “very clean person,” attributed his preference for their offerings to the quality control, saying, “You’re better off going there than someplace you have no idea where the food is coming from.”\n\n“I think the food is good. I think all of those places, Burger King, McDonald’s, I can live with it,” he added. “The other night I had Kentucky Fried Chicken. Not the worst thing in the world.”\n\nTrump brought that affection into the White House, where he once served Clemson’s national championship football team a smorgasbord of burgers and pizza. His son-in-law Jared Kushner quipped in his autobiography that he knew Trump had turned the corner in his battle with the coronavirus when he requested his favorite McDonald’s order.\n\n“McDonald’s Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, fries and a vanilla shake,” Kushner recounted.\n\nIn an appearance last week on Fox News, Donald Trump Jr. bemoaned that the network in its interview with Harris didn’t ask her which McDonald’s she worked at. He also asserted that his father’s familiarity with the chain’s offerings would surpass the Democratic nominee’s.\n\n“I think my father knows the McDonald’s menu much better than Kamala Harris ever did,” Trump Jr. said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Kristen Holmes, Kate Sullivan and Ebony Davis contributed to this story.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

struggling at the moment.\n\nDespite the pessimistic outlook, ECB president Christine Lagarde said she does not see the eurozone heading into recession and they are \"still looking at a soft landing\". \n\nAccording to the latest international business report from Grant Thornton, which surveyed 10,000 mid-market businesses across 28 economies, just 24% of Irish companies see the ongoing economic uncertainty as a concern which could impact future growth compared to the average across Europe of 47% and globally 52%.\n\nOnly 16% of Irish firms have concerns over geopolitical disruption — which was the lowest rate among the economies studied — compared to a global average of 43%.\n\nThe report notes that the lack of concern among Irish businesses appears to be driven by the belief that geopolitical disruption is unlikely to bring any negative headwinds, despite the upcoming US presidential election in November.\n\nDonald Trump has promised to introduce significant tariffs on imports should he win. \n\nThese tariffs could have a big impact on Irish exports considering the US is a major market.\n\n'Unique picture'\n\nGrant Thornton’s head of deal advisory, Patrick Dillon, said this report paints a “unique picture” of Ireland with medium-sized firms paying relatively little heed to “potential economic uncertainty or geopolitical disruption over the months ahead”.\n\n“Perhaps buoyed by the State’s healthy finances, this stands in contrast to our international peers, but we remain remarkably optimistic despite some concerns in relation to increased labour costs as a constraint on future business growth,” he said.\n\nHowever, despite this, the report found a drop in the number of companies reporting a positive outlook for the Irish economy over the next 12 months. \n\nOf the Irish firms surveyed, 66% reported a positive outlook down from 73% recorded in the previous report from the summer.\n\nA key factor in this change was an increase in the number of companies seeing labour costs as a constraint on growth, 44% up from 28%. \n\nAlmost three-quarters of these firms are expecting to pay salary increases over the next 12 months.\n\nThe report found that 44% of firms plan to invest in AI over the next year, with 29% saying they are going to do so as a cost-saving measure. \n\nOf those already investing in AI, 60% see it as a means of improving internal workflows.\n\nIT investment\n\nOnly 50% of Irish mid-market firms plan to increase investment in IT over the next 12 months compared to the global average of 69%. \n\nSimilarly, there is a marked gap in terms of planned investment in research and development, with just 31% of Irish companies surveyed confirming it as a priority compared to 61% of all other firms surveyed.\n\nMr Dillon added that the research shows that Irish companies are “eager to explore leveraging AI to bring about efficiencies and reduce costs”.\n\n“While a significant proportion of firms plan to invest in technology and research and development over the coming 12 months, the level still lags behind the global average,” he said.\n\n“If more medium-sized companies were to flourish, particularly in terms of international expansion, it would be wise for Irish businesses to double down on growth strategies now when the going is good.”","summary":"Only 16% of Irish firms have

would cover the bill.\n\nOnline video of the staged event taken from behind Trump showed customers pulling through the drive-thru and accepting food from the former president, and then a swarm of

president, an apparent attempt to bolster her working class credentials and garner votes from working and middle class people in this campaign, too.\n\nShe also referred to her employment at McDonald's on Drew Barrymore's talk show, and joined the fast food company's striking workers on the picket line in 2019.\n\nTrump's penchant for McDonald's is also well known and dates back to his first presidential run. His interest in Harris's employment at McDonald's and the role it plays in her political narrative seems to have taken on an outsize role in Trump's campaign with just a few weeks left before Election Day.\n\nTrump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of Harris' claim of employment at McDonald's and has accused the vice president, without evidence, of making it up.\n\n\"I'm looking for a job,\" Trump told the owner of the McDonald's in Feasterville-Trevose, Pa., on Sunday. \"And I've always wanted to work at McDonald's, but I never did. I'm running against somebody that said she did, but it turned out to be a totally phony story,\" he alleged of Harris's employment record. The vice president has largely ignored Trump's statements.\n\nHer time as a McDonald's employee has become a prominent part of the political narrative in this election dating back to the Democratic National Convention, when it seemed to take on a life of its own.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton joked that Harris would \"break my record as the president who has spent the most time at McDonald's.\"\n\n\"Can you simply picture Donald Trump working at a McDonald's?\" said Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \"He couldn't run that damn McFlurry machine if it cost him anything.\"\n\nTrump has suggested that while her employment record as a younger person working to make ends meet may seem insignificant, he has argued otherwise, and that it should not be dismissed.\n\n\"We would say, well, that's not a big lie. It's a huge lie,\" Trump has said in recent interviews,\" because McDonald's was part of her whole thing.\"\n\nDuring the network's recent interview with Harris, Donald Trump Jr. criticized Fox News for not asking Harris which McDonald's she worked at earlier in her life.\n\nSeeming to embrace his father's penchant for the fast food chain rather than become defensive, Trump, Jr. said that his father's knowledge of the McDonald's menu far surpasses hers.\n\n\"I think my father knows the McDonald's menu much better than Kamala Harris ever did,\" Trump Jr. said.","summary":"With the presidential race coming down to several swing states, former president and GOP hopeful Donald Trump donned an apron, served up fries and held a impromptu press conference in a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/10/20/trump-serves-fries-at-mcdonalds-questions-harris-record/7701729463459/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7701729463459/2024/upi/f904d755eeb7e809cc5a7f9a124e232a/v1.2/Trump-dons-McDonalds-apron-in-Pennsylvania-questions-Harris-record.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 22:53:40","author":"Mark Moran","authors":["Mark Moran"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":260435354,"title":"Cheryl Hines breaks silence on RFK Jr. marriage after Olivia Nuzzi sexting scandal: ‘Lots of emotions’","text":"Cheryl Hines revealed she is writing a book about the “rumors” she and her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have dealt with amid his alleged sexting scandal with political reporter Olivia Nuzzi.\n\n“Lots of emotions with rumors!” the actress told Us Weekly at Saturday’s Groundlings 50th Anniversary Event in Los Angeles while wearing her wedding ring.\n\n“But, it will all be in my book. I’m writing a book. I’ve been taking notes — serious notes!”\n\nAmid the gossip surrounding her 10-year marriage, Hines shared she’s focused on having “a lot of fun with [her] family.”\n\n“They’re fun. I mean, if I had a boring family it would be tough,” she said. “And I think just trying to embrace the unknown and instead of fighting against it, sort of trying to embrace it and just say yes to whatever comes your way.”\n\nThe “RV” star explained she’s trying to focus on the “little moments and not take anything too seriously.”\n\n“Even though I find myself in very serious situations!” Hines, 59, added.\n\nHines shares 20-year-old daughter Catherine Rose with ex-husband Paul Young, while Kennedy, 70, has children Bobby, 40, Kathleen, 36, Conor, 30, Kyra, 29, Willian, 26, and Aidan, 23, from previous relationships. \n\nElsewhere in the interview, the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star also opened up about the secret to a long-lasting marriage and moving past the “crazy” moments with her husband. \n\n“There has to be a connection,” she told Us Weekly.\n\n“There’s a connection that you look at your husband or your partner and all the crazy going on around you, or you look and you check in and it’s like, ‘OK. It’s going to be OK. We’re going to move through this moment.'”\n\nShe continued, “And, you know, a lot of times it’s funny and you can lean over and say, ‘This is crazy balls,’ and have a moment together and then hold your head up high and go to the next thing.”\n\nHines also reflected on the start of her romance with Kennedy in 2011, explaining they’ve learned how to roll with life’s curveballs.\n\n“When I met Bobby, I said, ‘You never wanted to go into politics?’ and he said, ‘No, I feel like I can do more work as an environmental attorney and I don’t have to. I’m not beholden to companies or corporations,” she explained. \n\n“I was like, ‘Great. This is going to be great!’ And then life gives you a left turn, a right turn, however it turns out to be.”\n\nLast year, RFK Jr. launched his 2024 presidential bid, but he withdrew from the election in August and endorsed Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nHines acknowledged that although politics can lead to many mixed feelings, she doesn’t allow her husband’s career to interfere with their connection.\n\n“People have a lot of feelings about politics, especially in Hollywood, and I don’t know,” she told the outlet. “I mean, so far I feel like it’s OK.\n\n“I’m OK to have conversations like that with people and, to me, it doesn’t define somebody. To some people it does and it’s like you can’t control it. There’s nothing I can do about it, so I have to let it wash over me.”\n\nHines and Kennedy tied the knot in 2014 after nearly three years of dating. \n\nThe “Waitress” star’s comments about Kennedy come after he made headlines for his alleged affair with Nuzzi, a 31-year-old political correspondent for New York Magazine. \n\nNuzzi admitted to having a relationship with Kennedy after he allegedly told people about the “intimate” photos she texted him\n\nThe scandal led Nuzzi to be suspended from her job and her fiancé Ryan Lizza to break up with her.\n\nHines, meanwhile, has since put on a united front with Kennedy despite being photographed sans her ring when the news broke.","summary":"Robert F.

Her duties reportedly included working the register and the french fry and ice cream machines.\n\n\"I’ve now worked for 15 minutes more than Kamala,\" Trump said during his McDonald's visit, according to the Inquirer.\n\nTrump responded to reporters' questions during his McDonald's visit.

These people work hard,” Trump said, via the Post. \"They’re great. And I just saw something — a process that’s beautiful.\"\n\nThe Feasterville McDonald's location that Trump went to was reportedly closed for normal business during his visit, and it's unclear how the drive-thru customers that Trump served were selected. \n\nIn a statement to NBC10, the Feasterville McDonald's owner and operator, Derek Giacomantonio, said that he decided to participate in the Trump campaign event because: \"It is a fundamental value of my organization that we proudly open our doors to everyone who visits the Feasterville community.\"\n\nA crowd lined the street outside the McDonald's that Trump visited, the Associated Press reported. Later on Sunday, Trump was slated to attend a town hall in Lancaster before heading to the Pittsburgh Steelers home game against the New York Jets. Pennsylvania is a key swing state that has voted for the winning president in 10 of the last 12 elections.\n\nHarris spokesperson Ian Sams responded to Trump's actions via a statement to NBC News.\n\n\"When Trump feels desperate, all he knows how to do is lie,\" Sams said. \"He can’t understand what it’s like to have a summer job because he was handed millions on a silver platter, only to blow it.\"\n\nTrump has long been a public fan of the fast food franchise.

American entrepreneur and holding company CEO Sardar Biglari is the publication’s owner and editor-in-chief. \n\n‘Catering to the modern man with content that promises to seduce, entertain and continuously surprise readers,’ the magazine’s website reads. \n\nMaxim wrote in 2018: ‘MAXIM creates an unparalleled luxury experience that’s part fantasy, part aspirational and part attainable. \n\n‘MAXIM embodies the life of an exceptional man.’\n\nTrump-loving MAXIM fans took to the comment section to give their stamps of approval to the risqué magazine’s political announcement.\n\n‘And you just lost zero fans. Probably gained some,’ said one satisfied X user. \n\nPeople discussed how this endorsement may reflect a changing political climate, with one comment reading ‘people are no longer scared to come out and endorse Trump and I’m here for it.’\n\nWhile others got a different take-away from the X post.\n\n‘Sexy girls like Trump! That’s all you need to know, folks!!!’, someone wrote.\n\nAnother fan said: ‘Awesome. You guys have great taste.’ \n\nBut not everyone was amused by the choice, as many skeptics voiced their opinions too.\n\n‘You’re not even relevant. Because of decisions like this,’ one user said.\n\nAnother agreed: ‘Maxim hasn’t been relevant in 20 year.’ \n\n‘I’m so glad I’ve never picked up a copy of this magazine,’ someone chimed in. \n\nMAXIM released its endorsement just as Harris’ voter support seems to be declining. \n\nTrump has rocketed to 17 percentage point lead in the betting markets and a one-point lead across the top battleground states. \n\nIf Trump wins Pennsylvania, he stands a 91 percent chance of winning the election, according to polling guru Nate Silver.\n\nA new Fox News poll revealed that Trump is two points ahead of Harris, while a PolyMarket poll predicts that Harris is still in the lead, but Trump’s chances of winning skyrocketed last week from 13 percent to 36 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the same poll, Harris’ chances declined from 71 percent to 63 percent. \n\nThe magazine was founded by Felix Dennis in 1995. It started off in the UK, but has been a New York-based company since 1997.\n\nThe signature words ‘Sex Sports Beer Gadgets Clothes Fitness’ were plastered across the cover of each printed copy before its 2015 rebranding, catering its content to an older, more established audience.\n\n‘Men’s interests have changed and the world has changed,’ Kate Lanphear, the editor-in-chief at the time told the Wall Street Journal about the magazine’s new look. ‘We are trying to respond to the times we live in.’\n\nMaxim reached its peak in the early 2000s, according to Fox News. More than 2.5million people read the magazine.\n\nNow, Maxim mainly publishes online, but subscribers get print copies every two months. They are mainly known for their ‘Hot 100 list’, a list of the world’s prettiest women, chosen by Maxim’s readers.","summary":"A renowned international men&#8217;s magazine has publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president &#8211;&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/global-publication-backs-donald-trump-as-kamala-harris-chances-decrease/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-gets-international-publication-endorsement-as-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 22:13:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.322},{"id":260434598,"title":"Kamala Harris visits church on birthday as Trump repeats ‘enemy within’ rhetoric","text":"Kamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday on the campaign trail on Sunday while Donald Trump doubled down on his dangerous rhetoric labeling Democrats as “enemies from within,” as both candidates tried to shore up support in key states ahead of the US presidential election.\n\nHarris rallied Black voters in Georgia on Sunday with “souls to the polls” visits to two community churches.\n\nHarris’s comments to the congregation of the New Birth Missionary Baptist church in Atlanta focused on how religious experiences in her youth in Oakland, California, influenced her politics. Drawing on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Gospel of Luke, the vice-president argued for policies that embrace compassion.\n\nShe said: “When we come across our brothers and sisters in need, let us, as the Good Samaritan, did see in the face of a stranger, a neighbor, and let us recognize that when we shine the light in moments of darkness, it will guide our feet into the path of peace.\n\n“And let us remember that while weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the morning.”\n\nShe asked: “What kind of country do we want to live in – a country of chaos, fear and hate, or a country of freedom, compassion and justice?”\n\nHarris added: “The great thing about living in a democracy is that we, the people, have the power to answer that question. So let us answer not just through our words, but through our actions and with our votes.”\n\nLater in the day, Stevie Wonder joined Harris at a rally at the Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro. The vice-president was also set to tape an interview with the civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton, to be broadcast later Sunday on MSNBC.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, doubled down on his earlier comments that attacked Democrats as “the enemy from within”, this time specifically denouncing representatives Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff.\n\nDuring an interview with Howard Kurtz on Fox News, broadcast on Sunday, the former president said that “radical left lunatics … the enemy from within … should be very easily handled, if necessary, by the national guard, or if really necessary, by the military” – before singling out Pelosi and Schiff.\n\nSimilar comments made by Trump in the past weeks have sparked widespread concern and raised fears of an authoritarian crackdown if he were to become president again. The Harris campaign was quick to respond to the new comments.\n\n“Even in his Fox News safe space, Donald Trump cannot help but show himself as the unhinged, angry, unstable man that he is – focused on his own petty grievances and tired playbook of division,” Ammar Moussa, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson, wrote in an email.\n\n“This is precisely why his handlers are hiding him from major mainstream interviews and refusing to let him debate again. They don’t want the country to see this candidate in decline,” he added.\n\nAlso taking the stage on Sunday was Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X who has thrown his weight behind Trump. Musk attended a town hall at the Roxian Theater in Pittsburgh, carrying a yellow “terrible towel” of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city’s beloved NFL team, and jumping up and down as the crowd chanted his name.\n\nIn a short speech, Musk repeated false and fear-mongering claims, telling attendees “the constitution is literally under attack”.\n\nHe then issued his second check for a million dollars to a signatory of his petition backing the first and second amendment.\n\nMusk announced on Saturday that America Pac, his Trump-allied political action committee, will give $1m every day until the presidential election to someone who signs the petition. The pledge appears to be a way to incentivize Republicans in battleground states to register to vote.\n\nAnd also on Sunday, Democratic governors from three states in the so-called blue wall that is key to their party’s aspirations for an electoral college victory delivered their closing pitches for Harris.\n\nJosh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer barnstormed the Sunday morning political shows to talk up the vice-president’s policy agenda – and highlight differences with Trump, 16 days before an election that polls suggest is still on a knife edge.\n\n“I don’t want to go back to Donald Trump when he was in charge of the country,” Shapiro told NBC’s Meet the Press.\n\n“Remember the record? I know there’s still some people that have maybe a little brain fog, they don’t remember what it was like under Donald Trump. You had more chaos, you had less jobs, and you had a whole lot less freedom.\n\n“I don’t think we want to go back to a time of chaos. I want a stable, strong leader, and that’s Kamala Harris.”\n\n“Both candidates believe that Pennsylvania is critical – I just think we’ve got a better candidate, a better message, and what we’re experiencing is a whole lot more energy,” Shapiro said.\n\nIn Michigan, according to Whitmer, voters were comparing both candidates’ records ahead of the 5 November election.\n\n“While this is going to be close, I’d much rather be playing our hand in theirs,” she said. “We got a better candidate. We’ve got receipts on the issues that matter to the American people, on the economy, individual rights, affordable housing, and we got a better ground game.”\n\nIt also emerged Sunday that Harris has no plans to campaign with Joe Biden before election day on 5 November, a development appearing to confirm recent reports of friction between the two after the 81-year-old president was pressured out of running for re-election over age-related questions.\n\n“The most important role he can play is doing his job as president,” an anonymous White House official told NBC News, which said the decision was mutual following discussions between the campaign and Biden administration officials.\n\nRepublicans appearing on the Sunday talk shows attempted to detract from Trump’s comments and other recent behavior, including suggesting in an interview this week he would use the US military against political enemies.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, were trying to control the message after Trump’s extraordinary and vulgar rhetoric during a Saturday night rally in Pennsylvania, when he called Harris a “shit vice-president” and exalted the size of the late golfer Arnold Palmer’s penis.\n\nThe South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham lost his composure when questioned about it on NBC’s Meet the Press – and tried to pivot to two recent assassination attempts on Trump, both conducted by pro-Republican persons.\n\n“When you talk about rhetoric, you gotta remember they tried to blow his head off,” Graham said. “And another guy tried to kill him … so I’m not overly impressed about the rhetoric game here.”\n\nGraham also condemned Republican colleagues, including Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, as well as numerous ex-Trump administration officials who have denounced him and expressed support for Harris.\n\nThe House speaker, Mike Johnson, was more restrained – but equally as determined to avoid questions about Trump’s commentary in an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, suggesting that it was host Jake Tapper who was obsessed with talking about Palmer’s penis.\n\n“The media can pick it apart, but people are going to vote what’s best for their family and they see that in Trump,” he said.\n\nEarly in-person voting is under way in numerous states, with voters in Georgia setting a first-day turnout record on Tuesday, even as polls have the candidates in a virtual dead heat.","summary":"Democratic nominee celebrates 60th birthday with call for compassion, while rival continues attacks on opponents\n\n\nUS politics – latest updatesKamala Harris celebrated her 60th birthday on the campaign trail on Sunday while Donald Trump doubled down on his dangerous rhetoric labeling Democrats as “enemies from within,” as both candidates tried to shore up support in key states ahead of the US presidential election.\n\nHarris rallied Black voters in Georgia on Sunday with “souls to the polls” visits to two community churches.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/20/kamala-harris-campaigns-trump-arnold-palmer","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5f8b46a9bd720b694b39e8b18b16b99df20bf9b/0_258_8640_5184/master/8640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 22:13:00","author":"George Chidi,Oliver Laughland,Richard Luscombe","authors":["George Chidi","Oliver Laughland","Richard Luscombe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.364},{"id":260434992,"title":"Gov. Shapiro calls Musk's $1M offer to Pennsylvania voters 'deeply concerning'","text":"Elon Musk — the billionaire tech founder and supporter of former President Donald Trump — is giving away $1 million to a Pennsylvanian each day until Nov. 5. Two people have already won the prize money after signing Musk's America PAC petition backing the Constitution. \n\nThe sweepstakes is raising concerns among election law experts and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who formerly served as the state’s attorney general. Shapiro is also a surrogate for Vice President Harris’ campaign.\n\n\"I think it’s something that law enforcement should take a look at,\" Shapiro said on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday. \"I’m not the attorney general anymore of Pennsylvania, I’m the governor, but it does raise serious questions.\"\n\nMusk announced the $1 million giveaway at an event in Harrisburg, Pa., on Saturday. The event was part of a tour supporting Trump. \n\n“I have a surprise for you,\" Musk said shortly before bringing out a giant check. \"We are going to be awarding $1 million to people who have signed the petition — every day, from now until the election.”\n\nPennsylvania is a crucial swing state this election that both Trump and Harris are campaigning hard in.\n\nUCLA election law professor Richard Hasen said that on its face, there's nothing illegal about a petition sweepstakes. But a closer look raises red flags for him.\n\n\"If you look at the conditions, you must be a registered voter,\" Hasen said. \"And so this is essentially a lottery that's open only to people who register to vote. So it's either an incentive for someone to vote or it's a reward. And either way, it violates federal law.\"\n\nHe calls Musk's actions \"clearly illegal\" because it violates statute 52 U.S.C. 10307(c) and the DOJ's election manual. \n\n\"When people vote, it should be of their free choice and they should not be voting for financial incentives that would work the electorate,\" Hasen said of federal election law. \"It would change the nature of voting if people were voting purely for a personal financial incentive, rather than making the choice whether or not to register to vote, whether or not to vote, and for whom.\"\n\nMusk said the goal of the sweepstakes is to \"maximize awareness of our petition to support the Constitution.\" On Sunday, the billionaire awarded a second giant check for $1 million to a petition signer. \n\nThe signers pledge their support for the First and Second amendments, specifically freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. \n\nPennsylvania’s deadline to register to vote is on Monday. \n\nMusk's America PAC did not immediately respond to NPR when asked about the legality of the giveaway. \n\nHasen said willful violation of statute 52 U.S.C. 10307(c) comes with a $10,000 fine and up to five years in prison.\n\n\"I don't think it would be likely that he would suffer such a serious fine,\" Hasen said of Musk. \"Although, if he was warned that this is illegal activity and continued to do it, I think that would create a different kind of situation.\"","summary":"Trump supporter Elon Musk says the daily prize money is meant to “support the Constitution,” but an election law expert calls it “clearly illegal.”","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/20/g-s1-29118/trump-elon-musk-pennsylvania-voters","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4706x3142+0+0/resize/4706x3142!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2F3b%2Fefd47da84e89b4c30f662440b4b6%2Fap24291780688069.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-20 22:11:46","author":"Luke Garrett","authors":["Luke Garrett"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072}]}
