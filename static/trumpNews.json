In a statement, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the meeting “holds the promise of bringing to an end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and opening up the prospects for peace.” Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated message to world leaders that “this is not an era of war,” Jaiswal said India “endorses the upcoming summit meeting and stands ready to support these efforts.” The Alaska summit will be the first presidential-level meeting between the US and Russia since 2021, when former US President Joe Biden met Putin in Geneva. Trump announced the upcoming talks earlier on Saturday, describing them as part of his push to broker peace in the three-year-old conflict. Ahead of the meeting, Trump suggested that any peace deal could involve “swapping some territories,” saying the arrangement would be “to the betterment of both” sides. “Nothing easy,” he added, “but we’re gonna get some back, we’re gonna get some switched.” The comments drew a sharp response from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who rejected any plan involving territorial concessions or excluding Ukraine from negotiations. “Any decisions that are made without Ukraine are decisions against peace,” Zelensky said on Telegram. “They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They will never work.” For India, a peace agreement between the US, Russia, and Ukraine would not only end hostilities but could also neutralize the threat of secondary US sanctions over New Delhi’s energy imports from Moscow. The MEA reiterated that Prime Minister Modi has consistently urged both Putin and Western leaders to seek a peaceful resolution, stressing that diplomacy and dialogue remain the only viable path forward.","summary":"Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said India “endorses the upcoming summit meeting and stands ready to support these efforts.”","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/news/current-affairs/india-welcomes-usrussia-summit-in-alaska-1896600","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/08/10/1946461-aa-5286957.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 01:26:42","author":"Dc Web Desk","authors":["Dc Web Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":349699208,"title":"How Kentucky bourbon went from boom to bust","text":"But like most market bubbles, this one was bound to burst. The pandemic's lockdowns tanked bar sales, and inflation has made many would-be bourbon drinkers choose less expensive options - or forgo drinking all together. Amongst Gen-Z, many 20-somethings are drinking less than their older siblings and parents did at their age.\n\nThose factors have contributed to declining alcohol sales, with bourbon sales specifically slowing down to just 2% between 2021-2024, according to ISWR data. \n\nPresident Donald Trump's global tariffs have been the final straw. The EU has announced retaliatory tariffs against US goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Californian wine, although implementation has been delayed for six months.\n\nMeanwhile, most provinces in Canada have stopped importing American alcoholic beverages in retaliation. The country accounts for about 10% of Kentucky's $9bn (£6.7bn) whiskey and bourbon business. \n\n\"That's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves ... that's a very disproportionate response,\" Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze.\n\nTrump has said that tariffs will boost made-in-American businesses.\n\nBut Republican Senator Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, said the tariffs will hurt local businesses and consumers in his home state.\n\n\"Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it's always passed through as a cost. So, there will be higher prices,\" he told ABC's \"This Week\" in May.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglnk6yxlko","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c554/live/f97d4d10-74b0-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 01:13:58","author":"Robin Levinson King","authors":["Robin Levinson King"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":349703618,"title":"Huge TV star 'signs six-month Good Morning Britain deal' as ITV prepares major shake-up","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuge TV star 'signs six-month Good Morning Britain deal' as ITV prepares major shake-up\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy RUTH FRANCIS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:15 BST, 10 August 2025 |Updated:02:07 BST, 10 August 2025 \n\nGood Morning Britain star Richard Madeley has reportedly agreed to a short-term deal to stay on the ITV breakfast sofa as bosses prepare a cost-cutting overhaul.\nThe veteran broadcaster, 69, has signed a six-month contract thought to begin in September, as part of a temporary arrangement while ITV reviews its presenter line-up.\nIt comes ahead of a major reshuffle in January which is expected to see some familiar faces axed in a bid to save millions.\nA source told The Sun that Richard - one of the programme’s best-known hosts - has not been offered a long-term commitment.\nThey revealed: 'Richard is one of the biggest names on the show but even he hasn’t been offered a long-term deal.\n'He’s signed for six more months and will then re-consider how the show looks. As things stand, almost every prominent face on the show is in talks.\n\nGood Morning Britain star Richard Madeley has reportedly agreed to a short-term deal to stay on the ITV breakfast sofa as bosses prepare a cost-cutting overhaul\n'Some are going to go in the reshuffle, so it will depend on who rates well with focus groups and how much money each of them is insisting on.'\nIt had previously been reported in May that Richard’s position was under review before he reached a part-time agreement with bosses.\nThe Daily Mail have contacted ITV and Richard Madeley's representatives for comment. \nITV chiefs are said to be weighing presenter popularity in focus groups against salary demands as they decide who stays.\nOnly lead anchor Susanna Reid, 54, is guaranteed a longer-term deal. \nOther regulars include Ed Balls, Robert Rinder and Kate Garraway, while Martin Lewis and other stand-ins rotate through the schedule.\nThe shake-up comes as ITV embarks on a drastic restructure, with plans to halve the daytime workforce at ITV Studios.\nBosses are also set to trim other shows, with Lorraine to be cut to just 30 minutes and broadcast for only 30 weeks a year.\n\nThe veteran broadcaster, 69, has signed a six-month contract thought to begin in September, as part of a temporary arrangement while ITV reviews its presenter line-up\n\nIt comes ahead of a major reshuffle in January which is expected to see some familiar faces axed in a bid to save millions\n\nITV chiefs are said to be weighing presenter popularity in focus groups against salary demands as they decide who stays (pictured l-r) Charlotte Hawkins, Adil Ray, Richard Madeley, Susanna Reid, Kate Garraway, Ed Balls and Ranvir Singh\n\n Only lead anchor Susanna Reid, 54, (pictured right) is guaranteed a longer-term deal\n\n ITV bosses 'plan major Coronation Street and Emmerdale shake-up' as '1 in 10 cast members face axe' \nThe new regime, set to come into effect in January, will cost a potential 300 staff members their jobs as a consultation period begins, thought to last until September, before employees are finally let go in December.\nA source told The Sun: 'The tension is unbearable. There's a lot of rage towards This Morning, which everyone feels is constantly favoured despite it being the lame duck of the daytime flock.\n'There's a feeling that Loose Women and Lorraine are delivering resilient, solid ratings while This Morning is always in the Press for its tumbling viewing figures. Loose Women is even winning awards.\n'Never mind the Phillip Schofield scandal and then Holly Willoughby leaving, This Morning is like the black sheep and yet that's the show that is not facing any cuts.\n\nIn May, ITV announced there would also be dramatic changes to Lorraine Kelly's show slashed from an hour to 30 minutes and, like Loose Women, will only air 30 weeks of the year (pictured host Kaye Adams (L), guests Oti Mabuse and Myleene Klass (middle) and panelist Nadia Sawalha (R) in July 2025)\n\n'Everyone is absolutely furious that This Morning has got away with it yet again.'\nA source added that some of the older members of the ITV presenting teams are worried that bosses will favour younger stars for the roles that are left.\nDaily Mail contacted ITV for comment at the time.\nThe changes follow a slump in profits, with ITV reporting a 30 per cent fall in earnings in the first half of this year.\nRichard Madeley\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHuge TV star 'signs six-month Good Morning Britain deal' as ITV prepares major shake-up\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

When Presidents Trump and Putin meet in Alaska on Friday, they will be on territory which was once part of the Russian Empire. Moscow sold it to Washington in 1867 for a bargain price, partly because they were afraid that either Britain or the USA would grab it anyway if they did not.\n\nBut since the aggressive horrors of the Second World War, there has been a general agreement that we should leave borders – above all in Europe – where they are.\n\nMost especially, we should not reward the illegal seizure of ground by armed force.\n\nThis is a good principle, though it has been bent, if not actually broken, since the founding of the UN in San Francisco 80 years ago. Now it is being tested very severely.\n\nVladimir Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine was, and remains, a bloody and destructive action which should live in infamy. Thanks to wartime secrecy on both sides, we do not know the true scale of the horror, only that it is great. War deaths and other casualties are state secrets, and we can only guess at their size by looking at satellite pictures of the vast graveyards on either side of the frontline.\n\nCivilians, too, have suffered appallingly. Multitudes have become destitute refugees. Ukraine’s economic sinews have been mangled and maimed by cynical Russian bombing, clearly intended to drive a once-prosperous country back into the pre-industrial age.\n\nDonald Trump, very reasonably, wants to stop these miseries and he has made it plain to Putin that he will hit the Russian economy where it hurts if he carries on with his aggression.\n\nBut the lonely despot in the Kremlin is demanding a heavy price in return, especially the surrender of large slices of territory and the end of Ukraine’s Nato ambitions.\n\nMr Trump has spoken rather bafflingly of ‘some swapping of territories to the betterment of both’. But Ukraine does not hold any significant Russian territory, while Russia has seized large portions of Ukraine and continues to eat away at its land each week.\n\nEven now, no more than 38 per cent of Ukraine’s population would even consider ceding some of that land for peace.\n\nThis is a big softening since 2023, but many of the remaining 62 per cent will always remain resolutely opposed to any such thing, and Ukraine’s President Zelensky is among them. He is rightly suspicious of any talks which exclude him from the table.\n\nIt is rumoured that Putin has offered a ceasefire in return for Ukraine handing over the eastern territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. But this is plainly not the end of his demands. Any such armistice would trigger more talks on the rest of the land Russia has grabbed – talks which Zelensky would rightly fear.\n\nUkraine cannot easily fight off new Russian gains without the support of the USA and Europe’s Nato powers. But America and Europe alike are worried that they must choose between a shabby deal or a much more intensive and dangerous war with Russia.\n\nIt is a nasty mess.\n\nCredit must go to Donald Trump for continuing to try to resolve it. We must all wish and hope for a just and lasting peace. But with the current balance of forces, it is very hard to see how such a compromise can be reached.","summary":"Borders can change.

While it’s still too early to fully assess the long-term impact of the United States’ political shift when it comes to global cooperation on climate change, there are signs that a new set of leaders is rising to the occasion.\n\nWorld responds to another US withdrawal\n\nThe U.S. first committed to the Paris Agreement in a joint an-nouncement by President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping in 2015. At the time, the U.S. agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and pledged finan-cial support to help developing countries adapt to climate risks and embrace renewable energy.\n\nSome people praised the U.S. engagement, while others criti-cized the original commitment as too weak. Since then, the U.S. has cut emissions by 17.2% below 2005 levels – missing the goal, in part because its efforts have been stymied along the way.\n\nJust two years after the land-mark Paris Agreement, Trump stood in the Rose Garden in 2017 and announced he was withdraw-ing the U.S. from the treaty, citing concerns that jobs would be lost, that meeting the goals would be an economic burden, and that it wouldn’t be fair because China, the world’s largest emitter today, wasn’t projected to start reducing its emissions for several years.\n\nScientists and some politicians and business leaders were quick to criticize the decision, calling it “shortsighted” and “reckless.” Some feared that the Paris Agree-ment, signed by almost every country, would fall apart.\n\nBut it did not.\n\nIn the United States, business-es such as Apple, Google, Micro-soft and Tesla made their own pledges to meet the Paris Agree-ment goals.\n\nHawaii passed legislation to become the first state to align with the agreement. A coalition of U.S. cities and states banded to-gether to form the United States Climate Alliance to keep working to slow climate change.\n\nGlobally, leaders from Italy, Germany and France rebutted Trump’s assertion that the Paris Agreement could be renegotiat-ed. Others from Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand dou-bled down on their own support of the global climate accord. In 2020, President Joe Biden brought the U.S. back into the agreement.\n\nNow, with Trump pulling the U.S. out again – and taking steps to eliminate U.S. climate policies, boost fossil fuels and slow the growth of clean energy at home – other countries are stepping up.\n\nOn July 24, 2025, China and the European Union issued a joint statement vowing to strengthen their climate targets and meet them. They alluded to the U.S., referring to “the fluid and tur-bulent international situation today” in saying that “the major economies … must step up efforts to address climate change.”\n\nIn some respects, this is a strength of the Paris Agreement – it is a legally nonbinding agree-ment based on what each country decides to commit to. Its flexibili-ty keeps it alive, as the withdraw-al of a single member does not trigger immediate sanctions, nor does it render the actions of oth-ers obsolete.\n\nThe agreement survived the first U.S. withdrawal, and so far, all signs point to it surviving the second one.\n\nWho’s filling the leadership vacuum\n\nFrom what I’ve seen in inter-national climate meetings and my team’s research, it appears that most countries are moving forward.\n\nOne bloc emerging as a pow-erful voice in negotiations is the Like-Minded Group of Develop-ing Countries – a group of low-and middle-income countries that includes China, India, Bo-livia and Venezuela. Driven by economic development concerns, these countries are pressuring the developed world to meet its commitments to both cut emis-sions and provide financial aid to poorer countries.\n\nChina, motivated by economic and political factors, seems to be happily filling the climate power vacuum created by the U.S. exit.\n\nIn 2017, China voiced disap-pointment over the first U.S. with-drawal. It maintained its climate commitments and pledged to con-tribute more in climate finance to other developing countries than the U.S. had committed to – US$3.1 billion compared with $3 billion.\n\nThis time around, China is us-ing leadership on climate change in ways that fit its broader strate-gy of gaining influence and eco-nomic power by supporting eco-nomic growth and cooperation in developing countries. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has scaled up renewable energy exports and development in oth-er countries, such as investing in solar power in Egypt and wind energy development in Ethiopia.\n\nWhile China is still the world’s largest coal consumer, it has ag-gressively pursued investments in renewable energy at home, in-cluding solar, wind and electri-fication. In 2024, about half the renewable energy capacity built worldwide was in China.\n\nWhile it missed the deadline to submit its climate pledge due this year, China has a goal of peak-ing its emissions before 2030 and then dropping to net-zero emis-sions by 2060. It is continuing major investments in renewable energy, both for its own use and for export. The U.S. government, in contrast, is cutting its support for wind and so-lar power. China also just expanded its carbon mar-ket to encourage emis-sions cuts in the cement, steel and aluminum sec-tors.\n\nThe British govern-ment has also ratcheted up its climate commit-ments as it seeks to be-come a clean energy superpower. In 2025, it pledged to cut emissions 77% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Its new pledge is also more trans-parent and specific than in the past, with details on how specific sectors, such as power, transportation, construction and agricul-ture, will cut emissions. And it contains stronger commitments to provide funding to help develop-ing countries grow more sustainably.\n\nIn terms of corporate leadership, while many American businesses are being quieter about their efforts, in order to avoid sparking the ire of the Trump administration, most appear to be continuing on a green path – despite the lack of federal support and diminished rules.\n\nUSA Today and Statista’s “America’s Climate Leader List” includes about 500 large compa-nies that have reduced their car-bon intensity – carbon emissions divided by revenue – by 3% from the previous year. The data shows that the list is growing, up from about 400 in 2023.\n\nWhat to watch at the 2025 climate talks\n\nThe Paris Agreement isn’t go-ing anywhere. Given the agree-ment’s design, with each country voluntarily setting its own goals, the U.S. never had the power to drive it into obsolescence.\n\nThe question is if developed and developing country leaders alike can navigate two pressing needs – economic growth and eco-logical sustainability – without compromising their leadership on climate change.\n\nThis year’s U.N. climate confer-ence in Brazil, COP30, will show how countries intend to move for-ward and, importantly, who will lead the way.\n\nShannon Gibson is Professor of Environmental Studies, Po-litical Science and International Relations, USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.\n\nResearch assistant Emerson Damiano, a recent graduate in environmental studies at USC, contributed to this article.\n\nSource: THE CONVERSATION (https://theconversation.com), July 30, 2025.","summary":"&#8230; US government may be abandoning the global climate fight, but new leaders are filling the void – including China.

Here's how they're going to do it: TOM LEONARD","text":"It’s difficult to mistake the southern drawl of one of Hollywood’s best-loved film actors – although the sentiment he’s expressing certainly wouldn’t find much favour in Tinseltown.\n\n‘You ever wonder if this industry of ours is just chasing its own tail?’ asks Woody Harrelson.\n\n‘No, I don’t wonder,’ comes the reply in the equally unmissable tones of fellow actor Matthew McConaughey. ‘Restrictions, regulations, nickel-and-diming productions, political lectures: Hollywood is a flat circle. Round and round, like a record with the sound off.’\n\n‘So, what: you want to turn the record off?’ asks Harrelson.\n\n‘No,’ McConaughey replies. ‘I just want to change the tune.’\n\nThis world-weary exchange is delivered at the start of a four-minute promotional film called True To Texas.\n\nFilmed as the pair drive down a sun-scorched desert highway, the clip pays homage to their celebrated turn as hard-bitten police detectives in the gritty 2014 HBO drama series True Detective. But the stars, who are close friends, didn’t shoot this scene simply out of nostalgia.\n\nHarrelson – who rose to fame playing bartender Woody in US sitcom Cheers – and McConaughey – who won an Oscar for his role as a cowboy with Aids in the 2013 drama Dallas Buyers Club – are both born-and-bred Texans.\n\nAnd, when it comes to resisting the herd-like ‘group think’ of Hollywood, both have inherited the Lone Star State’s famous commitment to independence.\n\nWith the True To Texas campaign, they are adding their backing to an entertainment revolution that would have seemed unthinkable a decade ago: to topple Left-wing Hollywood’s century-old reign and establish the red state as a movie-making rival to true-blue California.\n\nNeither Harrelson nor McConaughey are card-carrying Democrats – both have identified as centrists – and they are now joining forces with fellow Texans Dennis Quaid and Renee Zellweger, and Texas enthusiast Billy Bob Thornton, as well as local legislators.\n\nMcConaughey, who has been weighing up launching his own political career and running as state governor, ended the campaign’s promo film – released earlier this year – with a challenge to Texas politicians: ‘So what do you say . . . you don’t like what Hollywood’s been dishing? Let’s take over the kitchen, yeah!’\n\nIt worked. In June, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed SB22, a sweeping film and TV incentive Bill, into law.\n\nIt earmarks $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) of state funds over the next decade to attract big-budget productions to Texas, although the money will come with strings attached. To the alarm of Left-wingers, the likely Republican state governor will be able to veto what projects get subsidised.\n\nApplicants will have to show their film or TV show upholds ‘standards of decency and respect’. That will inevitably be determined by conservative politicians who have said that they intend to use the legislation to ‘export Texas values’ – the antithesis of wokery. \n\nAdditional subsidies will be available for ‘faith-based’ productions and those that promote family values or ‘favourable Texas characteristics’, whatever those are.\n\nInsiders have suggested that divisive social issues such as abortion, gun rights, illegal immigration, drug legalisation and transgenderism – just the sort of themes Hollywood loves to propagandise – will be heavily policed by Texas’s conservative leaders. Other states, such as Louisiana and Georgia, as well as countries including the UK have also\n\nbeen able to undercut Hollywood by offering more generous financial incentives, but some believe big ol’ Texas, whose economy is booming like no other state, truly has the heft to challenge La La Land.\n\nMany tech companies, including electric car giant Tesla and computer manufacturer Hewlett- Packard, have already decamped from California to Texas, while rich investors including billionaire businessman Ross Perot Jr reportedly want to invest in boosting the local movie industry.\n\nPanicked California politicians have belatedly started throwing subsidies at the film industry, but that often isn’t enough for production companies who have fled Los Angeles in droves to make movies and TV shows in parts of the world that offer not only better tax breaks but substantially less red tape.\n\nThe exodus has further weakened Hollywood’s hold on the industry, say insiders, because actors and crew no longer have to live near the studios in LA.\n\nThis spring, actor and 1980s heartthrob Rob Lowe accused California’s complacent leaders of allowing the industry to come close to collapse.\n\n‘It’s cheaper to bring 100 people to Ireland than to walk across the lot at Fox,’ he wailed, explaining why his game show, The Floor, was made near Dublin and not in LA.\n\nSome have predicted that Hollywood – also increasingly vulnerable to climate disasters such as wildfires and floods – may become ‘the next Detroit’, a reference to the once-booming home of the US car industry but now one of America’s most depressed cities. \n\nMeanwhile, Texas governor Abbott has left little doubt that he sees the production incentive Bill as a political weapon: a means to ‘divert film-making from California and provide it through the lens of traditional American values’. He added: ‘Hollywood’s Leftist, woke ideology is polluting the minds of Americans. It’s time to end it.’\n\nAnd in that mission, he has some potentially very useful allies. In his second administration, President Donald Trump has launched a widespread assault on his ideological foes, especially in the media.\n\nAmid this crusade against ‘wokeness’ and the influence of DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) initiatives in the public and private sectors, a group of Right-wing Silicon Valley investors are determined to take the battle to Tinseltown. \n\nThey have started a studio – Founders Films – that will focus on making unapologetically anti-woke movies that evoke a Hollywood era that existed before the industry became in thrall to box-ticking DEI requirements and politically-correct casting and scripts.\n\nThe company is based in Dallas – yes, Texas again – and is backed by a clutch of tech barons linked to Palantir, a controversial tech company which has championed a macho ‘America First’ ethos and whose immensely sophisticated software has been accused of unethically increasing the surveillance powers of the US and UK governments.\n\nPalantir’s most prominent figure, billionaire Peter Thiel, is a pro-Trump conservative libertarian. Founders Films echoes the name of Thiel’s venture-capital business Founders Fund.\n\nIn a pitch sent to investors, Founders Films argues that the ‘American brand is broken. Hollywood is AWOL. Movies have become more ideological, more cautious and less entertaining.’\n\nWith the cinema industry in decline amid the growth of online streaming, Hollywood studios addicted to stultifyingly formulaic sequels and superhero films, and the critics’ aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes awash with terribly- rated films, few people could disagree that the industry could do with a jolt to the system. \n\nAnd few impartial observers could also disagree that Hollywood’s ideological pendulum has in recent years swung wildly to the Left.\n\nStung by past accusations of sexism and racism, the organisers of the Oscars decided in 2020 that Best Picture contenders had to tick various diversity boxes – reforms that were attacked as ‘Orwellian’.\n\nNot that the big Hollywood studios need any encouragement to be more woke, churning out an endless diet of films that lecture audiences on the virtues of social justice, ‘diversity’ and ‘inclusion’.\n\nIn superhero movies such as The Marvels, Eternals and Wonder Woman, female, black and brown heroes regularly have to be seen to be triumphing over the insidious forces of white, male domination.\n\nMake that heterosexual domination, too. The 2021 film Eternals introduced Marvel Comics’ first ever gay superhero.\n\nIt’s relentless. This year’s new Superman star David Corenswet – a fierce Trump critic – highlighted how his planet-saving character is an immigrant (albeit from the planet Krypton rather than Mexico) and sent a rather damning message to Trump’s America about being ‘kinder’ to outsiders.\n\nConservative critics were furious, but it should have been no more surprising to them than the fact that this year’s new Captain America (who is blond and blue-eyed in the original comics) was black.\n\nTaken singly, each case is hardly something to get worked up about. But the tinkering, critics complain, is now all-consuming.\n\nThe worst offender is probably Disney, sidelining much-loved classics with warnings that they contain offensive ‘racial stereotypes’ and wasting millions on ‘progressive’ reboots of children’s films like Toy Story spin-off Lightyear (in which two characters exchange a lesbian kiss) and this year’s live action Snow White –complete with a Latina heroine and CGI dwarfs – that then flop.\n\nBut how would Founders Films actually get audiences back in front of the big screen?\n\nAccording to entertainment industry website Semafor, the studio’s slate of proposed productions includes 102 Minutes, a feature film about the evacuation of New York’s World Trade Centre on 9/11 (with the tagline ‘Courage is contagious’); Operation Pineapple Express, which is a planned dramatisation of the Biden administration’s ‘botched withdrawal from Afghanistan’; and The Greatest Game, a ‘multi-season, global spy thriller that lays bare China’s plans to replace the United States as the dominant global power’.\n\nPerhaps less excitingly, the studio also wants to make a three-part adaptation of Atlas Shrugged, the long and, many insist, dreary novel by libertarian firebrand Ayn Rand about industrialists rebelling against an overbearing government. \n\nIt has long been a favourite read of many Trump supporters, though less for the plot and writing than its political ideas.\n\nHollywood has historically been timid about criticising China because of its fear of offending the Communist regime – making a mockery of its claims to be morally high-minded.\n\nThe country constitutes the world’s second most lucrative film market, but its government can ban any foreign title that offends it.\n\nAnd so everything from references to Tibet in the Marvel superhero film Dr Strange to an unflattering shot of tattered underwear hanging from a washing line in Shanghai in Mission: Impossible III have been cravenly removed. \n\nThe 2013 film adaptation of World War Z starring Brad Pitt made changes from the book on which it was based to avoid suggesting that a zombie outbreak started in China.\n\nFounders Films bosses have noted that the Nazis were similarly highly effective in censoring Hollywood in the 1930s by threatening to close down the German market to its films.\n\nIf a TV series about devious Chinese attempts to undermine the US (a premise, incidentally, more than justified by the facts) doesn’t have Hollywood reaching for the smelling salts, Founders Films’ plans for movies celebrating recent Israeli military ventures will.\n\nThey include Roaring Lion, a thriller about this year’s Israeli attacks on Iran which – according to the film’s resumé – will portray Israel as ‘striving for nuclear non-proliferation and exercising its right of self-defence against a crazed regime intent on destroying it’.\n\nOne of the new studio’s founders, Shyam Sankar (chief technology officer of Palantir) six months ago outlined the sort of films he wanted to see being made once again.\n\nHe harked back to the gung-ho days of the late 1980s and 1990s – ‘I remember growing up as an immigrant kid at the end of the Cold War’ – when audiences flocked to patriotic classics such as Top Gun, Rocky IV, Red Dawn and The Hunt For Red October.\n\nIn each case, the plot involved US heroes confronting Soviet baddies and the films, said Sankar, served as a ‘soft power tool that helped lift the Iron Curtain and accelerate the collapse of the Soviet Union’.\n\nAnd the West, Sankar argued, needed that sort of propaganda even more, now that it faced a ‘Cold War II’ against a foe – China – that’s far more powerful than the Soviet Union.\n\n‘Breaking out of our cultural malaise will require the studios to wake up and choose America,’ he said.\n\nMedia analyst Alex DeGroote described Founders Films as a ‘real punch in the face for woke’.\n\nVeteran Hollywood journalist Paul Bond said the industry had left itself open to such a challenge by demonising Right-wingers with ‘Leftist messages . . . where anything smacking of conservatism is portrayed as extremism, racism, xenophobic, homophobic, whatever the flavour of the day is’.\n\nAnd, in fact, there have been some conservative screen successes of late, including a biopic of Ronald Reagan starring Dennis Quaid that last year grossed $30 million (£22 million) and Am I Racist?, a Borat-style mockumentary lampooning the DEI movement, which became the highest-grossing documentary of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent fierce row over a ‘Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans’ advertising campaign featuring the winsome actress – in which Left-wingers were widely ridiculed after they complained the jeans advert was racist and eugenicist because Sweeney is blonde and blue-eyed – revealed a large swathe of the US public is sick of being lectured by the wokerati.\n\nIt also revealed – to the delight of conservatives including President Trump – that Sweeney is a registered Republican.\n\nHowever, Hollywood veterans caution that if anything is going to succeed, it has to be entertaining. As with recent overly-woke films like the Snow White remake, movies that seem too much like an ideological lecture – whether liberal or conservative – are likely to flop.\n\nBut, even if a three-part Ayn Rand adaptation sounds about as enticing as a Snow White sequel, at least it offers something new and different in a film world that has become as gratingly predictable in its stories as it is in its politics.","summary":"It's difficult to mistake the southern drawl of one of Hollywood's best-loved film actors - although the sentiment he's expressing certainly wouldn't find much favour in Tinseltown.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14985707/Woody-Harrelson-Matthew-McConaughey-plotting-DESTROY-woke-Hollywood-TOM-LEONARD.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/09/17/101067461-0-image-m-22_1754758077928.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 00:20:36","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":349699004,"title":"World News | Indian Envoy Discusses Energy Security with US Senator Lindsey Graham Amid Tensions over Russian Oil Imports","text":"Washington, DC [US], August 10 (ANI): India's Ambassador to the United States, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, spoke to US Senator Lindsey Graham to share New Delhi's perspective on energy security, including the growing energy trade between India and the US.\n\"Spoke to Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and shared with him the Indian perspective on our energy security, including increasing energy trade with the United States,\" Kwatra said in a post on X.\nAlso Read | NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 Dragon Carrying 4 Astronauts From US, Japan and Russia Returns After 148 Days on ISS, Splashdown off San Diego Coast (Watch Video).\nhttps://x.com/AmbVMKwatra/status/1954206497157616000\nThe conversation comes after US Senator Lindsey Graham on Friday (local time) urged India to use its influence with Russia to help end the war in Ukraine, calling it one of the most significant steps to improve India-US relations.\nAlso Read | Earthquake in Russia: Quake of Magnitude 6.1 on Richter Scale Strikes Kuril Islands.\n\"As I have been telling my friends in India, one of the most consequential things they could do to improve India-U.S. relations is to help President Trump end this bloodbath in Ukraine,\" Graham posted on X.\n\"India is the second largest purchaser of Putin's cheap oil, the proceeds of which fuel his war machine.

I look forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year.\"\nHowever, the meeting with Senator Graham also comes amid escalating trade tensions, after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on imports from India earlier this week in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. The new tariff, set to take effect after 21 days, will raise the total duty on Indian goods to 50 per cent. Trump cited national security and foreign policy concerns, claiming that India's imports of Russian oil pose an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States.\nAccording to the White House order, the levy will apply to all Indian goods imported into the US, except for items already in transit or those qualifying for specific exemptions.\nIn a strong domestic message, Prime Minister Modi addressed the US tariff decision directly on Thursday, reaffirming his government's commitment to protecting the agricultural sector.\n\"For us, the interest of our farmers is our top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers. I know we will have to pay a heavy price for it, and I am ready for it. India is ready for it,\" PM Modi said.

San Francisco 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa, Las Vegas Raiders tight end Brock Bowers and others broke out in celebratory dances that emulated President Donald Trump after touchdowns and sacks in 2024. The upcoming version of the popular NFL-centric video game appears to show the virtual representation of Eagles running back Saquon Barkley doing his version of the dance. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM During a Madden game between the Eagles and Washington Commanders, Jalen Hurts throws a pass to Barkley. An animated version of the All-Pro running back then sprints into the end zone for a touchdown before breaking out into the signature Trump dance. Barkley and Trump have a connection. Earlier this year, Barkley visited the White House to commemorate the Eagles' Super Bowl championship. The day before the president hosted Barkley and his teammates on the South Lawn of the White House for a celebration ceremony, the star running back was spotted disembarking Marine One at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey. EAGLES RB SAQUON BARKLEY'S REVERSE HURDLE TO GRACE COVER OF MADDEN NFL 26 Trump told reporters Barkley is a \"nice guy\" and joked he \"wanted to race him.\" The president ultimately decided to skip the race. Barkley later responded to some of the backlash to news of his outing with Trump making its rounds on social media. \"Some people are really upset cause I played golfed [sic] and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT,\" Barkley wrote on X. \"Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand,\" Barkley wrote on X. \"Just golfed with Obama not too long ago…and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day.\" The White House's official X account shared a photo of Trump and Barkley inside the Oval Office. The picture features a screenshot of the running back's message to critics. More recently, Barkley declined an invitation to be part of Trump's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. \"A couple months ago, it was brought to my team about the council, so I’m not really too familiar with it,\" he said, according to NBC Philadelphia. \"I felt like I’m gonna be super busy, so me and my family thought it was probably in the best interest to not accept that. \"So, [I] was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned, but I’m assuming it’s something great. I appreciate it but was a little shocked when my name was mentioned.\" Trump also named Bosa, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker to the council.

After months of threats, intensive shuttle diplomacy and last-minute trade negotiations, Washington’s new tariff regime has finally come into force.\nFor Southeast Asia, whose nations jostled for favour – and relief – from a White House wielding economic might with Donald Trump’s trademark unpredictability, this ledger of punitive levies has laid bare the US president’s vision for a new global trade order: one underpinned by “reciprocal” transactions.\nThe wide spectrum of tariffs that took effect last week offers a telling window, not only onto the value the United States assigns to its trading partners, but also the concessions they made.\nTrump’s sweeping executive order, issued on July 31, imposed tariffs that came into force from Thursday on a host of nations. Most Southeast Asian countries ended up with rates between 19 and 20 per cent – a figure that analysts say now serves as a de facto “baseline” for future trade negotiations with the US.\n\nLaos and Myanmar, meanwhile, found themselves singled out for far harsher treatment, facing tariffs of 40 per cent.\nFor Cambodia and Thailand, the story is more nuanced. Initially saddled with punitive duties of 49 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively, both nations saw their tariffs dramatically reduced to 19 per cent after the two warring nations agreed to a ceasefire amid a flurry of diplomatic engagement.\nKevin Chen, an associate research fellow with the US programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said there was a “kernel of truth” in suggestions that the ceasefire had helped seal a lower tariff deal, but he cautioned against overstating its impact.\n\n“The negotiations over tariff exemptions and purchases of US equipment probably happened in the weeks preceding the conflict,” he told This Week in Asia.\n“What the ceasefire did was prevent a temporary setback in negotiations, as Trump threatened to halt all talks if the two countries did not stop fighting.”\nTensions flared into open conflict late last month, following the death of a Cambodian soldier in a border skirmish and several Thai soldiers being injured by landmines in disputed territory. Tit-for-tat military exchanges continued until July 28, when a ceasefire was announced after talks brokered by Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current Asean chair, with the US playing an instrumental role. Trump had made it clear: without peace, there would be no trade deals.\nA baseline ‘of sorts’\nOf the 11 states in Southeast Asia, only Singapore secured a 10 per cent tariff rate. Most of the others were slapped with levies of 19 to 20 per cent, which Chen described as “a baseline rate of sorts”.\nWhat united the six Southeast Asian nations that landed the “baseline” rate, he said, was their agility and willingness to engage – they were “early movers” in engaging US trade officials, many making multiple trips to Washington for in-person talks.\n“They [also] had something valuable to offer Washington, either by cutting their own tariffs or buying more US products,” he said.\nMalaysia, for instance, not only offered to eliminate tariffs on an additional 344 American products, but also committed to buying 30 Boeing aircraft valued at US$9.5 billion. Thailand similarly pledged to remove tariffs on more than 10,000 US products, as well as agreeing to buy more American liquefied natural gas and 35 Boeing jets.\n\nOther countries seemed to have less leverage, however. “While Laos and Myanmar were eager to engage US trade officials, it is likely that Washington was not interested in the concessions they offered,” Chen said.\nLaos President Thongloun Sisoulith said his government had reached out to Washington in May, but received no reply. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s Min Aung Hlaing was likely “too late” to initiate any meaningful dialogue before the August 1 deadline, Chen said, despite the junta chief praising Trump and offering to send a high-level trade delegation.\nResponding to Trump’s notification of the new 40 per cent tariff last month, Min Aung Hlaing wrote that he had received the letter with “sincere appreciation”, calling it an “honour” to be contacted directly by the US president. He also commended Trump for his “strong leadership” and guiding the US “toward national prosperity with the spirit of a true patriot”.\nBut Myanmar, which has been under junta rule since a 2021 coup, largely remains a pariah on the global stage, its regime unrecognised by most other countries and subject to broad international sanctions.\n\nOn July 24, the US did lift sanctions on several of Min Aung Hlaing’s allies, but a senior Trump official said the decision was unrelated to the general’s letter.\nStill, there are signs that Myanmar’s fortunes may shift as Washington seeks access to the country’s rare earth reserves for its own defence manufacturing, according to recent reports.\n“Myanmar will likely have a better opportunity to lower its tariff rate amid ongoing talks about access to rare earths,” Chen said. According to Reuters, the Trump administration has entertained proposals to engage not only the junta, but also rebel factions, to secure the strategic minerals.\nThe region’s relations with China complicate matters further. Laos and Myanmar, in particular, maintain close but complex ties with Beijing, whose influence is felt through vast investments in infrastructure, railways and dams.\n\nVery blunt tools\nFor Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, a trade-focused philanthropic organisation in Singapore, the very premise of Trump’s new tariff regime is flawed and viewing any of the levies on Southeast Asian nations as a “win” is misguided.\n“They are all very high. Punishing developing countries, especially with tariffs, is harsh,” she said, arguing that the only reason the adjusted rates “look good” was the “deeply flawed” nature of the original formula.\n“Once that became an anchor, any reduction, unless to nearly zero, became a sign of ‘success’,” Elms said.\n“Trump has also started using tariffs as a tool for all manner of presumed sins. For Thailand and Cambodia, border conflict became another justification. Assumed alignment with China is another reason for maintaining high rates.”\nPunishing developing countries, especially with tariffs, is harsh\nDeborah Elms, trade policy specialist\nTrump’s tariffs first came to light with his initial “Liberation Day” announcement in April, but their origins were born of a formula designed to “maximise coercive bargaining power” by targeting countries most dependent on the US market, according to economist Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the Singapore-based ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.\n“It was not based on any economic rationale,” he said, calling the subsequent adjustments “arbitrary, with little to no method to the madness”.\nThe use of tariffs, Menon argued, now served not just economic, but also foreign and geostrategic aims, “further complicating our understanding of the tariff outcomes”.\n“If Trump continues down the path of trying to interfere with the policies of foreign governments by using the tariff threat, it is likely that they will start pushing back, and a retaliatory cycle of tariff increases could ensue,” he added.\nChen described Trump’s tariffs as “a very blunt tool” that he had shown willingness to wield “even for non-economic goals”.\nIn theory, the levies could be incrementally modified over time, but “given Mr Trump’s volatile moods and tendency to abruptly raise tariffs, such delicate adjustments are improbable,” Chen said.\n“What remains is a zero-sum stand-off: either countries concede in exchange for lower tariffs, or they persist and suffer the consequences. Most countries, fearing economic turmoil, would rather concede than fight in the short term.”","summary":"And so it has come to this. After months of threats, intensive shuttle diplomacy and last-minute trade negotiations, Washington’s new tariff regime has finally come into force.\nFor Southeast Asia, whose nations jostled for favour – and relief – from a White House wielding economic might with Donald Trump’s trademark unpredictability, this ledger of punitive levies has laid bare the US president’s vision for a new global trade order: one underpinned by “reciprocal” transactions.\nThe wide spectrum...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3321264/how-southeast-asia-haggled-erratic-us-economic-might","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/08/e8913d94-6c0e-458c-b622-e20691f95d56_5726f46c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 00:00:09","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":349699862,"title":"Homes evacuated and major incident declared as wildfire spreads near Bournemouth","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDark secrets behind America's dancing quadruplets who were driven to madness by their Hitler-worshipping dad's sick perversions - as last of the tragic Morlok sisters dies aged 95\n\nPictured: UK family who died in 'fireball' Portugal crash - hours after renting car from airport\n\nHarry hits back at charity chief in bullying row - by launching new African children's charity\n\nREVEALED: Baby-killer Constance Marten is causing CHAOS behind bars, sneering at fellow inmates and moaning about 'ghastly' food.

Email eleanor.mann@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ELEANOR MANN \n Published:00:29 BST, 10 August 2025 |Updated:00:56 BST, 10 August 2025 \n\nA major incident has been declared as about 100 firefighters are tackling a fire ripping through Holt Heath in Bournemouth.\nDorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue are fighting to control the blaze which broke out near Wimbourne just after 11am this morning.\nLocals have been advised to stay clear of the area and 20 homes have been evacuated as residents are being ordered to keep their windows and doors shut.\nDorset & Wiltshire Fire Service are currently also fighting another blaze at Newton Heath, near Swanage, which broke out last Sunday on August 3 and is the size of about 35 football pitches.\nDarren Langdown, Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service's assistant chief fire officer, said the force was 'extremely grateful' to neighbouring services from Hampshire and the Isle of Wight who have helped battle the fire.\nLangdown said: 'We have declared a major incident both due to the size of the fire at Holt Heath, and also the impact of this and Newton Heath on our overall availability of resources.'\nHe also urged the public not to fly drones near the fire, as it could interfere with those currently being used by the fire service crews. \nThe Holt Heath fire, which covers an area about 1000m x 800m, has resulted in road closures in Holt Heath village and at the junction between Holt Road and Higher Road.\n\nA major incident has been declared as about 100 firefighters are tackling a fire ripping through Holt Heath in Bournemouth\n\nDorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue are fighting to control the blaze which broke out near Wimbourne just after 11am this morning\nWindy conditions are said to be making the fire harder to tackle, as firefighters are trying to surround the area to prevent it spreading further. \nResidents compared the scene to a 'horror movie' and dog walkers quickly fled the scene as people miles away spotted billowing smoke from the Heath.\nOne dog walker, Marcus Lastra, told the Bournemouth Echo that he witnessed the fire start as smoke rising in the distance, before quickly growing into a huge fire. \nLastra said: 'Because it's an open area, the flames spread very quickly in the wind. In those moments before the fire brigade got there, it had really taken hold. \n'They started spraying parts of it, but then another section caught fire an it just spread and spread. \n'There was mayhem on the main road because people were stopping to take pictures.'\nChloe Mountford, from Northbourne, said that her husband first spotted it from their son's bedroom window.\nShe said: 'We're in Northbourne, so it's a long way away too but we could still see the smoke from our house's window.\n\nResidents compared the scene to a 'horror movie' and dog walkers quickly fled the scene as people miles away spotted billowing smoke from the Heath\n'It's on a hill, so you could see it straight away. Every time the breeze went past, you'd see it's all showing and it's all getting bigger. Four hours later it was still about the same, with a lot of smoke.' \nDorset & Wiltshire Fire Service said: 'We are currently dealing with a large fire at Holt Heath. \n'This fire is spreading quickly and we strongly advise people to stay away from the area for their own safety. \n'If you are a local resident you are advised to keep doors and windows closed.'\nWhilst the Newton Heath fire is thought to have been started deliberately, is not yet clear how the blaze at Holt Heath began. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHomes evacuated and major incident declared as wildfire spreads near Bournemouth\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

She joined the department in January after a career as a Fox News contributor, syndicated radio host, and political commentator.Live EventsPrior to her tenure as a conservative media figure, Bruce was a Democrat and liberal activist. Her political shift was noted by Politico, which highlighted her eventual alignment with Trump. She joins a roster of former Fox News personalities in the Trump administration, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox & Friends co-host.Senate confirmation processThe position of deputy representative to the UN requires Senate confirmation. Lawmakers will have the opportunity to question Bruce on her qualifications and positions before a vote is held.The US currently does not have a confirmed ambassador to the United Nations. Former National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has been nominated for that role but has not yet been confirmed by the Senate. Waltz’s nomination followed the departure of his predecessor after the \"Signal scandal,\" in which sensitive military planning information was inadvertently shared with a journalist. Waltz appeared at a confirmation hearing last month, but the Senate has yet to vote.If confirmed, Bruce would take up her new role at a time when US foreign policy faces significant challenges. The administration’s strong support for Israel has generated friction with several allies as the conflict in Gaza continues.Also read: 'He stole Mar-a-Lago spa workers, including Virginia Giuffre': Trump on why he cut ties with EpsteinContext of the nominationBruce’s appointment would place her at the forefront of US diplomatic engagement at the United Nations during a period of heightened global tensions. The deputy representative assists the ambassador in representing US interests, participating in Security Council deliberations, and coordinating with allied and partner nations.The Trump administration’s foreign policy positions, particularly its stance toward Israel, have prompted debates within the international community. If confirmed, Bruce will be tasked with navigating these complex dynamics while advancing US priorities in multilateral forums.Her nomination reflects the president’s continued reliance on figures from his political and media orbit for key diplomatic positions, reinforcing a trend established during both his presidential terms.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTammy Bruce UN nominationUS deputy representative to the United NationsTrump administration foreign policySenate confirmation processUS Ambassador to the United NationsState Department spokesperson\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:47 BST, 10 August 2025 |Updated:00:52 BST, 10 August 2025 \n\nFrank Skinner has claimed there are 'lots of creepy men' working in the TV industry who often make 'women's lives a misery'.\nThe comedian, 68, recalled one particular incident in which he used his position on his chat show, which aired on both BBC and ITV from 1995 to 2005, to get a vile cameraman sacked after he filmed up a female colleague's skirt.\nHe told The Sun: 'I think if you’ve got the power to do something about that, you need to use it', as he branded the incident 'horrible' and a form of 'bullying'.\n'[The cameraman] He thought it was funny to put the camera up a make-up woman’s skirt and it got big laughs in the studio. I wasn’t in the studio, but I found her crying in a room and she told me about it.\n'I asked around. And because I was a big-time comedian, I was able to say: \"Well, look, either he goes or I go\". I don’t want to get anyone sacked, but I did get him sacked. I tell that story not to make myself sound like some big hero and good guy, but just that I had the power and I did something'.\nFrank said that he believed that is how incident os misconduct should be bullied and found it 'baffling' how they often appear to go ignored. \n\nFrank Skinner has claimed there are 'lots of creepy men' working in the TV industry who often make 'women's lives a misery'\n\nThe comedian recalled one particular incident in which he used his position on his chat show to get a vile cameraman sacked after he filmed up a female colleague's skirt (pictured 2001)\nMeanwhile Christopher Biggins has shockingly admitted he would still like to be able to 'grab women by the t***ies' in a bizarre defence of Gregg Wallace.\nThe iconic actor, 76, who is openly gay, said his own past behaviour would 'land him in prison' today and claimed 25 years ago 'everyone' was acting inappropriately. \nGregg, 60, stepped down from his duties as Masterchef host after more than 40 complaints about his behaviour were upheld following a BBC investigation. \nChristopher, who appeared on the show's celebrity version in 2014, said he'd reached out to the scandal-plagued broadcaster following the axe, as well as sharing insight into his own less than savoury antics. \nHe told The Sun: 'Years ago I would approach a woman from behind and grab her t***ies from the front. Well, I'm gay so it didn't matter. And I'd like to still be doing it, but I don't think I can any more.\n'If I were to do that now I'd be put into prison. Twenty-five years ago we were all doing it. It was a thing of affection.'\nHe went on: 'I love Gregg and I love his wife. I've tried to get hold of her because they must be going through a terrible time because suddenly careers are vanishing, it's so wrong.'\nDaily Mail have contacted Christopher Biggins' reps for further comment. \nNo stranger to his own controversy, Christopher was famously axed from the Celebrity Big Brother back in 2016 after making a shocking comment to X Factor star Katie Waissel, which was never broadcast.\n\nHe said: 'I think if you’ve got the power to do something about that, you need to use it', as he branded the incident 'horrible' and a form of 'bullying'\n\nank said that he believed that is how incident os misconduct should be bullied and found it 'baffling' how they often appear to go ignored\n\nMeanwhile Christopher Biggins, 76, has shockingly admitted he would still like to be able to 'grab women by the t***ies' in a bizarre defence of Gregg Wallace \nChristopher told Katie, who is Jewish: 'You better be careful or they'll be putting you in a shower and taking you to a room.'\nBosses immediately removed him from the house, and his £100,000 fee was reportedly slashed.\n\n Gregg Wallace and wife Anna stand united as they celebrate their nine year wedding anniversary amid the former MasterChef star's sexual misconduct probe \nChristopher has since apologised for his comments, noting that some of his close friends, such as Birds of a Feather's Lesley Joseph, were Jewish.\nThe BBC review into Gregg's behaviour concluded that the 'majority of the substantiated allegations against him related to inappropriate sexual language and humour'.\nIt added that 'a smaller number of allegations of other inappropriate language and being in a state of undress were also substantiated', with 'one incident of unwelcome physical contact' also substantiated.\nAustralian-born chef co-host John Torode, 59, also lost his job after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he claims to have 'absolutely no recollection' of.\nGregg and John have returned to screens for one final time together as the BBC made the decision to air the controversial 21st series of MasterChef.\nIt was filmed last year and remained shelved by the broadcaster until the findings of the independent investigation were gathered. \n\nGregg, 60, was recently dismissed from his duties as Masterchef host after more than 40 complaints about his behaviour were upheld following a BBC investigation\n\nThe iconic actor, who is openly gay, said his own past behaviour would 'land him in prison' today and claimed 25 years ago 'everyone' was acting inappropriately (pictured on Celebrity Masterchef in 2014)\n\nFans have been left divided over the move to air the programme, with some branding the decision as 'bizarre' and accused the BBC of being 'tone deaf'. \nThere was a last-minute scramble behind-the-scenes to re-edit it and limit the appearances of John and Gregg. \nOne contestant, Sarah Shafi, will not appear on the programme after she complained about the behaviour of Gregg.\nShe claimed she was 'eyed up and ogled' by Gregg on the show, while accusing the TV host of making an 'off' comment about his reputation with women.\nSarah, who was set to appear on the show's yet to be aired season, said the greengrocer, 60, made her feel like a 'rabbit in the headlights', when he made a 'throwaway comment' about his reputation with women.\nChristopher BigginsITVFrank SkinnerBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFrank Skinner claims there are 'lots of creepy men' working in TV 'making women's lives a misery' as he recalls getting vile cameraman sacked for filming up a female colleague's skirt\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Recent polls, however, suggest some Americans are turning on Trump's immigration policy amid reports that individuals with no criminal records or nonviolent offenses are being targeted.The administration said it deported around 100,000 illegal immigrants in the initial months of Trump's second term, and many individuals have been deported following the president invoking the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been criticized and blocked by judges.What To KnowAccording to ICE Buffalo, Yang was arrested \"pursuant to a warrant of removal issued by an immigration judge in 2002.\" The agency stated that Yang \"has had his due process and remained at large for over 20 years.\" Despite the outstanding warrant, Yang had maintained regular contact with immigration authorities through periodic check-ins and possessed a work authorization card.Yang's daughter, Elizabeth Yang, explained to WHAM-TV that her father had recently received approval for the first step in his green card application process.\"He asked his lawyer, and his lawyer was like, 'Oh, it's OK because you should be fine,' because he just recently got approved for the first step in applying for his green card,\" she told the news station. \"So, he just went in thinking it was going to be OK.\"After stepping down from his restaurant nearly a year ago, he had been actively working toward obtaining permanent legal status. His attorney had reportedly assured the family that the routine check-in would proceed normally given his recent immigration progress.The arrest occurred after Yang received a call on July 14 requesting his appearance at the immigration office. Elizabeth Yang described the family's shock, noting they expected a standard check-in similar to previous encounters with immigration officials.What People Are SayingICE Buffalo Statement: \"ICE Buffalo arrested Chinese national You Chen Yang July 14 pursuant to a warrant of removal issued by an immigration judge in 2002. This alien has had his due process and remained at large for over 20 years.\"It continued: \"Under President Trump and DHS Secretary Noem's leadership, ICE is focused on removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to the security of our communities as well as those who have a final order of removal. Yang is in custody pending execution of his removal from the U.S.\"Yang's daughter Elizabeth Yang told WHAM-TV: \"The immigration office asks him to come in, or they'll set up an interview on the phone and just make check in with him every once in a while. So, this time, we thought it was a normal routine check-in.\"What Happens Next?Yang remains in custody at the ICE detention center in Batavia, New York, pending execution of his removal from the United States.His family has maintained phone contact, and some have visited him at the facility.

It could be a death sentence for the people we love most,\" Lishay Miran Lavi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran told the rally, pleading to US President Donald Trump to intervene to immediately end the war.\n\nPublic opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an immediate end to the war to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials believe about 20 hostages are still alive.\n\nThe Israeli government has faced sharp criticism at home and abroad, including from some of its closest European allies, over the announcement that the military would expand the war.\n\nMost of the hostages who have been freed so far emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.\n\n\"They (the government) are fanatic. They are doing things against the interests of the country,\" said Rami Dar, 69-year-old retiree, echoing calls for Trump to force a deal for the hostages.\n\nTel Aviv has seen frequent rallies urging the government to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, who ignited the war with their October 2023 attack. Saturday's demonstration attracted over 100,000 protesters, according to organisers.\n\n\"Frankly, I'm not an expert or anything, but I feel that after two years of fighting there has been no success,\" said Yana, 45, who attended the rally with her husband and two children.\n\n\"I wonder whether additional lives for both sides, not just the Israelis but also Gazans, will make any difference.\"\n\nAround 100, mostly Israelis, were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza during Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since then.\n\nProtesters waved Israeli flags and carried placards bearing the images of hostages. Others held signs directing anger at the government or urging Trump to take action to stop Netanyahu from moving forward with plans to escalate the war. A small number of protesters held images of Gazan children killed by the military.\n\nIsrael's military has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians in the war, according to the Gazan health ministry, which said on Saturday that at least 39 had been killed in the past day.","summary":"Thousands have turned out for a rally in Tel Aviv organised by a forum of relatives of hostages abducted by Hamas and taken to the Gaza Strip.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/tens-of-thousands-rally-in-tel-aviv-against-gaza-plan-c-19635570","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19635570/8c0cb05a946aa063883a106d3786b577f242a87d-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 23:29:17","author":"Alexander Cornwell,Alexander Cornwellreu","authors":["Alexander Cornwell","Alexander Cornwellreu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.166},{"id":349691902,"title":"Mariano Rivera tears Achilles in Yankees Old-Timers’ Day game and needs surgery","text":"Home | Toronto Sun Home Page | Toronto Sun\n\nAdvertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\n Toronto & GTA WARMINGTON: Veteran ignites debate by challenging Nova Scotia's $25G fine for woods walk with Video 187 Comments Toronto & GTA The Weeknd saves best for last in final Toronto concert: 'It's been a beautiful 15 years' with Video 5 Comments Columnists GOLDSTEIN: Report finds antisemitism new normal in many Ontario schools with Video 46 Comments Lorrie Goldstein Canada 'Violent and unacceptable' attack on Jewish father in Montreal's Parc-Extension 22 Comments Columnists GUNTER: Canada still hasn't seen Carney's promised leadership Lorne Gunter World CRIME HUNTER: New docuseries shines light on horrific Yogurt Shop Murders with Video World London police arrest more than 200 as pro-Palestinian protesters defy new law with Video 59 Comments World Firefighters battle to prevent reignition of France’s largest wildfire as residents return home with Video Columnists LILLEY: Softwood lumber tariffs soar as Mark Carney's plan fails to deliver with Video 466 Comments Brian Lilley Editorials EDITORIAL: Rewarding terrorists makes no one safer with Video 5 Comments Postmedia News Latest Videos Up Next \n\nAdvertisement 2Stories continue belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nNewsFeaturedToronto & GTAWorld Pay hike for military members ’long overdue,’ says expert OTTAWA — The federal government’s decision to boost entry-level pay for Canadian Armed Forces members is being praised by expert observers as long overdue. with Video 28 Comments 9 hours ago Canada You can save this article by registering for free here.

The decision to hold the upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in Alaska underscores the intention of both countries to fundamentally transform bilateral relations and end the confrontation between Washington and Moscow, Dmitry Suslov, Deputy Director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics and an expert of the Valdai Discussion Club, told TASS.\n\nThe expert drew attention to the fact that Alaska is the US state geographically closest to Russia. \"The choice of Alaska is meant precisely to emphasize the bilateral nature of the Russian-American summit, the agenda that will be discussed, and the bilateral nature of the decisions that will be taken, including on the Ukrainian issue,\" he added.\n\n\"It should be stressed that this will be a full-scale summit. Holding such a full-scale summit on the territory of one of the countries, not on neutral ground in a third country, but on the territory of one of the participants, underscores a qualitative shift in Russian-American relations. Or, at the very least, it underscores the intent of both sides to fundamentally change the nature of Russian-American relations, to end the hybrid war that began with [Joe] Biden’s arrival to power in the United States, and even to end the confrontation that has existed since the Obama era,\" Suslov noted.\n\nAccording to him, holding the summit in Alaska is evidence of the parties’ intention to overcome the \"accumulated negative baggage\" and bring Russian-American relations to a qualitatively new level. \"Alaska underscores the strictly bilateral nature of the Russian-American summit and of any [possible] Russian-American plan for a Ukrainian settlement, precisely because it is as far removed as possible from Europe and Ukraine, while being as close as possible to Russia,\" the expert emphasized.","summary":"According to Dmitry Suslov, holding such a full-scale summit on the territory of one of the countries underscores a qualitative shift in Russian-American relations","url":"https://tass.com/politics/2000299","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 23:21:40","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":0.294},{"id":349697158,"title":"White House considering inviting Zelenskyy to Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska – reports | World News","text":"The White House is considering inviting Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, according to reports in the US.\n\nThe reports come a day after Washington and Moscow confirmed the US and Russian presidents will meet on Friday to discuss bringing about an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nA senior US official and three people briefed on internal discussions have told Sky News’ US partner network NBC News that the Trump administration is now considering inviting the Ukrainian president to the summit.\n\n“It’s being discussed,” one of the people briefed on the talks was quoted as saying.\n\nThe sources said a visit by Mr Zelenskyy has not been finalised – and it is unclear whether the Ukrainian leader will be in Alaska for the summit.\n\nHowever, the senior administration official said it is “absolutely” possible.\n\n“Everyone is very hopeful that would happen,” the official said.\n\nAsked whether the US had officially invited Mr Zelenskyy to Alaska, a senior White House official said: “The President remains open to a trilateral summit with both leaders. Right now, the White House is focusing on planning the bilateral meeting requested by President Putin.”\n\nMr Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday before the Alaska summit was confirmed that “we’re getting very close to a deal” that would end the war.\n\nThe US president added there will be “some swapping of territories to the betterment of both sides”.\n\nHowever, Mr Zelenskyy warned on Saturday that allowing Russia to keep territory it has occupied in Ukraine will result in another invasion.\n\nHe said allowing Mr Putin to annex Crimea in 2014 didn’t prevent Russia forces from occupying more parts of Ukraine during the current conflict.\n\nMr Zelenskyy added: “Now, Putin wants to be forgiven for seizing the south of our Kherson region, Zaporizhzhia, the entire territory of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and Crimea. We will not allow this second attempt to partition Ukraine.\n\n“Knowing Russia – where there is a second, there will be a third.”\n\nThe reports Mr Zelenksyy could be invited to Alask come as Ukraine and several NATO allies have reportedly been privately concerned Mr Trump might agree to Mr Putin’s proposals for ending the war without taking their positions into account.\n\nNATO allies say Ukraine must be at ‘negotiating table’\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy hosted a meeting of top Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers alongside US vice-president JD Vance on Saturday ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting.\n\nThe meeting took place at the foreign secretary’s official country retreat, Chevening, in Kent, where Mr Vance is staying at the start of a UK holiday.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Lammy said: “The UK’s support for Ukraine remains ironclad as we continue working towards a just and lasting peace.”\n\nIt is understood that the meeting had been called at Washington’s request, and included representatives from the US, Ukraine, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as the UK.\n\nUkraine was represented by Rustem Umerov, secretary of the country’s national security and defence council, and the head of Mr Zelensky’s office, Andriy Yermak.\n\nIn a post on social media, Mr Yermak said the allies’ positions were “clear” that “a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognising the occupation”.\n\nAhead of the meeting at Chevening, Sir Keir discussed the talks in a call with Mr Zelensky on Saturday, and also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron\n\nThis breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.\n\nPlease refresh the page for the fullest version.\n\nYou can receive breaking news alerts on a smartphone or tablet via the Sky News app. You can also follow @SkyNews on X or subscribe to our YouTube channel to keep up with the latest news.","summary":"The White House is considering inviting Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, according to reports in the US.

John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill, the executive producers of the show — which follows the lives of healthcare professionals at a Pittsburgh hospital juggling office politics, crises and the challenges of caring for the critically ill — say that season two of the show will feature a bit of a different plot. \"We take our platform very seriously,\" Gemmill told Variety, in a piece published on Thursday. TOP TRUMP ADMIN HEALTH OFFICIALS SHARE VISION FOR HHS TO 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' \"I think one of the things when you can reach 10 million people — and this was true back in the day on ‘ER’ as well — is with that amount of people listening, you have to be responsible for what you put out there,\" Gemmill added. \"The Pitt\" star Noah Wyle, who plays Dr. \"Robby\" Robinavitch, said he sees the show as a sort of mirror. \"We have a certain safety net in just being a realistic drama by trying to depict what it looks like in a hospital,\" Wyle said. \"You’re not making value judgments. You’re just painting a picture, and if it’s accurate enough, and it’s representative enough, it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test.

But they’re going to have on-the-ground, immediate consequences in emergency rooms, and nobody’s arguing with that,\" he added. \"That’s a bipartisan agreement.

Vance met with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and representatives from Ukraine and other European allies.\n\nThe UK meeting came as the upcoming Trump-Putin summit -- set to happen without Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the table -- has raised concern among Ukrainian officials and across Europe.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday morning he had spoken with both Zelenskyy and other European leaders and that, \"The future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now.\"\n\nSpeaking from the White House on Friday, Trump suggested discussions to end the war could include \"some swapping of territories,\" which Zelenskyy later swiftly rejected, saying Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.”\n\nZelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials have also insisted that any negotiations must include Ukraine at the table.\n\n\"Our positions were clear: a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognizing the occupation,\" Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said in a statement Saturday that also thanked JD Vance for taking part in the UK talks.\n\nIn an address Saturday evening, Zelenskyy called the talks Saturday in the UK \"constructive\" and said they came during an \"active day of diplomacy\" between Ukraine and several EU allies.\n\n\"All our messages were conveyed,\" Zelenskyy said of the talks with Vance. \"Our arguments are being heard.

The network blanketed the airwaves with hour after hour amplifying the Trump smear of Obama, desperately trying to drown out the Epstein coverage. Thus far, there are few signs that the campaign is working, but the right is giving their all.\n\nFamiliar Ground\n\nTrying to weave a conspiracy theory around Obama is well-worn territory for the right—and for Trump’s team in particular. Back in 2020, many of these same people, led by Trump, attempted to create an Obama-related scandal titled “Obamagate.” Unlike its namesake, the infamous Watergate scandal, the Obamagate conspiracy fizzled, and a few months after all that sound and fury, the public elected Joe Biden over Trump by a significant margin.\n\nSimilarly, when Trump first took office in 2017, it was just a few weeks in that the right began to argue that the grassroots protests against Trump’s bigoted policies were an Obama creation.\n\nTrump has made it quite clear that he hates Obama. He always takes great pains to name the former president in full as “Barack Hussein Obama,” an attempt to invoke bigoted fears of the name’s Middle Eastern roots.\n\nMillions watched in 2011 as Trump uncomfortably squirmed in his seat at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as Obama mercilessly mocked him over his racist birther crusade. It has been reported that the moment may have pushed Trump into the electoral arena, out of his desire for revenge.\n\nThe Roots Of Anti-Obama Rage\n\nObama is the first Black person to be elected president of the United States. He first did so by running in 2008 against then-Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a decorated military veteran and an icon in the conservative movement. Obama’s win was an affront to conservatives, who have historically treated Democratic presidents like usurpers, but with Obama, conservatives perceived it as more egregious because of his race.\n\nThe right, led by Trump, didn’t merely object to Obama’s stance as a Democrat—they argued that the first nonwhite person to occupy the presidential office was there illegally and was not even qualified for the job. Trump repeatedly claimed he had investigators looking into Obama’s birth certificate.\n\nDuring an appearance on “The View,” Trump touted his purported team’s visit to Hawaii, Obama’s birthplace. “They cannot believe what they are finding,” Trump claimed.\n\nNobody found anything, of course, because conservatives were lying.\n\nFour years later, Obama further angered the right by winning a second term, this time against self-described “severely conservative” Mitt Romney.\n\nBy this point, a Black man had twice beaten the Republican Party’s best efforts and the right-wing media smear machine.\n\nGOP Unhinged\n\nWhile Republicans have always fostered a conspiratorial culture, Obama’s double win appears to have been the party’s tipping point. Crackpots like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones became mainstream within conservative circles, and figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who went on at length about purported Jewish space lasers, were elected to Congress.\n\nAnd of course, the birther-in-chief himself, Donald Trump, became the leader of the party and has spent the last decade shaping conservatism in his twisted image. Central to that is hating Obama.\n\nTrump’s racism, working in tandem with conspiratorial thinking, is now the standard in the party. It’s no wonder that his team has reached for the familiar in trying to rid themselves of the stench of pedophilia and other sex crimes.\n\nObama has not been president for over 3,100 days. But Trump and his team believe the former president is always in the shadows, lurking and controlling world events. And when things go wrong for Trump, three words will always be on his lips: Barack Hussein Obama.","summary":"President Donald Trump and his team have spent weeks trying to kill damaging headlines about their mishandling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, and while doing so, they have lashed out at a very familiar target: former President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThe Obama Distraction (Attempt)\n\nThe public has repeatedly told pollsters they think the government and Trump are covering up evidence related to Epstein’s alleged sex-trafficking network.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy RUTH FRANCIS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:23:48 BST, 9 August 2025 |Updated:23:54 BST, 9 August 2025 \n\nBrooklyn Peltz Beckham has revealed he's still head-over-heels for wife Nicola after the pair secretly renewed their wedding vows earlier this month.\nThe loved-up couple, who tied the knot in a lavish £3million ceremony in 2022, decided to say 'I do' all over again on August 2 in what Brooklyn described as 'a really beautiful experience'.\nSpeaking for the first time about the day, the 26-year-old admitted he'd happily do it 'every single day' if he could.\nThe pair kept the intimate celebration under wraps until now, but Brooklyn said the moment was all about creating a 'really cute memory' they'd treasure forever.\nNicola, 30, was by his side as they exchanged longer vows than their original wedding, a detail Brooklyn confessed may cause a problem for his already inked tribute.\nSpeaking to People he said: 'It was beautiful. We just wanted a really beautiful experience - a really cute memory.\n\nBrooklyn Peltz Beckham has revealed he's still head-over-heels for wife Nicola after the pair secretly renewed their wedding vows in a romantic ceremony earlier this month\n\nThe loved-up couple, who first tied the knot in a lavish £3million ceremony in 2022, decided to say 'I do' all over again on August 2 in what Brooklyn described as 'a really beautiful experience'\n'To be honest, I could renew my vows every single day with her. I think the most important thing that someone can do is find that person that they're going to spend the rest of their life with. \nIt definitely shapes you as a person. It was really, really cute. It was really fun.'\nThe eldest Beckham has his first set of vows tattooed on his arm and now admits he'll have to 'find space' for the new ones.\nThe ceremony was a far cry from their first glitzy bash, with the couple opting for a smaller, more personal event surrounded by their four dogs.\nFar from being a party-loving celeb couple, Brooklyn says their favourite nights are spent at home, sipping wine and cooking together.\nThe pair began dating back in October 2019, went Instagram official a few months later, and by July 2020, Brooklyn had popped the question.\nIn another turn of events, the son of David and Victoria Beckham said he is keen to remind fans not to stress over life timelines, revealing that he didn't discover his career passion until his early twenties and now he's the proud owner of hot sauce brand Cloud23.\nBrooklyn added that Nicola played a major role in his business journey, pushing him to pursue food after he confessed he wasn't sure what career path to take.\n\nSpeaking for the first time about the day, the 26-year-old admitted he'd happily do it 'every single day' if he could\n\nThe pair kept the intimate celebration under wraps until now, but Brooklyn said the moment was all about creating a 'really cute memory' they'd treasure forever\n\nNicola, 30, was by his side as they exchanged longer vows than their original wedding, a detail Brooklyn confessed may cause a problem for his already inked tribute\n\nThe ceremony was a far cry from their first glitzy bash, with the couple opting for a smaller, more personal event surrounded by their four dogs\n\nIn another turn of events, Brooklyn revealed that he is keen to remind fans not to stress over life timelines, saying that he didn't discover his career passion until his early twenties and now he's the proud owner of hot sauce brand Cloud23\n\nBrooklyn added that Nicola played a major role in his business journey, pushing him to pursue food after he confessed he wasn't sure what career path to take and spotted a gap in the market for high-end hot sauces with clean ingredients\nIt all started, he admitted, after 'getting really drunk one night' and experimenting with making hot sauce in their kitchen.\n\n Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz seen for the first time since renewing their vows amid family feud \nThat tipsy trial run turned into a full-blown business, with Brooklyn spotting a gap in the market for high-end hot sauces with clean ingredients.\nTwo flavours - Hot Habanero and Sweet Jalapeño - are now on sale and both featured in his recent Airbnb Originals Experience event in Los Angeles.\nGuests at the party were served spicy pickle martinis infused with his sauce before learning how to whip up chimichurri from celebrity chef Aaron May.\nBrooklyn revealed that cooking is his 'favourite thing', whether it's for Nicola, friends, or even the couple's beloved pets.\nHis go-to dish is spaghetti bolognese - but with a twist - a whole bottle of red wine and a cork thrown into the pot for good luck.\nBrooklyn said: 'I add a whole bottle of red wine. The cheapest red wine is always the best for bolognese. I actually put 10 bay leaves in there.'\n\nBrooklyn revealed that cooking is his 'favourite thing', whether it's for Nicola, friends, or even the couple's beloved pets\n\nHis go-to dish is spaghetti bolognese - but with a twist - a whole bottle of red wine plus the cork thrown into the pot for good luck\nHe added: 'I don't know where I learned this, but I put the cork of the wine in the pot. I don't think it does anything. Then, I just marinate it for five hours.' \n\n David Beckham, 50, relaxes on yacht with Posh and Cruz - as Brooklyn and Nicola are seen amid feud \nAnd when he's entertaining, Brooklyn confessed candles, good music, and low lighting are his non-negotiable.\nBrooklyn's parents David and Victoria have been enjoying their annual summer break on their £16 million yacht in Europe. \nBut he and Nicola have kept away amid an ongoing family feud, as the pair lived it up on a £85million vessel that dwarfs his parents' close by the week before.\nThe family has been thrown into turmoil in recent months as it has been claimed Brooklyn has become increasingly estranged from his famous parents after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May.\nIt was also revealed that Brooklyn and Nicola's Instagram accounts no longer follow his younger brothers in the latest family drama.\nHowever, Brooklyn's friends told Daily Mail that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media platform.\n\nThe family has been thrown into turmoil in recent months as it has been claimed Brooklyn has become increasingly estranged from his famous parents after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May. [the family seen before the feud]\n\nThis would make sense given that Brooklyn and Nicola are still following Victoria and David.\nDavid and Victoria have reportedly become resigned to the fact that they have become estranged from their beloved son after he failed to attend any of the football ace's 50th birthday celebrations last month.\nHe also didn't wish either his mum Victoria or dad David a happy birthday on social media - an unusual move for the Beckhams, who are known for their loving posts.\nThis is in stark contrast to a post Brooklyn shared recently for his father-in-law and wrote on a picture of himself and Nicola with the billionaire: 'Happy birthday Nelson x We love you.'\nBrooklyn BeckhamInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham reveals he could 'renew vows every day' as he opens up on secret ceremony with wife Nicola Peltz amid ongoing feud with David and Victoria\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 44\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Speaking at a trilateral signing ceremony of a peace pledge with the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia at the White House, Trump also claimed that “five or six planes” were shot down during the conflict.\nAfter the signing of the accords, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan also stated that they would nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for the historic agreement.\nSpeaking at the ceremony alongside the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, Trump said, “Today’s signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big. And they were great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict, as you know, a nuclear conflict probably.”\nThis is not the first instance where Trump has claimed credit for brokering a truce between India and Pakistan. He has been making such statements since May 10, when hostilities between the two countries calmed down. Indian officials have repeatedly rejected these claims.\nAir Chief Marshal AP Singh confirmed on Saturday that the decision to implement a ceasefire was a unilateral move by India, not the result of any external mediation. During a lecture in Bengaluru, the Air Chief stated that the conflict was “a high-tech war” that had inflicted so much damage on Pakistan’s military infrastructure within just 80 to 90 hours that the adversary was compelled to seek a truce. “They came forward and sent a message to our DGMO that they wanted to talk,” he said, confirming that the ceasefire was a result of Pakistan’s military leadership initiating backchannel de-escalation.\nHe also confirmed that the Indian Air Force shot down at least five Pakistani fighter jets and one large aircraft, in addition to damaging key airbases and command centres. The military objectives achieved during this short, decisive operational window forced Pakistan to its knees, indicating that India halted the conflict by choice, not compulsion.","summary":"Air Chief Marshal AP Singh said on Saturday that the decision to implement a ceasefire was a unilateral move by India, not the result of any external mediation","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-again-claims-credit-for-india-pakistan-ceasefire-at-signing-of-armenia-azerbaijan-peace-pact-9495907.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-11-2025-08-0e09ca0db187442e92a45ff5fb2e48a0.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 22:52:28","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":349688740,"title":"Howard Stern psyched up as rumors swirl around show closure, ‘bring it on’: sources","text":"Reports of his SiriusXM show’s impending end have allegedly re-energized radio icon Howard Stern, who insiders say wants to prove he’s still one of the best interviewers around.\n\n“He’s in a bring-it-on mind frame,” the source said, adding the self-described “King of All Media,” whose $500 million contract runs out in mere months, is considering a shift to video streaming.\n\n“If he signs with Sirius again or anywhere else, it will be his last contract,” the source told DailyMail. “If Sirius doesn’t sign him, he will have a backup plan. He is not going to allow anyone [to] be the reason for the end of his career besides himself and what he wants to do.”\n\nThe source speculated Stern, 71, might move to Netflix or HBO Max.\n\nLast year, HBO aired Stern’s two-hour-long interview with New Jersey rocker Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe source described Stern as being “pumped up” by the speculation over his next move.\n\n“Howard likes what he likes and though he could be bitter on how things are going, it isn’t anything new to him,” the source offered. “He also isn’t blaming things on his age; the world has changed. He has changed himself. If he didn’t, he would have been gone a long time ago.\n\n“He still wants to figure something out to stay, especially for his team that would mostly be affected,” the source continued.\n\nStern’s audience has falled from 20 million at its height to 125,000 daily listeners now.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Stern’s show’s writers have reportedly been keeping their best jokes for themselves, secretly hoping to use after the show’s eventual end, one worker told The Post.\n\n“Most of us have been coasting at work the last year,” because “we know he’s retiring, whether by choice or because he’s forced out,” one longtime staffer said.\n\nCritics have also claimed the Long Island radio visionary has been “woke” since endorsing Hillary Clinton’s run against former pal President Donald Trump in 2015.\n\n“All this unknown is music to Howard’s ears,” the source insisted. “He thrives in this element of the unknown.”","summary":"An inside source speculated Howard Stern might move to Netflix or HBO Max.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/09/us-news/stern-insider-says-howard-in-his-element-as-fate-of-future-looms/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/109404127.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QJGhl8o3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-09 22:49:30","author":"Chris Harris","authors":["Chris Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":349692036,"title":"Thousands in Tel Aviv protest against Netanyahu’s plan to escalate Gaza war","text":"Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night to oppose Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to escalate the Gaza war.\n\nA day earlier, the Israeli prime minister’s office said the security cabinet had decided to seize Gaza City, expanding military operations in the devastated Palestinian territory despite widespread public opposition and warnings from the military the move could endanger the hostages.\n\nSaturday’s demonstration in Tel Aviv attracted more than 100,000 protesters, according to organisers. Attenders demanded an immediate end to the military campaign and for the release of hostages.\n\n“This isn’t just a military decision. It could be a death sentence for the people we love most,” Lishay Miran Lavi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, told the rally, pleading Donald Trump to intervene to immediately end the war.\n\nPublic opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an immediate end to the war to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by militants in Gaza. Israeli officials believe about 20 hostages are still alive.\n\nThe Israeli government has faced sharp criticism at home and abroad, including from some of its closest European allies, over the announcement that the military would expand the war. The full cabinet is expected to give its approval as soon as Sunday.\n\nMost of the hostages who have been freed emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations. Talks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.\n\n“They (the government) are fanatic. They are doing things against the interests of the country,” said Rami Dar, 69-year-old retiree, who travelled from a nearby suburb outside Tel Aviv, echoing calls for Trump to force a deal for the hostages.\n\nTel Aviv has seen frequent rallies urging the government to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, which ignited the war with their October 2023 attack.\n\n“Frankly, I’m not an expert or anything, but I feel that after two years of fighting there has been no success,” said Yana, 45, who attended the rally with her husband and two children. “I wonder whether additional lives for both sides, not just the Israelis but also Gazans, will make any difference.“\n\nAbout 1,200, mostly Israelis, were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza during Hamas’ attack on Israel on 7 October, 2023. More than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since.\n\nProtesters waved Israeli flags and carried placards bearing the images of hostages. Others held signs directing anger at the government or urging Trump to take action to stop Netanyahu from moving forward with plans to escalate the war. A small number of protesters held images of children killed by the military in Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s military has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians in the war, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which said on Saturday that at least 39 had been killed in the past day.\n\nSome of the prime minister’s far-right coalition allies have been pushing for a total takeover of Gaza. The military has warned this could endanger the lives of the hostages in Gaza.\n\nFar-right minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of continuing the war, issued a statement on Saturday criticising Netanyahu and calling for the annexation of large parts of Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu told Fox News in an interview that aired on Thursday that the military intended to take control of all Gaza but that Israel did not want to keep the territory.\n\nThe announcement from the prime minister’s office early on Friday said the military would take Gaza City, but did not explicitly say if Israeli forces would take all the territory.\n\nTal, a 55-year-old high school teacher, told Reuters at the rally in Tel Aviv that expanding the war was “terrible,” warning it would result in the deaths of soldiers and hostages. They said the war should end with the military withdrawing: “We don’t have anything to do there. It’s not ours.”","summary":"Organisers say more than 100,000 people joined demonstration demanding end to military campaign \n\nThousands of protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday night to oppose Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to escalate the Gaza war.\n\nA day earlier, the Israeli prime minister’s office said the security cabinet had decided to seize Gaza City, expanding military operations in the devastated Palestinian territory despite widespread public opposition and warnings from the military the move could endanger the hostages.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/09/thousands-in-tel-aviv-protest-against-netanyahus-plan-to-escalate-gaza-war","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aefcffcf7667c87c795e28b088757f597c0a812a/358_0_3584_2867/master/3584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 22:45:14","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.172},{"id":349690916,"title":"Nelly Furtado, 47, rocks ruffled hotpants and quirky boots at Boardmasters Festival in Cornwall","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Aug 9th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInternet star's husband let son, 3, drown in pool 'after taking his eye off him for NINE minutes to watch basketball game he had bet $25 on'\n\nThe baby name bust-up between the aristocratic Mountbatten clan and Nicholas Parsons' granddaughter\n\nPictured: UK family who died in 'fireball' Portugal crash - hours after renting car from airport\n\nSnorting cocaine on the floor, cuckolding JFK Jr and the day Carolyn Bessette humiliated herself at Mar-a-Lago: Every poisonous detail, told by friends and family\n\nDAN HODGES: Starmer needs to admit the truth: migrants DO commit more crime than native Brits.

It could be a death sentence for the people we love most,\" Lishay Miran Lavi, the wife of hostage Omri Miran, told the rally.\n\nShe pleaded with US President Donald Trump to intervene to immediately end the war.\n\nPublic opinion polls show an overwhelming majority of Israelis favour an immediate end to the war to secure the release of the remaining 50 hostages held by militants in Gaza. \n\nIsraeli officials believe about 20 hostages are still alive.\n\nThe Israeli government has faced sharp criticism at home and abroad, including from some of its closest European allies, over the announcement that the military would expand the war.\n\nThe full cabinet is expected to give its approval as soon as Sunday local time.\n\n'Against the interests of the country'\n\nMost of the hostages who have been freed so far emerged as a result of diplomatic negotiations.\n\nTalks toward a ceasefire that could have seen more hostages released collapsed in July.\n\n\"They [the government] are fanatic. They are doing things against the interests of the country,\" said Rami Dar, 69-year-old retiree who travelled from a nearby suburb outside of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe city has seen frequent rallies urging the government to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, who ignited the war with their October 2023 attack.\n\nSaturday's demonstration attracted over 100,000 protesters, according to organisers.\n\n\"Frankly, I'm not an expert or anything, but I feel that after two years of fighting there has been no success,\" said Yana, 45, who attended the rally with her husband and two children.\n\n\"I wonder whether additional lives for both sides, not just the Israelis but also Gazans, will make any difference.\"\n\nAbout 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza during Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. \n\nMore than 400 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since then.\n\nProtesters waved Israeli flags and carried placards bearing the images of hostages.\n\nOthers held signs directing anger at the government or urging Mr Trump to take action to stop Mr Netanyahu from moving forward with plans to escalate the war.\n\nA small number of protesters held images of Gazan children killed by the military.\n\nIsrael's military has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians in the war, according to the Gazan health ministry, which said on Saturday that at least 39 had been killed in the past day.\n\nSome of the Israeli prime minister's far-right coalition allies have been pushing for a total takeover of Gaza. \n\nThe military has warned this could endanger the lives of the hostages in Gaza.\n\nFar-right minister Bezalel Smotrich, a proponent of continuing the war, issued a statement on Saturday criticising Netanyahu and called for the annexation of large parts of Gaza.\n\nThe announcement from the prime minister's office early on Friday said the military would take Gaza City, but did not explicitly say if Israeli forces would take all of the enclave.\n\nTal, a 55-year-old high school teacher, told Reuters at the rally in Tel Aviv that expanding the war was \"terrible\", warning it would result in the deaths of both soldiers and hostages and insisting that the war should end with the military withdrawing.\n\n\"We don't have anything to do there.

Knowing Russia, where there is a second, there will be a third.”\n\nHe also said that any peace agreement that excluded Ukraine would be a decision “against peace”.\n\nIn their statement, the European leaders said they welcomed Mr Trump’s “work to stop the killing in Ukraine, end the Russian Federation’s war of aggression and achieve just and lasting peace and security for Ukraine”.\n\nAdding that they were “ready to support this work diplomatically” and through military and financial support for Kyiv, they reiterated the need for “robust and credible security guarantees” for Ukraine and their own “unwavering support” for the country.\n\nThe statement also comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy hosted a meeting of top Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers alongside US vice-president JD Vance on Saturday.\n\nThe meeting took place at the Foreign Secretary’s official country retreat, Chevening, in Kent, where Mr Vance is staying at the start of a UK holiday.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr Lammy said: “The UK’s support for Ukraine remains ironclad as we continue working towards a just and lasting peace.”\n\nIt is understood that the meeting had been called at Washington’s request, and included representatives from the US, Ukraine, France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland as well as the UK.\n\nUkraine was represented by Rustem Umerov, secretary of the country’s national security and defence council, and the head of Mr Zelensky’s office, Andriy Yermak.\n\nIn a post on social media, Mr Yermak said the allies’ positions were “clear” that “a reliable, lasting peace is only possible with Ukraine at the negotiating table, with full respect for our sovereignty and without recognising the occupation”.\n\nAhead of the meeting at Chevening, Sir Keir discussed the talks in a call with Mr Zelensky on Saturday, and also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict continues, with Ukrainian authorities reporting four people killed and 16 wounded in Russian drone strikes on Saturday in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.","summary":"In a joint statement they said ‘meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ukraine-vladimir-putin-keir-starmer-jd-vance-europe-b1242248.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/08/09/23/07-dc5218346e37465f901ba680c998ba4d.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-09 22:30:43","author":"Christopher McKeon","authors":["Christopher McKeon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.021}]}
