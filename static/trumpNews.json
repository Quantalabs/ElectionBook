Not everyone agrees though, certainly not the ones who contribute to the mess or those who thrive on it, and certainly not the moneyed M&Ms of the world—Microsoft and Mercedes, Mark and Musk. But, then, they are not of this world anyway. They inhabit a distant galaxy. While most people feel the pincer pinch of inflation, infection and inequality, trillionaires' wealth rockets to MoM-z14, the farthest observed galaxy, 33.8 billion light-years from planet earth. Experts attribute many reasons for this global gloom. War, polarisation, corruption, aggressive geopolitics and AI. People feel online trends have aggravated this mess. But, 25 years ago, when the internet dawned into our lives, the world brimmed with optimism, expectations and possibilities. 'But that optimism has curdled into cynicism,' mourns Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder. So, what went wrong? Wales answers, 'The defining difference between web 1.0 and the platforms that dominate today is not technological sophistication but moral architecture.' Moral architecture depends on good governance. Algorithms and AI determine the content consumed by billions of users. They are a force for good, but how they function remains opaque. Wales argues for implementing 'structural transparency', or clearly outlining 'where data originated, how it is processed and what uncertainty' surrounds it. He says, 'Think of it as nutritional labelling for information.' But powerful forces strive to strangle AI regulation. The troika of Silicon Valley lobbyists, $100 million moneybags and slick spin-doctors hatched a plan, backed by Donald Trump, to restrict US states from regulating AI companies. MAGA supporters and even some Republicans accuse Trump of appeasing Big Tech donors. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican hawk, sniggers, 'Shows what money can do.' Money is doing terrible things everywhere, adding to global gloom. Tuna is big business with a $50 billion global market. But tuna-fishing fleets starve, overwork, beat their 'bonded' migrant crew, who haul fishing lines that stretch for kilometres on voyages that last for years. 'Abuse on these vessels is industrial, systemic,' says human rights investigator, Steve Trent. Luxury brands tolerate worker abuse by subcontractors. A South African government probe reveals the nexus between rogue police officials and gangsters who bribe the judiciary, swindle state hospitals of millions of dollars and terrorise honest officials by 'threatening to burn them in their cars'. Moral crisis in football has led to rampant illegal betting, match-fixing and on-field punching. 'Football does not take place in outer space. The scandals are a magnifying glass of all the problems in today's society, especially the erosion of the rule of law, lack of transparency, accountability and legal impunity,' bemoans Turkish sociologist Daghan Irak. The internet, today, is a microcosm, spawning good solutions and bad problems ranging from predatory apps to data centres' guzzling of precious water, teenage suicides after conversations with chatbots to societal dangers from scams, financial bubbles and job losses. Wales says the best way to survive this onslaught is to embed transparency, independence and empathy into the digital architecture itself. 'It was done before. It can be done again,' he promises. But when big money talks, public good walks—away. Collective will to restore sense and sensibility seems feeble. Solutions sound like closing the door after the horse has bolted. The stallions of the universe gallop beyond MoM-z14 while earthlings, saddled with messy problems, can never catch up. Astronomers say MoM is unreachable, receding from earth due to cosmic expansion. The phenomenon—and the distance—is cosmological. And metaphorical.

(Photo: Kasey Williams) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in town centres, during the busy Christmas period.\n\nAssistant Commissioner of Police assigned to the Strategic Operations Portfolio and the Public Safety and Traffic Enforcement Branch, Dr Gary McKenzie, said the police will be clamping down on motorists who block other persons from moving freely.\n\n“One of the things that we tend to do as Jamaicans is that we want to park right where we’re going, we want to stop and go right into our building. But that will not work, because that causes a lot of double parking. People park on roadways obstructing traffic; there is a lot of parking on sidewalks. When that is done, pedestrians have to retreat to the roadways and that causes potential dangers for them,” he stated, during a Jamaica Information Service Think Tank held on December 8.\n\n“We will not tolerate obstruction through parking or vehicles being abandoned. When you return, the [vehicles] might not be there because we have to ensure that there are no delays, because whenever we have delays, then we have frustration and there is the propensity for persons to try and get by through careless and dangerous means,” he added.\n\nMcKenzie stressed that vehicles will be impounded, and owners will not be able to retrieve their vehicles without facing prosecution.\n\n“Tickets will be issued. What we want is that persons… use the parking lots, and in the Yuletide season, we encourage carpooling. We are very happy that there are improvements in our public service bus system and that is one option, but carpooling is also another,” he said.\n\nMcKenzie noted that, while the high volume of traffic is inevitable during the period, once order is maintained, people will be able to go about their business in an orderly fashion.\n\n“There are times when you simply can’t find anywhere else to send traffic. But once there’s order, people will eventually make their way. So, our strategy is to maintain order and to ensure that people conform with the law as they seek to go about their business,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Christmas Police Traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2025 the breakout year for singer Tony Roy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Whenever Tony Roy reflects on his career, he is likely to pinpoint 2025 as the year he got the big breakthrough.

Both tables are compiled by respected broadcaster Clinton Lindsay.\n\nI’d Love You to Want Me, also made an appearance in the Jamaica Music Countdown Chart. That was significant for the Maryland-based singer.\n\n“To have a presence on the Jamaica chart for Tony Roy means a lot. I am very happy to know that even though I am based overseas, I do have an impact in Jamaica, my home,” he said.\n\nInterestingly, when he first heard I’d Love You to Want Me in 2021, it was not the original. While on vacation in Las Vegas, a reggae version by John Holt caught his attention and he was instantly hooked.\n\nLater, Tony Roy got acquainted with Lobo’s original which peaked at number two on the Billboard Magazine Hot 100 in 1972. Holt’s rendition, from his 1,000 Volts of Holt album, was a big hit in the United Kingdom one year later.\n\nTony Roy co-produced his version with Wayne Holness, who also played bass guitar and keyboards.\n\nFrom St Thomas parish in eastern Jamaica, he migrated to the United States during the 1990s. For 30 years, Tony Roy has been a popular figure on the Baltimore/Washington DC reggae scene.\n\nOn My Mind, done for his Whylas Records, is the follow-up to I’d Love You to Want Me.\n\n— Howard Campbell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Entertainment music Tony Roy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth residents receive land titles \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — More than 700 residents of St Elizabeth across 34 communities are now proud landowners under the Government’s Systematic Land ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JPS advises of temporary road closures in St James \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica— The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) is advising the motoring public, that in order to support critical electricity grid restoration wo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Montego Bay mayor calls for community support as Clean-Up Day set for Sunday \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Mayor of Montego Bay, Councillor Richard Vernon is calling for support from the wider St James community as they seek to carry out... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump vows to ‘retaliate’ after IS attack kills US troops in Syria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States (US) would retaliate after two US troops and a civilian ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police constable dies in vehicular collision \n\n\n\n\n BY KEDIESHA PERRY Observer writer \n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has confirmed the death of a policeman following a motor vehicle collision in St Elizabet... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PNP caretaker demands answers after student allegedly falls from overcrowded school bus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n PORTLAND, Jamaica —People’s National Party (PNP) Caretaker for Portland Western, Doreen Campbell, is demanding answers following what she describes as... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Andrew Holness (right) shares a moment with a land title recipient, Charmaine Dennis Treasure (left) and her daughter, during a land titling ceremony held at the Lacovia Community Centre in St. Elizabeth on Friday (December 12). \n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth residents receive land titles \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — More than 700 residents of St Elizabeth across 34 communities are now proud landowners under the Government’s Systematic Land Registration (SLR) Programme.\n\nDuring the land titling ceremony held at the Lacovia Community Centre in the parish on Friday 50 residents received their titles.\n\nIn his remarks, Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness said land titles are instruments of economic empowerment and building blocks of a safer and more prosperous Jamaica.\n\nHe reported that as of December 1, the National Land Agency (NLA) had distributed 9,577 certificates of title under the programme. Of that number, nearly 6,000 were handed over in St Elizabeth.\n\n“For many, this title is the first piece of paper in generations that definitively states this land is yours. It formalises the sacrifices made by parents and grandparents and opens the door to new economic opportunities,” Holness stated.\n\nHe explained that under the programme, the government has taken on the legal cost of surveying the land.\n\n“We have taken on the fees for surveying, and we have set up a system of processing these titles to ensure that Jamaicans can regularise ownership and secure their land,” he noted.\n\nThrough the SLR programme, persons who have been in open, undisturbed, and undisputed possession of land for 12 years or more are afforded the opportunity to obtain titles for these lands.\n\nThe initiative is playing a key role in increasing socio-economic security and stability, by affording persons the opportunity to acquire property.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Infrastructure Development with responsibility for Land Titling and Settlements, Robert Montague, described the event as historic. He underscored the reach of the programme across the parish.\n\n“Communities like Lacovia, Essex Valley, Flagaman, Southfield, Rose Hall, Tryall, Top Hill… just to name a few, are benefiting from this. For many of you, this is the first time in your family’s history that the land you live on, farm on, and have raised your children on will finally bear your name,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa land titles St Elizabeth \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JPS advises of temporary road closures in St James \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica— The Jamaica Public Service (JPS) is advising the motoring public, that in order to support critical electricity grid restoration wo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Montego Bay mayor calls for community support as Clean-Up Day set for Sunday \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Mayor of Montego Bay, Councillor Richard Vernon is calling for support from the wider St James community as they seek to carry out... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump vows to ‘retaliate’ after IS attack kills US troops in Syria \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States (US) would retaliate after two US troops and a civilian ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police constable dies in vehicular collision \n\n\n\n\n BY KEDIESHA PERRY Observer writer \n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) has confirmed the death of a policeman following a motor vehicle collision in St Elizabet... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PNP caretaker demands answers after student allegedly falls from overcrowded school bus \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n PORTLAND, Jamaica —People’s National Party (PNP) Caretaker for Portland Western, Doreen Campbell, is demanding answers following what she describes as... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Haitians dance with joy over UNESCO musical listing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n From the bars of the capital Port-au-Prince to Haiti's most remote villages and its worldwide diaspora, people listen and dance to the sensual rhythms... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Colombian guerrillas place communities in lockdown citing Trump ‘intervention’ threats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n BOGOTA, Colombia (AFP) — Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group ordered civilians in areas under its control on Friday to stay hom... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Activities are set to get underway by 7:00am.\n\n“This is a city wide initiative supported by our stakeholders to reclaim our public spaces,” said Vernon who is also urging individuals to continue doing the work to make their own space clean.\n\n“I appeal to every resident, clean your own space, then join your neighbours. Your hands and your heart are the fastest way to recovery,” he said.\n\nThe mayor has acknowledged the support of members of the diaspora, in particular American Friends of Jamaica who contributed USD $25,000 to the Mayor’s Charity Fund to undertake clean-up efforts across the city.\n\n“This will certainly aid our restoration efforts as we steadily move back to normal,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: cleanup Hurricane Melissa Montego Bay \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police Federation expresses condolences following death of traffic cop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Police Federation has expressed condolences to the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and colleagues of Constable Er... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Roy reflects on ‘I’d Love You to Want Me’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Whenever Tony Roy reflects on his career, he is likely to pinpoint 2025 as the year he got the big breakthrough.

So far, we have processed 212 expedited relief authorisations and moved an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 metric tonnes of relief cargo. For civil aviation, I can say we exceeded all recovery targets and remain a critical driver of national relief and recovery efforts”.\n\nRegarding the seaports, the port community offered extended Saturday hours from November 15 to December 13, with Kingston Wharves lengthening its weekday gate operations to 6:00 pm through to December 23, to manage peak season volumes and support hurricane relief shipments.\n\nKingston Wharves also opened its warehouses on November 29, December 6 and 13, and will offer services on December 20.\n\nTurning to Petrojam, the minister said the country’s fuel supply remains stable and secure. He reported that since October 30, more than 3,600 tankers have been loaded at the Kingston facility along with over 60 tankers at the Montego Bay site, which is back to normal loading operations.\n\n“This is good news, especially for the west, and our national fuel inventory remains within the internationally accepted comfort range of two to three weeks supply,” said Vaz.\n\nHe told the briefing that shipments continue to arrive following the completion of the refinery’s maintenance shutdown on November 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Daryl Vaz Hurricane Melissa transport \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police Federation expresses condolences following death of traffic cop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Police Federation has expressed condolences to the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and colleagues of Constable Er... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Roy reflects on ‘I’d Love You to Want Me’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Whenever Tony Roy reflects on his career, he is likely to pinpoint 2025 as the year he got the big breakthrough.

We are nearly 300,000 visitors since we have started to operate again,” he declared.\n\nFollowing the storm, there was major destruction in some areas, and the Minister was quick to highlight the rebound of the sector that is still in the process of rebuilding.\n\nDespite that, he pointed out that entry into the country is not a problem for visitors.\n\n“The first area that I wanted the world to understand that’s ready is our points of entry, the airports of Jamaica. All three airports are ready, and MBJ sets the stage this morning, and let us show the world that yes, we are ready,” said Bartlett.\n\nHe said this shows the resilience of the country, and sought to highlight the scope of the devastation that Jamaica faced.\n\n“For a little country, just the size of the King’s Ranch of Texas, having the worst weather event in, arguably, the history of the northern hemisphere – western, if you want to call it any hemisphere, because the climatologists and the meteorologists and all of those who measure the intensity of weather events are still to determine whether Melissa was a Category 5…or a Category X, and to have survived 185 miles an hour winds with gusts of 252 miles per hour in places,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa Jamaica Tourism \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police Federation expresses condolences following death of traffic cop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Police Federation has expressed condolences to the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and colleagues of Constable Er... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Roy reflects on ‘I’d Love You to Want Me’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Whenever Tony Roy reflects on his career, he is likely to pinpoint 2025 as the year he got the big breakthrough.

Posting on Truth Social, Trump said, “They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim.”However, Thailand’s foreign ministry swiftly disputed the ceasefire assertion, while defence officials reported that clashes were still ongoing.Thai Prime Minister Anutin contradicted Trump’s version of events, saying Bangkok would continue military operations until Cambodia no longer posed a threat to Thai sovereignty. In a Facebook post on Saturday, he said, “Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people. I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke.”.preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Anutin also took strong exception to Trump’s description of a land mine explosion that wounded Thai soldiers, which the US president had called an accident. “It’s definitely not a roadside accident,” Anutin wrote, insisting Thailand viewed the incident as a deliberate act of aggression.Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said some of Trump’s remarks did not “reflect an accurate understanding of the situation.” He added that Thailand was hurt by Trump appearing to rely on what he described as distorted information, noting that Thailand is “the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,” according to a report by the Associated Press.Cambodia has stopped short of directly confirming Trump’s ceasefire claim but has accused Thailand of pressing ahead with attacks. Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a social media post that “On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs” on multiple targets inside Cambodian territory, adding that “Thai forces have not stopped the bombing yet and are still continuing the bombing,”.Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said he spoke with Trump on Friday night and earlier with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, thanking both leaders “for their continuous efforts to achieve a long-lasting peace between Cambodia and Thailand.” He added, “Cambodia is ready to cooperate in any way that is needed,” but made no direct reference to an agreed ceasefire.Malaysia has played a key mediation role since earlier this year. The initial ceasefire in July was brokered by Kuala Lumpur and pushed through after Trump threatened to withhold trade privileges unless both sides agreed. The deal was further detailed during a regional meeting in Malaysia in October that Trump attended.Despite those efforts, violence has escalated again. More than two dozen people have been officially reported killed in the past week, while displacement has crossed half a million. Thailand has acknowledged that 15 of its soldiers were killed, while estimating Cambodian military fatalities at 165. Cambodia has not confirmed military losses but has said at least 11 civilians were killed and more than 60 wounded.The fighting was triggered by a December 7 skirmish that injured two Thai soldiers and effectively derailed the July truce. Thailand has since carried out airstrikes on what it says are military targets, while Cambodia has fired thousands of BM-21 rockets, which are difficult to precisely target and have caused widespread damage, according to an Associated Press report.Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for helping resolve multiple international conflicts since returning to office in January and reiterated on Friday that the Thailand-Cambodia situation had been “straightened out.” Yet with fresh strikes reported on both sides, the ceasefire he announced appears, for now, to remain elusive.- EndsPublished By: Anuja JhaPublished On: Dec 13, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/thailand-cambodia-clashes-continue-even-as-trump-claims-truce-is-back-on-2835567-2025-12-13","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/thailand-cambodia-clash-130528842-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=8nrB.4VLob9oV7a.V7DbaVYKLGF6ig6n?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 15:23:16","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":386966954,"title":"Trump strips legal protections from Ethiopian refugees in latest crackdown","text":"The US ends Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Ethiopians, affecting around 5 000 refugees, effective February 2026. The decision cites Ethiopia’s recovery, despite ongoing violence and US travel warnings urging caution due to instability. The move aligns with President Trump’s immigration crackdown, criticised for racial bias and deportation-focused policies.\n\nThe United States has ended temporary legal protections for thousands of Ethiopian nationals, ordering them to leave the country within 60 days or face arrest and deportation.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision on Friday, determining that conditions in Ethiopia “no longer pose a serious threat” to returning nationals despite ongoing violence in parts of the country.\n\nThe move affects approximately 5 000 refugees who fled armed conflict and is the latest action in the administration’s hardline crackdown to remove legal protections from at least one million people across multiple countries.\n\nThe termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Ethiopia takes effect in early February 2026, giving current beneficiaries two months to either leave the United States voluntarily or find an alternative legal basis to remain. Those who force authorities to arrest them “may never be allowed to return,” according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.\n\nThe decision comes despite the State Department’s own travel advisory for Ethiopia, which urges Americans to “reconsider” travel to the country due to “sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping”.\n\nThe advisory, still in effect, warns that multiple regions remain off-limits and that the US embassy is “unlikely to be able to assist with departure from the country if the security situation deteriorates”.\n\nREAD | Not in our name: Afrikaners respond to the misuse of their story in US politics\n\nFederal authorities justified the termination by citing peace agreements signed in recent years, including a 2022 ceasefire in Tigray and a December 2024 deal in Oromia. Analysts have also warned of the risk of renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nThe Federal Register notice acknowledged that “some sporadic and episodic violence occurs” but claimed improvements in healthcare, food security and internal displacement figures demonstrated the country’s recovery.\n\nHowever, the notice also cited national interest concerns, including Ethiopian visa overstay rates that exceed the global average by more than 250% and unspecified national security investigations involving some TPS holders.\n\nThe Ethiopian termination is part of a broader pattern under President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved to end protections for nationals from Haiti, Venezuela, Somalia, South Sudan and other countries since returning to office.\n\nHis administration has dismissed many nations as “Third World” countries, a term that is largely no longer used due to its pejorative connotations for developing nations.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Trump has escalated inflammatory racist attacks on Minnesota’s large Somali community in particular, including calling Somali immigrants “garbage” and directing a surge of ICE agents into the state, alarming residents and drawing criticism.\n\nREAD | ‘Afrikaners fleeing persecution’ in SA will be the only ‘refugees’ allowed into the US\n\nAs of March 2025, approximately 1.3 million people held TPS in the United States, according to the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based research and advocacy organisation.\n\nTrump has identified immigration control as central to his national security strategy, with the document published this month describing migration policies in Europe and elsewhere as contributing to what they term “civilisational erasure,” a far-right theory which has been comprehensively debunked.\n\nThe approach has drawn sharp criticism for its racial selectivity. While terminating protections for Ethiopians who fled documented armed conflict, the administration simultaneously opened a refugee resettlement programme for white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity, claiming “race-based discrimination”. That discrimination has been rejected by the South African government and by a number of Afrikaners themselves.\n\nScott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera the contrast revealed a “perverse honesty” about the administration’s priorities.\n\n“If you’re white and you’ve got connections, you get in,” he said. \n\nLegal challenges have mounted against several TPS terminations, with courts temporarily blocking some decisions.\n\nEthiopian TPS beneficiaries can continue working during the 60-day transition period, but after the deadline, anyone without an alternative legal status becomes subject to immediate arrest and removal.\n\nThe administration has offered what it calls a “complimentary plane ticket” and “$1 000 exit bonus” to those who depart voluntarily using a mobile app to report their departure.","url":"https://www.news24.com/world/trump-strips-legal-protections-from-ethiopian-refugees-in-latest-crackdown-20251213-0899","image":"https://news24cobalt.24.co.za/resources/02a0-1f6de02a4b7d-c42de0ea6a89-1000/format/inline/gettyimages-2240003196.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 15:02:07","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"za","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":386966392,"title":"The American Circus With Evil Clowns","text":"America will come back to its senses.

The family of the President of the United States has made billions of dollars in personal wealth since Donald Trump took office. This does not include illicit money that was made during Trump’s previous corrupt term. His son-in-law walked away with two billion dollars from the Saudis.

Now they are taking legal action against President Donald Trump to stop him from building a ballroom near the White House.\n\nEver since Trump announced the project, Democrats have been clutching their pearls despite remaining silent when former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush also did renovations on the building.\n\nFrom The Hill:\n\nA preservation group filed a lawsuit Friday against the White House over President Trump’s $300 million ballroom construction project — which is mostly funded by private donors.The National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States is requesting an injunction to pause the project and ensure the public has a chance to weigh in on the new development.Trump did not inform or consult with the public, members of Congress or historically aligned groups before demolition of the East Wing began earlier this year.“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit reads. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”“President Trump’s efforts to do so should be immediately halted, and work on the Ballroom Project should be paused until the Defendants complete the required,” lawyers for the historic preservation group wrote.The Trump administration began demolishing portions of the East Wing in October to make room for a new 90,000 square foot ballroom. The site — which Trump promised Thursday would be finished in a year and a half — is set to host state dinners, galas and events held on campus.“I want to welcome you all to the White House. It’s an honor to have you. It’s a special place. You know, for 150 years, they’ve been trying to do a ballroom,” the president said during the Congressional Ball.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, representing the first major legal challenge to President Trump’s planned 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition.Read more: https://t.co/xZxtdqyUNy pic.twitter.com/8PO4vMkrsf— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) December 12, 2025\n\nWhat’s ironic is that most of the funding for the ballroom does not come from taxpayers — yet taxpayer funds will be spent to adjudicate this silly lawsuit.\n\nAfter the project was announced, a group of Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to the president complaining about it. They argued that the project is happening in secrecy, without proper public disclosure or oversight. The lawmakers pointed to supposed concerns over transparency, funding, and the safety of the White House building.\n\nJUST IN: YouTube will pay $24.5M to settle a lawsuit with President Trump over his 2021 account suspension, with $22M of the settlement earmarked for the Trust for the National Mall to support White House ballroom construction. pic.twitter.com/MXBUXNpRAb— Fox News (@FoxNews) September 30, 2025\n\nThe letter criticizes Trump for constructing the ballroom while millions of Americans are losing health care and food assistance while the Schumer shutdown was in effect. \n\nAgain, none of these people had a problem when previous presidents made renovations — even though Americans were going through difficult times. Regardless of where one lands on the construction of the ballroom, it is clear Democrats are simply looking for something to whine about — as usual.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

During a recent public appearance, the president left political observers and internet sleuths alike scratching their heads after he appeared to completely dissociate himself from the paternity of his youngest son, Barron.The incident occurred late on Thursday night at an event where the 78-year-old was discussing Melania Trump's latest project. In what critics are describing as a moment of 'bizarre' detachment, he referred to the 18-year-old Barron not as his son, nor even as 'our' son, but explicitly as Melania's alone.'I just heard about that for the first time. The only thing I can tell you, I know one thing for sure, it's going to be great for children,' he told the crowd, referring to Melania's initiative. 'I don't know what it is she's doing. She loves children'. However, it was his follow-up comment that truly ignited the controversy: 'She's got a wonderful boy. And she's very proud of her boy'.Donald Trump Distances Himself From Paternity in Bizarre SlipThe specific phrasing — 'She's got a wonderful boy' — immediately struck a discordant note with those listening. In the lexicon of family values that the Republican party often champions, the use of the singular 'she' rather than the collective 'we' stood out as remarkably odd. To many, it sounded less like a father speaking about his own flesh and blood, and more like a distant relative or an acquaintance complimenting a colleague's child.Critics online were quick to note that it appeared Trump was distancing himself from Barron, his youngest child, entirely. The slip of the tongue — if indeed it was a slip — provided immediate fodder for his detractors, who have long scrutinised the family dynamics within the Trump clan.Washington Post reporter Matt Viser was among the first to highlight the absurdity of the statement on social media. He quoted the president saying, 'She's got a wonderful boy. She's very proud of her boy', before dryly adding the necessary context for those who might have forgotten the family tree: 'President Trump says of First Lady Melania Trump, with whom he shares a son, Barron'.The reaction from the liberal sphere was even less charitable. Liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen captured the general mood of confusion with a simple, incredulous question posted to his followers: 'Uh, SHE'S got a wonderful boy?'Meanwhile, Will Cutlip did not mince his words, accusing Donald Trump of 'just babbling incoherently...' rather than making a calculated statement. The implication being that this was not a strategic distancing, but another example of the rambling rhetoric that has plagued his recent campaign appearances.Online Critics Question Donald Trump Over 'Monstrous' PhrasingAs the clip circulated, the commentary shifted from confusion to outright ridicule and wild speculation. The internet, known for its lack of restraint, began to spin theories about why a father would speak about his son with such unfamiliarity.The account 'Republicans against Trump' also quoted the president's words: 'Donald Trump on Melania: \"She loves children. She's got a wonderful boy. And she's very proud of her boy.\"' This prompted a user known as 'Former Republican' to respond with a theory accompanied by photographic evidence, suggesting a resemblance to another public figure: 'Yup, she has a son with Tom McMillen: Barron Thomas Trump'.While such paternity theories are standard fare for internet conspiracy mills, the emotional detachment in Trump's language drew more serious criticism regarding his parenting style. DJ Omega MVP remarked that the comment was 'a pretty weird way for a dad to talk about his own son'. They went further, condemning the entire family dynamic with a scathing assessment: 'They're all such bizarrely monstrous people'.Others joined the chorus of disbelief. Media strategist Todd Domke chimed in with a rhetorical question that underscored the absurdity of the situation, asking simply about Melania's son: 'What's his name?' implying that Trump himself might have momentarily forgotten.Former educator Nicole Hodges offered perhaps the most cutting remark of the evening, tapping into the long-standing gossip that has followed the Trumps for years. She chimed in, saying, 'I think we all knew he wasn't his'.While the Trump campaign has yet to clarify the remarks, the incident serves as another reminder of the intense scrutiny placed on the former president's every word. Whether it was a linguistic stumble or a Freudian slip revealing the true state of his relationship with Barron, the comment 'She's got a wonderful boy' has certainly left a lasting impression.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/shes-got-wonderful-boy-trump-addresses-son-barron-odd-way-leads-bizarre-new-theory-1762711","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1775313/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=932c333c88cf36f1ea3703334f09239a","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 12:25:42","author":"Welbert Bauyaban","authors":["Welbert Bauyaban"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":386960906,"title":"Marjorie Taylor Greene Allegedly Plotting to Oust House Speaker Mike Johnson With Nine Votes","text":"The fractious internal war consuming the Republican Party threatens to culminate in one final, chaotic explosion before the new year. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the firebrand Georgia congresswoman who became synonymous with the MAGA movement before her spectacular public fallout with President Donald Trump, is reportedly orchestrating a 'longshot' bid to decapitate the House leadership on her way out the door.With her resignation set for Jan. 5, 2026, Greene appears poised to leave Washington not with a wave, but with a legislative hand grenade aimed squarely at House Speaker Mike Johnson.Marjorie Taylor Greene Weighs Final Coup AttemptAccording to reports circulating Capitol Hill, Greene is quietly tallying support for a motion to oust Speaker Johnson before her departure. The congresswoman, whose relationship with the party's upper echelons has disintegrated into open hostility, is reportedly gauging whether she can secure the nine Republican votes necessary to trigger the vacate motion.'Marjorie is approaching members to get to nine who will oust the speaker,' an insider allegedly told MS Now. 'And if we don't get to work on codifying Trump's agenda, anything can happen'.While Greene has publicly dismissed the specific reporting as 'not true', the denial rings hollow to observers who have watched her wage a months-long campaign of attrition against Johnson. She previously attempted to remove him last year over Ukraine foreign aid and has since branded him 'weak' for his handling of healthcare costs and the government shutdown battles.Her fury has only intensified following her alienation from Donald Trump — a schism sparked by her insistence on releasing the unredacted Jeffrey Epstein files. Trump, who once embraced Greene as a key ally, has recently derided her as a 'traitor' and a 'rotten apple', isolating her further within the caucus she once sought to lead.Stefanik Joins Marjorie Taylor Greene in RebellionGreene is not the only high-profile Republican voicing doubts about Johnson's grip on the gavel. Representative Elise Stefanik, who formally announced her candidacy for Governor of New York in the 2026 election last month, has added her voice to the chorus of discontent.Stefanik, arguably looking to burnish her anti-establishment credentials ahead of a tough gubernatorial fight against Kathy Hochul, offered a withering assessment of the Speaker's standing. 'He certainly wouldn't have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow,' Stefanik told The Wall Street Journal. 'I believe that the majority of Republicans would vote for new leadership. It's that widespread.'The timing of these attacks is perilous for the GOP. With a slim majority hanging by a thread and the 2026 midterms looming, the party is beset by infighting over affordability and healthcare — issues on which Johnson has struggled to unite his conference. The Speaker himself admits the role has become a relentless grind.'I haven't had a vacation day in two years. I haven't been off in two years, literally,' Johnson confessed on a recent podcast. 'Last Christmas, I was taking calls from members with their drama. It takes everything out of whomever serves in the position, and by extension, their family'. He likened the job to being a 'firefighter' who must 'put out fires every hour'.Despite the turmoil, Trump has publicly stood by Johnson, recently calling him a 'fantastic speaker' capable of managing a 'very small majority'. Yet, as Greene prepares to exit the stage, the threat of one last act of defiance looms large, promising that her final days in Congress will be just as volatile as her first.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/marjorie-taylor-greene-allegedly-plotting-oust-house-speaker-mike-johnson-nine-votes-1762710","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768849/marjorie-taylor-greene.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=2a8d5b194dff7b832c7fc9b3750320b4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 12:11:59","author":"Welbert Bauyaban","authors":["Welbert Bauyaban"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":386960886,"title":"'I Need You Right Now, Pedophiles': Trump Campaign Email Sent to Epstein After His Death, Records Claim","text":"The toxic legacy of the convicted sex offender has once again collided head-on with the world of American politics. New records have just emerged, shedding a horrifying light on the bizarre and deeply troubling association between the late financier and President Donald Trump.What these newly released files show is a connection that, astonishingly, persisted well beyond Epstein's 2019 death — specifically, an email account used by Epstein was not only kept active, but was being routinely sent campaign alerts, using language that is genuinely jaw-dropping.The core of this latest revelation, obtained by the non-profit whistleblower group Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), concerns an account linked to Epstein, identified as 'jeeproject@yahoo.com'. Even a year after Epstein's supposed suicide in a New York jail cell, this address was clearly still receiving correspondence from the Republican campaign machine.The truly shocking element, however, is the sickeningly personalised language used in the emails sent directly from Donald Trump's own 2020 presidential re-election campaign. These were not generic bulk mailings.One email, dated Oct. 27, 2020, and signed off by the former president himself, contained a line that beggars belief: 'I need you right now, Pedophiles,' it read. This grotesque greeting was not a one-off error. An earlier message, sent on Oct. 1, 2020, also bearing Trump's signature, stated: 'Pedophiles, I want you to know how important you are to me'.The documents show the campaign also sent the account a message on Sept. 14, 2020, saying: 'Pedophiles, I am so proud to be your president,' and another on Oct 25, 2020, reading: 'I'm turning to my strongest supporters, like Pedophiles'.The implication of a presidential campaign using such a hideous term as a form of address, even if the address had been pseudonymously altered after Epstein's death, speaks to a breathtaking lapse in oversight, or perhaps something far worse. The records show the account was addressed under a 'shocking new name' after Epstein's death, which became the default salutation used by the campaign's automated system.The Obsession and the Orbits: New Links Between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald TrumpThese recent emails only deepen the already extraordinary, well-documented links between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump. The late financier was reportedly 'obsessed' with the president for years. The same batch of newly released emails reveals that Epstein had gone so far as to purchase 'basically every major exposé' about the president, suggesting a highly unusual and intense focus.The extent of their documented relationship has been laid bare in earlier disclosures, too. When the House Oversight Committee released its mammoth tranche of 20,000 pages of files from Epstein's estate last month, Mr .Trump was confirmed as the single-most mentioned individual across the documents.Their connection spanned decades. Epstein once boasted that the businessman-turned-politician was his 'closest friend for 10 years'. Furthermore, Raw Story previously reported that the files showed Epstein would apparently coordinate his flights around Trump's, indicating a persistent pattern of proximity and interaction that went beyond casual acquaintance.The Political Cost of the Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump ScandalThe links are not just professional; they involve deeply personal details, too. The House Oversight Committee's release mentioned that Mr. Trump might have 'spent hours' with one of Epstein's victims at his home. There is also the concerning detail that Mr. Trump may have spent Thanksgiving with Epstein during his first term in office. We also know that during the 1990s, the future president flew on Epstein's notorious private jet at least seven times.With campaign messages continuing to be sent to a convicted sex offender's email address, even post-mortem, the level of entanglement between the two men continues to shock. This entire web of association —f rom the flights on the infamous jet to coordinating schedules and the sheer volume of mentions in Epstein's personal records — raises profound questions about the kind of company Mr. Trump kept during his rise to political power. These latest emails, with their appalling salutation, serve as a visceral reminder that the controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump is far from over.The revelation of these appalling, personalised emails from the 2020 campaign to an account linked to a convicted sex offender, coupled with the decades-long association between the two men, ensures the toxic controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump is far from over.

Six years later, Zelenskyy — transformed by the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion — is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington’s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine’s future. President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for “using war not to hold an election.” It’s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy’s government “illegitimate” and thus impossible to negotiate with. Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect. Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine’s cities. “I do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine’s allies help provide security on the ground. Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia’s February 2022 attack. After Trump’s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals “enabling changes to the legal framework” that would make elections possible. Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army. First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won’t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin’s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting. “Elections always involve crowds,” said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. “What do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.” The White House did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment on how the U.S. might help. Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote. Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions. To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached. Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine’s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy’s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. “I don’t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,” Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp. Kravchuk pointed to the country’s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. “Ukrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,” she said. Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote. It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. “But discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,” Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. “We are very far from the real end of this war,” she added. Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine’s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko. Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don’t seem to agree. An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll. Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said — Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief. Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy’s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. “It’s just these two,” he said. “Everyone else has much lower ratings.” “In the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,” marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday. Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. “No rockets, no [drones] — and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,” he said. “If all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,” Datsko added. “First, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,” he said. Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be “pointless” because he has lost his legitimacy after being too “afraid” to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy’s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal — something Moscow has frequently rejected. Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials’ democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford. “And calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,” Dill added.","summary":"When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/pressure-zelenskyy-trump-election-war-rcna248611","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-zelenskyy-rs-af6edb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 11:39:22","author":"Yuliya Talmazan","authors":["Yuliya Talmazan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":386959694,"title":"Many immigrants' final legal step — citizenship — has become harder under Trump","text":"Lawful permanent residents are seeing their naturalization ceremonies abruptly canceled this month as the Trump administration puts an indefinite “hold” on immigration applications from certain countries. The holds apply to green card and U.S. citizenship requests by people from 19 countries deemed “high risk” by the Trump administration. The list includes Cuba, Iran, Haiti and Somalia, among others. Lawful permanent residents, or green card holders, are already among the most thoroughly vetted individuals in the nation’s immigration system. When they decide to naturalize, they undergo an even more comprehensive government review that includes background checks, interviews with immigration officers and a citizenship test. The citizenship ceremony is the last step in a long process that starts with having a green card for several years, submitting the application, paying hundreds of dollars in fees, completing an interview with an immigration officer, passing a background check as well as an English and civics test, all before finally taking the oath. “If you’re scheduled for an oath ceremony, you have gone through all of the checks that are required,” said Deborah Chen, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection unit. The Trump administration’s new policy placing a hold on naturalization ceremonies for immigrants from the 19 countries is the latest among several other changes implemented this year that could make it more difficult for many lawful permanent residents to become U.S. citizens. In addition to the holds on immigration applications, the administration is cutting grants to groups that help prepare people to become citizens, implementing stricter social media vetting for those seeking citizenship, conducting neighborhood investigations into applicants’ “moral character,” and giving a more difficult civics test required for citizenship. Ready to become citizens — now 're-scrutinized' In Florida, Anyi Cabrales, who is Cuban, went to the salon on the morning of Dec. 1 to get her hair done ahead of her citizenship ceremony, she shared on social media. Cabrales told Noticias Telemundo she had been looking forward to the special occasion for the past eight months, but a few hours before being sworn in as a U.S. citizen she received a phone call from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official notifying her about the cancelation. In Massachusetts, a Haitian immigrant who has lived in the state for more than 20 years was pulled out of the line at her citizenship oath ceremony on Dec. 4, Gail Breslow, executive director of Project Citizenship, the legal services organization helping the woman, told NBC Boston. “It’s just because of this policy memo, all of a sudden, everyone from these 19 countries are going to be re-scrutinized,” NYLAG’s Chen said. Throughout the year, USCIS has been cutting back on naturalization ceremonies in smaller localities across the nation, many of them held in public or donated venues such as public libraries and historical sites and buildings like Oakland’s Paramount Theatre in California and the Oregon Historical Society in Portland. Last month, USCIS canceled naturalization ceremonies held in local courthouses across seven counties in upstate New York. Those ceremonies were quickly reinstated two days later following public outcry. This week, three of those counties had their ceremonies canceled again. In Ulster County, one of the counties affected, the cancelations are causing not just “emotional damage” to those ready to take their citizenship oath, said Victor Cueva, a naturalized citizen born in Peru who serves as the executive director of the Ulster Immigrant Defense Network. “There’s also legal damage.” Canceling these ceremonies, and in many cases not rescheduling them, Cueva said, “is a harm done to people that have gone through 99% of the naturalization process.” USCIS has said it wants to do away with judicial oath ceremonies, which take place at courthouses, and allow only administrative ceremonies that are held in USCIS field offices or other federal buildings. For some, the cancelations would mean that people would have to wait longer and travel farther outside their county to take their citizenship oath. USCIS did not respond to a request for comment. The agency previously told NBC News it had concerns about the efficient use of USCIS grants following the funding freeze in February. In a policy email made public by the Immigration Policy Tracking Project, USCIS said it stopped coordinating naturalization ceremonies in public venues, preferring to continue conducting them at USCIS field offices. President Donald Trump laid the foundation for a more strict naturalization process in his Jan. 20 executive order seeking to enhance vetting and screening efforts for migrants coming to the United States as well as those already in the country. About a month later, the Trump administration stopped disbursing USCIS grants to organizations providing English classes and civics instruction to lawful permanent residents getting ready for their citizenship interviews and tests. In Rhode Island, Channavy Chhay began noticing the ripple effects of these cutbacks. As the executive director of the Center for Southeast Asians, she works with many families who’ve come from Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. In a state that is home to one of the nation’s largest Southeast Asian refugee populations per capita, there are essentially no citizenship classes, Chhay said. The discontinuation of the USCIS grants jeopardized the support of four federally funded citizenship and immigration services programs in Rhode Island that helped lawful permanent residents go through the naturalization process. In June, following the travel ban on 19 “high risk“ countries including Laos and Myanmar, decisions on immigration applications from many in these communities stalled, Chhay said. After all immigration requests from people in these countries were indefinitely halted this month, it “just went dark.” “We haven’t seen anyone get sworn in or get the chance to even file to become U.S. citizens. We haven’t seen that at all for a long time,” said Chhay. Aside from USCIS’ use of criminal history checks by the FBI and biometric screening, between August and September the Trump administration reintroduced neighborhood investigations into prospective citizens’ “moral character” as well as stricter social media vetting of applicants. The agency has said the changes are part of a “multi-step overhaul” to restore “robust vetting for all aliens and stricter reviews.” In neighborhood investigations, immigration officers visit an applicant’s home to assess good “moral character” and interview neighbors, landlords, co-workers and other community members about the applicant. Some clients of the New York Legal Assistance Group who had pending naturalization applications when the new policies went into effect were denied because they owed taxes, even though they were on a payment plan, according to NYLAG’s Chen. “It used to be that if you didn’t have any arrests, that was good enough,” Chen said, adding “that’s not good enough” anymore. To prove “good moral character,” applicants must also show “positive attributes,” such as family caregiving, educational attainment, stable employment and community involvement. With the growing scrutiny, compounded by immigration officers’ wider discretion to determine if someone has “good moral character,” the organization began advising more clients to renew their green cards instead of going through the naturalization process, Chen said, to avoid any potential issues that could jeopardize a person’s legal immigration status. USCIS plans to soon open a vetting center in Atlanta that will use “powerful screening resources” and “state-of-the-art technologies” including artificial intelligence to review immigration applications, especially from “presidentially designated countries of concern,” according to a news release.","summary":"Green card holders are among the most thoroughly vetted individuals in the nation’s immigration system, but citizenship is currently uncertain for many of them.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-citizenship-harder-immigrants-green-cards-rcna248917","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251212-us-citizenship-cancellations-gk-3b0968.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 11:30:00","author":"Nicole Acevedo","authors":["Nicole Acevedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":0.017},{"id":386967420,"title":"St Elizabeth councillors unsure about rebuilding near Black River shoreline","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shoreline\nalong High Street\nin Black River\n(Photos: Karl\nMclarty) \n\n Central, News \n\nBY KASEY WILLIAMS Observer staff reporter kaseyw@jamaicaobserver.com \n December 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n St Elizabeth councillors unsure about rebuilding near Black River shoreline \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBLACK RIVER, St Elizabeth — Members of the St Elizabeth Municipal Corporation and a representative of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security on Thursday engaged in a lively debate on whether there should be rebuilding near the shoreline in this south-central town.\n\nBlack River was battered by strong winds and high waves from Category 5 Hurricane Melissa on October 28 which damaged or destroyed critical structures including Black River Hospital, schools, the courthouse, commercial buildings, and homes.\n\nMinority leader in the corporation Councillor Donovan Pagon (People’s National Party (PNP), Braes River Division) started the discussion when he asked for clarity on limitations for rebuilding the heritage-rich town.\n\n“Is there any truth to it that there is a hold on rebuilding on the shorelines of Black River. Is there any truth to that?” Pagon asked during the monthly meeting of the corporation held in Santa Cruz at Levon’s Plaza due to inadequate space in Black River and the lack of electricity there.\n\nIn response, Mayor of Black River Richard Solomon said an answer could not be provided immediately.\n\n“I don’t think anybody here can speak to that at this point, minority leader, so as we get further information as it relates to the whole development of the space we will communicate that information,” said Solomon.\n\nChief Executive Officer Errol Lebert chimed in as he sought to explain that any applications for rebuilding will take a “multi-agency approach”.\n\n“It is not one institution or agency’s decision to say ‘no’ or ‘yes’. However, we get comments from various agencies to say persons have sent in their building applications and we will give them the specific response,” said Lebert.\n\nSolomon added to Lebert’s response as he indicated that the municipality is willing to do some level of building approval in the interim.\n\n“What we are prepared to do in circumstances like these, once they meet the necessary criteria, is to do some pre-conditional approval to facilitate a redevelopment… The other agencies still have to do their due diligence, but in terms of getting up economic activities we can look at cases and where necessary we do discretionary approval,” said the mayor.\n\nLebert said the staff complement of more than 60 people in the municipal corporation have had to work in less than ideal conditions and on a flexi work week from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm daily.\n\nFormer Mayor of Black River Everton Fisher (PNP, Balaclava Division) urged Lebert to write to the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Local Government Marsha Henry-Martin for provisions to be made for suitable facilities for the corporation.\n\n“I think what we need to do for January is put us in a position where we can meet in a better setting… staff have said to me that the condition they are working in now is not good [in terms] of bathroom [facilities] and water [accessibility]. There are many challenges and a lot of people are just trying to make ends meet so that the corporation can run,” said Fisher.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Solomon told journalists that the municipal corporation will remain in Black River rather than move permanently to Santa Cruz.\n\n“We are not leaving Black River. We are going to build back stronger in that space… It is just something to sort of live with [for] a short space of time. As it relates to rebuilding it is a process. Nobody can expect, as it relates to building back better, that it is something that will be done immediately,” said Solomon.\n\n“There are a lot of processes involved in scoping, proper planning, so it is not something that will be done overnight, it is a process. We are still in the clean-up phase,” he added.\n\nSolomon said a “scaled down” Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony is tentatively set for December 22 in Black River.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police Federation expresses condolences following death of traffic cop \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST ELIZABETH, Jamaica — The Jamaica Police Federation has expressed condolences to the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and colleagues of Constable Er... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Police warn against obstructing traffic \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) will be taking a zero-tolerance approach to persons who obstruct the free flow of traffic in ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Roy reflects on ‘I’d Love You to Want Me’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Whenever Tony Roy reflects on his career, he is likely to pinpoint 2025 as the year he got the big breakthrough.

Dailey, a Denver-area resident who works for a human resources outsourcing solutions firm, thinks \"the back-and-forthing of the tariffs\" sowed market uncertainty, pushing up some costs. But he has seen other prices fall - he recently paid just $1.74 a gallon for gas. Overall, he rates Trump an 8 out of 10 on his handling of the cost of living. \"There's nothing the president has a magic wand on,\" said Dailey, who believes the president's tariffs and deregulatory agenda will eventually lower most everyday costs. Affordability is front and center in voters' minds as both parties gear up for next year's congressional midterm elections, with Republicans particularly concerned that continuing high prices could hurt their chances to retain control of Congress. After campaigning last year on promises to tame inflation, Trump has in recent weeks alternated between dismissing affordability problems as a hoax, blaming President Joe Biden for them, and promising his economic policies will benefit Americans next year. In interviews, a group of 20 Trump voters from around the country whom Reuters has spoken with monthly since February revealed how high costs are impacting their lives, and where they lay the blame. Reuters asked the voters to rate the Trump administration's approach toward affordability on a scale of 1 to 10. Six of the 20 voters gave it a score of 5 or lower, and only one rated it higher than 8. But a majority of the voters staunchly supported the president, predicting that his policies would improve their purchasing power in the long term or saying he had little control over everyday costs. Most of them blamed larger structural issues in the U.S. economy - oligopolies, corporate greed, excessive money supply - for the rising cost of living. BREEDING ANXIETY Their views roughly match the results of recent polls. Nearly three-quarters of Trump voters who responded to a Reuters-Ipsos poll in early December said they approved of the president's handling of the cost of living, compared to 30% of all respondents. The figure for Trump voters was a 10 percentage point jump from a smaller November poll. Still, Republicans fear they are vulnerable on the economy ahead of next year's elections, with independents more skeptical of the president's economic policies. Trump hit the road this week to tout his cost-reducing efforts to audiences, beginning with a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. \"I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,\" Trump said at the rally, where he took credit for bringing down gasoline and energy costs and the price of eggs. He blamed Biden for high prices on other goods, though Trump has now been in office for almost a year. Government data shows that job growth has slowed during Trump's second term, unemployment has risen to its highest level in four years and consumer prices remain high. Overall, the economy's growth has rebounded somewhat after it contracted during the first few months of the year. Eight of the voters interviewed by Reuters reported rising prices at their local restaurants and grocery stores, especially for meat and coffee, although a handful reported food prices were down, and 11 said they had seen dips in the cost of gasoline in their area. Several complained that Trump had done too little to address such issues and that his signature tariffs had been inexpertly deployed, unnecessarily raising prices for Americans. Loretta Torres, 38, a mother of three near Houston, gave Trump an 8 but said holiday shopping had been harder this year because tariffs had doubled or tripled some prices. \"I would definitely hope to see those tariffs go down and improve over time,\" she said. Gerald Dunn, 67, a martial arts instructor in New York's Hudson Valley who rated Trump a 6 on affordability, agreed. \"Don't just throw tariffs out there just for no reason. That hurts the economy because uncertainty breeds anxiety,\" Dunn said. Other voters, however, said they had not noticed any price increases due to the tariffs. Terry Alberta, 64, a pilot in Michigan, noted that U.S. shoppers on Black Friday spent a record amount of money online. \"People are saying they're hurting, but apparently they're not hurting\" enough to curb such spending, Alberta said. \"To bash on the administration and say, 'Oh, these tariffs are horrible' and everything, it's like, then why are we still buying things?\" CAPS ON CORPORATE GREED Regardless of how they rated Trump, most voters blamed private companies and macroeconomic factors for hiking the cost of basic goods and services. While the 20 voters are not a statistically representative portrait of all Trump voters, their ages, educational backgrounds, races/ethnicities, locations and voting histories roughly correspond to those of Trump's overall electorate. They were selected from 429 respondents to a February 2025 Ipsos poll who said they voted for Trump in November and were willing to speak to a reporter. Don Jernigan, 75, a retiree in Virginia Beach, rated Trump a 4 on affordability for not doing enough to check oligopolies. In industries like meatpacking, \"you have such large corporations covering such large portions of our supply chain of products,\" Jernigan said. \"The small guys are totally regulated out of the system, and I haven't seen anything happen to change that.\" In Georgia, David Ferguson, 54, said he hoped Trump would use executive orders to push legislation capping profits in fields such as health insurance, blaming a \"feeding frenzy\" of dominant companies for high costs. Lou Nunez, an 83-year-old retired Army veteran in Des Moines, Iowa, also pointed to the fact that premium payments for Obamacare health plans will double if U.S. lawmakers do not extend pandemic-era subsidies by year's end. \"That's something that certainly the president, if he chose, he could probably get Congress to pass those subsidies, but I think he's pretty set against it,\" said Nunez, who rated Trump a 2 on affordability. \"I don't think he's done a whole lot (to improve the) prices of anything,\" Nunez added. 'DRILL, BABY, DRILL' A common refrain, especially among voters who gave Trump high marks overall, was that the president lacks the power to immediately lower costs. Kate Mottl, 62, of the Chicago suburbs, and Rich Somora, 62, in Charlotte, North Carolina, who rated the president 8 and 6 respectively, repeated one of Trump's campaign mottos, \"drill, baby, drill,\" suggesting that opening up more U.S. territory to oil and gas extraction would help lower the cost of living. Both also underscored that Trump was limited in his ability to directly reduce prices. Mottl said she would like to see prices drop on groceries and utilities, but was \"very optimistic\" about Trump's economic leadership. \"There's just so much he can do in the almost a year that he's been in office,\" she said. \"A lot of it is policy change, and a lot of that has to go through Congress,\" Somora said. Will Brown, 20, a student in Madison, Wisconsin, blamed current inflation on the Biden administration's federal spending initiatives which pumped cash into the U.S. money supply. Although Brown said meat prices were \"egregious\" and housing costs were out of reach for many Americans, he gave the president a 7 on affordability. Fixing inflation and the high cost of living is \"easy to say, but it's hard to do,\" Brown said.

The suspect, Tyler Robinson, is already facing multiple state charges, including an aggravated murder count, and Utah prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty. Robinson’s partner is trans, and authorities have produced text messages from the suspect to his partner saying he was motivated to kill Kirk because he had “enough of his hatred.” It’s not uncommon for defendants to face both state and federal charges, including for drug-related crimes and domestic terrorist attacks, among other offenses. But the effort to bring federal charges in the Kirk case has been met with resistance by some career prosecutors who have argued that the crime doesn’t appear to fall under any federal statutes, the three people said. Prosecuting it as an anti-Christian hate crime would be highly unusual because the federal case would likely turn on equating anti-trans views with Christianity, according to the three people familiar with the matter. And other potential federal statutes, like the stalking charge brought against Luigi Mangione, do not appear to apply in this case, the people say. “They are trying to shove a square peg into a round hole,” said one of the people familiar with the federal investigation. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. A fourth person familiar with the investigation said federal prosecutors are still considering all of their options. The Justice Department “is confident in the death penalty-eligible state murder case and are committed to making sure Charlie’s alleged killer goes to prison for life,” the person said. “The federal investigation remains ongoing and we will not hesitate to charge when appropriate. Involving the Civil Rights Division only opens more potential avenues to charge this suspect.” ​​ Kirk, who founded Turning Point USA, was popular among conservatives and a celebrated figure in President Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi all heaped praise on Kirk following his assassination and pledged to do whatever necessary to bring justice in his case. There’s widespread agreement that the Kirk assassination was an act of domestic terrorism under the federal definition, but there’s no specific federal domestic terrorism law. In September, NBC News reported that factors complicating an effort to bring federal charges against Robinson included that the alleged killer, a Utah resident, did not travel from out of state to attack Kirk, who was shot during an appearance at Utah Valley University. Additionally, Kirk himself was not a federal officer or elected official, which would have provided a more straightforward lane for a federal prosecution. Robinson, who made his first in-person court appearance on Thursday, has not yet entered a plea. Federal hate crime charges have traditionally been brought in cases of violence or discrimination against racial and religious minorities, LGBTQ Americans and other disenfranchised communities. Both state charges and federal civil rights charges have been brought in recent cases involving political violence, including against an avowed admirer of Adolf Hitler who plowed into a crowd of anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville in 2017, and the white supremacist who has pleaded guilty to killing 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division has undergone sweeping charges under the leadership of Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer known for championing conservative causes who represented Trump as he challenged the results of the 2020 election. The federal prosecutor’s office in Utah, which would be involved in any federal prosecution, recently underwent a leadership change. Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Utah Melissa Holyoak was appointed by Bondi on Nov. 17. Before that, acting U.S. Attorney Felice John Viti had overseen the federal prosecutor’s office. Viti did not respond to requests for comment, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"The Justice Department is weighing how to bring federal charges against Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin, Tyler Robinson.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj-weighs-novel-federal-hate-crimes-case-charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-rcna248549","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250913-kirk-memorial-ch-1600-af820e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 10:00:40","author":"Allan Smith,Ryan J.

Among those who’ve been targeted with threats after being mentioned in social media posts by the president are numerous Democrats, including Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — but even more Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and over a dozen Indiana state lawmakers. Three of the members of Congress that Trump accused of sedition, meanwhile, have filed complaints against him with the U.S. Capitol Police. The Capitol Police declined to comment on the complaints, saying in a statement, “For safety reasons, we cannot discuss any potential investigations.” The threats come amid an ugly spike in political violence, including the November shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. One, Sarah Beckstrom, died. They also come as threats have been on the rise against federal lawmakers. The Capitol Police said in an assessment in February that threats against lawmakers, their families and staff increased in 2024 for the second year in a row, going from about 8,000 concerning statements and direct threats in 2023 to nearly 9,500 last year. Criminally charged threats and attacks against members of Congress jumped more than 600% during Trump’s first term compared to President Barack Obama’s second term — 148 in the Trump years compared to 21 during the later Obama years, according to a study by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (CPOST), a nonpartisan research center at the University of Chicago. The number of charged threats remained relatively unchanged during President Joe Biden’s four years in office, with 140 people charged, the study found. While the bulk of the legislators threatened from 2000 to 2012 were Democrats, the survey found the victims have been split nearly 50-50 from 2013 to the end of last year. “We are in a new era of political violence,” the study’s author, University of Chicago professor Robert Pape, told NBC News, pointing to the assassination attempts on Trump, the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the assassination of Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and the firebombing of the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat. Americans are broadly trending toward seeing overheated rhetoric as a factor in episodes of political violence, as opposed to just seeing those incidents as the acts of individual disturbed perpetrators, according to NBC News polling on five instances of political violence in the last 15 years, the most recent being Kirk’s murder in September. Sixty-one percent of respondents in a poll earlier this year said that extreme political rhetoric was a significant factor in Kirk’s death, compared to just 24% who said rhetoric was to blame for the 2011 shooting of then-Rep. Gabby Giffords. Law enforcement has not identified the sources of the new wave of threats, but many of Trump’s targets say the president provoked them with over-the-top accusations of criminality on the part of Democrats and betrayal on the part of his fellow Republicans. A spokeswoman for the White House, Abigail Jackson, said the president is concerned about political violence and hasn’t done anything wrong. “As the survivor of two assassination attempts — and recently watching his dear friend Charlie be assassinated — no one understands the dangers of political violence more than President Trump,” Jackson said in a statement. “But President Trump, and the entire Administration, will not hesitate to speak the truth and call out Democrats for smearing their opponents as Nazis, encouraging members of the military to ignore lawful orders, and enabling violent criminals to invade our country. Sharing these facts is not inciting violence and the media would be wrong to make such an accusation,” she added. Trump accuses Democrats of sedition The video that led Trump to accuse the six Democrats of sedition encouraged members of the military and intelligence agencies to “refuse illegal orders,” not lawful ones. The lawmakers, Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan and Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, are all veterans of military or intelligence agencies. “Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren’t just coming from abroad but from right here at home. Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders,” they said in their Nov. 18 video. Two days later, on Nov. 20, Trump responded with a barrage of attacks on Truth Social, accusing the six of “seditious behavior at the highest level.” “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won’t have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,” the president wrote. In another, he wrote: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Most of the lawmakers said their offices were immediately inundated with death threats. Slotkin told reporters that day that “the shift was immediate.” “We’ve had hundreds and hundreds, if not, you know, closer to 1,000 threats come in to our phones, our emails — all our Senate systems,” she added. Houlahan said in a Nov. 20 phone interview with NBC News, “The president of the United States threatened a member of Congress with their life and now I have to worry about my life and about those around me.” Trump told Fox News the next day, “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death.” Another Democrat and frequent Trump target appeared to get caught in the crosshairs as well. Schumer said on Dec. 1 that “multiple bomb threats” had been sent to his offices around New York with “the email subject line ‘MAGA’ and from an email address alleging the ‘2020 election was rigged.’” Trump feuds with Marjorie Taylor Greene Trump also used fiery language about Greene, a Republican and a longtime ally, in the same time period, calling her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” after she said Trump should spend less time on foreign affairs and broke with the administration on issues like health care, Israel and the release of the Justice Department’s Jeffrey Epstein records. Trump announced he was withdrawing his support for Greene in mid-November, calling her a “ranting lunatic” who has “gone far left” in the first of several posts about her on the weekend of Nov. 14. Greene said on X that weekend that she’d been bombarded by threats that “are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected.” Trump was unmoved and kept posting about her, saying she was “working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim when, in actuality, she is the cause of all of her own problems. The fact is, nobody cares about this Traitor to our Country!” Greene said the continued remarks led to a pipe bomb threat at her business and death threats against her son. “President Trump’s unwarranted and vicious attacks against me were a dog whistle to dangerous radicals that could lead to serious attacks on me and my family,” she wrote on X. Trump shrugged off her claim. “I don’t think her life is in danger. I don’t think, frankly, I don’t think anybody cares about her,” he said at the time. Pape said that it’s “to be expected” that the type of language Trump uses could encourage violence. “He routinely uses metaphors and characterizations that we know from decades of studies encourages support for political violence. That’s been true for years now,” he said. “Dehumanizing people with the word garbage or the word traitor — with the idea of ‘they deserve death,’ it lowers the threshold for supporting violence against the target.” What makes his “continuing pervasive use of morally disengaging metaphors” even more dangerous, Pape said, is his “extreme popularity.” Trump takes aim at Indiana Republicans In recent weeks, Trump has used social media to publicly pressure lawmakers in Indiana to support a midcycle redistricting measure aimed at giving Republicans more seats in the U.S. House. On Nov. 16, two days after Indiana Senate Leader Rodric Bray announced that the chamber did not have enough support to pass the measure, Trump said he was “very disappointed in Indiana State Senate Republicans,” and called out two by name: Bray and Greg Goode. The same post also criticized Gov. Mike Braun, describing him as a friend who “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes. Considering that Mike wouldn’t be Governor without me (Not even close!), is disappointing!” Hours later, Goode was the victim of a swatting incident at his home, when someone claiming to be him called the police and said he’d murdered his wife and child. “My front door was kicked in. I had weapons pointed directly at me. I am so grateful that I was home. My wife and son were in the basement getting Christmas decorations,” he said Thursday. In the following weeks, a total of at least 12 Republican state senators — in addition to Braun and a member of the state House — were targeted with threats and swatting attacks. Trump continued posting about Indiana and suggesting any Republican who voted against the redistricting bill should be voted out of office. A spokesperson for the Indiana State Police, Capt. Ron Galaviz, said that in total there had been “a few dozen threats” made against state senators and representatives in recent weeks. The redistricting measure passed in the state House on Dec. 5 but failed in the state Senate on Thursday. State Rep. Tim Yocum, one of a handful of Republican legislators who voted against the redistricting measure in the House, received a bomb threat at his house on Wednesday. “These kinds of threats of violence are never acceptable, and I wholeheartedly condemn them,” Yocum said in a statement. Indiana state Senate Whip Mike Crider — who also voted against the measure — told NBC affiliate 13WTHR that he has received three threats this week alone. He cited the threats he received among the reasons he was voting against the redistricting bill. “When you get kind of bullied and threatened, if that tactic works, then you can expect to deal with that for the rest of your political career,” he said. “And so I’m a kind of guy that, if you start pushing on me, you’re going to get a reaction.”","summary":"President Donald Trump’s heated rhetoric against his perceived political enemies has resulted in a blizzard of threats against at least 22 officials on both sides of the aisle in recent weeks, according to an NBC News tally","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-attacks-political-opponents-spur-surge-threats-nbc-news-review-f-rcna247201","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251212-Elissa-Slotkin-MTG-aa-432-0d771a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 10:00:00","author":"Dareh Gregorian,Jiachuan Wu","authors":["Dareh Gregorian","Jiachuan Wu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":386959690,"title":"U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to hold talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Berlin","text":"United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is on his way to Berlin, Germany, to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders for peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior White House official told NBC News. Witkoff has spearheaded talks with Ukraine and Russia since President Donald Trump took office in January, but multiple high-level meetings between the U.S. and the two warring nations have yet to produce results as disagreements remain over the content of a peace plan. Trump, who has pushed for a deal to be in place by Christmas, has signaled that his patience is running thin. European leaders have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But long-time American allies in Europe have struggled to balance the mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia’s hard-line demands. Zelenskyy said Ukraine submitted a 20-point plan to the U.S. on Wednesday, as it sought to balance out a 28-point U.S.-backed plan whose original version was seen as too favorable to Moscow. Ukraine’s proposal included separate documents on security guarantees, to prevent Russia from attacking again, and on rebuilding Ukraine’s war-hit cities. The issue of ceding territory remains a major sticking point in negotiations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine “by force” unless his unwavering demands are met. Zelenskyy said there was still no common understanding on the land issue and that Ukrainians should vote on any territorial concessions in a referendum. Russia has continued its bombardment of Ukraine as talks continue. Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered major blackouts on Saturday after a large overnight Russian attack on the power grid across the country. Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also temporarily lost all offsite power overnight for the 12th time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. Zelenskyy said in a post on X: \"It is important that everyone now sees what Russia is doing – every step they take in terror against our people, all their attacks, for this is clearly not about ending the war. They still aim to destroy our state and inflict maximum pain on our people.\" Witkoff's visit to Berlin comes as the European Union agreed Friday to indefinitely freeze Russian assets worth 210 billion euros ($246 billion) held in Europe, as it considers using those assets to fund Ukraine’s war effort. The indefinite freeze appears to be a bid to convince Belgium, where much of that money is held at Euroclear, to agree to plans that would loan a large chunk of the money to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027. Belgium opposed the plan because it fears legal retaliation by Russia, which has condemned the freezing of its assets as theft, but the agreement includes a guarantee that Belgium would not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Russian lawsuit prove successful. Zelenskyy said Thursday that negotiators are wrestling with the question of territorial possession in U.S.-led peace talks on ending the war with Russia, including the future of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the world’s 10 biggest atomic plants. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv on Friday, Zelenskyy said the U.S. is offering as a compromise to create a “free economic zone” in the Ukraine-controlled parts of the eastern Donbas which Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede. Among the issues Zelenskyy shared were that Russia wants to incorporate the entire Donbas, which Ukraine opposes. He also said the U.S. proposed turning Donbas into a “free economic zone.” That would mean Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and Russia refrains from entering the parts of Donbas it does not currently occupy. “They see it as Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the Donetsk region, and the compromise is supposedly that Russian troops will not enter this part of Donetsk region. They do not know who will govern this territory,” he said, adding that Russia is referring to it as a “demilitarized zone.” NATO chief Mark Rutte struck a drastic note Thursday as he urged allies to step up defense efforts. “We are Russia’s next target,” he said, warning of a conflict that could be on “the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.”","summary":"United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is on his way to Berlin, Germany, to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders for peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior White House official told NBC News","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/us-envoy-steve-witkoff-hold-talks-zelenskyy-european-leaders-berlin-rcna248978","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251213-ukraine-nd-8e7b8b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 09:51:27","author":"Freddie Clayton","authors":["Freddie Clayton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":386966338,"title":"Elections in Ukraine: is it Realistic?","text":"In response to US President Donald Trump’s comment that it was time for elections in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the country is ready to hold elections if the United States and Europe can guarantee its security. Commentators examine the prospects for a fair vote – and see the ball in Trump’s court now.\n\nUS politicians should go to the war zone\n\nUkrainian Political scientist Volodymyr Fesenko considers elections under the current conditions utterly unrealistic, he writes in a Facebook post:\n\n“I would strongly recommend inviting representatives of the Trump administration to serve as official advisors to Ukraine’s Central Election Commission so they can assess the possibility of holding elections in Ukraine during the war and assist with the practical preparations for these elections. They should travel to Kherson (and not just spend two or three hours there, but at least a few days), where Russian drones are targeting civilians, as well as to Kharkiv, Sumy, Nikopol, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Odessa – and above all to the front line (near Pokrovsk, Kupiansk or Hulyaipole, for example)...”\n\nGross interference in Ukraine’s internal affairs\n\nIn a Facebook post picked up by Ukrainian Espreso, political scientist Mykhailo Bassarab lists arguments against holding elections:\n\n“Firstly, the topic of elections was an external demand from the outset, and a gross encroachment in Ukraine’s internal affairs. Russia initiated the discussion about elections as a condition. The enemy does not need the election results, but rather the process – which offers it plenty of leeway for sabotage. ... Secondly, the state can enter the election campaign but may not be able to get out of it. Both internal factors and hostile interference would ‘tear apart’ the war-weakened country during the election campaign.”\n\nPeople can’t vote from cellars and ruins\n\nPolish Polityka says the conditions for equal access to information – and therefore for fair elections – do not exist:\n\n“In the cities, this might be partly possible. But there are villages that have been cut off from the world by the war, left without electricity or water, with people living in cellars and ruins, focused only on how to survive another day. Any observer would justifiably question such elections. Since the first day of the war, the authorities have restricted access to the media – all to maintain maximum control over information, or rather disinformation, which is of particular importance to the Kremlin. That alone makes any elections a farce.”\n\nTrump must enforce a ceasefire\n\nWith his demand for free elections in Ukraine, US President Trump has taken on the obligation himself, comments ARD correspondent Florian Kellermann on tagesschau.de (Germany):\n\n“Now Zelensky is saying: you want elections? Fine, if you, dear Americans, and dear Europeans, ensure security. Elections can only be held during a ceasefire. That makes sense. Elections cannot be democratic or fair if the candidates can’t appear in public safely, if polling stations remained closed due to air raids alerts. If hundreds of thousands in the trenches are excluded. A ceasefire – that is exactly what US President Trump has been calling for for a long time. And Ukraine has been willing for just as long, but Russia has not. Now Trump has a duty to convince the Kremlin.”\n\nThis plan won’t pan out\n\nPolitical scientist Vladimir Pastukhov sees fundamental differences in the positions of both presidents in a Telegram post reposted by Russian Echo:\n\n“There is cognitive dissonance between Trump and Zelensky on the issue of elections. When Trump talks about elections, he has the election of Zelensky’s successor in mind, and when Zelensky talks about them he primarily means his own re-election and the extension of his legitimacy. ... A logical next step would be for Trump to directly demand not just elections, but elections in which Zelensky does not participate. Otherwise, the pieces in Trump’s puzzle won’t fit together.”\n\nSee the original here.","summary":"Commentators examine the prospects for a fair vote – and see the ball in Trump’s court now.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/66164","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/12/13/19dde13d2e047c918b33b3c8ac419f89.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 09:19:26","author":"Eurotopics","authors":["Eurotopics"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":386963896,"title":"Fighting continues in Thailand and Cambodia, despite Trump’s claim of ceasefire","text":"Clashes have continued across the Thai and Cambodian border, despite US President Donald Trump’s claims that both countries had agreed to renew a ceasefire.\n\nBoth Thai and Cambodian officials have suggested there is still more work to be done before the ceasefire can be re-established.\n\nOn Friday evening, Donald Trump posted to his social media platform Truth Social, making the announcement.\n\n“I had a very good conversation this morning with the Prime Minister of Thailand, Anutin Charnvirakul, and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet, concerning the very unfortunate reawakening of their long-running War.\n\n“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim.”\n\n“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America.\n\n“It is my Honor to work with Anutin and Hun in resolving what could have evolved into a major War between two otherwise wonderful and prosperous Countries!”\n\nOn Saturday morning, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul appeared to distance himself from this statement, saying Thailand won’t back down until it no longer feels aggression from Cambodia.\n\n“Thailand will continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people. I want to make it clear. Our actions this morning already spoke.”\n\nThai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Saturday that some of Trump’s remarks didn’t “reflect an accurate understanding of the situation.”\n\n“We regret and we’re disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have bearing upon the feeling of the Thai people, Thailand, because we consider ourselves — we are proud, in fact — to be the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,” he said.\n\nCambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet wrote a social media post, praising both Donald Trump and Malaysia’s Prime Minister for their involvement, but stopped short of saying a ceasefire had been agreed.\n\n“I thanked both His Excellency for their continuous efforts towards achieving long-term peace between Cambodia and Thailand.\n\n“Cambodia has always maintained its stance in seeking peaceful resolution of disputes, in line with the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration.”\n\nCambodia’s defence ministry reported that Thailand continued to carry out strikes early on Saturday.\n\nThe latest large-scale fighting was set off by a skirmish on December 7th that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed the original ceasefire promoted by Trump in July, after five days of combat over longstanding territorial disputes.\n\nThe July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold negotiations over trade tariffs unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed.\n\nDespite the deal, the two countries carried on a bitter propaganda war and minor cross-border violence continued.\n\nAbout two dozen people have officially been reported killed in this past week’s fighting, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced on both sides of the border.\n\nThe Thai military acknowledges 11 of its troops have been killed, while estimating there have been 165 fatalities among Cambodian soldiers. Cambodia has not announced military casualties, but has said at least 11 civilians have been killed and 76 wounded.\n\nThe roots of the conflict date back over a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn following the French occupation of Cambodia\n\nThis is not a recent dispute. The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn up following the French occupation of Cambodia.\n\nBoth countries claim certain areas, particularly the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Hostilities escalated in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register the temple as a Unesco World Heritage Site, which was met with heated protest from Thailand.\n\nOver the years, there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides.\n\nThe crumbling of the July ceasefire, and failure to completely renew it is another blow for Trump, who has repeatedly made the exaggerated claim that he has helped solve eight conflicts since his return to Office.\n\nIt is well known that he desires to be viewed as a powerful negotiator and recognised with the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn an exchange with reporters later Friday, Trump credited his administration with doing a “very good job” with its push to stem the renewed fighting.\n\n“And we got it, I think, straightened out today,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “So Thailand and Cambodia is in good shape.”\n\nAnother ceasefire that Trump takes credit for establishing, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, is also under strain, just after the leaders of the African nations travelled to Washington to sign a peace deal.\n\nAnd Trump’s internationally endorsed plan to end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is still not finalised and in limbo, with sporadic fighting continuing while a critical second phase remains a work in progress.","summary":"Trump claimed a new ceasefire had been agreed in a social media post on Friday night, but within hours Thailand claimed it won't back down until threats end.","url":"https://news.stv.tv/world/fighting-continues-in-thailand-and-cambodia-despite-trumps-claim-of-ceasefire","image":"https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/2h9CXv0QWFXPK8OCcHLRr3/8dbc954fd131e35d77cf29073a18df03/AP25346816313368.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 09:09:58","author":"ITV News,President Trump","authors":["ITV News","President Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"tv","sentiment":0.083},{"id":386958270,"title":"How King Charles's busy schedule aided his 'positive mindset' after new update","text":"During an appearance for Stand Up To Cancer, King Charles confirmed that his cancer treatment was being reduced thanks to an \"early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to 'doctors' orders'.\"\n\nThe monarch was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024, and despite operating under a reduced schedule for a few months after the initial diagnosis, he soon found himself with a packed schedule.\n\nThe monarch's insistence to continue working helped him gain a \"positive mindset\", which is believed to have formed part of his recovery journey. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"The King has taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment, while always heeding the advice of his medical team.\n\n\"His ability to uphold all of his State duties, and to continue with public engagements and overseas tours, has helped greatly with the positive mindset that, as many families will know, is such a vital a part of the recovery journey.\"\n\nThe King has already had a busy month, as last week, he hosted the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and First Lady Elke Büdenbender during their state visit to the United Kingdom. It was the third state visit that the monarch hosted this, after French President Emmanuel Macron in July and United States President Donald Trump in September.\n\nCharles has also been abroad four times this year, visiting Italy back in April, the Holy See in October, Poland in January and Canada in May.\n\nCharles' cancer message\n\nThe monarch's pre-recorded message was filmed at Clarence House and featured the King speaking about the importance of cancer screening programmes that can lead to an early diagnosis. In the message, he expressed his concern that \"at least nine million people in our country are not up to date with the cancer screenings available to them\".\n\nCharles encouraged people to take up the invitation for screenings, highlighting the new national Screening Checker, which is now available online, for breast, bowel or cervical cancer screening.\n\n\"In sharing some details of his treatment journey, His Majesty has been greatly encouraged by the outpouring of support both from the medical community and from members of the public - especially those affected by cancer,\" a palace spokesperson said.\n\nA Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: \"His Majesty has responded exceptionally well to treatment and his doctors advise that ongoing measures will now move into a precautionary phase. This position will be continuously monitored and reviewed to protect and prioritise his continued recovery. As The King has said, this milestone on his recovery journey is 'a great personal blessing'.\"\n\nKing's cancer diagnosis\n\nIn February 2024, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Charles had been diagnosed with a form of cancer after it was detected during treatment for an enlarged prostate.\n\nIn a statement, the Palace said: \"During the King's recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement, a separate issue of concern was noted. Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer.\n\n\"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties. Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.\n\n\"His Majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.\"","summary":"On Friday evening, King Charles confirmed that his cancer treatment was being reduced, and part of the monarch's recovery has been down to his busy schedule that allowed him a positive mindset'","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/872689/king-charles-busy-schedule-aided-positive-mindset-cancer-update/","image":"https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/42c5809a99b9-king-charles-westminster-abbey.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 09:00:00","author":"Matthew Moore","authors":["Matthew Moore"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.175},{"id":386960780,"title":"Open Thread","text":"Current Issue\n\nThe Reason Roundtable\n\nJust Asking Questions\n\nThe Reason Interview\n\nThe Reason Roundtable\n\nThe Reason Interview With Nick Gillespie\n\nThe Soho Forum Debates\n\nJust Asking Questions\n\nNewsletters\n\nDonate Online\n\nDonate Crypto\n\nWays To Give To Reason Foundation\n\nTorchbearer Society\n\nPlanned Giving\n\nReason Plus Subscription\n\nGift Subscriptions\n\nPrint Subscription\n\nSubscriber Support\n\n Search for:\n\n \n \n\nUsername/Email(Required)\n\nPassword(Required)\n\n Remember Me\n\nCreate new account\nForgot password\n\nThe Volokh Conspiracy\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\n About The Volokh Conspiracy \n \n\nEditorial Independence\n\nVolokh Daily Email\n\n \n\n \n\nOpen Thread\n\nWhat’s on your mind?\n\n Eugene Volokh\n\n 12.13.2025 3:00 AM\n\nStart your day with Reason.

It remains unclear how Palestinian militant group Hamas would be disarmed under the plan.The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilization Force (ISF) would not engage in combat with Hamas.They added that multiple countries have expressed interest in contributing personnel, and US officials are currently considering the ISF’s size, composition, housing, training, and rules of engagement.A two-star US general is being considered to lead the force, but no final decision has been made.The deployment of these forces represents a key component of the next phase of the Gaza peace plan proposed by US President Donald Trump.Under the first phase, a fragile ceasefire in the two-year conflict began on October 10, with Hamas releasing hostages and Israel releasing detained Palestinians. However, sporadic attacks have continued, contributing to civilian casualties in Gaza.“There is a lot of quiet planning that’s going on behind the scenes right now for phase two of the peace deal,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.“We want to ensure an enduring and lasting peace.”Indonesia Prepares TroopsIndonesia has indicated readiness to deploy up to 20,000 personnel to support health, reconstruction, and humanitarian tasks in Gaza.“This is still in the planning and preparation stage,” said Rico Sirait, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of Defense. “We are currently preparing the organizational structure of the forces to be deployed.”Currently, Israel controls about 53 percent of Gaza, while most of the territory is under Hamas administration. US officials said the plan calls for Israeli forces to gradually withdraw from Palestinian areas as the ISF establishes stability, following standards, milestones, and timelines for demilitarization.A UN Security Council resolution adopted on November 17 authorized the Peace Council and cooperating countries to form the ISF. President Trump said early next year he would announce which world leaders would serve on the council.Challenges RemainDespite the ceasefire, living conditions in Gaza have remained difficult, with strict restrictions on aid deliveries affecting humanitarian relief.International monitors have warned that sustained access to food, medical supplies, and essential services is critical to preventing further humanitarian crises.Read: Cambodia Says Thailand Continues Attacks Despite Trump's CallClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"The US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza would not engage in combat with Hamas.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2073153/us-plans-to-send-international-stabilization-force-to-gaza-in-early-2026","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/07/15/id_1413322/1413322_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 06:44:28","author":"Sita Planasari","authors":["Sita Planasari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":0.227},{"id":386957006,"title":"Witkoff to meet Zelensky for latest Ukraine war talks","text":"US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for the latest round of high-level talks on ending the war.\n\nSteve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing for a deal to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent.\n\nIt has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part.\n\nThe Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes days after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.\n\nThe fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.\n\nZelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".\n\nThe Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.\n\nThe proposal, seemingly an attempt to resolve the question of legal ownership by creating a new status for the land, has been publicly questioned by Zelensky, who said: \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\"\n\nUkraine and allies in Europe have said publicly that the US-led talks have been fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged.\n\nBut there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.\n\nIn a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.\n\nZelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nAs the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding.\n\nThe Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.\n\nOn Friday, European Union governments agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe.\n\nIt is hoped that agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.\n\nThat move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.\n\nOfficials were still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government being particularly sceptical due to its particular legal exposure as the main holder.\n\nElsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.\n\nThe Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.\n\nUkraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.\n\nUnder the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.","summary":"US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for the latest round of high-level talks on ending the war.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/witkoff-to-meet-zelensky-for-latest-ukraine-war-talks/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1738fb80-d7dd-11f0-a7d3-d3e62a2a1617.jpg.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 05:57:15","author":"Bbc 57am,David Apinga","authors":["Bbc 57am","David Apinga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":386963336,"title":"Nvidia considers increasing H200 chip output as Chinese demand surges","text":"Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter. The move comes after US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the US government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on such sales. Demand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private. \"We are managing our supply chain to ensure that licensed sales of the H200 to authorized customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters after the story was published. Major Chinese companies including Alibaba and ByteDance have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday. However, uncertainties remain, as the Chinese government has yet to greenlight any purchase of the H200. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source. Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the US AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines. China promoting own AI industry Supply of H200 chips has been a major concern for Chinese clients and they have reached out to Nvidia seeking clarity on this, sources said. As part of the briefing provided by Nvidia, the company has also given them guidance on current supply levels, said one of the first two people, without providing a specific number. The H200 went into mass deployment last year and is the fastest AI chip in Nvidia's previous Hopper generation. The chip is manufactured by TSMC using the Taiwanese firm's 4nm manufacturing process technology. TSMC and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.Chinese companies' strong demand for the H200 stems from the fact that it is easily the most powerful chip they can currently access. ALSO READ: China rejecting Nvidia's H200 chips, pushing for self-reliance: SacksIt is about six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip from Nvidia tailored for the Chinese market that was released in late 2023. Trump's decision on the H200 comes at a time when China is pushing to promote its own domestic AI chip industry. As domestic chip companies have yet to produce products that match the H200, there have been concerns that allowing the H200 into China could stymie the industry. \"Its (H200) compute performance is approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners. \"I'm already observing many CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprise customers aggressively placing large orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions on a conditional basis,\" he said, adding Chinese AI demand exceeds the capacity of local production. During the emergency meetings, there was a proposal to require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a certain ratio of domestic chips, one of the first two sources and a third source said. For Nvidia, adding new capacity is also challenging at a time when it is not only transitioning to Rubin but also competing with companies including Alphabet's Google for limited advanced chipmaking capacity from TSMC.","url":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nvidia-considers-increasing-h200-chip-output-as-chinese-demand-surges-125121300192_1.html","image":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-09/04/full/1756978041-9793.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 05:50:10","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":386960134,"title":"Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Have Served Nobly","text":"This week, Donald Trump reaffirmed his desire to have Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito remain on the court ‘til the end of his term. And, as the President has touted, one of his proudest first-term accomplishments was to nominate three eventual Supreme Court Justices: Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Coney Barrett.\n\nSome Stay True, Some Don’t\n\nJustice Gorsuch has been fairly consistent. Justice Kavanaugh has usually held the line, relying upon the U.S. Constitution as his north star. More than occasionally, Amy Coney Barrett has been a liability to conservatives. It is speculated that she fears for members of her family if she does not yield to Leftist causes. She did, however, appropriately chastise the ranting of Ketanji Brown Jackson – a DEI selection who should have never become a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nSome on the Right regard Barrett as one of Trump's mistakes, similar to what befell Ronald Reagan when Sandra Day O'Connor began crossing the line from her conservative values to agree with Leftists.\n\nThen, regrettably, there is George W. Bush's appointment of John Roberts. As Chief Justice, Roberts is demonstrably weak and has flip-flopped on many occasions. Perhaps he is being controlled by someone with knowledge of his extracurricular activities, but who knows? Regardless, the alleged conservative six-to-three majority on the court often ends up being five-to-four, or worse, four-to-five.\n\nNo Time to Dally\n\nDespite President Trump's wishes, in his remaining 37 months in office, two monumental, if bold, appointments are needed to ensure that vigorous, non-wavering conservatives will be added to the court and will remain in place for decades to come.\n\nClarence Thomas turns 78 on June 23, 2026. For much of his career, he said little, listened carefully, and wrote brilliant arguments. In recent years, he has spoken up more. Under fire from the Left, professionally as well as personally, he has stood his ground. It is remarkable that in 1991 he weathered what he termed a “high-tech lynching,” and for 34 years has proven to be a wise choice by George H. W. Bush.\n\nSamuel Alito is also a consistent conservative and takes his cues directly from the U.S. Constitution. Alito turns 76 on April 1, 2026. He has become one of the more principled justices in modern times, and the credit goes to George W. Bush for selecting him.\n\nIf only we could clone both justices!\n\nWe’re Going to Miss You\n\nTrue conservatives don't want to see the departure of champions like Justice Thomas and Justice Alito. The most prudent path, however, is that long before Trump's term is over and, preferably, even before the 2026 mid-term elections – a mere 10+ months away – both Justices retire to make way for new, younger, strong conservatives.\n\nHanging on too long has its consequences. Ruth Bader Ginsburg never met a clause in the U.S. Constitution that she felt couldn’t be ignored. She was the darling of the Left for decades. She aimed to serve well past the time that others strongly suggested she retire in favor of a younger, liberal justice.\n\nGinsburg, of course, died while in office, enabling Trump to select Amy Coney Barrett. Among many conservatives, Barrett is or is somewhat of a disappointment. Still, Trump at least had the opportunity with Ginsburg’s passing to flip one highly liberal justice for a presumably conservative justice.\n\nFool Me Once\n\nWhenever a nomination opportunity arises, Trump won't make the same mistake. He will vet and re-vet and vet again whomever he nominates, knowing that this will be a crucial aspect of his second term.\n\nA monumental question arises. Recalling Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s fate, will Justice Thomas and Justice Alito step down accordingly? The likelihood is no. Alito has balked at retiring. He is not in jeopardy health-wise. Thomas had a notable, health-related absence in 2024. Both could ably serve for many more years to come. The greater issue, however, is preserving the tenuous, conservative majority on the court and populating it with new justices who also will not waver.\n\nBoth Justices, clearly understanding the landscape, could step aside within three years or, better yet, before the midterms. Departing sooner rather than later would give President Trump sufficient time to ensure that whomever he selects will make it through the process.\n\n51 Votes Will Do\n\nRepublicans do not need 60 votes in the Senate to confirm a new justice. A mere 51 votes will do. Currently, they have the 51 and then some. However, November 3, 2026, beckons. It appears that the GOP will hold the Senate, but let’s not roll the dice.\n\nIf neither Justice retires before the midterms, given that the Republicans do retain the Senate, it is vital that both Justices bid adieu before 2028. Their legacies are well established, and each can retire knowing that he served his country well.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Complete disengagement from China’s technology sector merely accelerates China’s further development of its own advanced chips. Conversely, America’s structured participation in Asian markets – under terms that materially benefit Washington – ensures the U.S. remains at the center of the global semiconductor ecosystem by denying Beijing’s technological dominance over the region.\n\nReports that China’s president Xi Jinping has reacted favorably to the proposal indicate the White House may finally be converting latent leverage into strategic gains, but only if Washington adheres to Ronald Reagan’s timeless admonition to trust but verify the commitments the People’s Republic now signals.\n\nGovernments around the world are laying the foundations for what will become the defining infrastructure of the 21st century. These are hardly the industrial landmarks of bygone eras – highways, refineries, and deep-water ports. The new race hinges on Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip factories– the production of dense computational components that transform electricity, data, and algorithms into the most valuable strategic asset of our time – machine intelligence. The nations that master this infrastructure will dictate the terms of global innovation, economic growth, and security cooperation for decades.\n\nWhere detractors err is in their comparison of AI chips to precursor materials used to make, say, biological weapons or nuclear warheads. Yes, the U.S. should keep Iran from acquiring centrifuges necessary to refine weapons-grade plutonium and chemicals needed to build bio-bombs. As U.S. chipmaker Nvidia recently noted, “AI is not an atomic bomb. No one should have an atomic bomb. Everyone should have AI.’ \n\nThe United States retains a significant advantage in the AI chip race. American firms design the most capable GPUs, build the software frameworks that push the frontiers of research, and operate the cloud platforms that anchor the digital economy. By almost any measure, the U.S. ecosystem remains unmatched. But Washington’s current, self-imposed export restrictions threaten to shut out one of the world’s largest developer markets– China and greater Asia – from even mid-range, commercially viable chips. Simply put, what was once a targeted set of national security measures no longer reflects strategic reality.\n\nThis is because nearly half of the world’s AI developers are based in China, and their choices will help determine which platforms and frameworks dominate the global market. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is correct that if the United States cedes this developer ecosystem to competitors, “it will be almost impossible to get it back.” Technological ecosystems become self-reinforcing once they reach scale, as China’s rapid 5G deployment vividly demonstrated. Nations, vendors, and developers eventually align around whichever standard is winning. Losing an early lead jeopardizes far more than market share – it risks long-term strategic influence.\n\nRestricting high-end GPUs through U.S. export controls was intended to slow China’s ascent in artificial intelligence. That objective may have been feasible several years ago; it is not today. China already has a resilient domestic AI stack, from Huawei’s inference-optimized chips to rapidly improving open-source foundational models like DeepSeek R1. Today, China is not simply closing the gap – it’s exporting AI alternatives abroad. Even industry leaders now concede that China has sophisticated AI components on offer for sale, making the original rationale for blanket restrictions increasingly irrelevant.\n\nThe economic costs to the United States are equally significant. American semiconductor firms are losing billions in annual revenue – money that could otherwise fuel research, expand domestic employment, and fortify the innovation base critical to national security. In a sector where scale determines survivability, cutting off access to one of the largest markets on the planet is an unforced strategic error. At a time when the U.S.is working to strengthen its manufacturing base and narrow its trade deficit, sidelining high-value exports undermines the very goals policymakers claim to prioritize.\n\nIt is reassuring that the White House looks set to pursue a more calculated path – one grounded in strategic realism rather than ritualized restrictions based on an antiquated, Cold War mindset. Allowing controlled, licensed exports of non-cutting-edge chips such as Nvidia’s H200 will enhance, not diminish, U.S. national security. When Chinese developers, researchers, and institutions build atop American frameworks, cloud APIs, and tools, Washington gains influence, visibility, and leverage. When developers migrate to alternative ecosystems, our influence evaporates. Winning the global AI competition requires more than protecting advanced hardware; it requires deploying the American technology stack abroad and ensuring the world continues to build on U.S. platforms.\n\nThis moment is especially pivotal because nations are choosing their long-term AI partners now. As Huang has observed, “Every industrial revolution begins with infrastructure. AI is the essential infrastructure of our time, just as electricity and the internet once were.” Toward that end, China is exporting its AI models and chips across Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Should the U.S.abstain from the world’s fastest-growing markets, companies such as Huawei will fill the void and American standards will lose their gravitational pull.\n\nChina has poured resources into its own AI-chip ecosystem, standing up domestic supply chains, and engineering substitutes for the hardware it can no longer import. Far from slowing its progress, the restrictions only accelerated China’s push for technological self-reliance. By denying Chinese firms access to Western chips, Washington encourages precisely the outcome it hopes to avoid: the rapid expansion of China’s homegrown capabilities and a long-term erosion of the leverage that export controls presume to provide.\n\nPreserving American leadership in the age of machine intelligence requires engagement, not isolation and competition by performance, not constraint. If Washington proceeds prudently, it can ensure that the world’s emerging AI factories are built on American foundations – and that the next era of technological power reflects U.S. strengths, values, and interests.\n\nBy - Ivan Sascha Sheehan is a professor of Public and International Affairs and the incoming interim dean of the College of Public Affairs at the University of Baltimore.

The statement was cited by Al Jazeera.“Thai forces have not stopped the bombing yet and are still continuing the bombing,” the ministry said.The accusation came only hours after Trump announced that the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to stop hostilities starting Friday night.“I had a very good conversation this morning with the Prime Minister of Thailand, Anutin Charnvirakul, and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet, concerning the very unfortunate reawakening of their long-running War,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, as reported by CBS News.“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,” Trump added.He said both countries were “ready for peace and continued trade with the United States.”The renewed violence has threatened a ceasefire facilitated earlier this year under Malaysian mediation, which Trump attended during a meeting in October.The conflict, rooted in long-standing territorial disputes, is among several regional conflicts Trump has claimed to have helped resolve.Border Clashes ContinueThe armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia entered their fifth day on Friday, December 12. According to Al Jazeera, citing The Khmer Times, Thai forces were suspected of launching fresh attacks early Friday in three Cambodian provinces.Reports said gunfire was heard in Ta Moan, Ta Kra Bei, and Thmar Daun in Oddar Meanchey Province, while artillery shelling struck Phnom Khaing and An Ses in Preah Vihear. Attacks were also reported in Prey Chan and Boeung Trakuan in Banteay Meanchey.While no new casualties were reported, at least 20 people have been killed and nearly 200 injured since fighting resumed on Monday. Around 600,000 civilians on both sides of the border have been displaced following the collapse of the ceasefire brokered by Trump last October.Mutual AccusationsCambodia’s Ministry of Defense has rejected Thai military claims that Phnom Penh used foreign mercenaries to operate suicide drones.“The Ministry of National Defence of Cambodia would like to reject propaganda disseminated on the Thai 2nd Army Area Facebook page, which accused Cambodia of using foreigners to help launch FPV [first person view] drones in the Cambodian-Thai border conflict,” the ministry said in a Facebook statement. It also denied Thai media reports that Cambodia was preparing to deploy Chinese-made PHL-03 missile systems.“Cambodia demands the Thai side to deliberately stop spreading false news in order to divert attention to its violations of international law by painting Cambodia as a pretext to use more violent weapons on Cambodia,” the statement said.According to U.S. military data, the PHL-03 system is capable of firing rockets up to 130 kilometers—far beyond the range of Cambodia’s BM-21 launchers.Both sides have blamed each other for reigniting the conflict, which centers on an 800-kilometer disputed border and competing claims over several ancient temple complexes.Cambodia has accused Thailand of targeting civilian areas, describing recent attacks as “brutal armed aggression.” Thailand, meanwhile, said Cambodian forces violated its territory, prompting it to act in self-defense.Read: Malaysia to Convene ASEAN Meeting to Ease Thailand-Cambodia TensionsClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Thailand-Cambodia clashes enter the sixth day with mutual accusations of attacks and increasing casualties despite a phone call from US President Trump.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2073125/cambodia-says-thailand-continues-attacks-despite-trumps-call","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/10/26/id_1437231/1437231_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 04:41:10","author":"Adinda Jasmine","authors":["Adinda Jasmine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":0.006},{"id":386963240,"title":"IndiGo's real crime is letting government act as private sector's saviour","text":"There can be three immediate reactions when you see the unravelling of IndiGo, arguably the greatest global brand built in post-reform India.

We’re going to see a lot of death,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, citing staggering casualty numbers. “Last month… 25,000 soldiers were killed in Ukraine and Russia.

This common ground must unite Ukrainians, Americans, and Europeans,” the official said, adding, “It should allow us, together, to make a negotiating offer, a solid, lasting peace offer that respects international law and Ukraine’s sovereign interests, an offer that American negotiators are willing to bring to the Russians.”\n\nWhile no joint document has been finalized, talks will continue through a series of calls and meetings in the coming days, the official added.\n\nWestern diplomats involved in the discussions, speaking exclusively to Kyiv Post on condition of anonymity, characterized the current stage as “preparatory, yet delicate,” emphasizing that the clock is ticking as the human cost of conflict mounts.\n\n“The challenge isn’t Moscow right now, it’s Kyiv and Washington agreeing on the ultimate price of peace,” a senior Western official involved in the talks said, speaking candidly on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“We have the broad stroke, but turning ‘Let’s make a deal’ into a viable document requires a lot of sleepless nights in Berlin,” another European diplomat added.\n\nFor now, Trump’s approach remains open-ended, reflecting a blend of caution and unpredictability that has become his hallmark.\n\n“We’ll see,” he said, almost as a mantra, as the administration prepares to test whether its high-profile envoys can turn words into a workable roadmap for peace.\n\nThe question now is whether the “art of the deal’ can truly be applied to the art of war – or if the administration’s high-stakes gamble will simply blow up on the tarmac in Berlin.","summary":"White House scrambles to translate Trump’s vague “free economic zone” vision into a concrete plan ahead of Berlin summit.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/66150","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/12/13/198a850f7751d21b9a1dcb95c690a2b9.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-13 03:46:52","author":"Alex Raufoglu","authors":["Alex Raufoglu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":386959630,"title":"On the hunt!

I might get emotional.'\nClaudia added: 'I think we will be emotional, but of course, it won't be about us. It'll be about the winners.'\n'So we're not allowed to cry,' Tess said.\nTess presented the series since it first launched in 2004 alongside the late Sir Bruce Forsyth, while Claudia fronted its weekday companion show, It Takes Two.\nClaudia eventually moved on to host the Sunday night results show alongside Daly and joined the main show every Saturday from 2014, after Sir Bruce stepped down.\nThe pair picked up the entertainment programme gong at the BAFTA TV Awards in 2024 and were made Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the King's Birthday Honours for their services to broadcasting.\n\nView gallery\n\nThe news comes as Tess and Claudia are planning their Strictly farewell in style - with insiders suggesting the duo may even take to the dancefloor (pictured September) \n\nView gallery\n\nWhile the pair make a running joke about their two left feet and lack of rhythm, it looks like fans could finally see them perform\n\nDuring Sunday night's results show, the judges decided to save West End star Amber Davies and her dance partner Nikita Kuzmin after they found themselves in the bottom two alongside former Emmerdale star Lewis Cope and professional dancer Katya Jones.\nAmber joins EastEnders actress Balvinder Sopal, internet star George Clarke and former Lioness and sports broadcaster Karen Carney as semi-finalists.\nThe couples will perform during this weekend's semi-final, airing on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 6.35pm on Saturday, with the results show at 7.45pm on Sunday.\nEach couple will perform two new routines and there will be performances from Australian singer Kylie Minogue and boyband Five.\nBBCClaudia WinklemanStrictly Come Dancing\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOn the hunt!
