The talks in Paris on Tuesday will focus on how to integrate capabilities recently proposed by Washington with plans drawn up by the so-called coalition of the willing that’s made up of Ukraine’s allies, according to people familiar with the matter.French President Emmanuel Macron will host the meeting, which comes after a series of discussions between national security advisers over the last month. The US will be represented by President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the people added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, other European leaders, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. Top NATO military official Alexus Grynkewich, who also leads US forces in Europe, will also be in attendance.It is unclear what role US troops would play or where they would be stationed in the event of a peace agreement with Russia. European nations have discussed deploying a multinational “reassurance force,” with Ukraine’s army leading its defense at the front line. The US is also willing to help monitor a ceasefire, including by providing intelligence, the people said. Drones and satellites would be used to identify breaches, they added.European officials said their latest discussions with American counterparts were positive and that the current status of the proposed security guarantees was in a good place. One described the US offer of intelligence and troops as a game-changer. Another said it much more closely resembled the so-called American backstop sought by European nations over the last year.The aim of the recent meetings between US, European and Ukrainian officials has been to finalize an agreement on security guarantees. It remains unclear whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would agree to the proposals. Ukraine’s allies will push for Russian participation after an agreement on security is reached with the US, one of the people said.Other key sticking points remain, especially on territory, where Moscow is seeking the full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the Donbas region of the country — something Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has rejected.Zelenskiy told reporters over the weekend that the Paris meeting will “talk over the final details” of security guarantees. Kyiv and its European allies have insisted a strong deterrent is needed to ensure that Russia doesn’t attack Ukraine again after a peace deal is reached.Zelenskiy said he’s asked Trump for security guarantees that could cover a period as long as half a century. Current proposals set out a 15-year term with the possibility of an extension.Ukraine hopes to set up a meeting in the US at the leaders’ level by the end of January, he added.Bloomberg previously reported that Ukraine’s allies were seeking a tiered approach to security guarantees. Beefed-up Ukrainian armed forces would become the first line of defense in the event of a ceasefire, then a multinational force from the coalition of the willing countries would be deployed further away from the frontline with the US providing a so-called backstop.With assistance from Daryna Krasnolutska.©2026 Bloomberg L.P.This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/ukraines-allies-aim-to-secure-us-offer-to-deploy-troops-postwar-11767640577886.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/05/1600x900/logo/Politics_1545994646567_1767640581296.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 19:16:17","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.056},{"id":391482632,"title":"Gold hits one-week high after US strikes in Venezuela","text":"By Anjana AnilJan 5 - Gold rose to a one-week high on Monday, after U.S. strikes in Venezuela added to bullion's safe-haven appeal.Spot gold rose 2.7% to $4,444.52 an ounce by 1:38 p.m. ET , after earlier hitting its highest level since December 29.

The operation took place on Saturday and was followed by President Donald Trump’s announcement that Washington would temporarily govern the oil-rich South American nation until a transition was put in place.\n\nAmbassador Jadoon told the Council that such unilateral actions set “dangerous precedents” that erode the foundations of the global legal framework and threaten the doctrine of sovereign immunity. He cautioned that history had repeatedly shown that military interventions often fuel instability, leading to outcomes that remain “unpredictable and uncontrollable” for years.\n\nHe said the situation was unfolding at a time when the world was already grappling with multiple crises, adding that further destabilisation in Latin America would pose serious risks to both regional and international peace and security.\n\n\nUnilateral military action contravenes the sacrosanct principles of the UN Charter and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Such actions set dangerous precedents that risk eroding the foundations of the global legal framework. They also fuel instability, which – as history has… pic.twitter.com/ZG56LiPt7g\n— Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN (@PakistanUN_NY) January 5, 2026\n\nRecalling the obligations enshrined in the UN Charter, the Pakistani envoy stressed that states were bound to refrain from the threat or use of force against any country’s political independence. He said durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means, with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people and without external interference.\n\nAt this critical juncture, he added, the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy rather than coercion. Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation and engage in meaningful dialogue, including through sincere offers of mediation.\n\nAmbassador Jadoon also expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised internationally as a Zone of Peace, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards greater regional cooperation and prosperity.\n\nReaffirming Pakistan’s position, he said his country remained committed to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security by promoting peaceful settlement of disputes and upholding respect for international law.\n\n“Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said.\n\nPresident Maduro pleads not guilty to charges of narco-terrorism at US court\n\nThe emergency session was held just hours before President Maduro was scheduled to appear before a federal court in Manhattan to face drug-related charges, including allegations of narco-terrorism conspiracy. The US administration has described the operation as a law enforcement action rather than a military intervention.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also raised alarm over the developments, warning of a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela and its wider regional impact. In a statement delivered to the Council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo, Guterres said he was deeply concerned about the precedent the operation might set for relations between states.\n\nHe called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue and said the United Nations stood ready to support efforts aimed at helping Venezuelans find a peaceful way forward. The UN chief also expressed concern that the operation to capture President Maduro did not respect the rules of international law.\n\nSeveral Council members echoed these concerns. Colombia, which requested the emergency meeting, condemned the US action as a clear violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity. Colombia’s UN Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there was no justification under any circumstances for the unilateral use of force, describing it as an act of aggression in breach of the UN Charter.\n\nChina’s representative said Beijing was deeply shocked by what he termed unilateral and illegal actions by the United States, accusing Washington of placing power above multilateralism and military force above diplomacy. He warned that the operation posed a grave threat to peace in Latin America and urged a return to dialogue.\n\nRussia’s Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia also condemned the US action as armed aggression, calling for the immediate release of what he described as Venezuela’s legitimately elected president and his spouse. He accused Washington of pursuing control over Venezuela’s natural resources and warned against justifying what he called a flagrant violation of international law.\n\nDefending the operation, US Ambassador to the United Nations Michael G. Waltz told the Council that Washington had carried out a “surgical law enforcement operation” to apprehend two indicted fugitives. He insisted the action did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people and compared it to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panama’s former leader Manuel Noriega.\n\nPresident Trump, speaking after the operation, said the United States would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition” could take place, arguing that the move was necessary to prevent a repeat of past instability.","url":"https://www.dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/927900-dangerous-precedent-pakistan-warns-unsc-against-unilateral-action-i","image":"https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2026/January/01-06-26/news_big_images/927900_36957085.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 07:01:00","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":391540638,"title":"‘I am still President’: Nicolas Maduro stands defiant in US Court as wife appears bruised – Everything he told judge","text":"Two days after he was taken from a compound in Caracas, Venezuela’s former president Nicolás Maduro stood inside a Manhattan courtroom on Monday. Wearing a navy shirt over his orange prison clothes and headphones for translation, Maduro pleaded not guilty to US charges and called himself a “prisoner of war.” Maduro formally rejected charges of narco-terrorism and cocaine trafficking brought against him by US prosecutors. Here’s everything he told the court on Monday. ‘I Was Kidnapped,’ Maduro tells the Court Maduro entered the courtroom right at noon, escorted by US marshals. His black hair, streaked with grey, was neatly combed. He walked slowly and scanned the packed room filled with lawyers, reporters, and spectators. “Buenos días,” he said to the crowd. He sat two chairs away from his wife, Cilia Flores, with one of her lawyers seated between them. Flores had visible bruises and bandages on her face. Maduro tried to keep speaking after entering his plea. He went on to say that he was captured at his home in Caracas on Saturday, January 3. He said he had been kidnapped and wanted to explain himself further. But Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein stopped him. “I only want to know one thing,” the judge said. “Are you Nicolás Maduro Moros?” “I am Nicolás Maduro Moros,” Maduro replied. ALSO READWho is Tim Walz? Lawmaker drops out of Minnesota Governor’s race amid fraud scandal The former strongman of Venezuela was forced to follow courtroom rules, where the judge -- not the president--has the final say. Maduro kept a calm face, but, according to the reporters, his hands kept moving. Sometimes he gripped the chair tightly. Other times, he folded his hands below his chin like he was praying. Maduro was captured on Saturday during an operation involving US Army Delta Force commandos. He was taken to the United States along with his wife, Cilia Flores, who also faces criminal charges. ‘I am still President’: Maduro speaks out in US court “I’m innocent. I’m not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still the president of my country,” he kept saying in Spanish, according to the CNN reporters present inside. Maduro pleaded not guilty to all four charges against him, which include drug trafficking and weapons offences. His wife, Cilia Flores, also pleaded not guilty. “Not guilty, completely innocent,” Flores told the judge. Neither Maduro nor Flores asked for bail or release. Their next court hearing has been set for March 17 at 11 am ET. Maduro’s lawyers question the arrest Maduro’s lawyer, Barry Pollack, told the court that he may file motions questioning whether Maduro should be treated as the head of a sovereign country. He also raised concerns about the legality of Maduro’s military capture on foreign soil.

But the US stopped recognising Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate president after the disputed 2019 election. Washington also rejected the results of the July 2024 election, which Maduro claimed he won again. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Maduro had been a fugitive from American justice for years. Maduro was first indicted in New York five years ago. Maduro, who became president in 2013 after Hugo Chávez's death, is expected to challenge the legality of his arrest. He is also expected to challenge the US government’s refusal to recognise him as Venezuela’s rightful leader. Charges against Maduro Prosecutors in New York have been pursuing Maduro for years. Along with narco-terrorism and cocaine importation charges, he also pleaded not guilty to charges involving machine guns. As the hearing continued, Maduro pushed the limits of what he could say. At one point, he asked the judge to let him keep his written notes. “I believe you are entitled to keep them,” Judge Hellerstein replied. The indictment names six defendants in total. They include Maduro’s son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, known as Nicolásito. Alongside him, the documents, according to the NYT, named former Interior Minister Ramón Rodríguez Chacín, current Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, and Héctor Guerrero Flores, the leader of the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The Trump administration has labelled Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation and linked it to Maduro’s government. Allegations against Cilia Flores Prosecutors say Maduro, Flores, and others partnered with drug traffickers who trafficked cocaine from Venezuela to the US through countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico. Flores is charged in the drug trafficking conspiracy but not in the narco-terrorism case. The indictment also claims she attended a meeting in 2007 where she accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to arrange a meeting between a major drug trafficker and Venezuela’s top anti-drug official at the time. Trump Says, ‘We’re in Charge’ As Maduro faced the judge in New York, President Donald Trump was making bold statements, speaking to the reporters. Speaking to NBC News, Trump said he considers himself in charge of Venezuela. When asked who is ultimately running the country, Trump answered, “Me.” Later, aboard Air Force One, Trump repeated the claim. “We’re in charge,” he said. Trump named several top officials involved in Venezuela-related decisions, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, White House official Stephen Miller, and Vice President JD Vance. Power shift in Caracas Back in Venezuela, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as acting president. As she took the oath, hundreds of Maduro supporters filled the streets of Caracas. They waved Venezuelan flags and held banners showing support for the ousted leader. Maduro’s son, Nicolás Maduro Guerra, addressed Venezuela’s National Assembly just two days after his parents were captured. He said the United States had kidnapped his father and called for international support. “If we normalise the kidnapping of a head of state, no country is safe,” he said. “Today it’s Venezuela. Tomorrow it could be any nation.”","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-news/i-am-still-president-nicolas-maduro-stands-defiant-in-us-court-as-wife-appears-bruised-everything-he-told-judge/4098521/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2026/01/Maduro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:30:42","author":"Aditi","authors":["Aditi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":391539954,"title":"Maduro’s capture sparks hope, concern among Venezuelans in Hong Kong","text":"Venezuelan Manny Reimi was queuing for Hong Kong’s Peak Tram on Saturday with his cousin and her family, whom he had not seen in 15 years, when news broke that the United States had captured Nicolas Maduro, the president of his homeland.\nThe 37-year-old father of two, who relocated from Venezuela to Hong Kong in 2011 and now runs a consultancy and artificial intelligence-related start-up in the city, said the family felt “exhilarated”.\nOne nephew even confessed that he had wished for Maduro’s downfall during an earlier visit to Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan.\n“I feel hopeful,” Reimi said. “[It] looks like the Venezuelan regime has been mortally wounded.”\nHis only concern, he added, was that the regime would once again, “like Maduro did many times in the past, find a way to cling to power”.\nAs the world digests the news of Maduro’s capture, some Venezuelans in Hong Kong who are critical of their president have rejoiced and expressed hope tempered with concern for their nation’s future.\nUS forces launched a pre-dawn raid on Saturday to capture the president and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were flown to New York to face charges of narcoterrorism conspiracy and illegal arms trafficking.\nThe brazen display of American military power, preceded by months of troop build-up in the region, sparked controversy within the international community.\nIt drew swift condemnation from neighbouring Latin American countries as well as from China and Russia, with the latter describing it as an “act of armed aggression”.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday delivered a veiled swipe at Washington, warning of “unilateral acts of hegemony severely undermining international order”.\nEven traditional American allies in Europe called for respect for international law in the raid’s aftermath.\n\nBut after years of what they described as rampant crime, economic crisis and authoritarian rule, Venezuelans who spoke to the Post said they welcomed any action that might bring about change.\n“This is not a political situation, it’s more like a hostage situation,” said 40-year-old Christian Mendoza, describing the life of ordinary Venezuelans in the country.\n“I support anyone who helps Venezuelans recover their freedom.”\nMendoza, who has lived in Hong Kong since 2015 and works in the cryptocurrency industry, described life in Venezuela before he left as a “constant battle” where “surviving felt almost impossible”.\n“There were shortages of everything,” he said. “Food, medicine, you name it. We’d see miles-long lines just to get basic supplies.”\nMendoza said crime was so rampant that kidnappings were viewed as a daily occurrence, adding that he was robbed at gunpoint “at least twice a year”.\n“There was just no future left,” he said.\nMendoza said he felt a mix of emotions following the US operation. While he was glad to see Maduro gone, he described it as only “the first step”, noting that the same regime remained in power.\nWhile President Donald Trump has declared that the US is “in charge” of Venezuela, Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, has assumed control of the fractured and divided country.\nTrump has since threatened more military action if she does not cooperate.\nDiego Molina, who has lived in Hong Kong for six years, shared a similar view to others the Post spoke to.\nThe 31-year-old was born just five years before Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, became president and had little recollection of what Venezuela was like before.\n“We’ve been in this situation for so many years, hoping for something, and something else happens, and we are still with the same government,” Molina, who works in marketing, said.\nAlthough he described Trump as one of the politicians he “hated most in the world”, Molina said he was grateful that the US president had ousted Maduro.\nHe acknowledged criticism that Trump’s actions were driven by Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, believed to be the largest in the world, but argued that other countries, such as Cuba and Iran, had also exploited the country in similar ways.\nMolina, who left Venezuela when he was 16 and has only returned a few times since, recalled watching from afar as his relatives struggled.\nHis uncles and aunts lost weight while his grandparents’ skin changed colour due to a lack of proper nutrition, he said.\n“We don’t know if it’s going to be good or bad in the future, but for me, after 26 years, it’s a change. Everyone wants their country to be the greatest; I just want a regular country.”\nThe Post contacted Venezuela’s consulate in Hong Kong for comment, which directed all correspondence to the country’s ambassador in Beijing.

The last hearing took place in November, with a final ruling expected in 2026.India is among the countries facing steep US tariffs.

Among the vehicles with sizable gains were the Chevrolet Equinox, a small \"crossover\" sport utility vehicle and the GMC Sierra line of pickup trucks.\"Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,\" said GM senior vice president Duncan Aldred.At Toyota, fourth-quarter sales rose about eight percent to 652,195, in line with annual growth of comparable percentage. Total sales were 2.5 million for 2025.Toyota models with significant year-over-year sales increases included the Grand Highlander SUV and Tacoma pickup.Tariff effect?Stellantis, meanwhile, scored a four percent increase in the fourth-quarter to 332,321, helping to reduce the size of its annual drop after a number of weak quarters. Stellantis annual sales fell three percent to 1.3 million.\"With consecutive quarterly sales increases and market share growth, it's clear that we are taking the right steps to reset our business in the US,\" said Jeff Kommor, head of US retail sales, who pointed to five new vehicle launches scheduled for 2026.Throughout 2025, automakers were faced with a fast-changing policy environment as Trump announced myriad tariff actions and moved to gut climate measures enacted under predecessor Joe Biden.Tariff costs did not lead to significant hikes in retail prices in 2025, in part because dealers were selling autos from inventory.However, analysts say consumers may see greater car price hikes in 2026 due to tariffs, potentially affecting demand.Cox estimates that US sales will come in at 15.8 million in 2026, or 2.4 percent below its projection for 2025 sales.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/lower-demand-for-electric-cars-dents-gms-sales/articleshow/126363725.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126363730/126363730.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:23:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":391539022,"title":"Reliance rejects claims of Russian Oil cargos coming to Jamnagar refinery, says news report “tarnishing our image”","text":"Reliance Industries Limited has categorically rejected any claims of Russian oil cargos coming to their Jamnagar refinery, claiming that such news reports are “blatantly untrue” and is “tarnishing our image”. While mentioning a Bloomberg News report, RIL reiterated that it has not recieved any shipments of Russian oil in the last 3 weeks and is “not expecting any Russian crude oil deliveries in January.”In a statement posted on X on Tuesday, Reliance Industries Limited said a Bloomberg report claiming that “three vessels laden with Russian Oil are heading for Reliance Industries Limited’s Jamnagar refinery” was incorrect. Reliance also expressed disappointment that its denial was allegedly ignored in the report’s publication.“A news report in Bloomberg claiming “three vessels laden with Russian Oil are heading for Reliance Industries Limited’s Jamnagar refinery” is blatantly untrue. Reliance Industries’s Jamnagar refinery has not received any cargo of Russian oil at its refinery in the past three weeks approx. and is not expecting any Russian crude oil deliveries in January,” RIL posted on X. Saying that the report had hurt the company’s reputation, RIL added, ” We are deeply pained that those claiming to be at the forefront of fair journalism chose to ignore the denial by RIL of buying any Russian oil to be delivered in January and published a wrong report tarnishing our image.”A Bloomberg report titled ‘Ships with Russian oil signal Reliance Plant as Destination’ had claimed that shipping data indicated the movement of Russian crude towards India’s west coast. According to Bloomberg, “A Reliance spokesman denied that the cargoes had been purchased by the company, adding that it didn’t have any committed shipments of Russian crude for delivery in January.”Bloomberg further reported that, “At least three tankers carrying Russian crude are indicating Reliance Industries Ltd.’s plant on India’s west coast as their next destination, after the refiner restarted some purchases for domestic production.”As per the report, “The vessels, laden with nearly 2.2 million barrels of Urals, are currently signalling the huge Jamnagar complex and are expected to deliver their cargoes early this month, according to data analytics firm Kpler.”Explaining the basis of the data, Bloomberg said, “Kpler tracks the movement of vessels based on live signals sent by captains detailing their current location and upcoming discharge ports. Destinations can change as the ships approach India.”Bloomberg reiterated the company’s denial in its report, stating, “A Reliance spokesman denied that the cargoes had been purchased by the company, adding that it didn’t have any committed shipments of Russian crude for delivery in January.”The statement by RIL comes amid US imposing tariffs on the import of Indian goods as a “penalty” for India buying Russian oil. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, while referring to an audio clip of US President Donald Trump, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra is “under his control.”Kharge told reporters, “I heard an audio today wherein Trump said (on Russian oil) that he knows that Modi respects him and listens to him. What does this mean? It means that Modi is under his control,” Kharge said. Drawing a pop-culture analogy, he added, “I am reminded of a dialogue from Mr India – ‘Mogambo Khush Hua’. After the Ambassador spoke to him, Trump said ‘Mogambo Khush Hua’.”The opposition’s remarks come amid Trump’s threats of higher tariffs and possible sanctions on Indian exports for continued Russian oil imports.Earlier, the Congress again cited Trump’s comments in a post on X.“Donald Trump says India reduced its oil purchases from Russia because Modi wants to keep him happy.

You can't have an election. There's no way the people could even vote,\" he said. \"No, it's going to take a period of time. We have — we have to nurse the country back to health.\" ,He added that the United States could subsidise efforts by oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy infrastructure, a project he said could take less than 18 months. ,\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" Trump said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they'll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\",,Trump insisted that the US is not at war with Venezuela. ,\"No, we're not,\" he said. \"We're at war with people that sell drugs. We're at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\" ,The interview came just hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was captured in the early hours of Saturday during a raid by US special forces and law enforcement officials at a compound in Caracas. ,Maduro pleaded not guilty and said he remains Venezuela's leader, even as Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in on Monday as his successor.,,Trump said Rodríguez had been cooperating with US officials but denied that there had been any coordination with her camp before Maduro's removal. ,\"No, that's not the case,\" he said, adding that a decision would soon be made on whether existing US sanctions against Rodríguez would remain in place or be lifted. ,Asked whether there had been \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied: \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that the operation went ahead without the help of Maduro's inner circle. ,Trump declined to say whether he had personally spoken to Rodríguez, but said Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong\". ,He also suggested the US could carry out a second military incursion if Rodríguez stopped cooperating with American officials, though he said he did not expect that to be necessary. ,\"We're prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\" ,The president also denied a report by The Washington Post that he had ruled out Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado playing a leading role because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year — an award Trump has previously said he wanted. ,\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\",Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"During an interview on Monday, US President Donald Trump also insisted that America is not at war with Venezuela","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/us-president-donald-trump-control-venezuela-elections-date-nbc-interview-article-153401590","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153401591,thumbsize-24608,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153401591.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:14:36","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":391537490,"title":"Why this celebrity enclave is still a burnt-out ghost town a year after the LA wildfires","text":"An acrid smell of smoke still hangs heavy in the air despite a cool breeze blowing off the Pacific. I am standing in front of what used to be Sir Anthony Hopkins' magnificent colonial-style mansion – now an empty lot behind makeshift plywood fencing with a 'private property' sign attached.\n\nTomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of the devastating Pacific Palisades fire, which destroyed 7,000 homes and businesses in what was one of LA's most exclusive suburbs, killing 12 people and displacing nearly 100,000 residents. The cost of the wildfire has been put at $28billion (£18billion).\n\nAnd it appears – like many who once loved this quiet enclave overlooking the ocean, a haven where many of the greats of Hollywood once lived – that Sir Anthony, 88, has also given up on his destroyed home ever being restored to its former glory – at least, not in his lifetime.\n\nA 'For Sale' sign hangs outside the fire-ravaged remnants of his estate; two adjacent lots which he bought in 2018 and 2019 for a total of $12.6million. Originally built in 1940, the weatherboarded main house was lovingly restored by Hopkins and his third wife, Stella Arroyave, 69.\n\nThere was also a guesthouse-cum-art-studio on the amalgamated estate – also destroyed.\n\nOnly the concrete foundations of the garage, a chimney stack, and the mud-filled pool remain.\n\nThe estate was valued at just $6.4million when it was put on the market last year, and realtors are believed to be in the process of selling it to developers as two divided lots, suggesting the original house will never be rebuilt.\n\nOscar-winner Sir Anthony took to Instagram days after the tragedy, saying: 'As we struggle to heal from the devastation of these fires, it's important we remember that the only thing we take with us is the love we give.'\n\nThe actor is now renting a home in nearby Brentwood. A mutual friend told me: 'At his age, he doesn't want to rebuild. It's time to sell up and move on.'\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by many.\n\nVisiting Pacific Palisades on the eve of memorials and protests scheduled to mark the anniversary left me with a heavy heart.\n\nI was one of the first journalists to arrive here in the early hours of January 8, 2025, not long after the wildfire raced down the Santa Monica Mountains, obliterating nearly everything in its wake.\n\nNavigating my way through police roadblocks and driving around downed electric cables that were still sparking, the scale of the devastation was obvious.\n\nEntire blocks had been razed. Poisonous fumes spewed from burned-out Teslas. Houses were still burning. Exhausted firemen complained they had been forced to abandon the fight because water in the fire hydrants ran out. I saw the charred remains of scores of homes, including those belonging to Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton, and John Goodman.\n\nYet, despite the shock, I felt confident the American 'can do' spirit would prevail. I spoke to city officials who vowed to 'build, build, build!' and locals who proudly put up 'Palisades Strong' signs.\n\nWithin days, hundreds of fund-raising benefit events had been arranged. One of the biggest, a 'Fire Aid' concert starring Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Rod Stewart, Sting, and Stevie Wonder raised over $100million.\n\nSo why, when I visited this week, is the Palisades still a ghost town in ruin?\n\nEven the handful of businesses and houses that miraculously escaped the blaze are boarded up.\n\nThere is some construction going on. Crews of Mexican workers are working on homes, mostly for corporate developers, which look like vast McMansions rising from the rubble.\n\nI bumped into a local, who gave her name only as 'Karen'.\n\nShe had come back to look at the remains of her family home, something she told me she often does without telling her husband or children: 'We're living in Santa Monica now, in a rented apartment,' she explained.\n\n'The kids are traumatised. We lost everything. The mayor and the insurance companies promised to fast-track the rebuilding process, but those were empty lies. Some people have received insurance payouts, but we're fighting for ours. It's impossible to get permits to rebuild. We're jumping through hoops to offer proof that our lot has been cleared of toxins to please the eco mob. We were offered $1 million to rebuild a family home that belonged to my grandparents. It was worth at least three times that.\n\n'They [the authorities] have tied us up in red tape. They don't want to help families. They want developers to maximise the size of the properties so they earn more in property taxes. There's huge anger towards the mayor, governor, insurance companies, and the incompetence that allowed this fire to destroy our town in the first place.'\n\nThe anger is palpable. Signs all over town declare: 'They Let Us Burn!'\n\nIt is not far from the truth. For one year after the conflagration, controversy rages.\n\nAn investigation last month by the LA Times showed firefighters voiced 'grave concerns' at the time about being pulled off an earlier fire in the area, known as the Lachman fire, five days before the Palisades inferno.\n\nThat eight-acre bush fire was declared 'contained' despite whistleblowers claiming the ground was smouldering, and rocks remained hot to the touch.\n\nA former Pacific Palisades resident, Jonathan Rinderknecht, now living in Florida, who was working as an Uber driver at the time, has since been arrested and charged with starting the Lachman fire, which caused the Palisades Fire, and is facing a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail if convicted.\n\nA Los Angeles Fire Department report said strong winds stoked the Lachman fire into a wall of 50-foot-high flames, which tore down the mountains and straight into Pacific Palisades.\n\nTo compound matters, firefighters quickly ran out of water.\n\nA reservoir, built specifically to provide water to fight wildfires and which should have contained 117 million gallons, was empty. It had been closed for repairs for nine months.\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles' left-wing mayor, Karen Bass, was away on a 'jolly' in Ghana, to celebrate the inauguration of John Mahama as the new Ghanaian president.\n\nPhotographs of her at a cocktail party while the fires raged fuelled public anger. Bass later admitted it was a 'mistake' not to jump on a plane immediately, but blamed the fire chief for not calling her to flag the severity of the situation.\n\nLike many, I was stunned that one of the richest parts of LA, a place where you would routinely see stars like Ben Affleck and Tom Hanks at the local Starbucks – housed in a beautiful 1924 historic building – could be wiped out overnight.\n\nBut I also assumed that the sheer star wattage of many of those affected would spearhead a massive clean-up and rebuilding project that would move at warp speed. Not so.\n\nThis week, I drove past Billy Crystal's home, where only a stone-arched front door now remains. His lot also displays a 'For Sale' sign.\n\nParis Hilton watched 'in horror' as her beachside weekend home burned to the ground on TV. It remains rubble in the sand.\n\nThere is no sign of any building work at John Goodman's house either.\n\nSchools remain shut. Supermarkets have been demolished but not rebuilt. No one had counted on 'woke' California's endless bureaucratic red tape on everything from regulating when a cleared site could be declared 'safe' from toxins, to lengthy delays in issuing building permits, stalling by insurance companies, and political rows.\n\nMayor Bass hired a 'fire czar', wealthy real estate developer Steve Soboroff, on a salary of $500,000 (£369,000) for a 90-day contract, prompting a public outcry.\n\nHe would complain he had been 'lied to' that his salary would be paid by philanthropic donations, although later distanced himself from that comment, saying: 'That's not what I feel and not what I meant.'\n\nWithin the past couple of weeks, Bass has come under fire again for grandly announcing that the first certificate of occupancy had been issued for a rebuilt home in the Palisades.\n\nIt emerged that the home belonged to a professional contractor who obtained all the necessary building permits before the fire conveniently demolished the existing house and allowed him to start building his new dwelling, which, he said, will be used as a 'show home' for other properties he intends to build.\n\nOne friend, who worked for a major movie star for decades, lost her home of 40 years in the fire.\n\nShe told me: 'Pacific Palisades was a wealthy area, but a lot of that wealth, like mine, was inherited. Yes, you have movie stars in big houses, but you also had people like me who had 1940s cottages they'd inherited from their parents.\n\n'That was part of the charm of the place. Of course, the proximity to the ocean and the endless sunshine are what attracted people, but Pacific Palisades had a small-town feel. Neighbour helped neighbour, even when that neighbour turned out to be Steven Spielberg.\n\n'Building permits have been issued, but they're mostly to professional contractors who bought cheap and are maximising the size of the McMansions they are building on each lot. I'm not sure I want to return even if I get the insurance money to rebuild. It's not going to be the same. All we're seeing is homogenised mega mansions.'\n\nSpencer Pratt is a former reality star who has become one of the most outspoken critics of what he calls a 'conspiracy' that allowed the Palisades to burn.\n\nPratt, 42, made his name on a show called The Hills, married co-star Heidi Montag, and appeared on Celebrity Big Brother twice. The couple were runners-up in 2013 and returned for an all-stars season in 2017.\n\nThey have two children and moved to a hillside home in the Palisades to be near his parents.\n\nPratt had his one million Instagram followers on edge as he live-streamed the fire racing towards his 2,200 square feet, three-bedroom property before showing his family's escape.\n\nHe is spearheading a lawsuit against the City of Los Angeles and the LA Department of Water and Power (LADWP) – which controlled the empty reservoir – citing negligence and mismanagement.\n\nTwo dozen neighbours have joined the suit, seeking millions in compensation for property damage, lost wages, and emotional distress.\n\nHe said: 'Everyone processes trauma differently. I've tried to channel all my emotional energy into accountability and making it clear that this was preventable. This was no act of God. This was gross negligence.'\n\nPratt rails against major corporations snapping up land parcels from distressed sellers. He posts regularly about the 'dereliction of duty' at Democrat-managed government agencies including what he calls the 'utter incompetence' of California's Governor Gavin Newsom.\n\nNewsom is hotly-tipped to run as the Democratic candidate for the Presidential elections in 2028, but Pratt argues that he's been to Washington to fight for aid on more occasions than the Governor.\n\nGovernor Newsom's high-powered PR team has accused Pratt of being a conspiracy theorist and posted pictures of him online that compared him during his reality-TV peak to how he looks now.\n\nPratt fired back: 'I'm sure my appearance would be better if Newsom hadn't let my town burn down. Stress alone has taken years off my life.'\n\nThe star grew up in the Palisades. His parents' house burned down, too. He took pleasure in raising his sons, ages eight and three, in his hometown. 'They went to my preschool. Then I watched footage of their bedroom ignite. It was surreal. I will never stop fighting for justice.'\n\nWhile Pratt had insurance, the money is nowhere near enough for him to rebuild his $5.5 million home.\n\n'Most people we know in the same circumstances have given up, sold up and moved.'\n\nPratt and his wife have launched a podcast, 'The Fame Game,' which they broadcast from plastic lawn chairs on their burnt-out lot.\n\nHe said: 'I'm still paying for the mortgage. I don't have a single photo from before an iPhone existed. They're all gone. Everything I ever bought in my life burned down. Everything my parents ever bought in their lives burned down.'\n\nThere have been claims that some of the land has been snatched up by Chinese-backed corporations seeking a foothold in one of America's most desirable places.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who ordered snow run-off water from the mountains in northern California to be released into Pacific Palisades to replenish water supplies, has ordered a Congressional investigation into the failures that led to the fire.\n\nHe has been scathing about Newsom, whom he calls 'incompetent' for regulating water levels in LA to appease environmentalists who were opposed to snow run-off water being moved to ease the water shortages in LA. Trump, who made his fortune as a builder in New York, has lambasted Newsom and Bass for failing to fast-track building permits and for imposing 'prohibitive' property taxes on those who wish to rebuild.\n\nThe president has ordered an official investigation into what happened to the tens of millions of charity dollars raised after the fires.\n\nThe organisation behind Fire Aid has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, as have other charitable groups. Nonetheless, victims like Pratt say they have yet to see a penny.\n\nMayor Bass and Governor Newsom have both denied stalling aid programmes or delaying the issuing of rebuilding permits.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the official investigations, as I drove out of Pacific Palisades last week, past the burned-out facade of Starbucks, it is clear something has gone catastrophically wrong.","summary":"Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of the Pacific Palisades fire, which destroyed 7,000 homes and businesses, killing 12 people and displacing nearly 100,000 residents.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15436819/Why-celebrity-enclave-burnt-ghost-town-year-LA-wildfires.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/06/01/105254177-0-image-a-14_1767661874800.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/09/5968259112462432257/1024x576_MP4_5968259112462432257.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:11:47","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":391537478,"title":"Gunfire and anti-aircraft blasts heard near Venezuela's presidential palace as chaos unfolds after Maduro's ouster","text":"Heavy gunfire has been reported near the presidential palace in Caracas, Venezuela, hours after ousted President Nicolás Maduro faced a New York courtroom.\n\nExtraordinary vision emerged on social media on Monday night appearing to capture the soudn of a hail of bullets descending on Venezuela's capital.\n\nLocals said 'anti-aircraft' blasts were heard from the general vicinity of the presidential palace after days of chaos in the streets since Maduro and his wife were captured from their home and whisked to America to face drug trafficking charges.\n\nIt comes after Maduro declared himself 'the president of my country' as he protested his capture and pleaded not guilty Monday to federal charges that the Trump administration used to justify removing him from power in Venezuela.\n\n'I was captured,' Maduro said in Spanish as translated by a courtroom interpreter before being cut off by the judge. \n\nAsked later for his plea to the charges, he stated: 'I am innocent.

The amounts do not include any personal investment from Ramaswamy, the campaign said.\n\n“You simply don’t see this level of support in a gubernatorial race in Ohio,” said Jonathan Ewing, campaign manager for Vivek Ramaswamy for Ohio. “Raising $9.88 million in a single reporting period and nearly $20 million in the year before the election sends an unmistakable message: Vivek’s campaign has historic momentum that no other campaign can match.”\n\nAccording to the campaign, Ramaswamy raised more than $19.57 million in 2025, more than doubling the previous Ohio gubernatorial fundraising record of $8.4 million set by then-candidate Mike DeWine in 2017.\n\nSince launching his campaign in late February 2025, Ramaswamy has held 112 campaign events that included a fundraising component, the campaign said. It added that the $9.7 million raised earlier in 2025 came from 40,000 unique donors and that the $9.88 million raised in the second half of the year similarly reflects contributions from supporters alone.\n\nThe campaign said Ramaswamy’s early fundraising has already outpaced the total campaign receipts of several past Ohio gubernatorial candidates. In his first two filings, the campaign said, Ramaswamy raised more than the entire campaign totals of Republican John Kasich in 2010 and 2014, Republican Mike DeWine in 2022, and Democrat Richard Cordray in 2018.\n\nCampaign officials also pointed to endorsements as evidence of political momentum.

In the first of a two-part series, Seong Hyeon Choi looks at how historically fraught China-Japan ties might fare as Tokyo bolsters its military posture with record budgets and advanced weaponry.\nChina and Japan have never fully resolved the decades-old grudges of their wartime history and territorial disputes, but it was near the end of 2025 – the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Asia – that military tensions seemed to stir in ways rarely seen for years.\nThe Donald Trump administration’s National Security Strategy, released in December, included a pledge to deter conflict in the first island chain with the focus on the Taiwan Strait.\nThe series of islands and archipelagos along the eastern edge of continental Asia, stretching from Japan through the Philippines, is part of a US containment strategy to restrict Chinese military access to the Pacific Ocean.\nThe security document stressed that the United States “must urge” allies such as Japan and South Korea to increase their share of the defence burden to “deter adversaries and protect the first island chain”.\nAlso in December, a Pentagon report warned that the Chinese military build-up was leaving the US “vulnerable”, adding to the pressure on Washington’s Indo-Pacific allies to boost defence spending and driving the region towards a tense crossroads between China and its neighbours.\n\nAnalysts say regional pressure is likely to intensify as China’s military activities persist and Japan bolsters its long-range counterstrike missiles as part of collective defence in the first island chain.\nTensions between Beijing and Tokyo have spiralled since Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Japan could take military action in the event of an attack on Taiwan.\nHer remarks prompted strong protests as well as economic and diplomatic retaliation from Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary.\nMost countries, including the US and its treaty ally Japan, do not recognise self-governed Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any forcible change to the status quo and is legally bound to supply Taipei with weapons for defence.\nThe row escalated militarily when Tokyo said that Chinese J-15 fighters in international airspace near Japan’s Okinawa islands had locked fire-control radar on Japanese F-15 jets – a dangerous step towards weapon targeting. Beijing in turn accused Tokyo of harassing its forces during normal military exercises and training.\n\nDennis Wilder, a professor at Georgetown University and a former CIA official, said a “certain amount of underlying tension” between China and Japan would persist as long as Takaichi remained in office.\n“Both sides have reasons to tone down the spat, particularly because of the economic dimensions of the relationship,” he said. “But she is unlikely to take steps to reassure Beijing on the military front because Japan is committed to countering the growing Chinese threat.”\nCollin Koh, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, also said tensions “look set to persist” but did not rule out de-escalation.\nHowever, both sides would be most likely to “entrench their respective positions while seeking an off-ramp”, he said.\n“We would have to see whether Takaichi gets to meet Trump in early 2026 before his planned summit with [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping], and there could be a turning point in this. But until then, we will expect Beijing to keep up with the rhetoric against Takaichi,” Koh said.\n“Given the ramping up of tensions over the radar-lock incident, both governments are likely to be mindful of provoking an armed provocation. So they’ll keep tensions confined to rhetorical and military posturing.”\n\nThe China-Japan spat has paralleled rising military tensions near the Taiwan Strait and East China Sea, prompting Tokyo to abandon its decades-long disarmament policy.\nIn late November, the Japanese cabinet approved a supplementary budget proposal that included 1.1 trillion yen (US$7.1 billion) in additional defence spending, taking the total to 11 trillion yen – or more than 2 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product.\nTokyo has barred its defence spending from exceeding 1 per cent of GDP since the end of World War II.\nThe approval followed the defence ministry’s budget request in August for around US$60 billion in the next financial year, prioritising long-range missiles and naval procurement programmes seen as significant to deterring People’s Liberation Army advancement in the first island chain.\nJapanese anti-ship missiles could potentially deny the PLA Navy’s advance across the first island chain and impede access to the eastern flank of Taiwan, deemed essential to any attack on the island.\nNumerically, the PLA Navy has the largest fleet in the world, which it continues to modernise with the “goal of achieving sea superiority during a conflict over Taiwan”, according to the December Pentagon report.\nThe report noted that China maintained a “large reserve” of operationally ready ships that enabled it to “expand its persistent patrol presence and surge forces during crises and war”.\nAfter the November inauguration of the Fujian, its third aircraft carrier, the PLA Navy was likely to increase its fleet of carriers to nine by 2035, it said.\nThese developments would enhance its blue water capabilities, potentially driving increased military activities across the first island chain.\nSuch a manoeuvre would require the Chinese naval fleet to penetrate the waters between Japan’s southwestern islands, which host US troops as well as future Japanese anti-ship missile bases.\n\nKoh said that Japan’s record-breaking defence budgets would not result in any let-up in the PLA’s military activities.\n“It doesn’t mean deterrence fails, but beyond the military build-up, much of what we see persisting so far has been peacetime military activities, including what most would call grey-zone actions,” he said, referring to non-military activities aimed at undermining adversaries’ defences without triggering a full-scale war.\n“If deterrence holds, we assume also that Beijing will remain conscious of the US-Japan security alliance and be wary of accidentally provoking the invocation of the treaty obligations, given consistent signalling by Washington.”\nLiselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, noted that the Japanese defence ministry flagged the increasing PLA build-up as a justification for the spending boost.\nJapan’s military build-up was “real and accelerating” and coastal and fleet stand-off missiles would “raise the cost of Chinese naval advancement and strengthen deterrence”, especially when integrated with US and partner forces, she said.\nShe said there was “potential for accidental skirmishes” in hotspots such as the Diaoyu Islands, disputed East China Sea islands controlled as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, “if confrontations escalate further”.\n“The current diplomatic crisis is likely to redefine Japan-China relations permanently because Japan’s willingness to participate in a military conflict if Taiwan faces a survival-threatening situation is a red line for China,” she said.\n“Japan under Takaichi appears committed to maintaining a firmer stance aligned with the US, likely deepening military cooperation and bolstering deterrence.”\n\nTokyo plans to deploy Type 12 surface-to-ship missiles at Camp Kengun in Kumamoto prefecture, on the western coast of Kyushu Island. With a range of 1,000km (621 miles), mainland China and North Korea would be well within reach of the upgraded anti-ship missile, which recently completed a test launch in the US.\nIn September, Tokyo said its Kongo-class Aegis destroyer JS Chokai was heading to the US for a year-long deployment that would include modifications and training to operate Tomahawk cruise missiles, which have a range of around 1,600km, by September 2026.\nJapan signed a contract for 400 of the long-range missiles in January 2024, with plans to make all eight of its Aegis destroyers Tomahawk-capable, as well as two Aegis system-equipped vessel destroyers currently under construction.\nRetired US Navy officer John Bradford, a Japan Foundation fellow at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies, said Japanese “counterstrike” forces were intended to “destroy Chinese weapons systems before those weapons can attack Japan”.\nTokyo also had some of the “world’s best naval systems”, such as its destroyers and submarines, which would be “critical” to containing a PLA Navy force in a combat situation, he added.\n“Regardless of how the recent spat plays out, Japan is set to increase its defence capabilities. The capacity development areas to watch will be medium and long-range weapons, unmanned systems and – most important – munitions stockpiles.”\n\nStephen Nagy, from the International Christian University in Tokyo, said Japan’s focus on anti-ship missiles and extended-range strike capabilities “fundamentally alters” the strategic calculus by threatening China’s naval assets before they leave port.\n“But the real deterrent effect depends on demonstrating the political will to use them,” said Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies.\n“China will respond asymmetrically through cyber operations, supply chain weaponisation and intensified pressure on Japanese companies in China rather than matching capabilities directly, as they recognise Japan’s technological advantages in precision systems.”\nTokyo’s increased missile deployment has been opposed by Beijing, especially near the East China Sea. In November, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the deployment of Japanese missiles near Taiwan was a “deliberate move that breeds regional tensions and stokes military confrontation”.\nMao was responding to Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi’s remarks the same month, which outlined Tokyo’s plans to deploy medium-range surface-to-air missiles on Yonaguni Island, around 100km from Taiwan.\nWilder at Georgetown University said that while Japan’s weapons acquisitions were important, of greater significance was the greater coordination and integration of Japanese and US warfighting capabilities.\n“The new wartime command established in Tokyo, and its US equivalent, will be a big step in the development of serious Japanese defence capabilities,” he said, adding that Tokyo appeared to be more dedicated to deterring Beijing’s pressure than previously.\nOdgaard said that the security pressure on China would “intensify across multiple axes, not only in the Taiwan Strait”, but also in the East China Sea, South China Sea and Korean waters.\nShe said the combination of allied missile networks, undersea enhancements and US strategic signalling would force China to “allocate more resources to defence and deterrence, raising the risk of friction and miscalculation”.\n“China is likely to respond with expanded naval deployments, such as dual-carrier operations and more submarines; hypersonic and anti-ship ballistic missile exercises to stress US and allied surface forces,” Odgaard said.\n“But these moves will not change the fact that China faces more capable, networked adversaries in 2026 than previously.”","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3338769/china-japan-military-tensions-what-lies-ahead-2026?module=top_story&pgtype=homepage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2026/01/05/5960f36b-97fc-4082-a64f-2a3b8e061c32_b245fec5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:00:29","author":"Seong Hyeon Choi","authors":["Seong Hyeon Choi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.192},{"id":391539960,"title":"China-Japan military tensions: what lies ahead in 2026?","text":"As the new year unfolds, China finds itself grappling with strategic pressures fuelled by two US treaty allies at its doorstep – Japan and South Korea.

It is complicated, and even today, there are further developments.' Sir Keir ducked questions in the Commons about his stance, sending Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper to face MPs instead.\n\nLabour MPs lined up to criticise Mr Trump – and ask why the PM was not taking a tougher stance.\n\nDame Emily Thornberry said Maduro had led an 'abhorrent' regime, but warned that the Government was in danger of endorsing the 'law of the jungle', and it was 'not for the country that is breaking the law to say whether or not it is breaking the law'.\n\nDame Emily, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, added: 'We risk living in a world where might is right, and that cannot be in Britain's interests.'\n\nJohn McDonnell, Labour's former shadow chancellor, said the Government's stance was 'shameful', adding: 'Trump will interpret that as the green light to go in wherever, to steal the national assets of those countries.\n\n'And as a result of that, we are all in a more dangerous place.'\n\nMs Cooper said she raised the importance of respecting international law at the weekend with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nShe also signalled a breach with the Trump administration's approach, saying the UK believed the new Venezuelan regime sworn in under Maduro's deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, was not legitimate.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Sir Keir insisted the 'vast majority' of Labour MPs were opposed to Maduro's regime. 'What we need in Venezuela is a peaceful transition to democracy,' he said. 'That was our position before this weekend, it remains our position.'\n\nKemi Badenoch criticised Sir Keir for ducking MPs' scrutiny.\n\nShe said the 'jubilation' among many Venezuelans following Maduro's removal was no surprise because he led a 'gangster state'.\n\nThe Tory leader said it was clear that the US was 'acting in its national interest' and the UK should follow suit.\n\nFormer Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell suggested 'the end might justify the means'.\n\nVeteran Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh mocked the PM for sitting on the fence, adding: 'The PM is such a defender of international law he's not prepared to defend our own borders from small boats.\n\n'Why is it that there's one law for the US President doing what is right for his country and a different law for us?'\n\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said the US clearly broke international law and its actions would embolden authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.\n\nBut the fiercest criticism came from Labour MPs.

He also questioned whether the operation respected the rules of international law.\n\nSamuel Moncada, Venezuela’s ambassador to the UN, described the US action as an “illegitimate armed attack lacking any legal justification”.\n\nHowever, Trump’s UN ambassador Mike Waltz defended the attack as a legitimate “law enforcement” action to execute long-standing criminal indictments against an “illegitimate” leader, not an act of war.\n\nSpeaking on a visit to China, Taoiseach Micheál Martin would not condemn the US seizure of Maduro as a breach of the international rules-based order.\n\nMr Martin said the Irish government has “never accepted the legitimacy of the Maduro regime” which, he said had been “particularly brutal and repressive”.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez, who served as Nicolás Maduro’s vice president, was last night formally sworn in as Venezuela’s interim president.\n\nNicolás Maduro Guerra, Maduro’s son, pledged his support for Rodríguez.\n\n“To you, Delcy Eloína, My unconditional support for the difficult task ahead,” he said. “Count on me, count on my family, you can count on our resolve to take the right steps in facing this responsibility that now falls to you, and we stand firm in absolute unity to achieve the objective of peace in Venezuela, to move the country forward, and for the return of Nicolás and Cilia.”\n\nHe then turned his remarks to his father, and said: “You made all of us in the family strong people, we are here doing our duty until your return.\n\n The country is in good hands, Dad, and soon we will embrace each other here in Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark’s leader has warned that an attack by the United States on a Nato ally would mean the end of both the military alliance and “post-second world war security”.\n\nFresh from his military operation in Venezuela, the US president said on Sunday the US needed Greenland “very badly” — renewing fears of a US invasion of the largely autonomous island, which is a former Danish colony and remains part of the Danish kingdom. Greenland’s foreign and security policy continues to be controlled by Copenhagen.\n\nMette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, warned on Monday that any US attack on a Nato ally would be the end of “everything”.\n\n“If the United States decides to militarily attack another Nato country, then everything would stop — that includes Nato and therefore post-second world war security,” Frederiksen told Danish television network TV2.\n\n Additional reporting by the Guardian","summary":"He also claimed he was 'kidnapped' in a military incursion","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41770448.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9841/4920878_6_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2254194705_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 01:00:00","author":"David Smith And Paul Hosford,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["David Smith And Paul Hosford","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":391537100,"title":"Gemma Collins, 44, shows off her incredible weight loss in a cut out swimsuit as she hits the spa in five star London hotel","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jan 6th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurious fallen dictator Nicolás Maduro's hearing descends into chaos as he gets into shouting match with man claiming he was prisoner of his regime\n\nMaduro erupts and tells judge he was 'kidnapped' while wife Cilia shows off head injuries in first court appearance\n\nKeir Starmer refuses to say whether Donald Trump's capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro broke international law\n\nLabour 'is failing to build enough homes to keep pace with immigration'\n\nClaire's and The Original Factory Shop are being put into administration: 2,500 jobs at risk\n\nThis is exactly what you need to do to lose half a stone in just two weeks, with or WITHOUT fat jabs, by Dr Clare Bailey Mosley\n\nI'm divorcing my husband of 15 years after the final straw this Christmas.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:22:31 GMT, 5 January 2026 |Updated:00:55 GMT, 6 January 2026 \n\nLouise Thompson has said the way she will grow her family is 'complicated' as she shared her fears over her 'uncertain' fertility journey on Instagram on Monday. \nThe former Made In Chelsea star, 35, nearly died when she gave birth to her first child Leo-Hunter in 2021 after an emergency caesarean, druing which she lost '12 and a half litres of blood'.\nShe went on to suffer with PTSD and post-natal anxiety due to her near-death experience and has since been diagnosed with Lupus, Asherman's syndrome, suffered a second Hemorrhage, and has also had a stoma bag fitted.\nAnd Louise has spoken candidly about how she struggled being a new mother as she recovered from the trauma of the birth.\nHowever Louise has shared that she is hoping to 'expand her family' this year after her and partner Ryan are 'finally feeling ready' to welcome another child. \nThe TV personality admitted she is 'afraid' of the couple's 'complicated' journey ahead after previously stating she is likely unable to carry another baby due to severe health complications from her traumatic first birth. \n\nLouise Thompson has said the way she will grow her family is 'complicated' as she shared her fears over her 'uncertain' fertility journey on Instagram on Monday\n\nThe former Made In Chelsea star, 35, nearly died when she gave birth to her first child Leo-Hunter in 2021 after a emergency caesarean in which she lost '12 and a half litres of blood'\nDespite this, Louise explained she is 'writing from a place of hope' as she opened up in a lengthy social media post. \nSharing a sweet picture of Ryan and Leo with the caption, 'All I want for 2026... Is a baby!' written across it she penned: 'I’m about to share something incredibly personal in a totally public arena, and it feels a little unhinged, especially when our fertility future feels so uncertain.\n'I guess it could be because I shared an Instagram story a few days ago saying I would hard-launch this news on Saturday, and now it’s Monday night.\n'My hands are tied, and I’m holding myself accountable. I’m a people pleaser by nature, and I hate letting people down, but that’s not really why I’m doing this. \n'One of my New Year’s resolutions was to truly lean in to the notion that this is MY life and that I must respect it. It belongs to me and not you, nor anyone else, for that matter. \n'And so far it’s going pretty well, but I do seem to have this strange personality trait where I need regular reminding that there isn’t a big bossy teacher sat on the other end of all my work, harshly marking it. That applies to everything I do. Writing and other things. So naturally this is all pretty nerve-wracking. \n'But here is a reminder to myself: I’m 35 years old, and I work for myself. No one is judging me except for me, and I don’t TECHNICALLY HAVE to share anything. I want you to take that message into 2026, too.' \nLouise shared that she is ready to share her journey and opened up about a miscarriage she suffered in 2020 before welcoming son Leo. \n\nShe went on to suffer with PTSD and post-natal anxiety due to her near-death experience and has since been diagnosed with Lupus, Asherman's syndrome, suffered a second Hemorrhage, and has also had a stoma bag fitted\n\nHowever Louise has shared that she is hoping to 'expand her family' this year after her and partner Ryan are 'finally feeling ready' to welcome another child\n\nThe TV personality admitted she is 'afraid' of the couple's 'complicated' journey ahead after previously stating she is likely unable to carry another baby due to severe health complications\n\n Louise Thompson's fiancé Ryan Libbey says he went into 'survival mode' after her 'traumatic' birth \nShe admitted it was 'a little cowardly' to share her loss with fans after she was already 'blissfully pregnant again' but this time hopes to take fans along through the ups and downs of 'mixed emotions'. \nShe continued: 'However, today is the day that I (emphasis on I) finally feel ready to share my fertility journey… and I think that hammering all of this out on here (exactly as it pops into my head) will help me to process this whole…. Process.\n'I hope it will feel cathartic and clarifying.\n'A bit of context: When I had a miscarriage back in 2020, before I gave birth to my now 4-year-old son Leo, I waited until I was pregnant again before sharing the news of the loss. \n'I wanted reassurance that I was going to be able to get pregnant again. I wanted to post from a place of hope rather than fear.\n'In all honesty, I look back and think that was a little cowardly. I was trying to be vulnerable, I was trying to connect with people who had experienced something similar, but I was already on the other side. I was pregnant again.\n'Today I do not sit in that camp. I am not blissfully pregnant.' \nLouise also added that her partner Ryan has taken 'even longer' to come to terms with her wanting to have another child after he previous shared he was forced into 'survival mode for a year' while looking after her and their baby. \nShe continued: 'Instead, I’m writing from a place of mixed emotions. I feel afraid about the future because the way in which we are going to be able to grow our family feels a little complicated.\n'(I don’t want to manifest any further complications, so maybe I should refrain from using that word and be super duper positive. Maybe I’ll stick to the word a-typical from now on.)\n'But I am also writing from a place of hope because both Ryan and I FINALLY feel really well and truly ready to bring another child into the world. \n\nLouise shared that she is ready share her journey and opened up about a miscarriage she suffered in 2020 before welcoming son Leo\n\nShe admitted it was 'a little cowardly' to share her loss after she was already 'blissfully pregnant again' but this time hopes to take fans along through the ups and downs \n\nLouise also added that her partner Ryan has taken 'even longer' to come to terms with her wanting to have another child after he previous shared he was forced into 'survival mode for a year' while looking after her and their baby\n\n Louise Thompson reveals she wants another baby in 2026 after almost dying during traumatic birth \n'This has taken an awful lot of emotional and physical work. It feels like a BIG milestone for us and something to be celebrated. \n'Ryan has taken even longer than I have to wrap his head around this whole thing since the dreaded ‘birth trauma,’ but more on him in a separate post. X'\nLouise was placed on suicide watch due to being 'mentally checked out' following the traumatic birth of Leo. \nAnd last year her fiancé Ryan revealed heartbreaking details of her battle with postpartum depression.\nSpeaking on an episode of Giovanna Fletcher's Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast, Ryan, 34, shared: 'We even had a crisis-management team come very regularly, which - to be really honest with you - was a suicide watch because she was so mentally checked out.\n'Which is absolutely terrifying, and I don't think I've quite processed that one. I think that was something that I wanted to reframe straight away.\n'It's really, really sad to know that Louise was hurting like that and she couldn't, and I suppose I didn't really understand what was happening.'\nHe continued: 'I could understand that she was in shock and that she was completely reduced to a version of herself that was... she was just surrendering to the whole thing.\n'She'd lost the fight, and I could understand it because she would have been exhausted and her body would have been looking and feeling so different.\n'And to lie on the sofa with a vacant look on your face for days and weeks, I could understand that, but I couldn't understand that we were in the place of potential: she wants to end her life, and she doesn't really recognise or care for the baby in the room. At the time, I couldn't quite understand that.' \nIt comes after Louise was forced to spend her Christmas Eve in hospital amid her ongoing health battle and thanked the NHS for their help. \nMade In ChelseaLouise ThompsonInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLouise Thompson says the way she will grow her family is 'complicated' as she shares fears over 'uncertain' fertility journey - after revealing she feels ready for a baby after traumatic birth of son Leo\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 39\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

As co-host Brian Kilmeade introduced Patel, the FBI director appeared on screen under bright studio lights. Moments later, the lighting suddenly dimmed without warning. Patel remained composed and continued listening as Kilmeade moved into his first question. Everything was fine until a woman’s voice was heard loudly over the broadcast saying, “Guys, you cannot be adjusting his light!” The unexpected dialogue confused viewers, but Patel did not respond to the interruption.Ignoring the background noise, Patel began explaining the role of the FBI in safely moving Maduro through the city. As he spoke, Fox News cut away to B-roll footage showing a helicopter transporting the ousted Venezuelan leader.Patel went on to praise President Donald Trump’s decision to authorise the operation and commended the personnel involved.Mediaite later reported that the disruption was caused by a technical error linked to a mobile studio van being used for the live hit. According to a network source cited by Mediaite, the operator of the van had left a phone on speaker at the start of the interview. When the feed was activated, audio from the phone leaked onto the live broadcast.The problem was identified and resolved within seconds. Patel’s lighting was adjusted properly, and the interview continued smoothly for the remainder of the segment without further issues.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patels-interview-disrupted-by-on-air-lighting-adjustments-social-media-says-fox-trying-to-make-him-look-less-indian/articleshow/126363570.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-126363570/126363570.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:54:00","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.65},{"id":391538328,"title":"Rubio tasked to lead US post-operation strategy in Venezuela: White House","text":"Washington, Jan 6 (SocialNews.XYZ) US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been designated by President Donald Trump to lead implementation of Washington’s post-operation strategy in Venezuela, the White House said, outlining a whole-of-government effort that spans diplomatic, economic, financial, and military tools.\n\nStephen Miller, a close adviser to the president, told reporters at the White House on Monday that Rubio has been asked to enforce the president’s guidance and coordinate across agencies.\n\n“The President of the United States has asked Secretary Rubio … to directly enforcement of the President’s post guidance and direction to be the lead on this process,” Miller said, adding that the work involves “energy policy, Treasury policy, financial policy, military policy.”\n\nMiller said the approach reflects broad coordination inside the administration. “It’s a big team, a group of people,” he said, while downplaying his own role. “I’m just happy to serve on this incredible team on behalf of President Trump.”\n\nPressed on how Washington is effectively “running” Venezuela following the arrest of Nicolás Maduro and the swearing-in of a temporary leader, Miller pointed to US control over key pressure points. “We have an oil embargo on Venezuela,” he said. “For them to do any kind of commerce, they need our permission.”\n\nHe also cited the continued US military posture in the region. “We have our massive fleet, our Armada still present there,” Miller said. “This is an active and ongoing US government military operation.

The defence is expected to challenge the jurisdiction of the US courts by questioning the circumstances under which the Venezuelan leader was taken into custody.This is not the first instance of a defendant advancing such a claim. More than 30 years ago, Panama's former leader, Manuel Noriega, argued that the United States had breached international law and due process by invading Panama and arresting him on foreign soil, according to CNN.That defence, however, did not succeed. Courts at the time declined to examine the legality of the US invasion and instead confined their review to the charges detailed in Noriega's indictment. It remains uncertain whether the judiciary will revisit that legal precedent in Maduro's case, CNN reported.It is uncommon for a defendant to address the court during an initial appearance, as defence lawyers generally advise against speaking due to the risk that prosecutors could later use statements.As Maduro spoke in court on Monday, Judge Alvin Hellerstein issued a similar caution as the Venezuelan president spoke.\"There will be a time and a place to go into all of this,\" the judge said.Maduro's court appearance follows his capture during a military strike on Saturday. In the immediate aftermath, President Donald Trump declared that America is \"in charge.\" At the same time, acting Venezuelan president Delcy Rodriguez called for \"cooperation\" with the US, signalling a softer response to the attack, CNN reported.US officials have indicated that Washington is working to establish a pliant interim government in Venezuela.Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the focus remains on setting policy and maintaining \"leverage.\"During the same period, Trump made a series of broader remarks touching on other international issues. These included implying potential military action in Colombia, urging Mexico to get its \"act together\" on drugs, and stating that the US \"needs Greenland.\"The developments stem from a pre-dawn US operation inside Venezuela.During the operation, deposed dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were detained and transferred to a US naval vessel before being flown to New York, according to the Trump administration.US authorities have said that deposed dictator Nicolas Maduro is expected to face multiple charges. These include narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons-related offences. The operation followed months of intensified US military activity in the region.Since September, Washington has launched dozens of strikes against vessels it claims were involved in drug trafficking linked to Venezuela. These operations reportedly resulted in more than 115 deaths. This has prompted legal experts to raise concerns over potential violations of international law.US legal action against deposed dictator Nicolas Maduro dates back to President Donald Trump's first term. A superseding indictment unsealed on Saturday added fresh allegations of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine.Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media that Maduro and others \"will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts\". However, President Trump's own remarks added a broader political dimension to the case.Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, he went beyond a law enforcement justification.He stated that the United States would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" Trump also referred to reclaiming American oil interests in Venezuela.","summary":"Nicolas Maduro&#39;s wife Cilia Flores sustained critical injuries during her capture in Venezuela, her lawyer informed the US Court during the trial.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/maduro-s-wife-cilia-flores-sustains-significant-injuries-during-us-capture-claims-lawyer","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/maduro-s-wife-cilia-flores-sustains-significant-injuries-during-us-capture-claims-lawyer-1767660533032-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:48:58","author":"Asian News International","authors":["Asian News International"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":391535006,"title":"\"Deeply concerned about possible intensification, instability in country\": UN Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo on US strike in Venezuela","text":"New York [US], January 6 (ANI): Rosemary A. DiCarlo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, has expressed deep concern over the recent US military operation in Venezuela and the subsequent capture of Nicolas Maduro. Speaking on the situation following the January 3 strike by US, DiCarlo, Under-Secretary for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said at a UN security council meet, \"We meet at a grave time following the 3 January United States military action in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela... The extent of casualties resulting from these actions remains undetermined.\"She noted that President Donald Trump had announced the strike on social media on Saturday, describing it as a \"large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro.\" DiCarlo added that Trump stated, \"We are going to run the country until such time that we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"DiCarlo said the government of Venezuela has characterised the US operation as a military aggression affecting both civilian and military areas and called it a \"flagrant violation of the charter,\" posing a threat to international and regional peace and security.She highlighted that President Maduro is currently being held in New York, accused by US authorities of serious criminal offences alongside his wife, Cilia Flores. DiCarlo emphasised the uncertainty surrounding Venezuela's immediate future and warned of the risk of intensified instability.\n\n\"What is less certain is the immediate future of Venezuela. I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification and the instability in the country. The potential impact on the region and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,\" DiCarlo added. Meanwhile, during their first court appearance in New York, Venezuela's deposed dictator Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused the United States government of abducting them from their home country, CNN reported.As per CNN on Monday (local time), both Maduro and Flores denied the drug trafficking and weapons-related charges filed against them and, for now, did not contest their continued detention. The appearance marked a historic moment and the beginning of what is expected to be a prolonged legal battle, as their defence is likely to challenge the legality of their military capture.After the military operation to arrest Maduro, US President Donald Trump said, \"We're in charge.\"Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signalled that it will closely monitor developments in Venezuela under interim leadership.

You can’t have an election. There’s no way the people could even vote,” Trump said in the NBC News interview.“No, it’s going to take a period of time. We have, we have to nurse the country back to health,” Trump added.Earlier, Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida had said, “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” adding “So we don’t want to be involved with having somebody else get in, and we have the same situation that we had for the last long period of years.”Trump offered almost no details on how the US would “run” a sovereign nation when its vice president, legislature and military were still in place and publicly opposing the US move, according to a Bloomberg report.He said it would include deploying US oil companies to the country, though he indicated that his embargo “on all Venezuelan oil remains in full effect” and that US forces would stay on alert.“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump said.(This is a developing story; check later for updates)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-stephen-miller-to-oversee-venezuela-oil-reserves-maduro-vance-11767658678491.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/06/1600x900/logo/USA-VENEZUELA--75_1767658715023_1767658731662.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:46:45","author":"Mausam Jha","authors":["Mausam Jha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.458},{"id":391540102,"title":"Venezuela’s abducted leader Nicolas Maduro, wife appear in NYC court  | Barbados Gazette – Barbados &amp;","text":"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – recently abducted with his wife by US commandos from his home – has appeared in a federal courtroom in New York City for a hearing on alleged “narco-terrorism” and other charges.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were brought before US District Judge Alvin K Hellerstein at 12pm (17:00 GMT) on Monday for a brief legal proceeding that kicks off a long legal battle over whether they can face trial in the United States.\n\nHandcuffed and wearing blue jail uniforms, Maduro and his wife were led into the court by officers, and both put on headsets to hear the English-language proceeding as it was translated into Spanish.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty in the US court, telling the judge: “I was kidnapped. I am innocent and a decent man, the president of my country.”\n\nAcross the street from the courthouse, the police separated a small but growing group of protesters from about a dozen pro-intervention demonstrators, including one man who pulled a Venezuelan flag away from those protesting the US abduction.\n\nThe left-wing leader, his wife, son and three others could face life in prison if convicted of allegedly working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the country. Some observers say there is no evidence linking him to cartels.\n\nMaduro’s lawyers said they’ll contest the legality of his arrest, arguing he is immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of a foreign state, though he is not recognised as Venezuela’s legitimate leader by the US and other nations around the world.\n\nFlores also pleaded not guilty to US charges against her during the arraignment. Hellerstein ordered the Venezuelan leader to next appear in court for a hearing on March 17.\n\n‘Attacks’ against US people\n\nNear the end of the hearing, Maduro’s attorney Barry J Pollack said his client “is head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege” that the status ensures.\n\nPollack said there were “questions about the legality of his military abduction”, and there will be “voluminous” pretrial filings to address those legal challenges.\n\nEarlier, images showed the pair being led handcuffed and under heavy guard from a helicopter en route from a detention facility to the courthouse, two days after they were forcibly removed from Caracas in a brazen US special forces operation.\n\n“The United States arrested a narco-trafficker who is now going to stand trial in the United States,” US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz told an emergency UN Security Council meeting about the US attack on Venezuela on Saturday.\n\nWaltz accused Maduro of being “responsible for attacks against the people of the United States, for destabilising the Western Hemisphere, and illegitimately repressing the people of Venezuela”.\n\nSamuel Moncada, Venezuela’s ambassador to the UN, accused the US of carrying out an illegal armed attack against his country.\n\nVenezuela was subjected to bombing, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, the loss of civilian and military lives, and the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Moncada said.\n\nThe abduction of a sitting head of state breached a core norm of international law, the personal immunity of leaders in office, he added, warning that such actions set a dangerous precedent for all countries.\n\nVast oil wealth\n\nAll eyes are on Venezuela’s response to the swiftly moving events after US President Donald Trump said late on Sunday the US is “in charge” of the South American nation, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.\n\nVice President Delcy Rodriguez, meanwhile, was officially sworn in as interim president on Monday.\n\nRodriguez, a 56-year-old labour lawyer known for close connections to the private sector and her devotion to the ruling party, was sworn in by ​her brother Jorge, ‌who is the head of the National Assembly legislature.\n\nDelcy Rodriguez initially took a defiant stand against the seizure of the president in what some observers labelled a return to “US gunboat diplomacy”. But she has now offered “to collaborate” with Washington.\n\nOne analyst said Venezuela’s opposition appreciates the US intervention to remove Maduro from power, but is alarmed by Trump’s comments about US plans to “run” Venezuela, apparently with members of his government.\n\n“Trump doesn’t recognise the decision of the Venezuelan people. We are not a colony of the US. We are an independent country,” Jose Manuel Puente, a professor at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administracion, a private university in Caracas, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“We want to initiate a transition to democracy, to rebuild the institutions, to rebuild the economy, to rebuild the oil sector. And we don’t see that from Trump until now.”\n\n‘You will not succeed’\n\nVenezuela’s National Assembly opened on Monday with lawmakers chanting “Let’s go Nico!” as they denounced his abduction.\n\n“The president of the United States, Mr Trump, claims to be the prosecutor, the judge, and the policeman of the world,” senior lawmaker Fernando Soto Rojas told the assembly.\n\n“We say: you will not succeed and we will ultimately deploy all our solidarity so that our legitimate president, Nicolas Maduro, returns victorious to Miraflores,” the presidential palace, he added.\n\nRodriguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe’s part of a band of senior officials in Maduro’s administration who now appear to control Venezuela, even as Trump and other US officials say they’ll pressure the government to fall in line with their vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Sunday, some 2,000 Maduro supporters, including rifle-wielding men on motorcycles, rallied in Caracas with crowds shouting and waving Venezuelan flags. The Venezuelan military, loyal to Maduro, announced it recognised Rodriguez and urged calm.\n\nThe White House indicated on Sunday it does not want regime change, only Maduro’s removal and a pliant new government that will enable US companies to exploit the country’s vast oil reserves – even if the government is filled with his former associates.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/venezuelas-abducted-leader-nicolas-maduro-wife-appear-in-nyc-court/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05T132513Z_1997653511_RC20VIAIZF2M_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-MADURO-NEW-YORK-1767620171-nx5De5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:45:24","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":391537916,"title":"Ana Navarro Claims Trump's 'Ego' Was the Driving Force Behind Shock Capture Of Nicolás Maduro — 'He Doesn’t Give A Damn About The Venezuelan People'","text":"The View's Ana Navarro is deeply conflicted over the arrest of narco-trafficking Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, calling it an \"ego\" trip for Donald Trump but a victorious day for the people of the South American country, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nNavarro's viewpoint clashed somewhat with her panelists, including Sunny Hostin, who railed Trump's actions of sending a Delta Force team into Caracas to extract Maduro and his wife were \"completely, completely, 100 percent illegal.\"Maduro's Arrest 'Not About The Venezuelan People'\"I don't think this is at all about the Venezuelan people. Donald Trump doesn’t give a d--- about the Venezuelan people,\" Navarro claimed during the Hot Topics segment on Monday, January 5, on The View's first show of the new year. \n\n\"If he did, he wouldn’t be taking away temporary protective status from 600,000. He wouldn’t be arresting the Venezuelans who are seeking asylum here. He wouldn’t be maligning the entire community and sending hundreds of Venezuelans to a hellhole prison in El Salvador,\" she continued, referring to the infamous CECOT facility where Trump has sent some Tren de Aragua gang members deported from the U.S.'This Is A Lot About Donald Trump's Ego'\"I think this is a lot about Donald Trump's ego. I think he thought it was going to be easier to get rid of Maduro,\" Navarro raged about the president's motives.\n\nUnlike the opinion of some of her Democrat counterparts, the political strategist shared, \"I don't think this is regime change because the regime is still there. He got rid of the head. He got rid of the titular head, which is Maduro, and he gets the biggest trophy there is,\" Navarro said of Trump while noting that Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, is now the interim leader of Venezuela. \n\nNavarro also huffed \"Donald Trump gives a damn about drugs,\" referring to how the president said the top reason for going after Maduro was because he was running a narco state, pumping illegal drugs such as fentanyl and cocaine into the U.S., resulting in the deaths of thousands of Americans. \n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced on the day of Maduro's arrest that he and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and several machine gun-related counts. The dictator professed his innocence during a Monday arraignment.Maduro's Arrest 'Brought Me to Tears'Navarro became emotional when discussing what Maduro's removal, as her own family fled political turmoil in her native Nicaragua when she was a child. \n\n\"Who voted for this? The people in South Florida. The Venezuelan community, the Cuban-American community, and the Nicaraguan community voted for this,\" she asserted, referring to the various communities displaced by despotic rulers in their home countries.\n\n“For us, this is a very, very happy day. When we see a dictator who has been part of oppressing and abusing the Venezuelan people for 25 years in handcuffs and held to some sort of accountability, it brought me to tears. It brought me great joy,\" Navarro cheered.'Both Things Can Be True'Hostin, 57, pressed Navarro if she was \"okay with the way that it was done,\" referring to the U.S. extracting Maduro by force from Venezuela and bringing him to the U.S. to face charges. \n\n\"I think both things can be true,\" the CNN analyst retorted.\n\nNavarro explained, \"I think you can criticize and ask questions, and have concerns about the way it was done and what this means in the future, right? And I think you can still celebrate that this murderous, corrupt, sadistic son of a b---- is out of Venezuela.\"","summary":"Ana Navarro blasted Donald Trump for not caring about Venezuela illegal immigrants while cheering on dictator Nicolás Maduro's arrest","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/ana-navarro-trump-ego-maduro-capture-venezuela/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/-GLKKcSwr/0x0/ana-navarro-on-trump-maduro-arrest-the-view-1767656070654.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:45:00","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":391537108,"title":"Lorraine Stanley reveals she has lost seven stone from weight-loss surgery after fearing for her life","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jan 6th 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurious fallen dictator Nicolás Maduro's hearing descends into chaos as he gets into shouting match with man claiming he was prisoner of his regime\n\nMaduro erupts and tells judge he was 'kidnapped' while wife Cilia shows off head injuries in first court appearance\n\nKeir Starmer refuses to say whether Donald Trump's capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro broke international law\n\nLabour 'is failing to build enough homes to keep pace with immigration'\n\nClaire's and The Original Factory Shop are being put into administration: 2,500 jobs at risk\n\nThis is exactly what you need to do to lose half a stone in just two weeks, with or WITHOUT fat jabs, by Dr Clare Bailey Mosley\n\nI'm divorcing my husband of 15 years after the final straw this Christmas.

That's amazing!' as Matt humbly declared: 'Bit of fun isn't it?'\nHis followers flooded the post with praise for the sweet video and Diana's jubilant reaction, including several of his famous pals.\nDoctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies wrote: 'Oh that’s beautiful ♥️', while EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy and Coronation Street's Sally Dynevor both commented a string of heart-eyed emojis.\nWhile one of the Masked Singer judges, presenter Davina McCall, also took to the comments to gush: 'Love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️'.\nAfter his unmasking Matt told host Joel Dommett that it was 'very, very hot indeed' in the costume, explaining he had chosen to be a penguin because he 'likes a chocolate biscuit'.\nWhile he branded the judging panel's guesses about his identity as 'pretty poor', after Davina, Jonathan Ross, Maya Jama and Mo Gilligan incorrectly theorised it was Peter Andre, Bradley Walsh or Sir Trevor McDonald behind the mask. \n\nThe Little Britain star sneakily filmed the trio sat together on the sofa using his laptop, captioning the clip: 'My mum and stepdad were watching The Masked Singer with me tonight, blissfully unaware…'\n\nAfter his unmasking Matt told host Joel Dommett that it was 'very, very hot indeed' in the costume, explaining he had chosen to be a penguin because he 'likes a chocolate biscuit' \n\nHis followers flooded the post with praise for the sweet video and Diana's jubilant reaction, including several of his famous pals\n He impressed with his vocals earlier in the night with a rendition of The Who's Pinball Wizard with his band the Antarctic Funkies, before joining the judging panel as a guest after being unmasked.\nViewers took to X to applaud Matt for his 'amazing voice', writing: 'I'm shocked Matt Lucas was Emperor Penguin.

Where I don’t take myself too seriously. I don’t know if I ever did. I probably would have done this fifteen years ago to be fair. \n\nHe impressed with his vocals earlier in the night with a rendition of The Who's Pinball Wizard with his band the Antarctic Funkies, before joining the judging panel as a guest after being unmasked\n\nAnd it was a double unmasking after Teabag was voted out after being in the final two against Yak - and was revealed to be rapper Professor Green (seen)\n\nSaturday night's show revealed The One Show's Alex Jones as the celebrity behind the Disc Jockey costume \n'I was petrified.

'And if you arrest the president whom a good part of my people want and respect, you will unleash the popular jaguar.' \n\nHe said his government has conducted record amounts of cocaine seizures and warned the Trump administration that it would kill children if it conducts strikes against drug trafficking groups and rebels in Colombia.\n\nPetro, who was a member of a left wing guerrilla group in his youth, said he will 'return to arms' if the US government stages attacks in Colombian territory. \n\n'Although I have not been a military man, I know about war and clandestinely. I swore not to touch a weapon again since the 1989 Peace Pact, but for the Homeland I will take up arms again that I do not want,' he said in Spanish.\n\nThe Colombian leader said he recently fired Colombian intelligence officers who are feeding the U.S. administration with 'false information' on his government.\n\n'I am not illegitimate, nor am I a narco, I only have as assets my family home that I still pay for with my salary. My bank statements have been published. No one could say that I have spent more than my salary. I am not greedy,' he added.\n\nHe also promised that his country would fight back should US imperialism challenge them.\n\n'Every soldier of Colombia has an order from now on: every commander of the public force who prefers the flag of the US to the flag of Colombia must immediately withdraw from the institution by order of the bases and the troops and mine. The constitution orders the public force to defend popular sovereignty.' \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nIn September, Petro sent audacious warnings to Trump, even saying 'come get me' after the president suggested military action.\n\n'Come get me,' Petro declared in a blunt public warning aimed squarely at Washington. 'I'm waiting for you here. Don't threaten me, I'll wait for you right here if you want to.' \n\n'I don't accept invasions, missiles, or assassinations, only intel,' he said, insisting he was prepared to meet his critics head-on. \n\nHe demanded 'facts, not lies,' while lashing out at what he described as entrenched corruption at home, accusing 'Colombian political mafias who condemned us to 700,000 deaths and made us the world's most unequal country.' \n\nTrump warned Colombia could be the next country to face a military operation, while clarifying that the US was 'in charge' of Venezuela after ousting its leader Nicolás Maduro. \n\nTrump said while traveling on Air Force One Sunday that Petro was a 'sick man' who 'likes making cocaine' one day after threatening Petro to 'watch his a**.'\n\nTrump's attacks on the Colombian leader came after Petro described Washington's attack on Venezuela as an 'assault on the sovereignty' of Latin America.\n\n'Colombia is very sick, too, run by a sick man, who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he's not going to be doing it very long,' he said. \n\nWhen asked whether the US would pursue a military operation against the country, Trump bluntly replied, 'It sounds good to me.'\n\nThe heated exchange follows an explosive US operation in neighboring Venezuela that led to the capture of Maduro, 63, and his wife, Cilia Flores, 69.\n\nMaduro was hauled before a federal court in Manhattan on Monday, where scenes outside descended into chaos as protesters clashed and police were forced to intervene.\n\nIn the wake of the arrests, Trump issued a series of ominous warnings to governments across the region, including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico, demanding tougher action against drug cartels and accusing leaders of failing to stem the flow of narcotics into the US.\n\nFollowing Maduro's arrest, Trump suggested the United States 'takeover' Venezuela during a transitional period, with a sharp focus on the country's vast - but crumbling - oil reserves.\n\nHe claimed Venezuela's oil industry had been allowed to rot and said American firms would step in to rebuild it.\n\n'The oil companies are going to go in and rebuild their system,' Trump said. 'It was the greatest theft in the history of America.' \n\nTrump went on to accuse Venezuela of stealing US oil assets outright. \n\n'Nobody has ever stolen our property like they have. They took our oil away from us,' he claimed. \n\n'They took the infrastructure away and all that infrastructure is rotted and decayed, and the oil companies are going to go in and rebuild it.' \n\nThe White House has reportedly told oil companies that reconstructing Venezuela's oil rigs would be a condition of any compensation linked to previously seized assets.","summary":"Colombia's leftist president said he is willing to 'take up arms' should Donald Trump make good on his threats to come after his country next.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15435773/Colombia-president-Donald-Trump-cocaine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/06/00/105257751-0-image-a-9_1767658031529.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2026/01/05/2869702331252949954/1024x576_MP4_2869702331252949954.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:40:40","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

He has previously threatened America’s closest ally (geographically but also arguably culturally) Canada. It is often unclear if Mr Trump is joking, so outlandish are some of his ideas. But for America to run Venezuela and extract oil profits would be not just surreal but outrageous. Issues become entangled in this international crisis. The loathsome nature of the Maduro regime – both its financial criminality and its political repression – is clear. It deserves to be overthrown internally, and its European sympathisers, such as Irish republican terror apologists and Corbynite extremists, deserve contempt. But for the US to invade it is another matter entirely. So far, America has not seized territory so any parallel with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is flawed. At the same time, however, Mr Trump’s actions will embolden President Putin, who will argue that Russia too has its spheres of influence. It will embolden the Chinese, who want to seize Taiwan and destroy its position as a thriving capitalist democracy with a free press, as it has done in Hong Kong – in a few years. Taiwan is relatively small in global terms yet its destruction by the communist autocrats would be a catastrophe for the world, the triumph of values that are the antithesis of western enlightened principles. Mr Trump seizing Greenland would also be a disaster, and fuel a possible Argentinian second seizure of the Falklands. Mr Trump is a remarkable figure who has single handedly overturned liberal idiocy on immigration and has forced Europe to pay for its defence. But he is a highly unreliable ally. It is friends of America above all who need to challenge his worst excesses.","summary":"News Letter editorial on Tuesday January 6 2026:","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/editorial-it-is-friends-of-america-who-can-and-should-call-out-donald-trumps-excesses-5464070","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmFmODliYzdhLWQ0ODEtNGE1OS05NzE0LWI1MjczZWZjYTA1Mzo5OTYzNGRhOC1kOTc3LTQ5YzMtOWQwNS1iZDE4OGFlYTE3MWI=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:40:13","author":"Editorial","authors":["Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.206},{"id":391533390,"title":"Sunny Hostin says Maduro's arrest was an act of 'piracy' and 'imperialism' — but Ana Navarro says it made her cry with joy","text":"The hosts of \"The View\" offered a wide spectrum of responses to the arrest of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces.\n\nMaduro was captured at his home in Caracas and flown out of the country alongside his wife in a daring mission on Saturday evening.

It&#8217;s time for her to return to Venezuela.","text":"Here’s a critical question being asked not just in Venezuela: Where is Maria Corina Machado?\n\nIt isn’t every day, of course, that the ousted leader of a sovereign nation appears in a New York court — nor that U.S. forces swoop into another country to bring a dictator to justice.\n\nNo one has more questions about what will happen next than the 70% of Venezuelans who voted for Edmundo Gonzalez in the July 2024 presidential election and by extension, Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her indefatigable fight for Venezuelan democracy. \n\nVenezuelans with whom I have spoken are understandably thankful to have the scourge of Nicolás Maduro removed but are perplexed about what it means for them. \n\nI’ve known Maria Corina for years. A former lawmaker, she has been an outspoken proponent of restoring democracy to Venezuela since the 1990s. She often drew the ire of Hugo Chavez and later, after Chavez’s death, of Maduro. After she won a 2023 opposition primary with more than 90% of the vote, Maduro’s regime blocked Machado from running for president. She first chose Corina Yoris, a respected civil society figure, to run in her place. Yoris, too, was blocked. So Machado supported Gonzalez, then a little-known former diplomat, to run in her place, and he shocked the regime by winning a stacked election. \n\nVenezuelans with whom I have spoken are understandably thankful to have the scourge of Nicolás Maduro removed but are perplexed about what the surprise U.S. action taken Saturday means for them. Would they be putting themselves in harm’s way if they take to the streets to celebrate the downfall of a dictator, many wonder? Diosdado Cabello, the Maduro regime’s interior minister, remains in office, and he has threatened to unleash his motorcycle thugs, the colectivos, to attack anyone who celebrates Maduro’s ouster.\n\nA demonstrator bangs on a cooking pan in front of police officers during a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government in Caracas on July 29, 2024.\n\nIf the United States is now running Venezuela, as President Donald Trump has asserted, it should allow her a tranquil return to the country. For one thing, this would clarify whether the U.S. has effectively taken over or if Venezuela is still under the control of Maduro’s dictatorship. So would the release of those wrongfully detained by the Maduro regime. \n\nAccording to the nongovernmental organization Foro Penal, there are more than 900 political prisoners in Venezuela that include democracy activists and military officers. Political activists such as Freddy Superlano (winner of the governor’s office in Barinas in 2021 but barred from assuming office), civil society leader Rocio San Miguel (an expert on civil-military relations) and my friend Juan Pablo Guanipa are in jail because they dared to think differently than the Maduro dictatorship. There are too many to name them all here, but now that Maduro is gone, why shouldn’t all political prisoners find their way home? \n\nFor a clear indicator of how things are going, look no further than the notorious intelligence service center, El Helicoide. The quandary before Acting President Delcy Rodríguez is how to mollify the U.S. while not incurring the wrath of Cabello. Trump initially on Saturday spoke warmly of Rodríguez but by Sunday evening had threatened to depose her, too. Cabello, for his part, dislikes both Rodriguez and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, president of the National Assembly and the official responsible for the intelligence services that sow fear across the country.\n\nIn his press conference Saturday, Trump dismissed Machado, saying she does not have the respect of the people to lead. Actually, the return of the opposition leadership matters. \n\nMachado’s return would ignite the passions of Venezuelans thirsting for democracy.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the U.S. took the rare step of not recognizing a government. In early 2019, the U.S. supported Juan Guaidó, a 35-year-old National Assembly speaker, as the country’s legitimate president. The Maduro regime told Guaidó that he could not depart Venezuela. He nonetheless traveled to the U.S., where he attended the State of the Union address in 2019. His public return to Venezuela, on a commercial flight, tested the nerve of the Maduro regime and simultaneously rallied the hopes of ordinary Venezuelans. I and many other international diplomats went to the airport to receive him. What we witnessed was the return of a national hero. His action kept the flame of liberty alight even as the Maduro regime sought to snuff out dissent.\n\nSimilarly, Machado’s return would ignite the passions of Venezuelans thirsting for democracy. It would show the world, particularly the Trump administration, that she has the support of the people and that Venezuela is ready for real change, not the window dressing of exchanging one dictator for another. Under the status quo, and the long history of oil assets being expropriated in Venezuela, it’s hard to imagine U.S. or other oil executives would feel comfortable making the massive investments necessary to increase Venezuelan oil production and rebuild the country.\n\nPolitics is a contact sport in a settled democracy like the U.S. Building a democracy in the wake of an authoritarian regime is even more intense. It requires enormous courage and sacrifice. Few have fought as hard for democracy in Venezuela than Maria Corina Machado. Her place in her country’s pantheon of national heroes is assured. If she is going to be Venezuela’s next president, she needs to be seen. Without her leadership, the democratic opposition might fracture. But with it, the true potential of Venezuela could be unleashed.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/venezuela-maria-corina-machado-trump-maduro-democracy","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767652372/260105-maria-corina-machado-pi/260105-maria-corina-machado-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:38:21","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":391540318,"title":"Trump quadrupling up on aspirin is a metaphor for his presidency","text":"I didn’t really expect much from 2026, but it’s still discouraging that it’s only the first week of January, and I am feeling compelled to say that you shouldn’t quadruple the recommended dose of a medication. \n\nIn a Wall Street Journal interview published Jan. 1, President Donald Trump’s physician confirmed that Trump is taking a full dose of aspirin, 325 mg daily, for “cardiac prevention.” Trump told the newspaper, “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart. I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?\"\n\n I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart. I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart.President Donald Trump\n\nAspirin doesn’t thin the blood — it is a platelet inhibitor that keeps clots from forming and blocking blood vessels. And a low-dose aspirin, — that is 81 mg — is recommended for some people to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. But Trump is taking four times that amount. “They’d rather have me take the smaller one,” he said. “I take the larger one, but I’ve done it for years, and what it does do is it causes bruising.”\n\nFor people’s Trump age, the harms of even a low-dose aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding, generally outweigh the benefits. So its routine use is generally not recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) or the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\nThere might be individual situations, including high risk for cardiovascular disease, that cause a physician to recommend 81 mg of aspirin daily to someone who’s almost 80. This may be the situation for Trump. In 2018, White House physician Ronny Jackson reported the president had high cholesterol and a high coronary artery calcium score, which indicates atherosclerosis. In these circumstances, the decision to start a medication with a non-zero risk for harm involves a discussion with a health care provider — and one’s own preferences.\n\nTrump’s decision is different yet, in that, contrary to what he says his medical team has recommended, he is taking four times the preventive dose of aspirin, even though the ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize that while the risk of bleeding goes up with dose increase, the benefits of low dose and high dose aspirin are similar. In other words, a high dose of aspirin adds a negative with no counterbalancing positive.\n\nWhen calculating risk of harm, the 81 mg to 325 mg aspirin dose difference is clinically meaningful. In my trauma center, for example, when we see a patient with an intracranial hemorrhage after a fall, we typically decide that those on low-dose aspirin are safe to go home after a brief period of observation. For those on a full dose of aspirin, we require a neurosurgical evaluation and admission to the intensive care unit due to high risk for poor outcomes.\n\nEveryone should make the medical decisions they feel are best for them, in consultation with their doctors and after considering the risks and benefits. One only hopes the decisions people make fall within safe and reasonable parameters.\n\nWhen calculating risk of harm, the 81 mg to 325 mg aspirin dose difference is clinically meaningful.\n\nBut it isn’t just about the aspirin. It’s really what’s reflected in the pulsing bravado of Trump blowing off professional advice, even that of his handpicked medical team, and the messaging that no authority or expertise needs to be taken seriously.\n\nTrump casually dismissing national evidence-based recommendations from his doctors hits a deeper nerve in the context of his administration’s attack on the preventive services task force mentioned above. \n\nUSPSTF’s recommendations support up-to-date, evidence-based health care across the nation, influencing practice decisions and insurance-covered services for millions of Americans each year. But their integrity is under grave threat, both because of large cuts to the scientific processes that fuel their development, and because of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s interest in replacing its panel of experts. Kennedy Jr. has already replaced the members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices to disastrous effect.\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/erictopol.bsky.social/post/3mbmfwzpb322a\n\nTrump’s illogical quadruple dose of aspirin and his scorn for the standards and processes that advise against it connect in a straight line to the structural changes he’s inflicted on scientific and public health functions vital to this nation. The very oxygen has been taken out of our federal scientific research enterprise; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is so compromised in its functions that individual states and organizations have taken up the responsibility of maintaining evidence-based guidance around topics such as immunizing children against dangerous diseases. We’ve lost dozens of public health services and resources around the country, not to mention our withdrawal from global public health efforts, which affect the health and safety of our own country.\n\nIt’s a topsy-turvy world. We are in the middle of the largest measles outbreak in 30 years. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician running for the Senate from South Carolina, which has reported 188 measles cases since July, is aptly running on the slogan, “It’s me or the measles.” Meanwhile, Kennedy is recommending cod liver oil over vaccines. \n\nI can say with confidence it’s going to be a long, long year for public health.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-aspirin-dose-health-bruising-325-mg","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767655980/260105-trump-hand-asprin-pi/260105-trump-hand-asprin-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:37:52","author":"Ja’han Jones","authors":["Ja’han Jones"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":391539288,"title":"Presiden Colombia sedia 'angkat senjata' berdepan ancaman Donald Trump","text":"Ein Fahrer verrät: 1 simpler Trick schützt dich vor teuren Blitzer-Strafen!Nachrichten Auto | SponsoredSponsoredUndoDiese Kamera schlägt jedes Jahr Tausende von Einbrechern in die FluchtInnovative Smart-Kamera | SponsoredSponsoredUndoNeuropathie kommt nicht von zu wenig Vitamin B.

But insiders say explosive data that Kristi Noem is desperate to hide tells the REAL story...","text":"Donald Trump roared back into the White House promising to deport one million illegal immigrants as part of the 'largest deportation operation in the history of the country.' \n\nNearly a year later, he's not even close.\n\nKristi Noemi's Department of Homeland Security has bragged its removed more than 2.5 million migrants in less than a year into Trump's second term. \n\n'600k illegals have been deported from the interior of our country in less than 365 days, with another 1.9 million self-deporting, totaling over 2.5 million illegals gone. A monumental achievement!' wrote the official X account for DHS in a December post.\n\nBut the Daily Mail has learned from an ICE insider familiar with the matter that the true number of deportations since Trump's inauguration in January of 2025 is closer to 467,000 – more than 100,000 fewer deportations than the total publicly claimed by DHS.\n\nThe latest figure accounts for deportations carried out by ICE officers but does include some made by US Customs and Border Protection, according to an agency source familiar with how ICE tracks its monthly deportations. \n\nMoreover, the vast majority of the administration's deportation tally is reliant on the claim that nearly two million illegal migrants have self-deported from the country.\n\nBut those figures are unreliable and overblown, according to experts.\n\nDHS is measuring self-deportations with survey data and polling estimates rather than individually recorded deportations, a method that produces misleading conclusions. \n\nThe reality is that the actual number of self-deportations is far lower than the administration has touted. \n\n'It's very unlikely that that many people have self-deported or voluntarily left,' Dr Tara Watson, an immigration expert at the Brookings Institution, told the Daily Mail. 'I would put the number in the low hundreds of thousands, and the data source that I believe the administration is using for that is completely inappropriate.'\n\nWatson also noted that if the administration's claim that nearly two million undocumented migrants have self-deported were true, it would be reflected in clear economic signals, including a substantial jump in unemployment. When Trump entered office last year, the unemployment was approximately four percent but rose but has only climbed to 4.6 percent by November. \n\nExperts explained that Homeland Security is using unreliable data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) - a monthly survey of approximately 60,000 households, conducted jointly by the US Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)- to measure changes in US foreign-born population to justify their inflated self-deportation numbers.\n\n'The CPS surveys just 60,000 of the 128 million households in the U.S. each month. As a result, its estimates bounce around quite a bit from month to month,' said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nNoem's reliance on the survey is also complicated by the possibility that fewer illegal and legal migrants may be responding to CPS out of fear their data will be shared to ICE.\n\nTax, health and other data stored by other federal agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have been handed over to ICE since the start of this administration.\n\n'Lower response rates among immigrants would result in a falsely low estimate of the immigrant population in the CPS,' Mittelstadt told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe department has also not provided regular or comprehensive data on arrests and deportations across all DHS agencies, including Border Patrol and ICE.\n\n'What it has provided would require believing that the vast majority of these individuals left the country under their own steam - aka \"self deported.\" And there is no evidence for that,' added Mittelstadt. \n\nA DHS spokeswoman declined to provide more detailed numbers when pressed by the Daily Mail.\n\nIndeed, experts warn that self-deportations are difficult to verify, since there is no reliable system to track whether migrants who leave the country later slip back in.\n\nCurrent Population Survey findings do indicate that the immigrant population is declining in the country, but not to the extent claimed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe sudden push by Homeland Security to rewrite its one-year accomplishments comes as rumors swirl that the White House has grown frustrated with Noem's inability to deliver on the president's promise of mass deportations.\n\nTrump's loyal Border Czar Tom Homan admitted during a May interview that monthly deportations were falling behind Biden-era deportations, explaining that Biden officials used a different calculation method. \n\nIt is often easier to deport migrants detained at the border than to locate and arrest them inside the country, but the latter is what Trump promised supporters repeatedly on the campaign trail. \n\nMultiple media outlets have reported that Trump's deporter-in-chief Stephen Miller and other top White House officials are angered by Noem's inability to construct new detention facilities despite receiving billions of new funding from the Big Beautiful Bill passed over the summer.\n\nAccording to reporting in June, Miller expressed disappointment to senior ICE leadership about the deportation numbers and demanded they increase their apprehension of undocumented migrants to 3,000 each day. \n\nHowever, it remains unclear what the current average number of apprehensions is, as DHS has not consistently released its monthly immigration enforcement data, unlike prior administrations. \n\nA November 2024 report from the Heritage Foundation, one of the nation's largest conservative think tanks, found that the administration's claim it is on track to deport 600,000 people in its first year is not supported by underlying data and shows the government is 'substantially off pace' to reach Eisenhower-era removal levels.\n\n'The Trump Administration has not released monthly data on immigration enforcement since President Trump took office,' wrote Heritage fellow Mike Howell.\n\n'Without access to the data, it is impossible to ascertain how the DHS is supporting its varying claims of deportation and self-deportation numbers,' Howell added.\n\nFrustration and tension has also grown between Homan and Noem top aide, and rumored lover, Corey Lewandowski.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported in December that Lewandowski went on a months-long effort to pressure ICE officials to grant him a federally issued gun and badge even going so far as to make it a litmus test during an interview for a top contender to take over as the agency's director, according to multiple department sources.\n\nLewandowski denied the accusations and instead accused Homan of leaking the information to the Daily Mail.\n\nNow as the administration has failed to deliver on Trump's promise of one million deportations, rumors are swirling that the White House is looking to replace Noem sometime at the start of the new year.\n\nA December report from the Bulwark, citing former DHS officials, claimed Noem's departure from DHS is imminent and potential replacements include former Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin.\n\nAs speculation has grown, Trump and the White House has repeatedly denied those reports that Noem is in danger of losing her job.","summary":"The Daily Mail has learned from an ICE insider familiar with the matter that the true number of deportations is far lower than publicly claimed by Homeland Security.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15427705/trump-migrants-real-numbers-deported-kristi-noem.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/05/23/105258273-0-image-m-20_1767655678930.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:33:38","author":"Editor,Phillip Nieto","authors":["Editor","Phillip Nieto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":391540380,"title":"Letters: Venezuela incursion is Donald Trump’s latest smokescreen","text":"Venezuela incursion is\nTrump smokescreen\n\nRe: “Trump says U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela after swift strike” (Page A1, Jan. 4).\n\nDoes the president really think we are falling for his smokescreen outrage over drugs coming to the U.S. from Venezuela? The people of Venezuela are not forcing Americans to buy illegal drugs from them. Stupid Americans are buying dangerous illegal drugs from a lot of sources. The U.S. has open borders, and drugs flow in from many places.\n\nThis “war” the president has started is about oil. Full stop. We all know it. Venezuela has the type of oil America needs. All the killing and pretend outrage about drugs is really about getting their oil.\n\nFor this, we are bombing boats and killing people illegally. The whole world hates us for this president’s cruel cuts that have killed hundreds of thousands already. This just adds more fuel to that fire.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nTrump’s actions turn\nthe world against us\n\nRe: “Trump says U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela after swift strike” (Page A1, Jan. 4).\n\nWith the U.S. military strikes and capture of President Maduro on Saturday, President Trump and his administration continue their assault on the U.S. Constitution and reinforce their belief that laws, as well as checks and balances, no longer apply.\n\nThis is not about drugs. Trump has recently pardoned some of the largest drug importers in U.S. history. This is about oil and the “taking back what is ours,” per Trump. The U.S. has invaded a sovereign nation and seized control of its oil infrastructure. The GOP-controlled Congress has abdicated more power, the power only they have to declare war, to Trump.\n\nAmerica First? A cute slogan only. We are looking and behaving more like America The Despicable and Russia every day.\n\nBarry Brynjulson\n\nGOP sabotages ACA\nthen complains about it\n\nRe: “Failed Obamacare faces a reckoning” (Page A8, Jan. 4).\n\nThe disingenuousness of Republican attacks on the ACA is breathtaking. It’s the Republicans who have insisted on insurance-based health care throughout history. In fact, the ACA is really a Republican-hatched plan originating in Massachusetts by Mitt Romney. Because of Republican opposition to any non-insurance-based plan, the ACA was the only politically viable plan in 2010 and may still be the only federal plan politically viable today. No? OK, just where is the Republican plan? Nothing for all of Donald Trump’s two terms in office.\n\nHere is the Republican health care “plan“: Offer no meaningful health care plan while fighting tooth and nail to tear down any existing plan we do have. Then complain about the effectiveness of plans they make worse.\n\nWant to cut insurance companies from our health care? It’s called Medicare For All. Don’t like that? Then propose something else, or stop voting for Republicans.\n\nSteve Reynolds\n\nGOP can gripe about\nACA after offering plan\n\nRe: “Failed Obamacare faces a reckoning” (Page A8, Jan. 4).\n\nConservative commentators like John Rego rant about the horrors of Barack Obama and Obamacare, using incorrect and incomplete data. Let’s correct the record.\n\nBetween 2010, when Obamacare was enacted, and 2025, the average rate of U.S. inflation for all goods and services was 2.6% per year. The U.S. health care inflation rate during that time was a little over 2.7% a year. In other words, health care inflation was essentially equal to general inflation. Furthermore, health care inflation before Obamacare from 1970-2010, increased more than 6% a year versus almost 4.5% for overall inflation. Conclusion: Obamacare greatly reduced health care inflation.\n\nAn essential point is that congressional Republicans have not offered a health care program that curbs expenses and covers economically challenged Americans. Legislation backed by Donald Trump and passed by Republicans will lead to over 10 million Americans losing health care access, while premiums increase dramatically for all others.\n\nWhen Republicans introduce viable health care legislation, conservatives will gain the right to complain about the shortcomings of the ACA.\n\nEnding lives should be\noption for the elderly\n\nRe: “Remembering Papa: Rural elderly face a gun suicide epidemic” (Page B1, Jan. 4).\n\nThe article about elders committing suicide called it an epidemic. I disagree. As an elder, I call it a choice. My friends and I are getting older. Two died in November — one by refusing food, which required taking days to die. When visiting peers who end up in care homes, my friends and I see the poor condition of other residents and don’t want the same for ourselves.\n\nWe believe there is a difference between living and existing. Once we are unable to live our lives, those who want to should have the option to end their life quickly.\n\nThe article states: “Experts say these deaths may get little attention because society empathizes with struggling older adults who want to control how their lives end.” Elder suicide does not need to be “fixed”; it needs to be allowed.\n\nSusan O’Sullivan","summary":"Also: Trump's actions &#124; Sabotaging ACA &#124; Offer a plan &#124; Option for elderly.

The appearance marked a historic moment and the beginning of what is expected to be a prolonged legal battle, as their defence is likely to challenge the legality of their military capture.After the military operation to arrest Maduro, US President Donald Trump said, “We’re in charge.”Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signalled that it will closely monitor developments in Venezuela under interim leadership. However, Maduro’s long-time vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, was sworn in as acting president on Monday, according to CNN.When asked to confirm his identity, Maduro stood up and spoke in Spanish, with his remarks translated into English in court.He told the court that he “was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela,” and, as Judge Alvin Hellerstein attempted to interrupt him, added, “I am still president of my country.”Responding to the charges for a second time, Maduro said, “I am innocent. I am not guilty of anything that is mentioned here. I am a decent man.”As per CNN, it remains unclear how much of his statement was translated aloud in the courtroom. Judge Hellerstein said Maduro would be given an opportunity at a later stage to speak in detail about his arrest and the allegations against him.Maduro’s lawyer confirmed that a not guilty plea had been entered on all four charges. Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores also pleaded not guilty, telling the judge in Spanish, “Not guilty, completely innocent.”When asked to verify her identity, she said through an interpreter, “I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.”She appeared in court with visible bandages on her forehead and right temple and required assistance to take her seat at the defence table. Her lawyer said she would need a medical evaluation and possible treatment for “significant injuries” sustained during what he described as her “abduction.”Attorney Mark Donnelly said Flores may have suffered a fracture or, at a minimum, severe bruising to her ribs.Maduro’s lawyer, Barry Pollack, also told the court that the Venezuelan leader has “some health and medical issues that will require attention,” without providing further details.Pollack said he intends to file multiple motions challenging both the indictment and Maduro’s arrest, which he described as a “military abduction” carried out by US operatives early Saturday morning, CNN reported.He also argued that Maduro holds privileges and immunity linked to his position as the leader of a sovereign nation.As per CNN, both Maduro and Flores requested a “visit” with representatives of the Venezuelan consulate. Under US law, detained foreign nationals are entitled to consular access, though it remains unclear how that request will be handled.Their lawyers did not seek immediate release during Monday’s hearing but indicated that a formal bail application would be submitted at a later stage.The next hearing in the case has been scheduled for March 17, CNN reported.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2026/01/maduro-wife-accuse-us-of-abduction-pleads-not-guilty-at-first-us-court-hearing/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI-20260106002327.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:30:07","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.5},{"id":391534900,"title":"Trump shocks when asked who is 'top person' in charge after Venezuelan strongman ousted","text":"President Donald Trump made a stunning claim Monday evening about who's in charge in Venezuela after he ordered Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro to be captured in a pre‑dawn U.S. special operations raid on Caracas.\n\nMaduro was taken into custody on Saturday and flown to New York to face narco‑terrorism and related drug charges.

Instead, those shots are advised for certain high-risk groups or through “shared clinical decision making” by families and doctors.\n\nFederal officials said the overhaul to the vaccine schedule won’t result in families losing access or insurance coverage for vaccines, but multiple professional medical organizations objected, saying fewer children would get shots resulting in more illness and deaths.\n\nThe change came after President Donald Trump in December asked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising its guidance to align with theirs.\n\nHHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.\n\n“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement Monday.\n\nPhysician groups disagreed.\n\n“Today’s announcement by federal health officials to arbitrarily stop recommending numerous routine childhood immunizations is dangerous and unnecessary,” the Itasca-based American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement.\n\n“The longstanding, evidence-based approach that has guided the U.S. immunization review and recommendation process remains the best way to keep children healthy and protect against health complications and hospitalizations.”\n\nThe American Medical Association said it was “deeply concerned.” “Vaccination policy has long been guided by a rigorous, transparent scientific process,” said Dr. Sandra Adamson Fryhofer, an AMA trustee.\n\n“Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision.”\n\nFlu hospitalizations up \n\nStatewide, hospitalizations for flu nearly doubled last month, increasing from 2.3% of all admissions the week ending Dec. 20 to 5.2% the week ending Dec. 27, the IDPH reported.\n\nThe majority of patients are under age 18. Just under 22% of Illinoisans have received flu shots this year.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health reported the first death of a child from flu this season on Monday. Twelve children died in the 2024/2025 period.\n\nCook County Department of Public Health said hospital admissions associated with flu and COVID-19 are “dramatically increasing.”\n\n· Daily Herald wire services contributed to this report.","summary":"Health experts and medical organizations have criticized the move, warning that it could lead to fewer children getting vaccinated and an increase in illnesses and deaths.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20260105/news/amid-illinois-flu-surge-u-s-drops-key-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=6E4DF661-78B7-40FA-A8A2-3A86C06CAC60&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-06 00:27:19","author":"Marni Pyke","authors":["Marni Pyke"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.034},{"id":391539396,"title":"School Assembly News Headlines Today (Jan 6): Check Out Top National, International & Sports Updates","text":"If you’re a student on the lookout for news headlines to read out in your school assembly, you’re at the right place!

The appearance marked a historic moment and the beginning of what is expected to be a prolonged legal battle, as their defence is likely to challenge the legality of their military capture.After the military operation to arrest Maduro, US President Donald Trump said, \"We're in charge.\"Meanwhile, the Trump administration has signalled that it will closely monitor developments in Venezuela under interim leadership. However, Maduro's long-time vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, was sworn in as acting president on Monday, according to CNN.When asked to confirm his identity, Maduro stood up and spoke in Spanish, with his remarks translated into English in court.He told the court that he \"was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela,\" and, as Judge Alvin Hellerstein attempted to interrupt him, added, \"I am still president of my country.\"Responding to the charges for a second time, Maduro said, \"I am innocent. I am not guilty of anything that is mentioned here. I am a decent man.\"As per CNN, it remains unclear how much of his statement was translated aloud in the courtroom. Judge Hellerstein said Maduro would be given an opportunity at a later stage to speak in detail about his arrest and the allegations against him.Maduro's lawyer confirmed that a not guilty plea had been entered on all four charges. Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores also pleaded not guilty, telling the judge in Spanish, \"Not guilty, completely innocent.\"When asked to verify her identity, she said through an interpreter, \"I am first lady of the Republic of Venezuela.\"She appeared in court with visible bandages on her forehead and right temple and required assistance to take her seat at the defence table. Her lawyer said she would need a medical evaluation and possible treatment for \"significant injuries\" sustained during what he described as her \"abduction.\"Attorney Mark Donnelly said Flores may have suffered a fracture or, at a minimum, severe bruising to her ribs.Maduro's lawyer, Barry Pollack, also told the court that the Venezuelan leader has \"some health and medical issues that will require attention,\" without providing further details.Pollack said he intends to file multiple motions challenging both the indictment and Maduro's arrest, which he described as a \"military abduction\" carried out by US operatives early Saturday morning, CNN reported.He also argued that Maduro holds privileges and immunity linked to his position as the leader of a sovereign nation.As per CNN, both Maduro and Flores requested a \"visit\" with representatives of the Venezuelan consulate. Under US law, detained foreign nationals are entitled to consular access, though it remains unclear how that request will be handled.Their lawyers did not seek immediate release during Monday's hearing but indicated that a formal bail application would be submitted at a later stage.The next hearing in the case has been scheduled for March 17, CNN reported.
