This included some critical minerals and metals.\"\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government shared details of its border plan with the premiers, who offered to contribute provincial resources to the effort.\n\n\"We're going to incorporate many of the positive suggestions that the premiers made into finalizing our border plan,\" he said. \"And then obviously a priority will be to share details of this plan with the incoming Trump administration and with Canadians in the coming days.\"\n\nFord said the premiers are on board with the plan to deal with Trump's concerns about the border, but it needs a bit of \"polish.\" \n\nThe premiers also asked for more \"boots on the ground\" at the border, including increasing the number of officers with the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP, which Trudeau agreed to do.\n\nYukon Premier Ranj Pillai said in an interview he was \"personally was very impressed by what Canada put on the table in a response to border security and the illicit trade of fentanyl.\"\n\nThe first ministers' meeting came a day after Trump launched more jibes at Trudeau on social media, calling him governor of \"the great state of Canada\" — a nod to his ribbing that he might just have Canada join the U.S. as its 51st state.\n\nAhead of the meeting, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said some conservative premiers have been giving off \"very mixed messages,\" and now is the time to send signals of unity and a show of strength.\n\n\"What we need to do is acknowledge Trump is a bully. Bullies look for weakness. That's why he's trolling us,\" Singh said, demanding a clear plan of action.\n\nLawmakers are days away from starting an extended winter holiday break, but when MPs return to Parliament in January, it will be after the presidential inauguration — making Trump's social media taunts and threats all the more serious.\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller said in the face of that, the government needs to strike the right tone.\n\n\"This is the first inning. Yeah, sure, there's some goofy stuff going on, there's some shenanigans, but we have to be serious about this. Canadians expect their government to be serious about the border, about making sure Canadians are safe and secure,\" he said on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We can't be arguing against ourselves and at cross purposes, I think that's really important,\" he added. \"Because anything the U.S. does impacts Canada so severely, this isn't the time for partisanship.\" \n\nCanada has vowed to beef up border security in the face of Trump's threats, despite a lack of evidence for his claims about illicit fentanyl pouring into the U.S. from Canada.\n\nSingh accused Trudeau of so far only acquiescing to Trump's demands.\n\nBut Liberal MP Sean Casey said it's not a problem if it appears Canada is bending to Trump's pressure.\n\n\"Whether it looks like we're caving to his demands is completely irrelevant,\" he said as he headed into the caucus meeting. \"If his demands are aligned with the best interest of Canada, the perception of the relationship doesn't matter.\"\n\nWednesday's high-level meeting also comes days before Ford hosts the fall premiers' meeting in Mississauga, which lasts Sunday through Monday.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 11, 2024.\n\n-- With files from Nick Murray and Liam Casey in Toronto\n\nAnja Karadeglija and Kyle Duggan, The Canadian Press","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/canada-preparing-retaliatory-tariffs-as-ford-threatens-to-cut-off-energy-to-us-9938002","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/12/0a38ab8a05c2d7be1b56d80c9e17d439f9ac5faf5b330b987b9640905fb189db.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 01:08:03","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":272438868,"title":"FBI Director Chris Wray to step down before Trump takes office","text":"Washington, DC [US], December 12 (ANI): FBI Director Christopher A Wray announced on Wednesday that he will resign before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, despite having three years remaining on his 10-year term, CNN reported.Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony is scheduled to take place on January 20, 2025, at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.Wray made his announcement at a town hall in FBI headquarters in Washington, DC.\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission -- the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day,\" Wray said.\"In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,\" he added.The decision comes after Trump expressed his intention to replace Wray with Kash Patel.Wray's tenure as FBI director has been marked by significant investigations into Trump, including the search of the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 for classified documents.Trump responded to Wray's announcement by calling it \"a great day for America.\"In a Truth Social post, Trump said Wray's resignation \"is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don't know what happened to him. We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans.\"Patel also responded to Wray's announcement and stated, \"I look forward to a smooth transition. I will be ready to serve the American people on day one.\"According to CNN, Wray had wrestled with whether or not to resign given Trump's stated desire to replace him, sources say, and wants to facilitate an orderly transition. But some in the FBI worried his departure would normalise Trump's penchant for replacing FBI directors he doesn't like, as the position is supposed to straddle administrations and be insulated from politics.Wray was appointed as FBI director in 2017 after Trump fired James Comey, who had overseen investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 US elections. Wray took office following Comey's dismissal, whose FBI also investigated Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, left the bureau in May 2017.Trump, in particular, was unhappy with the FBI's court-approved search of his Mar-a-Lago resort in August 2022 during the investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified documents.\"He invaded my home,\" Trump said. \"He invaded Mar-a-Lago.\" (ANI)","url":"https://aninews.in/news/world/us/fbi-director-chris-wray-to-step-down-before-trump-takes-office20241212062714","image":"https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20241212005704.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 01:05:02","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":272438772,"title":"The peace Ukrainians deserve, by Ikechukwu Amaechi","text":"On December 6, Ukrainians commemorated the Armed Forces Day. It is an occasion used annually in honouring their “brave defenders who protect their homeland from Russian aggression.” I happened to be at the Ukrainian embassy that Friday where the Ambassador of Ukraine to Nigeria, Ivan Kholostenko, said the heroes being honoured “safeguard not only Ukraine but also the broader world.”\n\n“On this day, we express our deepest gratitude to all those who defend the freedom and future of our country, ensuring peace and security for millions around the globe. The Embassy of Ukraine in Nigeria commemorates the heroes with an exhibition. Faces of men and women who risk everything for their homeland and peace around the globe are looking from the pictures of the exhibition,” Kholostenko said.\n\nThe most important element of the composition of the exhibition is the blue-yellow Ukrainian flag, which he said “bears the imprint of heroism and love for the motherland – the signatures of the heroes, soldiers of the 4th Battalion of the Slovozhansk Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, who defended Kharkiv from invaders.”\n\nThe national pride was palpable as he spoke. “The battle for Kharkiv became an example of heroism and self-sacrifice, when Ukrainian soldiers rebuffed the superior forces of aggressor, preventing them from turning the city into a monument of repression and cruelty. The flag has travelled all the way to Nigeria to serve as a symbol of courage and love for the motherland.”\n\nOf course, Ambassador Kholostenko was talking about the Russia-Ukraine war which is almost in its third year now. He blamed Russia for the aggression and for deploying hunger as a component of its war strategy.\n\n“By unleashing an unprovoked and brutal war against Ukraine, Russia is using hunger as a way to put pressure on the world. The courage of the Ukrainian defenders allows Ukraine to fulfill its role as a guarantor of global food security and produce grain. This grain is delivered to the countries of Africa and Asia, which have felt the consequences of Russia’s aggression the most.”\n\nIt is a testament to how much the world has fractured since the United Nations, UN, came into existence on October 24, 1945 that bloody conflicts such as the war the Ukrainian envoy was bemoaning still remain a global spectacle. On that historic day 79 years ago, four years of painstaking planning morphed into an international organisation designed to promote global peace, justice and better living for all humanity.\n\nThe negotiations were particularly conscientious in the U.S. where President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, FDR, convinced Americans that an international organisation was the best means to prevent future wars and the U.S. Senate approved the UN Charter by a vote of 89 to 2. On June 26, 1945, 50 countries signed the Charter in San Francisco. Poland signed on October 15, 1945, becoming one of the original 51 member states.\n\nThe overarching goal of the new organisation, which rose from the ashes of the League of Nations, was to reduce international tension, promote human rights, lower the chance of other large-scale conflicts, promote peace, justice, and better living for all mankind.\n\nFrustratingly, almost eight decades thence, and 193 member states to boot, the world is teetering on the brink of another large-scale conflict with the debilitating invasion of Ukraine by Russia and Israel’s genocidal onslaught on Palestinians.\n\nFortuitously, just as all eyes were on President Roosevelt eight decades ago, all eyes are on U.S. President-elect, Donald Trump, for a solution. The fact that many acknowledge that Trump is no Roosevelt has not dampened expectations.\n\nOn the hustings, Trump blamed the two wars on the foreign policy failures of the Biden administration, with a promise to end them in 24 hours if re-elected. Now that his dream has come true, the global community is waiting on him.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, in his usual bombast, is ratcheting up the rhetoric. “I think we have to solve the Ukraine problem with Russia,” he told the French magazine, Paris Match, this week. “Both countries are losing numbers that nobody can believe. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are being killed,” Trump said, responding to a question about his top priority on the international stage. “And the Middle East is of course a big priority. But I think that the Middle East is a less difficult situation than Ukraine with Russia. But those are the two situations that we have to solve and we have to solve them quickly. A lot of people are dying.”\n\nOn Saturday, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris, during the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, his first international trip since his dramatic political comeback. After the highly anticipated meeting, he wetted global appetite for peace when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that “there should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.”\n\nIt is in the interest of both countries that the bloody conflict is ended. As Trump rightly noted, both Ukraine and Russia are paying a dire price. Only 18 months into the conflict, officials of the Biden administration aver that both countries had lost a staggering number of troops estimated at over 500,000, including the injured. Ironically, the troop toll was heavier on the Russian side in a war Putin said would end in a matter of days.\n\nBut more Ukrainian civilians have died since the war is waged mostly on Ukrainian soil, with fighting and air strikes inflicting over 30,000 civilian casualties, while 3.7 million people are internally displaced, and 6.5 million have fled Ukraine and 14.6 million others need humanitarian assistance.\n\nThere is no doubting the fact that Ukrainians desire peace and are willing to collaborate with Trump and, indeed, the international community to realise that goal, yet, one question concentrates their minds right now. What will be the terms of the ceasefire that Trump is touting? Will it guarantee enduring peace? This is important because without justice and equity, peace becomes an illusion.\n\nUkrainians deserve a peaceful homeland, immune to Russia’s wilful aggression, a point poignantly made by President Zelenskyy last Sunday in a post on the Telegram messaging app: “When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land.”\n\nThat is the crux of the matter. The Ukrainian envoy to Nigeria is on the same page with President Zelenskyy.\n\n“Ukraine’s position on peace remains firm. Ukraine desires peace more than anyone does. Ukraine did not start this war and never wanted it. If Russia stops fighting – there will be peace. If Ukraine stops fighting – Ukraine will cease to exist.\n\n“Thus, the peace must be lasting and just. Ukraine is ready to seek diplomatic solutions, but only on the condition of full adherence to the United Nations Charter. Additionally, Ukraine requests effective and reliable security guarantees from international partners to prevent future aggression,” he said in a statement forwarded to me on Wednesday.\n\nTo underscore their quest for peace by building trust with the incoming U.S. administration, Zelenskyy’s top aide, Andriy Yermak, met with key members of the Trump team on a two-day trip recently. Will such deft diplomatic maneuvering thaw the diplomatic ice and prod Trump in the direction of a ceasefire that will guarantee lasting peace?\n\nTrump insists that he is pushing the Russian leader Vladimir Putin to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine. “Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” he wrote on social media. And that is true. The question is: Would Putin and Russia also want to make a deal and stop the madness? Trump says he knows Vladimir well and that this is his time to act. “China can help. The World is waiting!”\n\nIndeed, the world is waiting and as Zelenskyy cautioned, Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”\n\nReducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the U.S. out of NATO as Trump has threatened will indubitably hamstrung Kyiv’s fighting capacity. That cannot guarantee peace. Kremlin’s incessant reference a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader is also a smokescreen to camouflage Putin’s aversion for talks with Ukraine. That decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nTruth remains that Russia is the aggressor. And any deal that does not guarantee lasting and just peace for Ukrainians will be a repudiation of the 79-year-old UN Charter.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/12/the-peace-ukrainians-deserve-by-ikechukwu-amaechi/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ikechukwu-Amaechi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 01:04:04","author":"Emmanuel Okogba","authors":["Emmanuel Okogba"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.66},{"id":272440010,"title":"'Let's see him do it': George Conway explains why Wray should have let Trump fire him","text":"FBI Director Christopher Wray's announcement that he's vacating his position before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated next month set off a firestorm of criticism on social media.

Its true meaning and superiority on all other institutions is to replace civil war and collective violence with a predictable set of rules. As the British philosopher Karl Popper wrote: Democracy does not necessarily allow selecting the best leader, but it guarantees that the leader will leave at a certain date, known in advance and without bloodshed. This modest definition of democracy seems not well understood in South Korea, where too much benefit is expected from democracy when its true value is overlooked. As a proof of this misunderstanding, let us remind that four former presidents have been sent to jail. Whatever the motives of their incarceration, this is not the way a democratic country should work.\n\nActually, the misunderstanding of what democracy is about has deep roots in South Korea's history and culture: This has always been a violent society punctuated with civil wars, religious rivalries, conflicts between provinces and more recently archaic conflicts between men and women on what should be the role of women in the society. Based on such a long history on confrontations, democracy is difficult to establish on stable basis in South Korea because democracy is rooted in compromise — the very notion of compromise does not seem a strong component of the Korean civilization, to say the least. Therefore, each election is fought as a kind of war and not a confrontation between programs. When elected, the presidents behave as if they were elected dictators and not the representative of the whole nation for a finite period of time. On the other side, the opposition behaves as if they were at war with the elected dictator and not the next government-to-be when their turn comes.\n\nTherefore, confronted with another crisis, we need to wonder how to reinforce the rule of law in spite of the complexity of South Korea's society and culture.\n\nIt seems to me, the only way would be to change the Constitution. This is a proposal I expressed many times in Seoul, even in front of the National Assembly. I had no success because each member (with some exceptions of course) of the Assembly is avidly looking for power for himself, and his followers – stability comes second.\n\nHow would a new Constitution look like? It should draw a middle way between the rule of law and the tradition of political violence. It should combine a legitimate leadership, necessary in a dangerous international environment, with an obligation for compromise.\n\nThe legitimate leader should remain the president but with a shorter mandate, like four years in the U.S., and limited powers. Instead of a political activist the president should only guarantee the respect of the law, with the increased power in case of war. Germany could be considered as a reliable model, and the U.S. before Donald Trump. Day-to-day government, long-term economic and social strategy, protection of minorities and public safety should be the task of a prime minister and his government, elected by the parliament for four years as well.\n\nIn such a parliamentary democracy, the opposition would have specific rights like the so-called shadow government in the U.K. — the right to be informed on any seminal domestic or international affairs and the right to publicly interrogate the prime minister in allotted time slots. The opposition would thus become responsible and the government would respect the opposition. Dialogue would replace fistfights.\n\nThe parliament could be divided in two chambers, like in the U.S., Germany and France: The second chamber or Senate would represent the provinces, with less power than the Congress but useful to stop excesses in the name of law and order. Two successive four-year mandates for the members of the parliament and for the president could combine efficiency and modesty; politics should thus not become a full- time job but one sequence in a professional lifetime.\n\nSupposing that a new Constitution offering a better balance of powers than the current one, could instill a culture of compromise in the political culture, who will write such a text? For sure, this would not be the task of the current or next Assembly.\n\nBased on the history of several European countries, the way forward would be to elect a special Assembly for a short mandate and whose only purpose would be to write the new Constitution. The members of this special Assembly would have no right to run for any political office during four years after they complete their task.\n\nEventually, the new Constitution will need to be approved by a popular referendum.\n\nNot being Korean but French, I will take no position in the current conflict between the president and the various factions of the Assembly. Seen from afar, I can only be flabbergasted by the political mess which is South Korea, in contrast with its phenomenal economic and cultural success. It is time for South Korea to bridge the gap between their up-to-date economic and cultural industry on one side and their obsolete institutions on the other side. It can be done if you seize the current crisis not as a crisis but as an opportunity.\n\nGuy Sorman is a French philosopher and economist, and the author of \"Economics Does Not Lie\" and \"Diary of an Optimist.\"","summary":"Democracy is never, nowhere, a perfect political system.

The other half goes to Catalyst of San Diego & Imperial Counties, which in turn will make grants to other local aid groups for the same purpose.\n\nThe board of supervisors voted 3-1 to authorize the grants, using money it got last month from the state Department of Social Services’ Office of Equity. Jim Desmond cast the no vote, and Joel Anderson was absent.\n\nThe number of migrants arriving in San Diego County peaked earlier this year and has averaged about 550 a day, according to the board letter; about 99 percent are here briefly before traveling to other parts of the country. The number of encounters has fallen, but the region remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nSince the county closed its temporary migrant welcome center earlier this year — it operated on $6 million in county funds and served more than 81,000 people in its four months — Catholic Charities and Jewish Family Service of San Diego have tried filling the gap in services for migrants continuing to other parts of the country.\n\nTheir respite shelters mainly provide the most vulnerable asylum-seekers — families, pregnant women, LGBTQ+ people and those with medical conditions — temporary places to stay and help reaching their final destinations.\n\nIn recent months, Catholic Charities has been taking in every asylum-seeker processed and released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, plus people from other shelters already at capacity, its CEO Vino Pajanor told The San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nNow, he says the shelters are working with CBP to prepare for an increase in arriving migrants, which typically happens each year during the busy holiday season due to increased travel.\n\nPlus, it can take migrants arriving in San Diego County longer to head their final destinations than it otherwise might, due to the hectic holiday travel season.\n\n“Usually, as it gets closer to Christmas, that’s when the backlog starts happening — because people are not able to leave San Diego because of increased costs or weather (delays),” Pajanor explained Wednesday.\n\nThat’s why Kimberly Giardina, deputy chief administrative officer of the county’s health agency, urged supervisors to act quickly, calling it “critical for the county to expeditiously get available and timely resources out to community providers” in a letter last week.\n\nCatalyst has been helping connect and fund migrant service groups since 2018, its president and CEO Megan Thomas said Wednesday.\n\nShe said the county grant “will allow us to fund the critical work of nonprofit partners who ensure a humane and dignified entry into our country.”\n\nCounty staff had originally planned to give the entire $2 million to Catholic Charities, which would then collaborate with other local migrant service groups. But other community organizations renewed months-long pleas for a seat at the table, too.\n\nIn a letter sent to supervisors Monday, nearly two dozen migrant advocacy groups recommended the county create a task force “led by a regional facilitator from philanthropy and who is not a service provider.”\n\n“This approach would ensure the necessary flexibility and impartiality to effectively convene and coordinate stakeholders, fostering a collaborative and equitable regional response,” the letter went on to explain.\n\nAs the county works to establish a permanent migrant transition center, staff have been soliciting feedback from many of the same groups to determine the scope of services needed.\n\nIn May, they met with representatives from 23 such groups who advised them to rely on existing nonprofits with expertise in serving asylum-seekers to provide services “prioritizing onward travel,” Barbara Jiménez, HHSA’s community operations officer, said Tuesday.\n\nBut efforts to establish the center have since stalled after negotiations with two potential operators failed.\n\nAnd with President-elect Donald Trump vowing to crack down on immigration once he re-takes office, county staff are worried their costs might not be reimbursed if his administration redirects or repurposes federal funding.\n\nThe county had secured $19.6 million through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Shelter and Services Program — but the money isn’t provided up front but rather reimbursed later. Catholic Charities and Jewish Family Service also secured nearly $63.3 million in SSP funding this fiscal year split between them.\n\nLast week, the county hosted a community-engagement session to give updates on the project and gather feedback from recipients of such funding. People from dozens of groups attended.\n\nMany of those groups have begun making their own contingency plans.\n\nAlthough the board’s Tuesday action was unrelated to the use of federal SSP funds, both Chair Nora Vargas and Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer expressed dismay that talks with potential migrant-center providers had failed.\n\nVargas went on to push for the county to continue to move forward with the project. “It’s extremely important that we don’t speculate about the impacts (of) what the federal government does or doesn’t do,” she said.\n\nStaff expects to return to the board early next year to seek further direction on how the county can spend their SSP funds — if they are still available.\n\nStaff writer Alexandra Mendoza contributed to this report.","summary":"'Usually, as it gets closer to Christmas, that's when the backlog starts happening — because people are not able to leave San Diego because of increased costs or weather'","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/12/11/supervisors-ok-2m-to-help-migrants-traveling-through-san-diego-county-amid-holiday-surge/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SUT-L-BOSMIGRANTUPDATES-12.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:57:58","author":"Emily Alvarenga","authors":["Emily Alvarenga"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":272437114,"title":"National Newswatch","text":"Speaking on Tuesday night at an event hosted by the Equal Voice Foundation -- an organization dedicated to improving gender representation in Canadian politics -- Trudeau said there are regressive forces fighting against women's progress.\n\n\"It shouldn't be that way.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.\n\nYeah, China may well be trying to figure out just what the *Acting* President is up to, here. Is he opening up a path for increased diplomatic talks, on the old Churchillian maxim of \"jaw, jaw, jaw is better than war, war, war?\" Could this be an olive branch towards China, which has been making aggressive moves in the Pacific lately - and who has landed thousands of their nationals, legally and illegally, on our shores?\n\nIs Trump keeping his friends close, and his enemies, closer?\n\nXi Jinping is only one of the many world leaders to receive an invitation to the inauguration.\n\nIn addition to Xi, the president-elect's team has raised the possibility of hosting other leaders at the Capitol on Jan. 20. Hungary's far-right leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has a warm relationship with Trump and visited him at Mar-a-Lago this week, is \"still considering\" whether to attend, according to a source familiar with Orbán's plans. \"World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through American strength around the globe,\" Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said. \n\nHere's the thing: Foreign heads of state don't attend these affairs. The more usual form is to have an ambassador attend. Trump's invitation to Xi is a bit unusual. But then, what about Donald Trump's political career hasn't been unusual?\n\nBear in mind that things with China are a bit tense right now.\n\nSee Related: \n\nMeanwhile in CA: FBI Arrests Chinese National for Flying Drone Over Vandenberg Space Force Base\n\nThere's another possibility; it may not be his primary reason for the invitation, but Donald Trump may also be tweaking the noses of the leftist opposition with this \"Only Nixon could go to China\" move. \n\nThen again, this is the man who went to Korea and spoke to Kim Jong Un, that stunted little gargoyle with bad hair from a long line of stunted little gargoyles with bad hair who runs the nation/prison camp called North Korea. This is the man who has all along said that to make deals, you have to talk to people, and he's never shied away from talking to anyone. Not Kim Jong Un, not Tsar Vladimir I, and not Xi Jinping.\n\nGiven the silence from the Chinese embassy, it's likely that they will instead follow the normal form and send their ambassador. But it's a safe bet that, once he is back behind the Resolute Desk, President Trump will be seeking to talk to these people, as well as other world leaders. In his first term, he was big on talking and deal-making. There's no reason to suspect he will abandon the practice in his second term. And, honestly, why shouldn't he? Talking beats shooting, every day of the week.","url":"https://redstate.com/wardclark/2024/12/11/wait-what-donald-trump-is-inviting-chinas-xi-jinping-to-what-again-n2183088","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/306/c934caf1-cad5-46eb-900e-6228d8a6ff2e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:41:04","author":"Ward Clark","authors":["Ward Clark"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056},{"id":272435318,"title":"Mint Primer | Rupee takes a dive, more turbulence in 2025 | Mint","text":"What triggered the rupee’s recent fall?\n\nThe Indian rupee breached a record low of 84.85 per dollar this week and briefly tested 85.06-per-dollar levels as outgoing Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das’s term ended on Tuesday. Known for his hawkish stance, Das’s departure might mark a shift to looser monetary policy as revenue secretary Sanjay Malhotra steps in as RBI governor for three years. In anticipation of an interest rate cut in February, currency traders are expecting the US-India interest rate differential to narrow in the near term. This expectation has driven up dollar demand, weakening the rupee.\n\nAlso read | Can right to repair make modular phones popular?\n\nWhy does the rupee keep depreciating?\n\nSince India is a net importer of goods and services, demand for dollar is always high. Hence, by nature, the rupee is a depreciating currency. Its fall is limited by the RBI through planned interventions in the spot and forward foreign currency markets. However, increasing geopolitical uncertainty, attractive US government bond yields, cheaper crude oil prices and heavy foreign institutional investor outflow from domestic equities further boosted dollar demand and exacerbated the rupee’s fall at the fag end of 2024. Subdued exports have also reduced India’s dollar earnings and kept dollar supply low.\n\nHow has the rupee fared against peers?\n\nIt has held its ground better than most global peers this year, outperforming both emerging and developed market rivals. So far in 2024, the dollar index has risen almost 5% to 106.40, while major developed market currencies such as the Swiss franc, euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen have fallen 5-7%. The rupee fell only around 2% against the dollar.\n\nAlso read | Should India pay for academic journal access?\n\nWhat does it mean for the economy?\n\nA depreciating rupee adds to the pain. It will increase India’s rising import bill while export earnings remain lacklustre. A recent India Ratings and Research report suggests India’s current account deficit is expected to widen to a seven-quarter high of $15 billion in Q2 from a $9.8 billion deficit in Q1. While Indians will pay more for foreign goods and services going ahead, “if the rupee stays within the 3% on-year depreciation range, it should not be a major issue\", Anindya Banerjee, head, currency, Kotak Securities, said.\n\nAlso read | Why are banks issuing fewer credit cards?\n\nWhat is the prognosis for 2025?\n\nThe rupee will most likely fall in 2025, with experts eyeing 85.5–86-per-dollar levels by the end of March, and 87 by the end of 2025. Market experts are anticipating a resurgence in US inflation next year because of brewing tariff wars and a low-tax environment once Donald Trump becomes president in March. This will prevent the US Federal Reserve from further cutting interest rates, making dollars more lucrative to hold, further boosting its demand. The headwinds for the rupee are intensifying, signalling volatility.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/economy/mint-primer-rupee-takes-a-dive-more-turbulence-in-2025-11733933762913.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/11/1600x900/rupee_1733933832486_1733933832862.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:40:02","author":"Abhinaba Saha","authors":["Abhinaba Saha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":272434758,"title":"Another Hegseth Attack Is Shooting Blanks, and Suddenly We Have an Immigration Problem!","text":"The media swarm to bring down Pete Hegseth continues – and so does the lack of success.

But in his new Netflix special, What Had Happened Was (now streaming on Netflix), Foxx reveals the harrowing details of the debilitating stroke that left him on the edge of death — and his arduous road to recovery.\n\n “I was fighting for my life, but I’m here right in front of you,” a tearful Foxx tells a cheering Atlanta crowd after being introduced by his daughter, actress Corinne Foxx. “If I dance all night, don’t mind me. I’m happy to be alive.”\n\n Foxx explains that he wanted to film the special in Atlanta because it’s where he got started doing stand-up and because the doctors and nurses of Piedmont Atlanta Hospital were the first to care for him after his stroke. At the time, Foxx was in Atlanta filming his upcoming Netflix movie Back in Action co-starring Cameron Diaz. \n\n “Atlanta saved my life,” he repeats to the audience throughout the special, which has already been nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the Best Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television category.\n\n Here are key takeaways from the performance:\n\n His “mystery illness” started with a headache. \n\n On April 11, 2023, Foxx was hit with a bad headache and asked a friend for an aspirin. But before he was able to take it, he says he “went out.” He doesn’t remember the following 20 days, but Foxx says he was told by friends and family members that the first doctor he saw gave him a cortisone shot and sent him home. When his sister, Deidra Dixon, went to visit him she insisted he get further medical care because something didn’t seem right.\n\n Dixon drove him to Piedmont Hospital, where another doctor speculated Foxx was having a brain bleed that led to a stroke. The doctor operated on Foxx in what the actor says was a near-death experience. “He may be able to make a full recovery, but it’s gonna be the worst year of his life,” Foxx tearfully recounts the doctor telling his sister.\n\n When Foxx woke up 20 days later, he was in a rehabilitation center in Chicago and was confused to find himself in a wheelchair. \n\n Foxx initially refused to participate in therapy to get better. \n\n In an emotional retelling, Foxx remembers being dizzy, frustrated, and stubbornly resistant to both physical and mental therapy. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothing. I don’t want to see no therapist,” he says. “They say, ‘You got a second chance.’ I don’t want a second chance. What’s wrong with my first chance?”\n\n Eventually, Foxx says, the rehab center sent in a nurse named Holly who pushed him to get out of bed and gain perspective on his situation. She reminded him that while he had the chance to get better, there were people who weren’t going to make it out of the facility he was in. \n\n Foxx’s sense of humor is well intact. \n\n Throughout his time in rehab, Foxx says he made jokes with the nurses and his other visitors, telling himself, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.”\n\n While he sheds plenty of tears as he speaks candidly about his health criss, Foxx also leans into his comedy roots with impressions of Wesley Snipes, Dave Chappelle, Jay-Z, Mike Tyson, and even Donald Trump. Withing the first few minutes of the special, he also nods to the sexual assault, harassment, and sex trafficking allegations against Sean Combs. \n\n “The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. I know what you’re thinking: ‘Did he?’” Foxx says. “Hell no, I left them parties early. I was out by nine. ‘Something don’t look right. It’s slippery in here’” (a reference to the more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil that were found in Diddy’s home raid as a part of Homeland Security’s investigation).\n\n He returns to Diddy later in the special as he describes his “oddly peaceful” near-death experience: “I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light, I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel. [I thought], ‘Shit am I going to the wrong place in this motherfucker?’ ’Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel and I thought I saw the devil. Or was that Puffy?” \n\n Foxx celebrates how his family “held me the fuck down” during this scary moment in his life. \n\n While he was experiencing his stroke, memory loss, and subsequent recovery, Foxx says he was absent from the spotlight because his sister and his older daughter tried their best to keep him out of the public eye. “They didn’t want you to see me like that, and I didnt want you to see me like that,” he explains. “I wanted you to see me like this.” The comedian is brought to tears explaining that he doesn’t have to wonder who will be by his side during the worst of times, because he’s lived through it. \n\n Before leaving the stage, Foxx also brings out his younger daughter, 14-year-old Anelise Bishop, who plays her guitar for the audience. Foxx says he was told that for the first 15 days following his stroke, his vitals were “out of control” and things were very “touch and go.” But when Bishop snuck into his hospital room and played her guitar, the nurses were “baffled” to see his vitals go down. “You know what I found out? It was God in that guitar,” he says. “That’s my spiritual defibrillator.”\n\n Bishop strums along while Foxx performs a conversation he had with God during this tumultuous time. After she finishes her song, Foxx takes a seat at a piano to take the audience through a long list of his accomplishments, including a performance of his Grammy-nominated song “Slow Jamz.” \n\n We still don’t really know everything about what had happened to Jamie Foxx. \n\n While Foxx addresses his stroke and the gravity of his medical condition, some details remain opaque. While Foxx says he was “gone for 20 days” throughout the health crisis, it’s not entirely clear whether he lost consciousness during the experience, fell into a coma, suffered amnesia, or something else entirely.","summary":"Key details on the actor's health crisis and recovery from the intimate and emotional Golden Globe-nominated stand-up show","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jamie-foxx-netflix-special-what-had-happened-was-1235198883/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/jamie-foxx-netflix-LEAD.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:29:55","author":"Krystie Lee Yandoli","authors":["Krystie Lee Yandoli"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":272436484,"title":"Jim Leach, former US representative from Iowa, dies at 82 - The Associated Press","text":"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Former U.S. Rep.

John McCain, in part for Obama’s opposition to the 2003 invasion — a decision he said wasn’t easy.\n\n“Part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment,” Leach told The Associated Press in an interview at the time. \n\nEarlier this year, Leach joined with Loebsack to pen a Jan. 6 op-ed in The Des Moines Register, a year after former President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s victory.\n\n“This anniversary of the violent insurrection on our nation’s Capitol is a solemn reminder of how fragile the foundations of democracy are when extremists like Donald Trump are willing to undermine millions of voters and encourage a deadly mob all in the name of wielding power,” Leach and Loebsack wrote.\n\nLoebsack told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he even voted for Leach before running against him, despite their difference in political party.\n\n“Jim served our district and state honorably for 30 years. He was a man of principle and integrity and honor,” Loebsack said. “We’re gonna miss him. There’s no question.”\n\nLeach worked as a professor for Princeton, his alma mater, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard before Obama tapped him to lead the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2009. He resigned from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 2013 and he joined the University of Iowa faculty.\n\nUniversity Vice President Peter Matthes said in a statement Wednesday that Leach was a “relentless advocate” for Iowa. The university’s statement also said Leach donated his public and private papers to their libraries.\n\n“He lived a life of service that we should all aspire to emulate,” Matthes said.\n\nIowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds offered her condolences Wednesday.\n\n“As a member of U.S. Congress for 30 years, Jim dedicated his life to serving his country and the state of Iowa,” Reynolds said on the social platform X.\n\nLeach is survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren, according to his obituary.","summary":"Jim Leach, former US representative from Iowa, dies at 82  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/jim-leach-died-a0fab761883b7cf84636ed60964f53cf","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4ecb98e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3180x1789+0+144/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa3%2F02%2Fef32160cfe28d6a327f21cb52260%2F2436d2d0cece47c59bdeeaf0a9875f7d","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:29:00","author":"Hannah Fingerhut,Thomas Beaumont","authors":["Hannah Fingerhut","Thomas Beaumont"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.016},{"id":272432352,"title":"Nasdaq Composite closes at record high Wednesday","text":"NEW YORK, New York - Technology stocks bolted on Wednesday pushing the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite to a new all-time closing high. The November consumer price index came in at 0.3 percent, or an annualized 2.7 percent, broadly in line with expectations. The reading enhances the already-strong view that the Fed will cut official interest rates at its next meeting.\n\n\"We expect a rate cut in the final meeting here at the end of the year,\" Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management, told CNBC Wednesday. \"With no surprises, the direction of the market's been higher, and there's been nothing to derail it from melting up into year-end.\"\n\nNvidia shares rose more than 3 percent. Trump Media and Tesla, majority-owned by the dynamic duo Donald Trump and Elon Musk both closed more than 5 percent higher.\n\nFollowing are the closing quotes Wednesday for the leading U.S. stock indices:\n\nS&P 500 Moves Higher on Broad GainsThe S&P 500 rose 49.28 points to close at 6,084.19, adding 0.82 percent. The positive momentum spanned multiple sectors, with consumer discretionary, healthcare, and communication services all pushing higher.\n\nDow Lags Behind as Select Blue Chips WeighMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 99.27 points, ending the session at 44,148.56, a 0.22 percent decline. This dip came as several blue-chip components struggled, weighed down by profit-taking and lingering uncertainty about global economic indicators. \n\nNASDAQ Surges on Technology RallyThe NASDAQ Composite index soared 347.65 points to close at 20,034.89, representing a new record closing high, and an impressive gain of 1.77 percent. It was the first time the key index closed above 20,000. Tech heavyweights and high-growth innovators led the charge, benefiting from upbeat forward guidance and ongoing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence and advanced computing sectors. The NASDAQ's robust volume of 5.414 billion shares traded underscored investor appetite for exposure to cutting-edge companies.\n\nGlobal Forex Markets: Dollar Strengthens Against Major Rivals on Wednesday\n\nOn Wednesday, the global foreign exchange landscape showcased a resurgent U.S. dollar, as it gained ground against several major currencies despite ongoing global economic uncertainties. Market participants pointed to a mix of relatively stable U.S. economic indicators, a slight uptick in inflation, and lingering investor caution that kept the greenback in favor.\n\nEuro and Pound Decline as Dollar FirmsThe Euro slipped against the U.S. dollar, with the EUR/USD pair settling at 1.0492, down 0.33 percent. Traders attributed the move to dovish signals from European policymakers and mixed Eurozone economic data, which encouraged investors to seek safer havens. The British pound, meanwhile, followed a similar path. The GBP/USD pair stood at 1.2745, declining by 0.20 percent, as uncertainty over upcoming U.K. growth figures weighed on sterling.\n\nYen Falls to Dollar as Safe-Haven Appeal ShiftsThe U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY rising to 152.58, up 0.42 percent. The yen's traditional appeal as a safe haven currency diminished amid ongoing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve might maintain higher interest rates longer than initially anticipated, thereby bolstering the dollar's yield advantage.\n\nDollar Gains Versus Swiss Franc, Mixed Performance Against Commodity CurrenciesThe greenback also advanced against the Swiss franc, as the USD/CHF pair climbed to 0.8845, registering a 0.35 percent increase. The move came even as global sentiment remained cautious, suggesting that investors felt more comfortable with the dollar's yield dynamics than the franc's safe-haven status.\n\nIn commodity-linked currencies, the U.S. dollar posted mixed results. Against the Canadian dollar, it dipped slightly, with USD/CAD at 1.4162, down 0.12 percent as firmer oil prices and recent economic data offered modest support to the loonie. The Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar both lost ground against the U.S. dollar, at 0.6369 (down 0.11 percent) and 0.5784 (down 0.24 percent), respectively. Currency analysts suggested that slower Chinese economic indicators and subdued commodity demand continued to pressure these currencies.\n\nGlobal Markets Close Mostly Higher on Wednesday, With European Benchmarks Leading Gains\n\nWednesday's global trading session saw most major stock indices end the day in positive territory, as European markets displayed broad strength and some Asian bourses struggled to find upward momentum. Currency indices reflected mixed signals, with the U.S. Dollar Index inching upward while European and Asian currency measures showed some softness.\n\nCanadian Stocks Join the Party \n\nNorth of the border, Canada's S&P/TSX Composite index climbed 153.37 points to settle at 25,657.70, up 0.60 percent. Rising commodity prices and stronger-than-expected corporate earnings contributed to a more upbeat mood in the Canadian markets. Energy and mining names benefited from firm global demand, helping drive the index's upward momentum.\n\nUK and Europe's Major Indices Advance, Though Belgium LagsIn the UK, the London-based FTSE 100 climbed to 8,301.62, up 21.26 points or 0.26 percent, benefiting from steady investor confidence and mild economic optimism. Germany's DAX advanced 70.00 points, closing at 20,399.16, a 0.34 percent increase. Meanwhile, the CAC 40 in France finished at 7,423.40, up 28.62 points or 0.39 percent. The pan-European EURO STOXX 50 Index recorded a modest gain, rising 7.61 points to 4,959.35, an increase of 0.15 percent. The Euronext 100 added 5.06 points, settling at 1,467.45, or 0.35 percent higher.\n\nNot all European benchmarks joined the rally; Belgium's BEL 20 slipped by 7.23 points to 4,239.01, down 0.17 percent as select financial and industrial components weighed on the index.\n\nMixed Results Across Asia-Pacific MarketsAsian equities presented a more varied picture. China's SSE Composite Index rose 9.83 points to 3,432.49, an improvement of 0.29 percent, amid hopes for policy support. Japan's Nikkei 225 barely moved, adding only 4.65 points to close at 39,372.23, up by just 0.01 percent.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 20,155.05, down 156.23 points or 0.77 percent, as investor caution persisted following recent economic data. Singapore's STI Index dropped 20.73 points to 3,792.82, a decrease of 0.54 percent, and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 closed at 8,353.60 after shedding 39.40 points, down 0.47 percent. Its broader counterpart, the All Ordinaries, dipped 39.60 points to 8,610.40, off by 0.46 percent.\n\nThe S&P/NZX 50 Index Gross of New Zealand advanced 37.82 points, closing at 12,761.19, or 0.30 percent higher.\n\nElsewhere, India's S&P BSE SENSEX recorded a slight improvement, gaining 16.09 points to settle at 81,526.14, up by a mere 0.02 percent. Malaysia's FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI slipped 5.77 points to 1,603.20, a loss of 0.36 percent.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI Composite Index surged 24.67 points to 2,442.51, a notable 1.02 percent jump, signaling robust sentiment. By contrast, Taiwan's TWSE Index fell sharply, losing 221.45 points to 22,903.63, a 0.96 percent decline.\n\nMiddle East markets end mixed\n\nIn the Middle East, the Egyptian EGX 30 rallied 121.50 points, ending at 30,739.30, up 0.40 percent, and Tel Aviv's TA-125 slipped 12.95 points to 2,387.74, down 0.54 percent.\n\nGood gains on African continent\n\nSouth Africa's Top 40 USD Net TRI Index rose 30.46 points to 4,764.07, registering a 0.64 percent gain.\n\nCurrencies and Key BenchmarksOn the currency front, the U.S. Dollar Index edged up 0.35 points to 106.75, a 0.33 percent gain, reflecting continued investor favor for the greenback as a safe haven. In contrast, the MSCI EUROPE index added 2.66 points to 2,077.49, up 0.13 percent, while the British Pound Currency Index slipped 0.26 points to 127.41, a 0.20 percent loss, and the Euro Currency Index dropped 0.41 points to 104.88, off by 0.39 percent.\n\nIn Asia, The Japanese Yen Currency Index fell by 0.29 points to 65.53, a 0.43 percent decline, and the Australian Dollar Currency Index dipped by 0.10 points to 63.69, down 0.16 percent.\n\nLooking AheadAnalysts suggest that Europe's stronger showing could set the tone for a steadier week ahead, provided no unforeseen geopolitical or economic headwinds emerge. In Asia, markets remain more sensitive to regional data and currency dynamics, while global investors await key announcements and earnings reports that could influence the next directional moves across these major benchmarks.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nTuesday 10 December 2024 | U.S. stocks close weaker, Dow Jones drops 154 points | Big News Network\n\nMonday 9 December 2024 | Sell-off in Nvidia undermines U.S. stock markets | Big News Network\n\nPhoto credit: Big News Network news agency","url":"https://www.nigeriasun.com/news/274846083/nasdaq-composite-closes-at-record-high-wednesday","image":"https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/cus1733945725625.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:27:02","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.282},{"id":272431848,"title":"Ukraine says aerial attack sparks fire at key Russian oil depot","text":"Ukraine’s military says it has hit an oil depot in western Russia that fuels a key pipeline for Russian military supplies.\n\nThe military’s general staff said on Wednesday the overnight attack had caused a “massive fire” to break out at the facility in the Bryansk region.\n\nFootage posted by the Astra Telegram channel, which shares war updates from Russian journalists, appeared to show huge flames towering into the sky near the targeted site. Ukrainian news site Pravda also published an image of the blaze.\n\nBryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz acknowledged a production facility in the region had caught fire after a drone attack, but said it had been extinguished.\n\n“There were no casualties. Operational and emergency services are working on the scene,” Bogomaz said in a post on Telegram.\n\nThe Soviet-built Druzhba oil pipeline, which pumps oil from the fields in Western Siberia and the Caspian Sea to markets of Europe, runs through the Bryansk region, as does the Baltic Pipeline System which runs to the Baltic Sea.\n\nKazakhstan pipeline operator KazTransOil said the pipeline, which brings both Russian and Kazakh oil to Europe, was not damaged in the attack.\n\nAlso overnight, Ukraine’s military fired missiles at a Russian port on the Azov Sea, damaging an industrial facility and numerous cars, said Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Russia’s Rostov region.\n\nSlyusar said 14 cars had caught fire at the Taganrog port, but he did not disclose details on what else was hit or how big the attack was.\n\nRussia has an airbase near the city, from which military analysts say Russia’s air force operates drones, bombers and other weapons to attack Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile in Zaporizhzhia, one of the four Ukrainian regions Moscow claimed to annex in 2022 without fully controlling, casualties continued to mount from an attack the day before that hit a medical clinic and office building.\n\nAt least seven people have been confirmed killed and others are still trapped under the rubble, said Ukraine’s State Emergency Service on Wednesday. Twenty-two others, including a five-year-old girl, are wounded, according to Ukraine’s interior ministry.\n\nThe 34-month war in Ukraine, which has left tens of thousands dead and displaced millions, is entering what some Russian and Western officials say could be its final and most dangerous phase. Russian forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine at their fastest pace since the war’s onset and Ukraine has been using high-precision tactical missile systems against Russia.\n\nUnited States President-elect Donald Trump, who has at times praised Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and suggested cutting aid to Ukraine if it does not make concessions to stop the fighting, has said ending the war will be a top priority once he enters the White House in January.\n\n“I think we have to solve the Ukraine problem with Russia,” Trump told French magazine Paris Match in an interview recorded on Saturday and released on Wednesday.\n\n“Both those countries [Russia and Ukraine] are losing numbers that nobody can believe. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are being killed,” Trump said. “And the Middle East is of course a big priority. But I think that the Middle East is a less difficult situation than Ukraine with Russia.”\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed he would be able to bring an end to the war in Ukraine within 24 hours.","url":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/ukraine-says-aerial-attack-sparks-fire-at-key-russian-oil-depot/","image":"https://jamaicainquirer.com/app/uploads/2024/12/2024-12-11T102939Z_1461492606_RC2YMBAVCJTQ_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-DRONES-RUSSIA-UGC-1733915754-hxnRWK.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:25:02","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jm","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":272431408,"title":"How to catch the Geminids, one of the strongest meteor showers of the year","text":"Shopping Trends\n\n The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Month to date, it’s up just 0.5%.\n\nMarket drivers\n\nOil prices gained following a report by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, that the Biden administration is considering new sanctions on Russian oil — in a effort to weaken Russia’s ability to fund its war with Ukraine — before incoming U.S. President Donald Trump takes office. \n\nA U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia may use its lethal intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine again in the coming days, the Associated Press reported, citing a U.S. official. \n\nThat would “definitely amp up the risk,” and with reports that the U.S. is looking to toughen sanctions on Russia, there may be “some protection buying in the [oil] complex,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, told MarketWatch.\n\nNew Russian oil sanctions had been “previously avoided due to concerns over global energy cost spikes,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. But “bolder measures are now deemed viable, with oil prices currently subdued by a global surplus and increasing anxieties that the incoming administration may push for a swift resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.”\n\n“This shift could impose new pressures on one of the world’s largest oil producers,” he said in a daily note. “Until the specifics of the sanctions are revealed, this could establish a floor under oil prices,” said Innes. “If the sanctions prove substantial, we could see oil prices climb higher.”\n\nSupport for oil has also been tied to the recent pledge by China’s Politburo for more aggressive stimulus measures. \n\n“Experts see supporting domestic spending and investment as key factors to support growth,” said Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com. “The crystallization of the impact of the recent support packages and reforms over the next year, in conjunction with easy monetary conditions, should accelerate the recovery,” he wrote in market commentary.\n\nOil prices were up despite the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a monthly report Wednesday, lowering its forecast for 2024 global oil demand growth by 210,000 barrels per day from the November report, to 1.6 million barrels per day, year over year. For 2025, it also cut its oil demand-growth forecast by 90,000 barrels per day, to 1.4 million bpd.\n\nThe reductions marked the fifth month in row that OPEC has lowered its oil demand-growth projections, according to the Wall Street Journal. OPEC’s downward revision likely “partially reflects the challenging growth outlook in China,” said Kenny Zhu, research analyst at Global X, in emailed commentary.\n\nSupply data\n\nWeekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies from the Energy Information Administration released Wednesday showed a decline of 1.4 million barrels in U.S. commercial crude inventories for the week ended Dec. 6.\n\nThe report was expected to show a decline of 600,000 barrels on average, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&P Global Commodity Insights. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a crude-inventory climb of 499,000 barrels, according to a source citing the data.\n\nThe EIA also reported weekly supply gains of 5.1 million barrels for gasoline and 3.2 million barrels for distillates. The S&P Global Commodity Insights survey forecast inventory gains of 1.7 million barrels each for gasoline and distillates.\n\nU.S. oil production was up by 118,000 barrels at 13.631 million barrels per day in the latest week, the EIA said. That’s a fresh record high. \n\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., Nymex delivery hub fell by 1.3 million barrels to 22.9 million barrels, data showed. Demand for gasoline rose, with total motor gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, at 8.810 million barrels per day in the latest week, from 8.738 million bpd from a week earlier.\n\nSeparately, a monthly report from the EIA released Tuesday showed expectations for a oil supply deficit this year, with total world oil output forecast at 102.6 million barrels per day and total world consumption at 103 million bpd.","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crude-climbs-as-u-s-reportedly-considers-oil-sanctions-on-russia-43554852?&mod=home-page","image":"https://images.mktw.net/im-294199/social","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:22:03","author":"Myra P.

As he spoke, a television near him flashed “Comey Resigns.” He thought his team was playing a prank on him, Comey told ABC News in 2018, but soon realized the news was no joke. \n\nAt the time, he had been leading an investigation into whether Trump’s advisers colluded with the Russian government to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump fired him because he refused to stop the investigation.\n\n“The special burden of being in the FBI is that you lack friends in high places — by design,” Comey’s statement continued. “America has wanted you to be lonely since the searing lessons of Watergate. Once upon a time, the FBI director was a pal of presidents, sharing late-night drinks and using the Bureau to do favors for the powerful. \n\n“But the country learned 50 years ago that it is not in the national interest for the FBI to be loyal to anything except the constitution and the law.” \n\nComey noted how, in recent years, federal investigators have investigated both Republicans and Democrats, including Trump and former New Jersey Democratic senator Bob Menendez in 2022. \n\n“Those investigations predictably led the politicians and their followers to decry the alleged partisan bias of the FBI,” Comey wrote. “An organization devoted only to finding out what is true will have few fans among politicians who have done something they shouldn’t have.”\n\n“But when the liars leave the stage, you will still be at work, trying to find facts in a careful and honest way,” he added. \n\nThe Independent has reached out to Comey for comment.\n\nLast month, Trump announced he would nominate MAGA loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI. In an ABC News interview on Sunday, Trump said he wasn’t “thrilled” with Wray’s performance, stating the director had “invaded” his Mar-a-Lago home to search for classified documents.\n\nWhen asked if he intended to fire Wray to make room for Patel, Trump told the NBC News reporter: “It would sort of seem pretty obvious that if Kash gets in, he’s going to be taking somebody’s place right, and somebody is the man that you’re talking about.” \n\nWray announced his resignation on Wednesday, stating he would only serve until the end of President Joe Biden’s administration. “In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,” said Wray, who Trump appointed to the position in 2017. He’s currently seven years into his 10-year term. \n\nPatel, who will need to be confirmed by the US Senate, has advocated for firing workers and going on a prosecution spree to fulfill Trump’s promise of retribution, although Trump said he would not specifically direct Patel to go after his political enemies. \n\nComey encouraged Bureau employees to continue doing the job they’ve been trained to do by opening cases when evidence warrants it and launching investigations as regulations require. \n\n“Your job is hard, the hours crushing, the pay mediocre. You get threatened and lied about. People try to hurt you constantly,” his statement read. “The water is rough right now and the sea is likely to rage over the next four years, but your children and grandchildren will be proud that you stayed true to the values of your great institution.”\n\nHe added: “There is always accountability even if it seems years away.”","summary":"‘There is always accountability even if it seems years away,’ the former FBI director wrote on instagram","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/james-comey-fbi-christopher-wray-b2662917.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/11/23/GettyImages-1069515694.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DesuqgvY-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:18:19","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":272432860,"title":"Why Christopher Wray's planned resignation is significant","text":"Why Christopher Wray's planned resignation is significant\n FBI Director Christopher Wray announced Wednesday that he plans to resign from his post at the end of President Biden's term in January.

Daniel Christman.\n\nProPublica senior editor Jesse Eisinger answered with telling haughty self-importance: “We asked West Pt public affairs, which told us twice on the record that he hadn’t even applied there. We reached out. Hegseth’s spox gave us his acceptance letter. We didn’t publish a story. That’s journalism.” \n\nHe followed with an 11-part thread (concluding. “This is how journalism is supposed to work”!) on the tale, but never explained why the publication started chasing the story in the first place — nor why ProPublica never dug into, say, Tim Walz’s claims. \n\nThe reason, of course, is that ProPublica isn’t so much a news outlet as it is a left-wing “opposition research” project, funded by shadowy “anonymous” donors to dig up dirt (some of it possibly true) on Republicans and conservatives. \n\nAs witness its smears Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\n\nStill a mystery is just how the West Point public affairs team failed so conveniently for ProPublica’s agenda, repeatedly giving false info to an agenda-driven outlet — answers that might’ve violated the Privacy Act even if they’d been true. \n\nA genuine news outlet could’ve turned these events into an exposé on the forces working to tank this nomination.\n\nYou have to wonder if some insider (at the school, or higher up the command chain) didn’t suggest ProPublica chase this story.\n\nCertainly, high command is nervous about Hegseth’s and Trump’s stated intentions to fire “woke” generals who’ve risen to the top as politicians-in-uniform. \n\nHegseth’s lucky he had that 20-year-old letter handy: Absent hard proof to the contrary, ProPublica might well have gone to press with the lie, “apologizing” only when and if it had to.\n\nWith the eager cooperation of top Pentagon “career” officials, Democrats for years have pushed political correctness and even mandatory DEI “re education” on our troops. \n\nPutting political partisans in civilian jobs at West Point is even easier. \n\nHeck, the military academy “voluntarily” removed “duty, honor, country” from its mission statement in March.\n\nThe longer the Hegseth nomination fight goes on, the more obvious the need for someone like Pete to start cleaning house at the Pentagon.\n\nAmerica needs a military devoted to doing its job, not to catering to the left.","summary":"In an X post on Wednesday, Pete Hegseth flagged an in-the-works hit job, saying: \"We understand that ProPublica (the Left Wing hack group) is planning to publish a knowingly false report that I was not accepted to West Point in 1999.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/12/11/opinion/propublicas-botched-pete-hegseth-smear-proves-the-need-to-purge-the-military-of-partisanship/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/2024-12-06T142920Z_994660224_RC24JBAM7DS9_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CABINET-DEFENSE-e1733961115736.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:15:01","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.347},{"id":272435352,"title":"Barron Trump's Classmates At NYU Reveal What He Enjoys Doing The Most To Make Friends","text":"Barron Trump has always been somewhat of a loner as per insiders. However, now at college, New York University, he is reportedly making friends by leaning into one old hobby— video games. Rumor has it that the 18-year-old has been using gaming as a means to socialize, asking his classmates for their Gamertags and Discord IDs to get to know them. Dad Donald Trump, in an interview with prominent Twitch streamer, Adin Ross, also admitted his son's passion for gaming. According to TMZ, Barron is a huge fan of FIFA.\n\nDespite his successful efforts to make friends in his own special way, Barron is reportedly not getting the usual college experience— partying on campus as one might expect. He allegedly doesn't spend much time on the NYU campus given the Secret Service detail that always follows him around. He simply moves from building to building to attend classes and goes back home. Unlike other freshmen, he doesn't reside on campus for security reasons and remains at Trump Tower with Mum Melania Trump. This situation is likely to only get worse once Donald assumes office in January.\n\nAccording to his classmates, Barron doesn't like to draw attention to himself. In the words of a student who spoke to TMZ, \"He hardly exists,\" and typically sits in the back of his economics class, keeping to himself, and being as low-key as possible. Despite his controlled attitude, Barron is quite friendly. His classmates described him as 'chill,' amiable, and easygoing. According to the Daily Mail, kids at his high school claimed he was really into the game Clash of Clans and would talk endlessly about soccer. Barron’s love for video games played a big role in helping his dad’s campaign. He convinced Donald to join channels that specialize in gaming and pop culture, such as Ross's stream, to help win the youth vote. \n\nBarron's low-key demeanor and tendency to avoid the spotlight have created an air of mystery around him. Recently, Barron made headlines, after a video of him speaking with a Slovenian accent went viral.

Trump sat for a wide-ranging interview with the magazine last month.\n\nTime declined to comment.\n\nTrump’s 2024 selection mirrors his first recognition in 2016, when Time named him Person of the Year after his unexpected rise to the presidency. This time, the unveiling caps a remarkable comeback and a resurgence that has the potential to upend modern American politics.\n\nDespite the magazine’s dwindling circulation, Time’s Person of the Year remains an annual cultural touchstone and the distinction has become an obsession of sorts for Trump throughout the years. A Time cover naming him Person of the Year in 2009 hung in several of his golf clubs, The Washington Post reported nearly a decade later, though no such issue was ever printed.\n\nThrough his widely followed Twitter account, Trump regularly weighed in on the annual selection and amplified accounts suggesting it should be him. He criticized the magazine in 2011 for picking “The Protester” in a nod to the revolutions breaking out across the Arab world and the Occupy movement in the US. A year later, he said Time had “lost all credibility” because it failed to list him among its 100 most influential people of the year. Trump has also privately complained about the choices, in particular when Taylor Swift won in 2023. Trump has often been fixated on the power the pop star wields and posted, “I hate Taylor Swift,” on social media earlier this year after she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOver time, the title became a symbol of the mainstream fame and respect Trump sought out but appeared out of reach. In 2015, when the magazine named then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel its Person of the Year, he wrote on Twitter, “I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite,” before adding: “They picked person who is ruining Germany.”\n\nEven after Time named Trump its person of the year in 2016 – which he called “a great honor” on social media – he continued to closely monitor the results. The following year, Trump claimed he was in the mix for the distinction again but wouldn’t agree to an interview and photo shoot. Time disputed his version of events.\n\nDespite his regular criticism of the media, Trump has regularly granted access to legacy outlets – including Time. He sat down for an extended interview in April of this year with the magazine at his Palm Beach club. Harris turned down a similar opportunity, the magazine’s owner said in October.\n\nOver the decades, the title has been granted to a wide array of figures, from heads of state and activists to entrepreneurs and, in some instances, brutal authoritarian leaders. Every US president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, except Gerald Ford, has been named Person of the Year at least once. President Joe Biden and Harris were co-honorees after they defeated Trump in 2020.\n\nMembers of Trump’s family are expected to attend the Thursday event, including Ivanka Trump, according to a source familiar with planning. It marks a rare public appearance for the president-elect’s daughter, who served as a senior adviser during his first term.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

We were supposed to be on a steady, if difficult sometimes, march towards progress,” Trudeau said, adding he is a proud feminist and will always be an ally.\n\n“And yet, just a few weeks ago, the United States voted for a second time to not elect its first woman president.

The space sector was also added to the list when the President-elect nominated 41-year-old Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).Isaacman is not a space scientist, an engineer or a public administrator but an entrepreneur-businessman. His connection with the space sector is that he has flown to space twice as a space tourist; is a trained jet pilot; and holds a stake in SpaceX — the firm founded by Elon Musk. His nomination — subject to congressional confirmation — has, therefore, raised eyebrows in the space industry.Musk and Isaacman are friends. The former has also been nominated to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Apart from carrying out space missions for NASA, Musk’s business interests include launching space-based Internet service globally — using a constellation of satellites under a venture called Starlink. The company’s application for providing satellite-based Internet services in India is pending with the Central Government and its clearance is subject to security approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Musk and his partner Isaacman becoming part of the Trump administration is likely to impact NASA’s policies as well as the space sector globally over the next four years.The appointments come at a critical point for the American space agency, which is planning a return to the moon. NASA conquered the Cold War-era of space race, when it successfully landed humans on the lunar surface in 1969. Post the USSR breakup, it built the International Space Station (ISS) as an international collaborative effort. With changes in technologies connected with space travel and renewed interest in lunar and inter-planetary missions, NASA has embarked on the mission to return to the moon.The first moon race was entirely led by state-funded efforts. However, in the second race, private companies are going to play a big role. After NASA shut its space shuttle programme, it funded private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin (founded by Jeff Bezos) and Boeing to develop reliable space travel systems. The agency has been hiring services from SpaceX to ferry cargo and astronauts to the ISS. For its lunar mission too, NASA must depend on private companies.For NASA’s return to the moon after five decades, both SpaceX and Blue Origin are in the race to develop lunar landers. The two companies are being funded to simultaneously develop lunar landers by NASA. If one fails or is delayed, the other can deliver on time. The total value of the contract for Blue Moon Lander is $3.4 billion up to 2029, while that with SpaceX is valued at $2.89 billion. In addition, NASA has a massive budget and awards contracts worth billions of dollars to commercial space companies for a range of projects.Isaacman at NASA’s helm and Musk being a part of the Trump administration appears to be a clear case of ‘conflict of interest.’ Isaacman — with a substantial financial stake in SpaceX —would preside over the high-stakes contracts to private companies, including SpaceX. This apart, he has been critical of NASA’s policy of parallel development of lunar landers.Musk has also publicly made fun of his close competitor, Boeing, for its problems with the Starliner spaceship that ferried Sunita Williams to the ISS but developed a snag, delaying her safe return to earth. Isaacman has also criticised NASA’s Space Launch System project as a waste of public money. As the next head of NASA, he will have to take a call on several such issues.The first race to the moon was a highlight of the Cold War rivalry between the two superpowers. They eventually saw the futility of such a race, given the inherent risks and high-capita costs involved and began cooperating for projects. The ISS is the prime example of such cooperation between Russia and America and several other nations.NASA also decided to shift some of its key tasks such as space transportation to private companies. The agency is funding private companies to develop new space technologies, thereby reducing the risks involved. Commercial players have benefited from NASA’s technical skills by hiring its former experienced scientists, engineers and astronauts.Although, the second race to the moon — NASA’s Artemis — is a state initiative, it will be largely driven by commercial space providers. This marks a global shift in the approach to space. The flight of an Indian astronaut to the ISS slated for 2025 is being projected as a by-product of Indo-US cooperation in space, but in effect, it is being executed through commercial operators and is paid for.We are going to witness such a tilt towards the private sector in other areas of space activity as well. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has also started encouraging private players to develop satellites and rockets and launch them. The government has created a Rs 1,000-crore venture capital fund to support space startups. Private engineering firms are already major suppliers to the space agency. The head of IN-SPACe — the agency that coordinates the entry of private companies in the space sector — also comes from the private sector.Space exploration is not just about human curiosity and seeking scientific knowledge. It is as much about diplomacy, geopolitics, national pride and commercial interests. It is about providing commercial and strategic services such as location, search and rescue and is an aid to military campaigns.In the long-term, it could lead to colonising the moon and exploration of resources on planets. Should this activity be pursued in a global cooperative and collaborative manner or left for competition among private companies and billionaires? Even though competition breeds innovation and faster development of technology, it comes with a set of risks and dangers.","url":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/a-new-private-race-to-the-moon/","image":"https://www.tribuneindia.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9tZWRpYTBkZTViZTEwLWI4MWMtMTFlZi1hZWU4LWI5OWQ1NjM5ZjgzOS5qcGc=","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:07:03","author":"Dinesh C.

It’s the highest share of spending on mortgages that Ireland has seen since 2007 and early 2008.\n\nFor example, for a household with a net income of €40,000, spending 33% of disposable income on mortgages repayments would equate to €13,010 per year or €1,100 per month. For a household with a net income of €65,000, it would be €21,450 per year or €1,787.50 per month.\n\nThe immediate outlook isn’t great for prospective homeowners either, with the number of homes completed in the first six months of this year lower than in the same period of 2023 (although the completion rate picked up after that).\n\nOverall, the outlook for the Irish economy for next year is good, the ESRI said as it released its latest quarterly economic commentary.\n\nHowever, policy changes proposed by incoming US president Donald Trump pose risk to Ireland’s prosperity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuous increases in house prices over the last 11 years mean that as of August 2024, Irish house prices are 13.4% higher now than they were in April 2007, before the global financial crisis.\n\nThe year-on-year growth in property prices reached as high as 10% in the months of August and September this year.\n\nA crucial measure to alleviate housing pressures is increasing the availability of supply, but expectations for new housing this year and next year are still falling short. There were 20,000 homes completed in the first nine months of the year.\n\nSeasonal patterns typically show an increase in house completions in the final three months of the year – but it’s unlikely that home completions will exceed 33,000 by the end of this month. As a result, the ESRI is maintaining its forecast that just over 33,000 units will be completed in 2024.\n\nThat is well short of the 52,000 homes needed per year to address the supply issue, according to the Central Bank.\n\nIrish economy and US influence\n\nThe State’s tax income has increased compared with 2023, even if the income from Apple losing its case at the Court of Justice of the European Union is excluded.\n\nHowever, the ESRI is cautioning that the outlook for future corporation tax receipts is uncertain in the face of the incoming US administration.\n\nDonald Trump is due to return to the White House in January after winning the US’s presidential election in November.\n\nTrump made promises during his campaign about certain policies that could affect Ireland, such as lowering the US’s corporate tax rate to 15%, which would match the rate here. This could make Ireland a less competitive location for multinational companies in the future.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nTo the politicians: 'My generation lives with a housing crisis that will last a lifetime'\n\nThe real risk of a Trump presidency to Ireland - the end of our corporate tax bonanza \n\nThe ESRI believes “aggressive US trade policy could affect decision-making in large multinationals”. It noted that Ireland’s corporation tax receipts are heavily dependent on a small number of firms and that the tech and pharmaceutical sectors are particularly vulnerable.\n\n“In these sectors, there may be a higher risk of relocation because firms with complex, globalised manufacturing processes could be liable for transatlantic tariffs more than once for a given product,” the ESRI warned.\n\nThe ESRI also noted another Trump policy could also affect Irish public finances.\n\n“The Trump campaign signalled its intention to reshore to the US profits arising from intellectual property that is located in Ireland. If this were done, it could have a significant impact on future corporation tax receipts,” the ESRI said.\n\nNevertheless, the think tank expects that GDP will fall by 1.1% in 2024 but rebound in 2025 to a growth rate of 4.5% due to higher exports and investment.\n\nModified domestic demand, which is considered to be an accurate measure of underlying Irish economic performance, is expected to grow by 3.2% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025.\n\nInflation has been falling, dropping to a year-on-year rate of 0.7% as of October, which is lower than the EU average. It’s a large drop since January, when the rate of inflation stood at 4.1%.

It says: ‘Dear Madam President of the Bundestag, in accordance with Article 68 of the Basic Law, I request a vote of confidence in me. I intend to make a statement on this before the vote on Monday, 16 December 2024.'\n\nIt was delivered to Bundestag President Bärbel Bas (SPD).\n\nIn a brief televised statement, Scholz said he wanted \"to clear the way\" for the elections and stressed that until then his government and the legislature would remain \"fully capable\" of steering the ship of state.\n\nDuring the transition period, the government is in 'caretaker mode' until a new coalition eventually takes over.\n\nREAD ALSO: How new German citizens can vote in upcoming elections\n\nAfter Scholz loses this vote, Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will have 21 days to dissolve parliament, and then elections will have to be held within 60 days. Steinmeier is expected to dissolve the Bundestag on Friday December 27th.\n\nThis is expected to lead to a fresh federal election in Germany on Sunday February 23rd next year. This date has been agreed on by mainstream parties but can be subject to change. However, Steinmeier has previously said that he considers this to be a realistic goal for the date of the next election. \n\nREAD ALSO: What happens if Germany doesn't agree on a budget for 2025?\n\nWhat's the current political mood?\n\nIt's dicey out there, as the country is stuck in political uncertainty and economic troubles. \n\nThe conservative opposition CDU/CSU, led by Friedrich Merz, has been consistently soaring ahead in polls. The bloc is polling at around 32 percent, followed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is hovering around 18 percent of the vote.\n\nThe centre-left SPD is polling at around 15 percent, and two points higher in a recent survey, but Scholz hopes to repeat his performance from 2021 elections when he made a late comeback to win the race.\n\nThe left-leaning Greens under Robert Habeck, 55, are polling at around 12 to 14 percent, making them a likely partner in the next government, even though the CSU has strongly opposed this so far.\n\nSmaller parties include the Free Democrats (FDP) of former finance minister Christian Lindner, which has been badly bruised by revelations that its leadership had carefully plotted the break-up of the coalition.\n\nOn the far left, the Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), with a nationalist, anti-immigration and Russia-friendly stance, will compete with Die Linke party which Wagenknecht split away from early this year.\n\nCampaigning has already started, centred on the flagging economy, how to support Ukraine in its war with Russia and a resurgent immigration debate amid upheaval in the Middle East.\n\nREAD ALSO: \n\nGerman chancellor proposes lowering VAT ahead of snap elections Citizenship to Bürgergeld - the laws the CDU wants to scrap if they win power\n\nBerlin's political crisis comes at a turbulent time after the French government of Michel Barnier was ousted in a no-confidence vote last week and as Donald Trump returns to the US presidency on January 20th.\n\nWith reporting by AFP","url":"https://www.thelocal.de/20241211/timeline-what-happens-next-as-german-chancellor-kicks-off-path-to-snap-elections","image":"https://apiwp.thelocal.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,width=1200,quality=75/https://apiwp.thelocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/497523749.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-12 00:05:05","author":"Rachel Loxton","authors":["Rachel Loxton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"de","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":272438846,"title":"Why Trump Soured on F.B.I.

Trump repeatedly denounced a law enforcement agency he could not control.\n\nFor years, Mr. Trump has complained that picking Mr. Wray to run the F.B.I. in 2017 was one of his worst personnel decisions as president. By the time Mr. Trump left the White House, he was eager to fire Mr. Wray, but he held back. His antipathy only heightened in the years after his presidency.\n\nIn selecting Mr. Wray, Mr. Trump believed he had found the antithesis of the F.B.I. director he had just fired, James B. Comey. The president derided Mr. Comey as a “showboat” and chafed at the F.B.I.’s investigation into his 2016 campaign and its possible ties to Russia.\n\nMr. Wray was no showboat. In his early television interviews as F.B.I. director, he often seemed uncomfortable and intent on avoiding making headlines. But the honeymoon was brief, because the F.B.I. Mr. Trump wanted was far different from the one Mr. Wray has run.","summary":"By the time Donald J. Trump left the White House, he was eager to fire Mr. Wray, but he held back.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 99.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 44,148.56. The S&P 500 added 49.28 points, or 0.82 percent, to 6,084.19.

Meanwhile, communication services and consumer discretionary led the gainers by going up 3.08 percent and 2.02 percent, respectively. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over the past 12 months, slightly higher than the 2.6 percent annual rate recorded in October and aligning with economists' expectations. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.3 percent, accelerating from the 0.2 percent rise in the prior month. Excluding volatile components like food and gas, the core CPI maintained a 3.3 percent increase year over year, consistent with the October figure, signaling steady underlying inflation pressures.
