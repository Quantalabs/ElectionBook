In her criticism against the Biden-Harris administration, she argued the administration has turned its back on Israel by withholding “critical military aid at a very important time.” “It is a disgrace, and you asked the question, Sean, is she fit to protect our national security interests and American citizens around the world?” Stefanik said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, guest-hosted by Sean Duffy. “The answer is an overwhelming no. She is not fit to serve the role as commander in chief. The fact that this is an American-Israeli citizen who lost his life on their watch, it is a disgrace, and it’s going to go down in history as one of the darkest chapters of our national security policy.” Stefanik also referenced how last week marked the three-year anniversary of the 13 service members who were killed during the United States’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, with former President Donald Trump commemorating their lives during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Monday. The New York congresswoman specifically blasted the Harris campaign for politicizing the deaths of the service members when it criticized Trump for visiting the cemetery, arguing the former president accepted an offer from the families to visit. Harris slammed Trump for his visit to the cemetery in a lengthy post on X Saturday, saying he “disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.” The Trump campaign has since released eight videos in which Gold Star families defended his actions, as well as a joint statement in which they were “appalled” by Harris’s attempt to politicize his visit. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s death,” the statement said. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) mourned the deaths of the six Israeli hostages and claimed the only way to secure the safe release of the remaining hostages is to target Iran. He referred to Iran as “the great Satan,” while the Hamas terrorist group “is the junior partner.”","summary":"Rep.

At 51, the America's Got Talent judge might be 16 years older than the Tokio Hotel guitarist, but they've been inseparable ever since meeting on the set of Germany's Next Topmodel in their native Germany back in 2018. Third wheeling it with the married couple of five years, as usual, was Tom's identical twin brother and bandmate Bill Kaulitz. Heidi - who boasts 24.6M social media followers - captioned her celebratory Instagram post of the touring siblings: 'Loves of my life! 35 years young. Happy birthday!' The Kaulitz brothers (born Kaulitz-Trümper) have been filming the second season of their Netflix docuseries Kaulitz & Kaulitz, and they'll next bring their band to the Super Bloom Festival in München, Germany this Saturday. Heidi Klum left the comfort of her $9.875M Bel-Air mansion to fly all the way to Switzerland to celebrate the 35th birthday of her third husband Tom Kaultiz at Lake Zurich on Sunday The Home rocker is stepfather to Klum's four children - daughter Lou, 14; son Henry, nearly 19; son Johan, 17; and daughter Leni, 20 - with ex-husband #2 Seal and ex-boyfriend Flavio Briatore. 'The sweetest thing that my partner has done for me is that he asked my kids first if he could ask for my hand, so he kind of was in cahoots with my kids,' the Emmy-winning host recalled to People on August 14. 'They figured out how they were going to do it and then they all surprised me on Christmas morning six years ago. I thought that was so nice that he involved my kids.' Tom ended his year-long marriage with first wife Ria Sommerfeld in 2016, and Heidi ended her five-year marriage to ex-husband #1 Ric Pipino in 2002. Last Monday, Klum gave her fans 'a clue of what's to come on October 31' for her next elaborate Halloween costume in the form a of a bloodshot glass eye. The self-proclaimed 'Queen of Halloween' collaborates with Oscar-nominated make-up artist Mike Marino and his Prosthetic Renaissance team on what to wear at her annual ball in Manhattan. 'I start thinking about it on November 1. I usually have two or three ideas that I'm playing with and then I decide on one thing,' Heidi told DailyMail.com back in 2019. 'So the next morning, I start thinking, \"Maybe next year, I'm going to do that one that I didn't do this year.\" And then, obviously, throughout the year new ideas pop up because maybe I've seen a new or old movie, or was inspired by my travels.'

In a contentious exchange on Meet the Press Sunday, Kristen Welker pressed Cotton on whether or not Trump broke the law by making campaign content out of the pictures and videos taken there. Trump attended a wreath-laying ceremony honoring 13 service members who died withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2021. One of the soldiers, Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover, is buried in Section 60. Trump posed for photos with the Hoover family at his grave. Trump’s spokespeople have denied any wrongdoing, claiming they were given permission to film ahead of the visit. Cemetery and defense officials have denied this. Further adding to the chaos, a scuffle allegedly occurred between a member of the cemetery staff and Trump campaign staffers when the cemetery worker tried to stop Trump’s entourage from taking photos. In a statement earlier this week, the Trump campaign also denied the physical altercation took place. “13 brave Americans were killed in Afghanistan three years ago because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's failure to plan for a withdrawal,” Cotton wrote in response last week on X. “Good for President Trump to honor the service and sacrifice of those fallen heroes and their loved ones.” “The scandal is not that Pres. Trump honored 13 brave Americans killed in Afghanistan,” he wrote in a later post. “The scandal is Biden and Kamala sent those heroes into a needlessly dangerous situation.” Doubling down on his comments Sunday on Fox News, Cotton told Welker: “He didn’t take campaign photos there. These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s incompetence, invited him to the cemetery…They wanted President Trump there. They wanted to take those photos,” Cotton said. Welker then brought up Master Sergeant Andrew Marckesano, a fallen solider whose gravestone was visible in photos Trump took with the Hoovers. Following the controversy, Marckesano’s sister asked that the soldiers buried at Section 60 “are honored and respected accordingly.” When asked if the Marckesano’s wishes were honored, Cotton said: “No, Kristen, they honored the wishes of the 13 families whose children died at Abbey Gate. Those families wanted the photos. They told me yesterday that they specifically asked President Trump for the photos. Obviously, headstones at Arlington are close to each other. When you take a photo of your loved one then other headstones are going to be present as well.” Coincidentally, Cotton has a special tie to the sacred site. It’s where he served for 16 months in The Old Guard. Soldiers assigned to The Old Guard guard the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, another holy site in the cemetery, among other duties. In his 2019 book Sacred Duty, Cotton details his time at Arlington and gives his thoughts on conduct while visiting. “Although a sign welcomes visitors to ‘our nation’s most sacred shrine,’ no rules are posted. Yet visitors somehow understand a proper code of conduct,” Cotton wrote. Ironically, his tune has changed as he went to bat for the former president.","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/GettySenator Tom Cotton (R-AR) is defending Donald Trump’s decision to take photos with military families in a restricted area of Arlington National Cemetery called Section 60 yet again.\n\nIn a contentious exchange on Meet the Press Sunday, Kristen Welker pressed Cotton on whether or not Trump broke the law by making campaign content out of the pictures and videos taken there.\n\nTrump attended a wreath-laying ceremony honoring 13 service members who died withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2021.

This is the first time this term there have been two successive ties in Newspoll. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (steady), 12% Greens (steady), 7% One Nation (up one) and 11% for all Others (steady). Anthony Albanese’s net approval slumped five points to -13, with 54% dissatisfied (up three) and 41% satisfied (down two). This is Albanese’s worst net approval in Newspoll since November 2023, after the failure of the Voice referendum. The graph below shows Albanese’s net approval in Newspoll this term. The plus signs are Newspoll results and a smoothed line has been fitted. Peter Dutton’s net approval was down three points to -13, and this is the first time Albanese and Dutton have been equal on net approval in Newspoll since November 2023. Albanese led Dutton by 45–37 as better PM (46–39 previously). When asked about inflation if Dutton and the Coalition were in government, 24% said inflation would be lower than it is now, 18% higher, 41% about the same and 17% were undecided. While the government has had other problems in the past few weeks, I believe inflation is still its main problem with voters. Last week’s Morgan consumer confidence reading of 82.6 was the highest six-week average since February, but consumer confidence has been below 85 for a record 82 successive weeks. YouGov poll tied at 50–50 A national YouGov poll, conducted August 23–28 from a sample of 1,543, had a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the mid-July YouGov poll. Primary votes were 37% Coalition (down one), 32% Labor (up one), 13% Greens (steady), 8% One Nation (up one) and 10% for all Others (down one). It’s strange that the two-party vote improved for the Coalition despite the drop in the Coalition’s primary vote and gain for Labor. Rounding probably explains this. Albanese’s net approval was down one point to -11, with 52% dissatisfied and 41% satisfied. Dutton’s net approval was also down one to -5. Albanese led Dutton by 43–38 as preferred PM (45–37 in July). In a forced choice question, 67% of Australian voters would vote for Democrat Kamala Harris for US president, while 33% would vote for Republican Donald Trump. The only group voting for Trump was One Nation voters (80–20 for Trump). Essential poll: Labor gains to lead by 48–46 A national Essential poll, conducted August 21–25 from a sample of 1,129, gave Labor a 48–46 lead including undecided, after a 47–47 tie in the early August Essential poll. Primary votes were 33% Coalition (down one), 29% Labor (up one), 13% Greens (down one), 7% One Nation (steady), 1% UAP (steady), 11% for all Others (up two) and 6% undecided (steady). Despite Labor’s improvement on voting intentions, Albanese’s net approval dropped seven points since late July to -10, with 50% disapproving and 40% approving. This is Albanese’s worst rating in Essential this term. Dutton’s net approval was steady at +1. By 44–30, voters supported Dutton’s call to pause arrivals of Palestinian refugees. There was a 42–42 tie on whether immigration to Australia is generally positive or negative (46–34 positive in November 2023). While voters were narrowly positive on immigration’s impact on the economy (42–41), they were negative on its impact on jobs (51–35), the environment (43–24) and strongly negative on house prices (69–15). On the government’s response to the Israel-Gaza war, 32% said it was too supportive of Israel, 16% too harsh on Israel and 52% were satisfied. These figures are unchanged from June. On Israel’s military action in Gaza, 39% (up one since June) said Israel should permanently withdraw, 21% (steady) agree to a temporary ceasefire and 17% (up two) said Israel’s military action was justified. Redbridge and Morgan polls A national Redbridge poll, conducted from a sample of 2,000, gave Labor a 50.5–49.5 lead, a two-point gain for Labor since the mid-July Redbridge poll. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (down three) and 33% Labor (up one). No other primary votes or fieldwork dates have been released yet. A national Morgan poll, conducted August 19–25 from a sample of 1,701, gave the Coalition a 50.5–49.5 lead, a one-point gain for the Coalition since the August 12–18 Morgan poll. Primary votes were 39.5% Coalition (up one), 29.5% Labor (down one), 13% Greens (down 0.5), 4% One Nation (steady), 9% independents (up 0.5) and 5% others (steady). The headline figure is based on respondent preferences. By 2022 election preferences flows, there was a 50–50 tie, a one-point gain for the Coalition. EMRS Tasmanian poll: little change since May An EMRS Tasmanian state poll, conducted August 14–21 from a sample of 1,000, gave the Liberals 36% of the vote (up one since May), Labor 27% (down one), the Greens 14% (down one), the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) 8% (up one), independents 14% (steady) and others 3% (steady). Liberal incumbent Jeremy Rockliff held a 45–30 lead over Labor’s Dean Winter as preferred premier (40–32 in May). At the March state election, three JLN MPs were elected, but analyst Kevin Bonham reported on August 25 that two of these MPs had been expelled by the party. So the current standings of the Tasmanian lower house are 14 Liberals out of 35, ten Labor, five Greens, five independents and one JLN. The Liberals need four of the six crossbenchers to pass legislation opposed by Labor and the Greens. The EMRS poll was done before the JLN blew up. NT likely election result For the August 24 Northern Territory election, the ABC is giving the Country Liberal Party (CLP) 17 of the 25 seats, Labor four, independents three and one seat (Nightcliff) is undecided, but Labor is expected to beat the Greens after distribution of preferences. The Greens were initially seen as likely to beat the CLP in Fannie Bay on Labor preferences, but the flow of Labor preferences to the Greens was weaker than expected, and the CLP will gain Fannie Bay from Labor.","summary":"The two-party preferred vote is tied again in Newspoll, but the prime minister’s net approval continues to slide.","url":"https://theconversation.com/newspoll-remains-tied-at-50-50-but-albaneses-net-approval-slumps-237549","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/616604/original/file-20240901-18-s588vm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=24%2C30%2C4052%2C2023&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 23:20:40","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":255413712,"title":"Ketanji Brown Jackson 'Prepared' for Election to Go Before Supreme Court","text":"In an interview on CBS News Sunday Morning, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she is \"prepared\" for the 2024 presidential election to go before the Supreme Court.As part of the 10-minute interview with CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell, Jackson, at first, jokingly replied to a question about being prepared for that scenario as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris seem to be headed for a closely contested November election.\"Are you prepared that this election could end up in front of the Supreme Court?\" O'Donnell asked.\"As prepared as anyone can be,\" Jackson said with a laugh before asking O'Donnell, \"Are you prepared for all of the news cycles that you are getting as a result of this election?\"O'Donnell responded \"no\" as Jackson quipped \"no, exactly,\" as the two continued to laugh.Then, Jackson said, stoically, \"There are legal issues that arise out of the political process. So, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary.\"Newsweek has emailed the Trump and Harris campaigns Sunday night for comment.In the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush, a Republican, was ultimately declared the winner over former Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, after the race came down to about 500 votes in Florida. Although Gore wanted to push forward with recounts, the Supreme Court, which was controlled by conservative justices at the time, ruled that vote counting standards in Florida were not consistent and halted a recount ordered by Florida's Supreme Court.Conservative Supreme Court justices currently outnumber their liberal cohorts, 6-3. Three of the conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, were appointed by Trump during his first presidential term. Jackson, appointed by President Joe Biden, is among the liberal justices.But that ideological breakdown doesn't necessarily predict future decisions.In recent rulings, Barrett has slowly inched closer to the middle, battling Chief Justice John Roberts to be the court's ideological center. Last week, she sided with liberal justices in an Arizona voting rights case.In the interview with O'Donnell, Jackson openly expressed \"concern\" about the Court's recent presidential immunity ruling.In a decision handed down on July 1, the Supreme Court ruled that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution of alleged crimes that take place while performing certain official acts, siding partially with Trump in his quest to quash all of his recent legal troubles.Jackson and her two fellow liberals, Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan, dissented from the decision, while all six conservative justices voted in favor. In Sunday's interview, Jackson said she felt that the decision gave Trump unwarranted special treatment in criminal matters.\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" Jackson said.In her written dissent of the immunity decision, Jackson warned that presidents could be \"exempt from legal liability for murder, assault, theft, fraud, or any other reprehensible and outlawed criminal act,\" as long as they claimed their actions were \"official acts.\"\"Stated simply: The Court has now declared for the first time in history that the most powerful official in the United States can (under circumstances yet to be fully determined) become a law unto himself,\" Jackson wrote. \"For my part, I simply cannot abide the majority's senseless discarding of a model of accountability for criminal acts that treats every citizen of this country as being equally subject to the law—as the Rule of Law requires,\" she added.On Tuesday, Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith filed a revised indictment against Trump in his federal election interference case.Trump currently faces four federal charges in the case into his alleged attempts to thwart the 2020 election results, which the former president has claimed was stolen from him via widespread voter fraud despite a lack of substantial evidence.The charges include conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, attempting to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and alleges the case is politically motivated.In addition, Trump was indicted in Georgia for alleged election fraud.In August 2023, Fani Willis, district attorney for Fulton County, Georgia, which covers most of Atlanta, indicted Trump and 18 of his allies for alleged fraud in the state involving the 2020 presidential election. All of the accused pleaded not guilty, but at least four are now cooperating with authorities.In a new court filing on Monday, Trump attorney Steven Sadow argued that Willis' election interference case against the former president should be dismissed in part because he believes Willis has been prejudiced against Trump.","summary":"Ketanji Brown Jackson said in an interview that aired Sunday, \"There are legal issues that arise out of the political process.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ketanji-brown-jackson-2024-election-trump-harris-supreme-court-1947306","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462157/brown-jackson-alabama.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 23:14:18","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":255413460,"title":"Sir Ian McKellen makes announcement on future after stage fall","text":"Sir Ian McKellen says he is looking to \"take the rest of the year off\" from acting following a fall on stage.

For much of the campaign, that effort to energize voters has favored Republicans, but new research from polling and data firm TargetSmart shows that Harris and newly energized Democrats have finally flipped the script on the MAGA movement. In a thread posted on X (formerly Twitter), TargetSmart Senior Advisor Tom Bonier shared the group’s stunning findings: In the more than a dozen states that have updated their voter files since late last month, Democrats have made record gains among every major voter group, blowing Republicans out of the water in the process. Black women ages 18 to 29 led the way, with a 175.8% increase in voter registrations compared with the same time period in 2020. Hispanic voters have also rushed to register since Harris became the Democratic nominee, with young Hispanic women posting a stunning 149.7% increase in registrations, and Hispanic voter registrations overall jumping over 60%. Women weren’t the only ones flocking to register. Registrations among Black voters leapt 85.8% over their 2020 numbers, while Asian Americans saw a 31.7% gain. Democrats as a whole saw a 51.2% increase in total registrations, compared with just 7% for Republicans. Those are game-changing numbers not just for Harris but also for Democrats up and down the ballot, and according to Bonier, those voters are also displaying higher enthusiasm than they did when Biden beat Trump four years ago. “You just don’t see that sort of thing happen in elections normally,” Bonider told CBS News on Wednesday, adding that the data indicated voters are “fired up and want to participate in this election.” The numbers back up Bonier’s confidence. A Gallup survey released this week found that 78% of Democratic-leaning voters say they are more enthusiastic than usual to vote. That nearly matches the record-high numbers recorded in 2008, when then-Sen. Barack Obama rode a wave of voter energy into the White House. By comparison, just 6 in 10 Republicans say they are more enthusiastic than usual—a lower number than around this point in 2020. Those numbers represent more than just a “fired up” voter base. The most recent benchmark for surging Democratic turnout came in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right to abortion, when record numbers of first-time voters cast ballots. According to Bonier, what he calls the “Harris Effect” has now surpassed even those monumental 2022 numbers—and they aren’t slowing down. That’s a huge shift from where the Democratic Party was just six weeks ago. It’s no secret that President Joe Biden was struggling to engage Democrats’ core constituencies. Democratic insiders openly fretted about a round of June polling that showed Biden losing large numbers of young voters, Black Americans, and Hispanic voters to Trump—and with it, key swing states like Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The evidence is mounting that Harris’ dynamic campaign has not only reenergized those skeptical groups but also spiked interest and enthusiasm in the race in ways Republicans are struggling to counter-message. Once written off as Trump pickups, Sun Belt states such as Arizona and Nevada are now back in play. But there’s more: A new Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll published Thursday finds Harris leading or tied with Trump in all seven critical swing states. “When you’re seeing some of the swings in these polls we’ve seen over the last few weeks, a lot of that is actually … turnout voters who are persuadable,” Bonier told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The great position the Harris position finds itself in is that they don’t have to pick one path” to beating Trump in the Electoral College, Bonier added. Meanwhile, Trump’s road to the White House has narrowed considerably as Republicans find themselves spending money in once safe states, including North Carolina and Georgia. Now comes the challenging part: turning out those newly registered voters. In 2008, the Obama campaign focused millions of dollars on contacting new voters and building the infrastructure to ensure those voters made it to the polls on Election Day. Harris is now flush with over $540 million in fundraising in just over a month of campaigning. She certainly has the financial resources to build a larger voter mobilization operation than Obama, but she has only two months in which to actually get that nationwide network running. There’s little doubt that Biden’s decision to step down and endorse Harris was the catalyst for Democrats’ massive gains in recent voter registration. By listening to what voters wanted, Harris and Democrats reengaged millions of disaffected voters while registering many who had never before cast a ballot. After almost a year of certainty in their own victory, Republicans have failed to generate anything close to that level of engagement or voter mobilization. Harris will have her biggest opportunity yet to sell those voters on her vision for America when she and Trump debate on Sept. 10. She’ll be speaking to a national audience of voters who are engaged and optimistic. Bringing those voters out to the polls in November could mean the difference between a vibrant democracy and a dark future of MAGA authoritarianism.","summary":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have both framed the 2024 election as a race to maximize voter turnout.

The conservative group’s “Joyful Warriors” summit, which organizers billed as “the ultimate gathering of parents fighting to defend their parental rights and improve education in America,” drew around 600 attendees over its four days of programming, according to The Atlantic. Many “stood in awe” of the grotesque, psuedo-satirical painting, the magazine reported. It portrayed the vice president—and Democratic nominee for president— kneeling over the bird’s bloodied corpse, gore all over her hands and mouth, a communist symbol stamped onto her jacket. Sitting on a stool in a corner in a dunce cap was President Joe Biden, an oversized knife in his back. Presumably to hammer home the apocalyptic overtones, a nuclear mushroom cloud blooms in the background. A label underneath, per photos posted on social media, identified the work as titled “We Did It Joe” and its creator as Scott LoBaido. Once characterized by The New York Times as “Staten Island’s most celebrated artist-provocateur,” LoBaido is a notorious MAGA activist-slash-creative known for his dozens of iterations of the American flag on canvas, as well as for occasional bouts of pro-Trump performance art. He has gifted the former president a number of his pieces, including most recently in July, when he presented Donald Trump with his rendering of the aftermath of his assassination attempt. Earlier this week, LoBaido began hyping up his latest work on social media, announcing that it would be unveiled on Friday in D.C. In a video filmed on the road to the capital, LoBaido boasted to his audience that he was going to have to “apologize to Leonardo da Vinci in advance” of the unveiling. “This painting, appropriately titled “We Did It Joe,” is going to be the next painting, for the next 500 years, that everybody’s going to know about,” he said. “They might not forget about the Mona Lisa, but she’s going to be in the back seat. It’s the way it is.” In another video the next day, LoBaido pulled a blue cloth off of the painting in front of the U.S. Capitol, promising that it would “change the course of history.” It was not clear if the original painting is for sale. (Signed 12-inch-by-16-inch poster prints, however, retail on his website for $59.) Neither LoBaido nor a representative for Moms for Liberty immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday afternoon. Moms for Liberty has around 130,000 members around the country. Its summit featured panels on abolishing the Department of Education and pamphlets on child sex trafficking, and was headlined by the right-wing comedian Rob Schneider and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Still, proceedings crescendoed with a Friday night appearance by former president Donald Trump, who dropped in for what The Guardian called a “long, zigzagging and at times incoherent” conversation with the organization’s co-founder Tiffany Justice. They drifted from subject to subject, discussing everything from Ivanka Trump’s clothing line to The Apprentice to Trump’s recent stop at Arlington National Cemetery. One topic left unaddressed: Raw eagle entrails. A notoriously incurious gourmand, the former president likely wouldn’t leap at the chance to sample fresh meat with the gusto of LoBaido’s Harris. But if they were served well-done with ketchup? Perhaps.","summary":"Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersA painting depicting a laughing Kamala Harris tearing into the bloody guts of a dead bald eagle was front and center at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty in the basement of a Washington, D.C. hotel this weekend, eliciting delight from attendees—and bemused side-eyes from online observers.\n\nThe conservative group’s “Joyful Warriors” summit, which organizers billed as “the ultimate gathering of parents fighting to defend their parental rights and improve education in America,” drew around 600 attendees over its four days of programming, according to The Atlantic. \n\nMany “stood in awe” of the grotesque, psuedo-satirical painting, the magazine reported.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-artist-scott-lobaido-debuts-deranged-painting-of-kamala-harris-devouring-bald-eagle","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3264,w_5803,x_0,y_253/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1725226372/2024-08-31T023218Z_803074756_RC2MQ9AS4SI5_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP_axakti","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:53:55","author":"Aj McDougall","authors":["Aj McDougall"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":255413756,"title":"Telluride: Hillary Clinton Talks ‘Handmaid’s Tale’-Style Abortion Policy at Doc Premiere","text":"Hillary Clinton encouraged a film festival audience in Telluride, Colorado, to “get back to a time when your government is not determining what your choices for your family would be, which is just so Handmaid’s Tale.” Clinton was in Telluride on Saturday for the premiere of Zurawski v Texas, a documentary she produced about a group of women who sued the state of Texas in 2023 after they were denied abortions when their health was at risk. The film, which was directed by Maisie Crow and Abbie Perrault and is seeking distribution, screened to a sold-out and often sobbing audience at the festival’s 650-seat Palm Theater. Zurawski v Texas is one of a number of politically topical films at the festival, including Ali Abbasi’s The Apprentice, in which Sebastian Stan plays a young Donald Trump (Briarcliff Entertainment); Matt Tyrnauer’s Carville: Winning Is Everything, Stupid! about Democratic strategist James Carville, which was acquired by CNN Films while at Telluride; and Errol Morris’s Separated, about the Trump administration’s family-separation policy at the U.S. border, which is looking for a buyer. “I don’t think we can underestimate how important this film is in order to break through the eye-rolling, the denial, the dismissiveness, the cruelty that has affected so many women’s lives in our country today,” Clinton said at the Zurawski v Texas post-screening Q&A, which this reporter moderated. Three of the Texas plaintiffs whose stories appear in the movie — Amanda Zurawski, Samantha Casiano and Austin Dennard — appeared at the premiere alongside the filmmakers, as did Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, and Chelsea Clinton. The Clintons backed Zurawski v Texas through HiddenLight, the production company they co-founded together with Sam Branson. HiddenLight won an Emmy last year for In Her Hands, a documentary about a female mayor in Afghanistan. The company is also backing a film on efforts by George and Amal Clooney’s foundation to investigate Russian war crimes in Ukraine. “We merged all of our ideas, hopes, frustrations and rage into HiddenLight to try to help platform people telling stories that we think urgently need to be told and yet are left in the shadows because the subject matter is uncomfortable for people,” Chelsea said at the Q&A. “We think we’re in a moment where we actually need to be uncomfortable. And so when we learned that Maisie and Abbie were working on this film we said, ‘What can we do? How can we help?'” Other producers of the film include Jennifer Lawrence’s Excellent Cadaver, Story Force Entertainment and Bumble Inc. The Texas abortion ban the Zurawski case challenged was triggered by the 2022 Supreme Court decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health that overturned Roe v. Wade. Asked whether she was surprised by the Dobbs decision, the former secretary of state said, “No, I was not. I had watched in a very concerned way, the steady, relentless attack on women’s reproductive health, and in particular on Roe v. Wade for years, and often said that if we’re not careful, there will be a Supreme Court that is literally designed to reverse Roe v. Wade… It was terribly distressing and disappointing but not surprising.” The conversation was a mix of talk about filmmaking, healthcare and politics in the post-Roe era, with the plaintiffs sharing some of the most personal moments about their lives, as they had in a Texas courtroom. “I wanted to be anonymous at first, and then I gave birth to my daughter, and I saw her eyes bleed,” Casiano said, explaining her decision to allow the filmmakers’ cameras at the funeral of her baby, Halo, who lived for only four hours. Casiano had learned at her 20-week scan that her baby had anencephaly and would not survive. Since she lacked the resources to travel out of Texas for an abortion, she continued the pregnancy. “From then on, I knew there was no way I could just go on without letting others know that this is reality, and this is what’s happening right now to women.” Duane, the attorney on the case, emerges as a key character in the film, preparing for court and mothering her own young children. “Part of this lawsuit was telling these stories to as big of an audience as possible,” Duane said, explaining why she was participating in the documentary. “We wanted people to stop pretending like [these women] didn’t exist.” Ten states, including Colorado, will have abortion measures on the ballot in November. Clinton said that she hoped that voters would demonstrate, “they are not in favor of what we have seen in this film.”","summary":"Hillary Clinton encouraged a film festival audience in Telluride, Colorado, to &#8220;get back to a time when your government is not determining what your choices for your family would be, which is just so Handmaid&#8217;s Tale.&#8221; Clinton was in Telluride on Saturday for the premiere of Zurawski v Texas, a documentary she produced about a [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/hillary-clinton-abortion-documentary-zurawski-v-texas-1235988766/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hillary-Clinton-Telluride-Film-Festival-Getty-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:46:24","author":"Rebecca Keegan","authors":["Rebecca Keegan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":255412076,"title":"Trump slams Harris, Biden over hostage deaths in Gaza: ‘They have blood on their hands!’","text":"Donald Trump on Sunday slammed President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris for the recent deaths of six Hamas hostages, blaming the horrific loss on the Dem pair’s “poor” leadership. After the Israeli military confirmed the deaths of US-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five others in Gaza on Saturday, Trump took to Truth Social to criticize his political rivals, claiming that he could have secured the safety of the hostages if he were still president. “Make no mistake – This happened because Comrade Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden are poor Leaders,” the GOP presidential candidate wrote. “They have blood on their hands!” he added. “…Our Country and our amazing people are not safe under Joe Biden, and will be less safe under Kamala Harris. “This terror would have never happened if I were President, and it will stop the day I am back in the Oval Office. America will be Strong Again, and that will make the World Safe and Secure!” Trump’s post came after the president and vice president spoke with Goldberg-Polin’s parents, with Harris tweeting about her phone call with the heartbroken mom and dad alongside her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish. “Doug and I just spoke to Jon and Rachel, Hersh Goldberg-Polin’s parents, to express our condolences following the brutal murder of their son by Hamas terrorists,” Harris said, who is facing Trump in November. “My heart breaks for their pain and anguish. “I told them: As they mourn this terrible loss, they are not alone,” she added. “Our nation mourns with them.” The bodies of the dead hostages were found in Rafah, the southern Gaza hub where the Harris-Biden administration had repeatedly pushed for Israel to avoid direct action, with President Biden previously saying it would cross a “red line.” Biden also slammed Hamas over the recent deaths of the hostages, who the Israeli health ministry confirmed were killed by short-range shots two to three days before their bodies were found. “I am devastated and outraged,” Biden said in a statement. “Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes.” Along with Golderg-Polin, 23, the victims whose bodies were recovered Saturday were identified as Ori Danino, 25; Eden Yerushalmi, 24; Almog Sarusi, 27; Alexander Lobanov, 33, and Carmel Gat, 40.","summary":"Donald Trump on Sunday slammed President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris for the recent deaths of six Hamas hostages, blaming the horrific loss on the Dem pair's \"poor\" leadership.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/world-news/trump-slams-harris-biden-over-hostage-deaths-in-gaza-they-have-blood-on-their-hands/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/republican-presidential-nominee-former-president-88760729.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:25:12","author":"Ronny Reyes","authors":["Ronny Reyes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":255411902,"title":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Lashes Out at 'Predatory' Jill Stein","text":"In an Instagram story posted on Sunday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, blasted Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \"predatory\" due to her multiple runs for the White House while struggling to grow the third party at the grassroots level.In 2016, Stein played kingmaker in several key battleground states. Her vote total was higher than Donald Trump's margin of victory in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan—prompting intense backlash from Democrats and political pundits. Not only was Stein widely condemned as a spoiler, but former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the Democratic nominee during the 2016 election, later accused her of being a \"Russian asset.\"Ocasio-Cortez accused Stein and the Green Party, which reached its current party status in 2001, for only putting its emphasis on presidential elections. To date, no Green Party candidate has ever held a federal office and only a handful have been elected as state legislators.Ocasio-Cortez, responding to a question from an Instagram follower about Jill Stein's candidacy, said that \"this is a little spicy, but I have thoughts.\"\"If you run for years in a row, and your party has not grown, has not added city council seats, down ballot seats and state electives, that's bad leadership. And that to me is what's upsetting,\" the congresswoman said about Stein.Stein will be on the ballot in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and West Virginia, according to Ballotpedia's most-recent update.She will also be on the ballot in Montana, Utah, Nevada, Alaska, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Maine, Maryland and Missouri, Stein's campaign manager Jason Call previously told Newsweek.Meanwhile, the Green Party is on the ballot in Mississippi, South Carolina and Hawaii.The reason for why Stein is on the ballot in some states and the Green Party is on in others is because of ballot access procedures.On its website, the Green Party states that \"at least 144 [party members] hold elected office in 20 states across the United States as of February 15, 2024.\" The list includes Green Party members of local school, zoning and tax boards, as well as several city council members.The New York Democrat said that Stein had been the Green Party's candidate for 12 years in a row. However, Howie Hawkins ran as the party's nominee in 2020.\"If you have been your party's nominee for 12 years in a row, and you cannot grow your movement, pretty much at all, and can't peruse any successful strategy...and all you do is show up every four years to speak to people who are justifiably pissed off, you're not serious. To me, it does not read as authentic, it reads as predatory. I'm sorry, I'm just saying it,\" Ocasio-Cortez said in her Instagram story.She also asserted that she's not against third parties, overall, and that she has and will continue to endorse some third-party candidates, even against Democrats.\"What I have a problem with is, if you're running for president, you are the DeFacto leader of your party. I've been on record with criticisms of the two-party system. This is not about that,\" the congresswoman added.Newsweek has emailed the Stein campaign and Ocasio-Cortez's office Sunday afternoon for comment.The Democratic Party has gone through considerable legal efforts to challenge third parties from appearing on ballots.Before independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump, Democratic-funded lawsuits had successfully removed him from the ballot in New York and had tried and failed to remove him in North Carolina and New Jersey.On Monday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court rejected an attempt by Democratic National Committee (DNC) official David Strange to knock Stein off the state's ballot this year.Strange said that the Green Party should not be allowed to nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because it does not have any state officeholders or legislative candidates to nominate these presidential electors. However, the court ruled that \"the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks.\"Michael White, co-chair of the Wisconsin Green Party, said the complaint was a \"mark of fear by the Democratic Party.\"In her 2017 book, What Happened, Clinton wrote: \"So in each state, there were more than enough Stein voters to swing the result.\"Nationally, Stein received 1 percent of the vote in 2016, just under 1.5 million votes. In the 2020 election between Trump and Joe Biden, the Green Party's candidate, Hawkins, only received 0.2 percent of the popular vote.When asked recently by Newsweek if she feared a similar backlash after Trump's 2016 victory when Clinton and many in the Democratic Party blamed her for taking crucial votes in several battleground states, Stein said those \"smear or fear campaigns by the parties of Wall Street have never stopped.\"\"The exit polls showed the vast majority of our votes in 2016 were non-voters,\" Stein said, stating it is nonsense to claim her party took votes away from Clinton. \"That campaign has never stopped and doesn't influence my thinking. My thinking is on the climate catastrophe, economic hardships and stopping endless wars.\"In addition to Stein, Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris could also lose votes in key states to Cornel West, the \"Justice for All Party\" presidential candidate.According to the Associated Press, a cohort of Republican strategists, attorneys, and supporters nationwide are striving to influence the upcoming November elections in a manner that potentially benefits Trump. Their objective is to bolster third-party candidates like West who present liberal voters with a different option that might divert support from Harris.The funding source for this initiative remains ambiguous, but it holds substantial potential to alter outcomes in states that saw extremely narrow margins in the 2020 election won by Biden.West's campaign has encouraged the effort. Last month, the academic told the AP that \"American politics is highly gangster-like activity\" and he \"just wanted to get on that ballot.\"Trump has offered praise for West, calling him \"one of my favorite candidates.\" Of Stein, the former president favors her for the same reason.\"I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100 percent from them. He takes 100 percent,\" Trump has said.","summary":"In an Instagram story on Sunday, the New York congresswoman accused Stein and the Green Party for only putting its emphasis on presidential elections.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-blasts-predatory-jill-stein-green-party-2024-election-1947286","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462137/aoc-jill-stein.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:17:30","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":255411612,"title":"From Donald Trump’s bizarre Drake boogie to ‘Rishi Sunak’ raving with Wayne Lineker, politicians’ cringiest dance moves","text":"ANGELA RAVER, sorry Rayner, has come in for some stick after a video surfaced of her dodgy dance moves in Ibiza.

Pearsall was shot when a 17-year-old attempted to rob him of his Rolex using a gun and the rookie fought back, leading to multiple shots going off one of which struck him in the chest. “Glad to hear Ricky is stable,” he had written early, which set off a barrage of negative reactions. Social media users appeared to take the post as an opportunity to attack Pepper over his political persuasion and another person used it as a chance to criticize the pick. “Why? Never liked the draft pick anyway who cares,” one social media user callously wrote in response. “Are you still [a] liberal piece of s–t?” another person replied, according to the Daily Mail. Pepper appears to have changed his settings on the social media platform so that only people mentioned in the post are able to reply. The long-snapper has previously been outspoken about politics on social media, including criticizing the National Association of Black Journalists over hosting a conversation with former president Donald Trump and comments made by popular ESPN host, Pat McAfee. Pepper played 17 games for the 49ers last season and has been a member of the team for the past four seasons. Pearsall was released from the hospital a day after he had been shot on a San Francisco street. “He and his family, along with the entire San Francisco 49ers organization, would like to thank the San Francisco Police Department, emergency medical services, doctors and staff at San Francisco General Hospital,” the 49ers said as part of a statement after the incident.","summary":"Long-snapper Taybor Pepper was shocked and dismayed that he was attacked on social media over the weekend after posting a comment expressing relief that Ricky Pearsall was OK following an attempted robbery attempt on the 49ers rookie.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/sports/49ers-long-snapper-gets-hateful-responses-to-ricky-pearsall-post-after-shooting/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-d1ds1188j-1725226555695.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725212191&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 22:04:09","author":"Christian Arnold","authors":["Christian Arnold"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.182},{"id":255412026,"title":"Richard Gere, 75, looks dapper as he joins son Homer, 24, and glamorous wife Alejandra Silva, 41, at amfAR Gala during Venice Film Festival","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 1st 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Brad Pitt, 60, goes public with glamorous girlfriend Ines de Ramon, 34, at the 81st Venice Film Festival premiere of Wolfs as he brushes off his bitter divorce from Angelina Jolie during red carpet love-in with old friends George and Amal Clooney Germany's AFD wins landmark victory in regional elections - the first triumph for the Right in the country since WWII - with rival parties vowing to form coalitions to keep them from power Just like the Duke of Windsor in 1970, I fear Prince Harry will find the royal door is slammed shut despite rehabilitation attempts, writes CHRISTOPHER WILSON British engineer on doomed Mike Lynch superyacht insists to police all 'doors and hatches were closed' before waterspout sank the £30m vessel off the Sicily coast - as prosecutors continue to probe tragedy that killed seven Dr Max Pemberton: Banning smoking in pub gardens WON'T save the NHS DEAR JANE: I set up a nanny-cam and caught the babysitter doing something horrifying in my bedroom Top dementia expert reveals the two popular diets that really can stop Alzheimer's before it strikes, according to science McFly star Tom Fletcher reveals he 'cried' with relief after Stephen Fry documentary helped him realise he had bipolar disorder following years of uncertainty Lorraine Kelly is a gran!

The rematch election battle between first-term Republican Anthony D’Esposito and Democrat Laura Gillen is an opportunity for Dems to get their mojo back on the island after getting trounced in three election cycles — while the GOP is looking for a victory that would prove the area is becoming reliably red. Democrats — who took some bruising in the area in recent years due to backlash over the state legislature’s liberal criminal justice reforms — are hoping this go-round that Gillen can unseat D’Esposito in the 4th district just two years after he beat her by more than 10,000 votes. In the rematch D’Esposito is up by 6 percentage points, leading 48% to 42% in the district, which borders New York City, according to an internal campaign poll conducted by McLaughlin Associates in mid-August. “Laura Gillen has been rejected twice. She will be rejected a third time,” D’Esposito said of his opponent, who lost her own re-election bid in 2019 after she was the first Democrat to hold the seat in a century. Gillen said she’s campaigning as an “independent,” pro-safety Democrat who condemned a state law that blocked judges from setting cash bail for numerous crimes. She also said she backs tougher border security. “We need to seal our border. [D’Esposito] failed to get this done,” she said. The congressman said he supports policies to deport migrants who entered the country illegally, especially those committing crimes — and he bashed Gillen for her support for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris who he called “the two people who created the disaster at the border.” Gillen is following a similar playbook as some other Democrats in this year’s elections, saying she’ll protect abortion rights in the first election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. She has criticized her opponent for allegedly shifting on the issue. “I have consistently been an advocate for reproductive rights,” she said. D’Esposito countered, “I would never support a nationwide abortion ban. I never have and never will.” He said he supports in-vitro fertilization and called Gillen’s abortion push as “her whole campaign.” The 4th District includes portions of Nassau County on the border with Queens, including Hempstead, Valley Stream, Uniondale and Freeport. Some 40% of the district’s voters are registered Democrats, with 30% registered Republicans and 30% registered independents. Jewish residents account for 20% of the electorate, including a growing number of orthodox residents in the 5 towns that are voting Republican, according to analyses. With the presidential race at the top of the ticket some insiders say Democratic nominee Harris is a “wild card” if she has strong support against GOP candidate Donald Trump from the sizable black population in the district. D’Esposito’s internal poll showed Trump and Harris tied at 46% while independent Robert Kennedy Jr. — who has since dropped out of the race — had 5%. President Biden carried the district over Trump 55% to 45% in 2020 but trailed Trump by 7-percentage points in a previous internal campaign poll in June. Harris has closed that gap since Biden dropped out of the race, the poll showed.","summary":"In what could turn out to be the tightest congressional race in New York and a bellwether for which party controls the House, Republican Rep.

President Joe Biden issued a lengthy statement overnight Saturday expressing his “outrage” and vowing that Hamas would “pay” for the death of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, even as the US seems no closer to reaching a ceasefire deal that officials have said is close at hand for months. “I have worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and am heartbroken by the news of his death,” Biden said of Goldberg-Polin’s parents Jon and Rachel, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last month. “Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages.” Biden’s statement was not likely to raise the spirits of the remaining hostage families. It did not mention a possible deal to secure the release of the last seven US hostages until the final sentence – and only after the president vowed justice and/or revenge for Goldberg-Polin’s death. “Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. With these murders, Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. I strongly condemn Hamas’ continued brutality, and so must the entire world,” added Harris, his VP and former running mate, in her own statement. Biden has spoken with Goldberg-Polin’s family and his national security adviser Jake Sullivan is due to speak with the other hostage families in the days ahead. But, relatives of the seven US hostages still in captivity are not buying the messages coming out of the White House and State Department – the latter of which has steadfastly denied for months that Israeli officials are holding up a deal from being reached. Even so, Israeli media continues to publicly speculate that such is the case, and Biden himself said that there was “every reason” for people to believe so earlier this year. “The tragic murder of Hersh, just months after we all saw his face in a hostage video released by Hamas, is nothing short of vicious and senseless,” said the hostage families in a joint statement. “For the last 331 days, we warned that this could happen. Enough is enough.” Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said publicly in July that the Israeli government would not accept any ceasefire terms that do not lead to the total destruction of Hamas. While some rescue operations have been mounted by the Israeli military to return some of the civilians taken hostage by Hamas, ceasefire negotiations have proven far more effective. The war in Gaza is quickly approaching the one-year mark and shows no signs of winding down — if anything, fears of it expanding into a regional conflict are higher than ever. Israeli tensions with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon have reached their highest point in months while violence in the West Bank, encouraged and spurred by a violent right-wing Israeli settler movement, continues to escalate as well. US officials announced another round of sanctions on members of that settler movement last week, but the decision was immediately condemned by Netanyahu. In the past, the Biden administration has tended to back off after such rebukes from their Israeli counterparts, fearful of pulling at a growing rift between the two administrations. On Capitol Hill, reactions to Goldberg-Polin’s death poured in on Sunday, while protesters rallied in Tel Aviv to demand a ceasefire deal that would see the remaining hostages returned. “It's horrible. I mean, the whole thing is horrible, and it just reaffirms that Hamas are barbarians, and it also reaffirms that we need to stop this war,” Michigan’s Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow, said in an interview Sunday with MSNBC’s The Weekend. “I mean, there are too many innocent people. Whether it's Israelis, Israeli hostages, Palestinian, innocent citizens, they it all needs to stop. I mean, and that's, you know, my, my heart goes out to everyone who is part of losing those six hostages. But this, this whole thing needs to stop.” Chris Coons, another Democratic senator, added: “I am heartbroken and angry at the news that six hostages whose bodies were recovered in Gaza today were brutally murdered after 11 months in captivity. I am thinking especially of Jon and Rachel, Hersh’s parents, whom I’ve come to know through their tireless, courageous, and determined efforts to secure the release of their beloved son since he was taken hostage on October 7. I truly believed they would be reunited with Hersh; instead, today they are living every parent’s worst nightmare.” He added: “Hamas is an organization of true evil, and its leaders must pay for their heinous crimes. We must secure a deal that frees the remaining hostages so that not one more parent has to feel the same pain that Jon and Rachel feel today.” Republicans, meanwhile, blamed the Biden administration for the ongoing chaos in the Middle East, a theme that Donald Trump has echoed in his campaign. In a Truth Social post, the former president hit out at “a complete lack of American Strength and Leadership” by Harris and Biden and tried to tie it to the “Debacle of the Afghanistan Withdrawal”. Lindsey Graham, a conservative Republican from South Carolina, argued that White House needed to increase the pressure on Iran to starve Hamas of resources, while referring to the vice president (who recently took over the top of the Democrats’ 2024 ticket) as a “wrecking ball” on foreign policy. “I would say on foreign policy, she [Harris] has been a wrecking ball,” Graham said on Sunday. Contrasting her to Trump’s running mate JD Vance, he went on to argue: “JD has been unequivocally supporting Israel. She has been horrible. She is slow-walking weapons. She did not attend the [Benjamin Netanyahu] speech [in Congress], and that juiced up every terrorist in the region.”","summary":"Washington mourns hostages but offers no clear path to reaching deal for return of last captives — or concrete reason for delays","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-israel-us-hostages-killed-hamas-b2605357.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/18/SEI214113356-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/q4CXz7RR-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:54:19","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":255410910,"title":"Trump Posts Ominous Message About 'Kamala's Open Border'","text":"Former President Donald Trump escalated his rhetoric on illegal immigration on Sunday, posting an ominous image to X, formerly Twitter, about Vice President Kamala Harris and security at the U.S.-Mexico border.The image, posted to the former president's official X account with nearly 5 million views, depicts a shadowy male figure wielding a knife and approaching a woman in a dimly lit alley. Written on the photo are the words \"No One Is Safe With Kamala's Open Border\"—an apparent reference to his fierce criticisms of the Biden administration's immigration policies regarding the southern border.Some Republicans, including Trump and his running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance, have labeled Harris as Biden's \"border czar,\" though she was never officially given that title. Biden assigned her the task of addressing the \"root causes\" of migration to the United States from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.Trump, the GOP's presidential nominee, continued on Sunday to post other ominous campaign messaging photos signaling the destruction of the United States with a potential Harris presidency.Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign and Harris' spokesperson via email on Sunday for comment.In a summer attack ad, Trump accused Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, of \"intentionally unsecur[ing] the border.\" The ad claimed that the vice president \"halted construction of President Trump's border wall\" and \"took more than 94 executive actions to unsecure the border.\"Trump has repeatedly targeted Harris in his campaign messaging. In August, he shared a bullet-point list on X detailing how \"KAMALA INTENTIONALLY UNSECURED THE BORDER.\" The post, which at the time had been viewed 5.5 million times, included claims that Harris \"opposes all deportations\" and \"supports deadly sanctuary cities.\"The former president has also accused Harris of supporting \"mass amnesty for millions of illegals\" and wanting to \"give them government benefits.\"Harris, meanwhile, has defended the Biden administration's approach to illegal immigration, arguing that long-term solutions are needed to address the complexity of the situation.During a 2021 joint news conference with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Harris said that the U.S. \"will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders. If you come to our border, you will be turned back.\"The Biden administration has defended its border policies, pointing to increased funding for border security technology and personnel. Officials also highlight efforts to work with Central American countries to address the factors driving migration, including poverty, violence, and climate change.During Harris' campaign rally in Atlanta, she said the former president \"doesn't care about the border, he only cares about himself.\"\"Donald Trump has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk...\"Republicans, however, argue that these measures have been insufficient to stem the flow of migrants at the southern border. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported over 2 million encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2023, a record high. Representative Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican, recently held a press conference in Texas, calling out the Biden-Harris administration for not doing enough to enforce tougher border security measures.\"The Biden-Harris Administration has forgotten us. They've abandoned us. We're on our own. We've been on our own. And so, we can either complain about the issue or we can roll up our sleeves and get to work,\" he said.","summary":"Some Republicans, including Trump and his running mate JD Vance, have labeled Harris as Biden's \"border czar,\" though she was never officially given that title.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-open-border-message-1947298","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462149/kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:48:22","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":255413004,"title":"NBC Admits Fake Claim About Kamala Meeting Families of Murdered Soldiers","text":"NBC News’ Meet the Press admitted Sunday that anchor Kristen Welker had been incorrect to say that Vice President Kamala Harris had met the families of Americans killed in Afghanistan — though it also botched the correction. In an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Welker challenged the Republican over former President Donald Trump’s visit last week to Arlington National Cemetery to pay his respects to the 13 fallen American soldiers on the third anniversary of the terror attack on Abbey Gate at the international airport in Kabul. The Harris/Walz campaign accused Trump of politicizing the memorial, amid controversy over whether his campaign could take photos or video. In response, the Gold Star families criticized Harris for the botched Afghanistan withdrawal and for failing to call or meet with them. NBC’s Welker picked up the thread of argument with Cotton, before making an incorrect claim: NBC’s @kwelkernbc tried to excuse the fact that Kamala has never reached out to the Gold Star families of the 13 fallen service members from Abbey Gate by saying she and Biden “met with them during the dignified transfer.” There’s only one problem: Kamala was not in fact at the… pic.twitter.com/BJK6RmlodB — Greg Price (@greg_price11) September 1, 2024 “Well, they did meet with them at the dignified transfer.

Later, Meet the Press posted the following correction to social media: On our broadcast this morning, we incorrectly implied that both President Biden and Vice President Harris attended the dignified transfer of 13 American service members killed during the Afghanistan withdrawal. Biden was in attendance but Harris was not. — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 1, 2024 Welker had not “implied” that Harris had been there; she had stated so explicitly.

The movement, which originated in the heavily Muslim-populated city of Dearborn, Michigan, first targeted the re-election campaign of President Biden during primary season, arguing that the president’s continued support for Israel made it necessary for the community to send a message to the Democratic Party. Along with movements such as the “Vote Uncommitted” movement that bubbled up in Dearborn around the same time, the campaigns were able to get over 100,000 voters to cast uncommitted ballots during the Michigan primary earlier this year. Biden’s decision to drop out of the race in July and the subsequent elevation of Harris to the top of the ticket seemingly cracked the door open that members of the movement may be able to rally support for the Democratic ticket, but tensions between Harris and the campaign’s leaders have continued as the vice president has failed to fully commit to their demands. “We are not interested in hollow rhetoric, empty platitudes, or shallow calls for a ceasefire while the Biden-Harris administration continues to send weapons to Israel, enabling the indiscriminate slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza and fueling a wider regional conflict,” the campaign said in the release. “Words without meaningful action are meaningless, and the continued complicity in these atrocities will not be tolerated.” During the primary season, the group was able to spread its influence from Michigan to Wisconsin, two critical swing states in November’s election. Both states have been decided by razor-thin margins in the previous two presidential elections, making the lack of support from a demographic that has leaned heavily Democratic for much of the last 20 years a potentially decisive factor in the states. As of Sunday, the Real Clear Politics Polling average shows Harris with slim leads in both states, coming in with a 1.1 point lead in Michigan and a 1.4 point lead in Wisconsin. The campaign has also looked to expand to other swing states, having had success pivoting to states such as Minnesota during the primary season. While the group did not offer support for the campaign of former President Donald Trump, it urged supporters “to avoid falling into the complacent trap of abstaining from the 2024 election” and “to vote against genocide and to support third-party candidates as a clear message that we reject any party that participates in or supports genocide.” “At this time, we have not issued an endorsement of any specific third-party candidate. If and when that changes, we will announce it,” the release said. “Abandon Biden, now Abandon Harris, will not cede a single inch,” the release continued. “We remain firm and steadfast in our convictions and our mission to ensure that the party currently supporting, funding and enabling the Israeli genocide of Palestinians in Gaza is defeated at the polls.” Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, a spokesperson for Abandon Harris said that the campaign had “extended an olive branch to Kamala Harris and expressed our openness to dialogue” after Biden’s decision to drop out of the race. “After nearly a month of waiting, during which she had a disastrous rally in Michigan where she inadvertently revealed her stance on those protesting the genocide in Gaza, we launched Abandon Harris on August 19,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson added that the organization believes there is nothing Harris can do to regain their support, but noted that they do not encourage anyone to vote for Trump. “We remember Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, as well as his stance during Gaza’s Great March of Return,” the spokesperson said. “We have consistently urged voters not to support either the Democratic or Republican parties, while also making it clear that sitting out the election is not an acceptable option.” The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.","summary":"The Abandon Biden campaign is relaunching and \"intensifying\" its campaign, this time focusing its efforts against Vice President Kamala Harris in key swing states.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/abandon-harris-campaign-tries-to-swing-muslim-americans-against-veep-in-key-swing-states/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2024-savannah-georgia-harris-campaigned-88756798.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zrfNTnvb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 21:40:36","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.53},{"id":255410214,"title":"Not even Kamala Harris’ biggest fans can say what the flip-flopping VP stands for","text":"Supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris are rallying behind her campaign despite admitting that they are can’t say where she stands on most big issues – as the Democratic nominee continues to flip-flop on major policies. Harris, 59, has reversed her stances on energy issues, health care and illegal immigration since replacing President Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, in an apparent effort to make herself more electable to moderates in key swing states. Harris’ abandoned policy positions include her pledges to eliminate private health insurance, decriminalize illegal border crossings, ban fracking for oil and natural gas, and ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035 — each of those made in 2019 when the then-California senator was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. In recent weeks, The Post has spoken to several swing-state voters who plan to cast ballots for Harris. The majority of them painted a vague picture of what the vice president stands for – “pro-choice” and “the environment.” But the main reason they’re backing Harris is because she is not former President Donald Trump. Immigration “I would say I believe she is more moderate? in terms of immigration. In the sense that she’s not like let’s let everyone in,” Aaliyah Dittman, a 20-year-old college student from Clarion County, Pa., told The Post when asked about Harris’ position on the border and immigration. “But I feel like she’s kind of similar to Biden,” Dittman, a first-time voter excited about Harris, added. “And that’s the difficult thing. As she is still the vice president, she has to pull herself apart from the administration and say this is what I stand for and maybe she hasn’t done a great job doing that.” (Harris previously supported decriminalizing crossing the border illegally, opposed Trump’s wall and oversaw Biden-Harris administration policies that let in more than 8 million migrants. Now, she says she’s for the wall and wants to hire more Border Patrol agents.) Dittman also recalled that Harris, at the Democratic National Convention, “talked about the border deal that Trump had told Republicans to shut down, and that she would bring that back.” A 28-year-old George Mason University librarian, who didn’t want to give her name, similarly couldn’t clearly define Harris’ stance on immigration and wasn’t hesitant to say the vice president flip-flopped on the issue. “I think she’s staying true to herself. Honestly, I can’t give you a well rounded answer, because I haven’t seen her flip-flop,” the employee at the Fairfax, Va., school said. “I haven’t been that invested in the news, but from what I’ve seen, knowing about her beginnings as attorney general of California to where she is now as vice president to presidential candidate — she has always seemed to stay true to herself, even though she changes her mind,” she added. “I think she really sees [illegal immigration] more as an opportunity for growth and development as in keeping in tune of what most Americans want.” Energy and the environment Harris supporters that spoke to The Post appeared skeptical that the vice president would do much to address the environment and admitted they were unclear about where she stood on the issue. “I don’t know that — environment isn’t really what I focus on,” Mckenna Anderson, a junior at the University of Michigan, told The Post. “My major is gender, so I’m not that up to date on environment issues in general,” Anderson said. “I know that her and Biden did the Alaska oil pipeline, which is not as pro-environment, I guess. So I don’t know exactly where she stands, but from what little I do know, she’s not like great on environment.” (Harris previously supported a ban on fracking and was an early sponsor of the $2 trillion Green New Deal. She has reversed course on the fracking ban, and has avoided mentioning the proposed climate legislation.) Anna Klein, a freshman from Flat Rock, Mich., studying statistics at the University of Michigan, suggested that Democrats usually pander to voters when they talk about the environment but that it wouldn’t dissuade her from voting for Harris. “I’m gonna be honest. I’m not so sure that like, she’s gonna do much about it,” Klein said. “She might talk about it and she might act like she’s going to do something, but like, even Biden said that he was gonna do a lot and I’m sure there were some policies that helped, but like, they always talk about it just to get people on their side and then they don’t really do much.” “I think the biggest issue right now is just whether or not we want a person with some sense of morality in office,” she argued. “I’m not really worried about certain issues.” Abortion Abortion policy was top of mind for several of the battleground staters that spoke with The Post, but few could articulate what Harris would actually do to expand reproductive rights as president. Anderson, the gender major from Michigan, described Harris as being, “definitely for more, like women’s health.” “She is pro-choice, I guess,” she added before admitting, “I definitely need to learn more [about Harris’ policies].” Klein, the statistics major from Michigan, gave a similar response when asked what Harris policies stood out. “I do very much agree with her pro-choice policies,” she said. “I probably can’t name them off the top of my head right now.” Dittman, the Pennsylvania college student, recalled, “Kamala said in one of her speeches that she would restore Roe” — referring to the overturned case that legalized abortion across the US. The Keystone State native noted that reproductive rights are among her two “core values” with the other being “gun safety.” Does policy even matter? Dittman told The Post that while the DNC was light on policy talk she was pleased with the “messaging” and hoped Harris would get more specific during her Sept. 10 debate against Trump. “She needs to start that messaging now,” Dittman said, noting that she likes following the “fun” and “relatable” Kamala HQ X account but that “maybe it would be a good idea to expand on policy.” “I really hope she hits hard on policy at the debate, because I feel like the debate, Trump is going to ramble on whatever he’s going to ramble on about and I feel like Kamala, at least I’m hoping, has the answers and her policy ready,” she added. Brandyn Fragosa, a 20-year-old communications major from Stafford, Va., studying at George Mason University, indicated that he plans to vote for Harris in November regardless of where the vice president stands on policy issues. “I will be voting for Kamala Harris, because I just feel like she, her beliefs align with my beliefs,” he said. Fragosa couldn’t identify a single policy stance from Harris that stood out to him, but said he plans to do “more research” even though it won’t change his vote. “At the moment, it’s more just about, OK, I know what Trump believes in, and I know that doesn’t align with what I believe in,” he said. “I know she was working underneath the Biden administration as the vice president, and I knew most of the things that they followed and believed in were stuff that I believed in.” Like Fragosa, Kyle Woody, an 18-year-old psychology major from Ashburn, Va., studying at George Mason University, also said that he didn’t ”know too much about the policies” of Harris but that it likely won’t play much of a role in how he votes. “I just don’t think Trump’s a good person,” Woody said. Even more seasoned voters told The Post that policy wasn’t playing a major role in their ballot box decisions this election cycle. In Las Vegas, Nev., Craig Wuest, a former Pentagon expert on nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said he believes Trump “is the greatest threat to democracy that I have seen in my career.” To Wuest, that, more than Harris’s policies, motivated his vote. Pastor Tanesha Jordan Roberts of Las Vegas’ Greater Grace Global Church, said she is a registered Republican but did not vote for “the top of the ticket” for several elections until 2020 when she pulled the lever for Biden. “I believe we just need to get back to politics being boring,” Roberts told The Post. “I probably won’t agree on 90% of what she’s putting forth. But this is not a policy decision. This is about our democracy. This is about the rule of law. This is about our way out of the crazy that we are in.” — Additional reporting by Ethan Dodd and Mark A.

It's the latest volley in an extended back and forth as Trump tries to saddle Harris with the Biden administration's handling of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, including a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members. Harris on Saturday accused Trump of staging a “political stunt” that “disrespected sacred ground\" where many Afghanistan war dead are buried. Trump and the families of some of those killed in the bombing blame Harris, as they did President Joe Biden before he ended his reelection bid, for their loved ones' deaths. The families say the former president was honoring their loved ones when he came to Arlington. His campaign later distributed images of the visit despite the cemetery's prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children's deaths,” said the relatives' joint statement. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” Gold Star families have lost a loved one in military service. Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt. Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss. They were among 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans who died in an Aug. 26, 2021, bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport as U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan. Trump thanked the family members for their statement via social media. “Thank you for saying you wanted me to stand with you ... and take pictures, that it was your request, not mine,” he wrote. Throughout the weekend, Trump has used his social media accounts to distribute video testimonials from some relatives who signed the joined the statement. Christy Shamblin, Gee's mother-in-law, said in a 90-second message that Trump and his aides were “respectful” and a “a comfort” to the families who gathered at Arlington. Then she directly addressed her remarks to Harris. “Why won't you return a call and explain how you call my daughter-in-law's death a success?” Shamblin said. “Why would you take a day where we celebrated the deaths of our loved ones and use it to disparage not only them, but us.” Biden and first lady Jill Biden went to Dover Air Force Base in 2021 for the ceremony returning the service members' remains to U.S. soil. The Bidens met privately with family members at Dover. The Bidens were joined at the ceremony by several top aides in the administration, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Shamblin was among the several family members who also spoke at the Republican National Convention in July on Trump's behalf. Several family members have joined Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, on a conference call with media. Trump's appearance ballooned into controversy after defense officials said his campaign was warned about not taking photographs and that there was an altercation between Trump aides and a cemetery employee. Officials have said since that an employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. The Trump campaign has since lashed out at Pentagon officials, with a top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, referring to military spokespersons as “hacks.” Trump campaign officials say the campaign had permission to bring someone to take video. Since Biden ended his reelection bid in July, Trump has been zeroing in on Harris and her roles in foreign policy decisions. He has highlighted the vice president’s statements that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. Biden’s administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover. Campaigning this year, Trump has said that leaving was the right thing to do but that the Biden administration's execution was poor. “We were going to do it with dignity and strength,” he said in a recent speech in Michigan. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tom Cotton and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two were speaking about former President Donald Trump's visit last week to Arlington National Cemetery, where he has drawn criticism for posing for photos with Gold Star families in a section of the cemetery where photos are traditionally prohibited. Last week, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Trump’s visit was a “personal invitation by families.” “There are many ways that we as a nation and our leaders can observe the third anniversary of Abbey Gate,” Kirby said. “Another way is to continue to work, maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work every single day to make sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded — not just at Abbey Gate but over the course of the 20-some-odd years that we were in Afghanistan — have the support that they need.” The Army also accused a member of Trump's campaign staff of \"abruptly push[ing] aside\" a cemetery staff member who sought to enforce restrictions on taking photos and video at the location. Asked about the incident Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Cotton, R-Ark., told moderator Kristen Welker: \"These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ incompetence invited [Trump] to the cemetery and they asked him to take those photos. ... You know who the families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting at a beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington, D.C.\" Cotton said he spoke to Kelly Barnett and Darin Hoover, the parents of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, who died in Afghanistan three years ago. Cotton didn't specify whether they were the family members he claimed invited Biden and Harris. Gabbard, a former Democratic House member from Hawaii, echoed Cotton, telling CNN on Sunday: \"President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn’t come; they didn’t even respond to that invitation.\" Trump last week defended the photos and videos he took at the cemetery, telling NBC News in Michigan on Thursday that a Gold Star family \"asked me whether or not I would stand for a picture at the grave of their loved one who should not have died.” He said he didn’t initiate the photo, adding: “While I was there, I didn’t ask for a picture. While I was there, they said, ‘Sir, could we have a picture at the grave?’\" Trump's campaign posted a TikTok video of the ceremony, and Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita posted a video on X of Trump laying flowers at a grave. Trump defended that on Thursday, too, saying, \"Well, we have a lot of people ... TikTok people.\" \"I don't know who did it, and it could have been them. It could have been the parents. It could have been somebody,\" he added. On Friday, at a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Trump said: “Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I use their graves for public relations services, and I didn’t.\" Trump took to X on Saturday night, posting multiple videos of relatives of killed service members defending him and criticizing Harris and Biden. In one video, Darin Hoover addresses Harris directly, saying Trump treated the family with the \"utmost respect\" and asking where she and Biden were on \"Aug. 26, 2024.\" He said they were \"nowhere near Arlington Cemetery. You couldn’t be bothered to be with us or say our kids' names.” In a statement accompanying the Trump campaign videos Sunday, members of the Gold Star families said they were \"appalled\" by Harris' attempts to \"politicize\" Trump's visit to the cemetery. \"President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,\" the statement said. \"He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.\" The videos were posted in response Harris' statement Saturday saying Trump \"disrespected sacred ground\" during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.

In an interview with Pavel Zarubin, a TV reporter with favored access to the Kremlin, Peskov also appeared dismissive of Trump’s boast that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours if U.S. voters returned him to the White House. Before Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from November’s election and threw his support behind Harris, Russian President Vladimir Putin had said that Moscow preferred Biden over Trump, describing the former as an experienced “old school” type of politician. With Biden out of the running, Zarubin asked Peskov, laughing: “Then who is our candidate now?” Peskov, also laughing, replied: “We have no candidate. But, of course, the Democrats are more predictable. And what Putin said about Biden’s predictability applies to almost all Democrats, including Ms. Harris.” While stating that the election was an internal U.S. matter, Putin and Peskov have offered a variety of opinions at different times. In February, for example, Putin praised Biden for his predictability but also discussed the sensitive topic of his mental fitness for office in comments that appeared designed to sow mischief. In June, he said Russia did not care who the next U.S. president was, but that the U.S. court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Trump. Peskov, in the interview published on Sunday, said U.S. steps to “trample on our country’s interests” had exceeded acceptable limits. Bilateral relations were at a historic low point, with “no prospects” at the moment of setting them on a path towards recovery. The Kremlin spokesman said there was no “magic wand” to resolve the Ukraine crisis overnight in the way that Trump has promised.

In the statement shared on Sunday, the Gold Star families – who have lost a loved one in military service – defended the Republican presidential nominee and insisted that Vice President Kamala Harris was the candidate politicizing fallen US service members. Some family members also recorded video messages that the former president posted on Truth Social, saying Trump was honoring their loved ones when he came to Arlington. The Republican presidential nominee has been facing fierce backlash over Monday’s visit, where campaign staffers allegedly physically shoved a female worker and then disrespected fallen soldiers and veterans’ families by defying the rules to film and take photos in a banned area. On Saturday, Harris accused Trump of staging a “political stunt” that “disrespected sacred ground” where many Afghanistan war dead are buried when his campaign released images of his visit — including the Republican nominee standing giving thumbs up by the graves of fallen soldiers. Partisan activity is prohibited on cemetery grounds. The same day, President Joe Biden told reporters when asked about the incident: “I don’t want to answer because I might tell you what I think.” To deflect from the furor, the former president has ramped up his rhetoric in recent days seeking to directly link Harris to the Biden administration’s handling of the US’s exit from Afghanistan in 2021 after 20 years of occupation. The service members who died on August 26 2021, were killed by a suicide bomber at the Abbey Gate of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport. Trump and the families of some of those killed in the bombing blame Harris, as they did Biden before he ended his reelection bid, for their loved ones’ deaths, slamming her role in foreign policy decisions, and highlighting a statement she made that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,” said the relatives’ joint statement. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt Ryan Knauss. He posted video testimonials from their family members and thanked them for their statement via social media: “Thank you for saying you wanted me to stand with you ... and take pictures, that it was your request, not mine.” Christy Shamblin, Gee’s mother-in-law, said in a 90-second message that Trump and his aides were “respectful” and a “a comfort” to the families who gathered at Arlington. Then she directly addressed her remarks to Harris. “Why won’t you return a call and explain how you call my daughter-in-law’s death a success?” Shamblin said. “Why would you take a day where we celebrated the deaths of our loved ones and use it to disparage not only them, but us.” Shamblin was among the several family members who also spoke at the Republican National Convention in July on Trump’s behalf. Others have joined Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, on a conference call with media. Biden and first lady Jill Biden went to Dover Air Force Base in 2021 for the ceremony returning the service members’ remains to US soil and met privately with the family members there. Allies of the former president also jumped to defend him in appearances on the Sunday morning political shows, with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina telling ABC News: “You know what really is unfortunate? That these families had to go visit their fallen loved ones at Arlington due to incompetence by the Biden administration.” Trump’s visit to the cemetery is controversial because defense officials said his campaign was warned about not taking photographs. There was also an altercation between Trump aides and a cemetery employee when the staff member tried to tell them not to film or take photos. Officials have said since that an employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. In response, the Trump campaign lashed out at Pentagon officials, with top campaign adviser Chris LaCivita referring to military spokespersons as “hacks” and claiming the campaign had prior permission to film at the site. The Afghanistan withdrawal came in respect to a commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover.

Engagement on X includes various interactions such as likes, retweets, comments and importantly, responses to polls,\" Grok said per Cuban's post. \"When users interact with a poll by selecting an option, its recorded as an interaction with that post.\"Musk has implemented some controversial changes to the social media platform since acquiring it. These changes included eliminating much of Twitter's staff, temporarily suspending some journalists from the platform and reinstating many of its previously banned users.Musk then pitched X's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot \"Grok,\" which debuted last year, as an AI that casually converses with users who are subscribers of X's premium tiers.However, the chatbot has been at the center of some issues, more recently in a letter sent in early August five secretaries of state said Musk's AI chatbot has spread election misinformation and are urging the billionaire to fix it.The Associated Press reported secretaries of state from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Washington last month expressed their concerns in a letter to Musk, stating that Grok produced false information regarding state ballot deadlines.The issues with Grok reportedly came shortly after Biden stepped down from the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Harris.According to the AP, the secretaries of state said that Grok provided incorrect ballot deadlines that were then shared across various social media platforms and reached millions of people. In their letter, the officials added that Grok continued to repeat the false information for 10 days before it was corrected.\"As tens of millions of voters in the U.S. seek basic information about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right to vote,\" the secretaries wrote in the letter, per the AP.","summary":"Mark Cuban raised a question to Elon Musk over the amount of votes to the amount of engagement a poll about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris received.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-raises-question-donald-trump-kamala-harris-poll-1947282","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2462135/mark-cuban.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:28:29","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":255408450,"title":"Republican network boosts leftist third-party candidates in crucial states, aiming to divert votes from Harris","text":"WASHINGTON – Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina’s presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help. Though Medelius, co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” welcomed the assistance, the offer would complicate his life, provoking threats and drawing him into a state election board investigation of the motivations, backgrounds and suspect tactics of his new allies. His is not an isolated case. Across the country, a network of Republican political operatives, lawyers and their allies is trying to shape November’s election in ways that favor former President Donald Trump. Their goal is to prop up third-party candidates such as West who offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It is not clear who is paying for the effort, but it could be impactful in states that were decided by miniscule margins in the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden. This is money West’s campaign does not have, and he has encouraged the effort. Last month the academic told The Associated Press that “American politics is highly gangster-like activity” and he “just wanted to get on that ballot.” Trump has offered praise for West, calling him “one of my favorite candidates.” Another is Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump favors both for the same reason. “I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.” Democrats are exploring ways to lift Randall Terry, an anti-abortion presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, believing he could draw voters from Trump. But the GOP effort appears to be more far-reaching. After years of Trump accusing Democrats of “rigging” elections, it is his allies who are now mounting a sprawling and at times deceptive campaign to tilt the vote in his favor. “The fact that either of the two major parties would attempt financially and otherwise to support a third-party spoiler candidate as part of its effort to win is an unfortunate byproduct” of current election laws “that facilitate spoilers,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program. “This phenomenon is equally problematic whichever of the two major party engages in it.” One key figure in the push is Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina. Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show. In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either. His history is complex. Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other. Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama’s Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate’s Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate. For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach. Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run “ghost candidates” against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility. Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022. Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man’s campaign. Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor’s seat in 2020. Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West’s name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona’s secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector. After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman’s husband, trying to rectify the situation and “gave some information.” Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails. The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors. Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show. West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot. Other Republican-aligned law firms also have been involved in the national push, opposing Democrat-backed challenges to West’s placement on the ballot: — In Georgia, Bryan Tyson, a partner at the Election Law Group, represented the state Republican Party as it tried to keep West on the ballot. The firm has collected $60,000 in payments from the RNC since April, campaign finance records show. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger overruled an administrative law judge and placed West, Stein and Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee Claudia De la Cruz on the ballot. Tyson did not respond to a message seeking comment. — In North Carolina, Phil Strach, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, successfully challenged in court a North Carolina State Board of Elections decision to bar West from the ballot. Strach did not respond to a message left for him. — In Michigan, John Bursch, a senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that helped overturn Roe v. Wade, successfully fended off a challenge to West’s placement on the ballot. Bursch’s firm, Bursch Law PLLC, was paid $25,000 by Trump’s campaign in November 2020 for “RECOUNT: LEGAL CONSULTING,” according to campaign finance disclosures. Bursch did not respond to a request for comment. — In Pennsylvania, a lawyer with long-standing ties to Republican candidates and causes, unsuccessfully argued in August for West to stay on the ballot. The attorney, Matt Haverstick, declined to say in an interview who hired him or why. People Over Party, the group Hamrick is affiliated with, had tried to get West on the ballot. None of these actions was funded by West’s campaign, though he and his “Justice for All” party have coordinated at times with Hamrick’s People Over Party, according to legal filings, a news release and social media posts. In North Carolina, People Over Party, worked with Blitz Canvassing and Campaign & Petition Management — two firms that routinely work for the GOP — to gather signatures for West. Hamrick later responded in writing on behalf of workers for the two companies after the state election board opened its inquiry. Jefferson Thomas, a longtime Republican operative from Colorado, submitted petition signatures that his firm, The Synapse Group, gathered on behalf of Stein in New Hampshire, records show. He did not respond to requests for comment. In Wisconsin, Blair Group Consulting oversaw West’s petition signature drive to qualify for the ballot, as previously reported by USA Today. David Blair, the firm’s president, was a the national director of Youth for Trump during the 2016 campaign and was a spokesman in the Trump administration. Blair declined to comment. Mark Jacoby, whose signature gathering firm Let the Voters Decide often works for Republicans, was involved in the failed Arizona push to get West on the ballot. The California operative has was convicted in 2009 of voter registration fraud, court records show. Jacoby did not respond to a message left at a phone number listed to him. Medelius, the North Carolina co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” said the partisan battles over third-party candidates amounted to a “gang war.” “If they want to use us for cannon fodder, there’s not much I can do about it,” he said. ___ Associated Press writers Jonathan J.

Following much back and forth, Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump have both finally agreed to a September 10 debate. On Saturday, the Democratic candidate publicly called for Trump to agree that the mics be kept on at all times throughout the event. “Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to debate with a live microphone,” Harris said in a tweet on Saturday. “If his own team doesn’t have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t. We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a transparent way—with the microphones on the whole time.” According to ABC News, Trump’s campaign has agreed to the following rules: no audience members; no opening statements; two minute closing statements; no props or pre written notes on stage; candidate microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, and muted when time belongs to another candidate, and candidates will not be able to ask questions of each other. Harris’ team has not yet agreed to the rules, the outlet reported. On Fox News Sunday, Lewandowski hit out at Harris, saying that the parameters of the debate had been agreed back when President Joe Biden was still the Democratic party’s nominee – and that Harris, as the VP pick, was part of that. Lewandowski said she knew of the debate rules ahead of time because they are the same for the vice presidential debate. “After she has been coronated to be the presidential nominee for the Democrats, what she’s done is come back and said I don’t like that criteria anymore,” he claimed. “I want to be seated so I can be the same height as Donald Trump,” he said. Bream interjected, saying: “Okay, her team denies that.” Lewandowski grew visibly frustrated and launched into a rant hitting out at Harris and her team. “We’ve been part of the negotiation back and forth for many, many days here and I don’t understand why once again Kamala Harris and her team are changing what their positions have been,” he said. Elsewhere in the interview, Lewandowski also pushed the false claim that Democrats are in favor of abortion after a baby is born, also known as infanticide. “Kamala Harris … has had a radical position on the issue of abortion,” Lewandowski said. “Many Democrats believe that you can have an abortion not only on up until the last week, but also in some cases after the baby’s been born.” Bream fact checked Lewandowski on his statement. “To be clear, in a number of states, there is abortion allowed through pregnancy. And that includes a measure that Governor Tim Walz signed in Minnesota,” she said. “But Democrats say they absolutely disavow the idea of infanticide or of a baby that does survive an abortion somehow their life being taken at that point. We can continue that debate, because there are a number of states that do allow it through pregnancy. But I think everybody agrees infanticide is illegal and wrong.” The Independent has emailed both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment.","summary":"Corey Lewandowski pushed the false claims that Democrats are in favor of abortion after a baby is born, also known as infanticide","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-lewandowski-fox-news-infanticide-abortion-debate-mics-b2605320.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/31/15/SEI219322298.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:06:57","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":255407828,"title":"Kate Beckinsale, 51, looks incredible in a strapless peach dress and HUGE glittering silver platform heels at the amfAR Gala in Venice","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 1st 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Cheating row erupts at Paralympics as Italian rower is stripped of his medal after being caught with his mobile phone - as Brit clinches gold Germany's AFD wins landmark victory in regional elections - the first triumph for the Right in the country since WWII - with rival parties vowing to form coalitions to keep them from power British engineer on doomed Mike Lynch superyacht insists to police all 'doors and hatches were closed' before waterspout sank the £30m vessel off the Sicily coast - as prosecutors continue to probe tragedy that killed seven Dr Max Pemberton: Banning smoking in pub gardens WON'T save the NHS DEAR JANE: I set up a nanny-cam and caught the babysitter doing something horrifying in my bedroom Top dementia expert reveals the two popular diets that really can stop Alzheimer's before it strikes, according to science McFly star Tom Fletcher reveals he 'cried' with relief after Stephen Fry documentary helped him realise he had bipolar disorder following years of uncertainty Drunk cyclist, 48, who smashed into two women from behind as they walked on pavement leaving one unconscious and needing her finger amputating is spared jail - as video shows aftermath as he rides away The ten smart ways YOU can duck Starmer's blitz on inheritance tax, capital gains and pensions, revealed by finance guru JEFF PRESTRIDGE Inside story of Harry's attempt to return to royal fold: Friends reveal 'surprising' messages, overtures and secret 'rehabilitation blueprint' that suggests not everything's sunny in Montecito Police release CCTV footage in hunt for man who raped a woman in a car in central London Soft toy giant Jellycat accuses Aldi of ripping off its popular £27 design with a £4 alternative Never wear sheer, avoid mini skirts and stay away from capes and ponchos!

Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich’s opinion piece for the Guardian was titled “Elon Musk is out of control. Here is how to rein him in.” In the article, Reich stated: Elon Musk is rapidly transforming his enormous wealth — he’s the richest person in the world — into a huge source of unaccountable political power that’s now backing Trump and other authoritarians around the world. … He may be the richest man in the world. He may own one of the world’s most influential social media platforms. But that doesn’t mean we’re powerless to stop him. In addition, he accused Musk of allowing X users to spread so-called “misinformation” on the platform. Reich then gave several suggestions on how to “rein in” Musk, which included a boycott of Tesla. “Regulators around the world should threaten Musk with arrest if he doesn’t stop disseminating lies and hate on X,” he added. WATCH — Lonsdale: “Clearly Weaponization” of DOJ Against Trump, Musk, “Not How the Country Is Supposed to Work”: One of Reich’s final points was to “make sure Musk’s favorite candidate for president is not elected.” In June 2023, Reich wrote on social media that former President Donald Trump should be disqualified from running for the White House a second time. “Not only should Trump be prosecuted, but Section 3 of the 14th Amendment clearly bars anyone from holding office who has ‘engaged in insurrection’ against the United States of America. He should be disqualified from running for president. It’s that simple,” he stated. The former Clinton official’s article in the Guardian came after Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov was arrested recently in France, Breitbart News reported August 24: Durov was arrested under a warrant related to “various violations of his encrypted messaging service,” according to a report by Le Monde. The 39-year-old, who became a French citizen in 2021, is expected to be brought to court on Sunday. French authorities are accusing Durov of a “lack of moderation” involving Telegram. The messaging app is reportedly under attack in Europe for the “viral circulation of false information.” Following Durov’s arrest, Musk said it was “probably wise” that he “limit” his travels to places where free speech is “constitutionally protected,” per Breitbart News.","summary":"A former Clinton administration official wrote on Friday that Elon Musk is a person who is \"out of control\" and needs to be stopped.\n\n\nThe post Ex-Clinton Official Robert Reich: &#8216;Elon Musk Is Out of Control&#8217; and Should Be Threatened with Arrest appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2024/09/01/ex-clinton-official-robert-reich-elon-musk-out-control-should-threatened-arrest/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/GettyImages-2158243805-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 20:05:06","author":"Amy Furr,Le Monde.

Taylor Hoover to mark the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Kabul airport during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021.

The Hollywood powerhouse fawned over Biden while brushing aside the furious behind-the-scenes and sometimes cringe-worthy public “machinations” — including by Clooney himself — that led up to the president caving. “The person who should be applauded is the president, who did the most selfless thing that anybody’s done since George Washington,” Clooney said in a nod to the nation’s first commander in chief, who stepped aside after his second term, when asked about his Times essay during an interview at the Venice Film Festival. “All the machinations that got us there, none of that’s gonna be remembered, and it shouldn’t be,” the 63-year-old actor and director added, according to Entertainment Weekly. There had been a unified effort from high-ranking members of the Democratic Party, including Nancy Pelosi, to push him out of the presidential race in July after his devastating debate performance against GOP foe Donald Trump. Numerous members of Hollywood and the left-wing media such as Clooney joined in on the effort with a series of carefully placed public comments and essays. But Clooney, whose own essay was titled “I love Joe Biden, but We Need a New Nominee,” said Sunday that he didn’t want all that to become what history remembers. “What should be remembered is the selfless act of someone who … you know, it’s very hard to let go of power. We know that. We’ve seen it all around the world,” he said. “And for someone to say, ‘I think there’s a better way forward,’ all the credit goes to him, and that’s really the truth,” Clooney said of Biden. In his July essay, Clooney voiced his longtime support and admiration for Biden but said that after the president’s debate against Trump, there was no ignoring the toll age had taken on the president. “The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010. He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,” Clooney wrote in the Times. “Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn’t see what we just saw. “Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,” Clooney concluded in urging the prez to step aside. In Biden’s first interview since he exited the race — paving the way for Veep Kamala Harris to take his place — he name-dropped Pelosi while saying he was pushed out by party elites. He added that House and Senate members running their own re-election campaigns decided he’d become a liability to their own futures. “A number of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate thought that I was going to hurt them in the races. And I was concerned if I stayed in the race, that would be the topic — you’d be interviewing me about why did Nancy Pelosi say [something] … and I thought it’d be a real distraction,” Biden told “CBS News Sunday Morning” earlier this month.","summary":"George Clooney on Sunday compared Joe Biden to George Washington in his first remarks since writing a bombshell New York Times op-ed calling on the 81-year-old prez to drop his re-election bid.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/clooney-compares-biden-to-george-washington-dodges-own-role-in-forcing-prez-from-race/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/88744928-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3T9yYO4H-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:57:33","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":255407832,"title":"Antonio Banderas' glamorous girlfriend Nicole Kimpel, 43, goes braless in an elegant floor-length gown as she joins Spanish star, 64, at the Venice amfAR Gala","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Sunday, Sep 1st 2024 10PM 17°C 1AM 16°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Cheating row erupts at Paralympics as Italian rower is stripped of his medal after being caught with his mobile phone - as Brit clinches gold Germany's AFD wins landmark victory in regional elections - the first triumph for the Right in the country since WWII - with rival parties vowing to form coalitions to keep them from power British engineer on doomed Mike Lynch superyacht insists to police all 'doors and hatches were closed' before waterspout sank the £30m vessel off the Sicily coast - as prosecutors continue to probe tragedy that killed seven Dr Max Pemberton: Banning smoking in pub gardens WON'T save the NHS DEAR JANE: I set up a nanny-cam and caught the babysitter doing something horrifying in my bedroom Top dementia expert reveals the two popular diets that really can stop Alzheimer's before it strikes, according to science McFly star Tom Fletcher reveals he 'cried' with relief after Stephen Fry documentary helped him realise he had bipolar disorder following years of uncertainty Drunk cyclist, 48, who smashed into two women from behind as they walked on pavement leaving one unconscious and needing her finger amputating is spared jail - as video shows aftermath as he rides away The ten smart ways YOU can duck Starmer's blitz on inheritance tax, capital gains and pensions, revealed by finance guru JEFF PRESTRIDGE Inside story of Harry's attempt to return to royal fold: Friends reveal 'surprising' messages, overtures and secret 'rehabilitation blueprint' that suggests not everything's sunny in Montecito Police release CCTV footage in hunt for man who raped a woman in a car in central London Soft toy giant Jellycat accuses Aldi of ripping off its popular £27 design with a £4 alternative Never wear sheer, avoid mini skirts and stay away from capes and ponchos!

Antonio, who stars as Jacob in the erotic thriller, looked handsome in a black tuxedo suit as he put on a loved-up display with his partner Nicole, who wore red, on the red carpet. Read More Antonio Banderas, 64, joins his glamorous partner Nicole Kimpel, 43, at Venice Film Festival During the event, Antonio was joined by his co-star Nicole, 57, who stars as high-powered CEO Romy in the movie. In the film, Nicole's high-powered New York business executive starts a risky affair with her much-younger intern, played by Harris Dickinson. She admitted she felt 'vulnerable' filming multiple scenes of masturbation, plus a depiction of a submissive/dominant relationship for the erotic new thriller. Rising British star Harris has a career-making turn as Samuel, the intern who intuits that his boss Romy, the CEO of a tech firm, wants to be dominated. Nicole has made nothing like it since the dream-like erotic thriller Eyes Wide Shut with then-husband Tom Cruise 25 years ago. She said that an intimacy co-ordinator and closed set had been vital to conjuring the sex scenes which tell the story of her character's existential crisis, resolved through a taboo-busting sexual odyssey. Nicole said: 'I think this film is obviously yes about sex, but it's about desire it's about your inner thoughts, it's about secrets, it's about marriage, it's about truth, power, consent.' He wore red-lensed sunglasses and Nicole paired her floor-length dress with heeled gold sandals and gold chandelier earrings Antonio took off his sunglasses for an indoor shot, expertly smizing next to Nicole as the pair wrapped their arms around each other Just on Friday, the couple stunned at the Venice Film Festival premiere of Babygirl starring Antonio and Nicole Kidman, 57 'This is one woman's story and this is I hope a very liberating story. It's told by a woman through her gaze. It's Halina (Reijn's) script, she wrote it and she directs and that made it unique, that suddenly I was going to be in the hands of a woman with this material. It was very dear to our shared instincts and very, very freeing.' She added: 'I don't think there's a judgement attached (about the character). It's for each person to react to Romy and the way she behaves. My connection to it is that I want to examine human beings, women, on screen, to explore what it means to be human in all the facets of that and the labyrinth of that.' She said that she was: 'exposed and vulnerable and frightened when it comes to giving it to the world' but that her experience of making it had been: 'delicate and intimate and very deep.' She added: 'I knew she wasn't going to exploit me. However, anyone interprets that, I didn't feel exploited. I felt very much a part of that. There was enormous caretaking by all of us, we were all very gentle with each other and helped each other. It felt very authentic, protected and, at the same time, real.' Babygirl review: Nicole Kidman sizzles in this tale of passion and power across the age divide, writes BRIAN VINER Babygirl Verdict: A sexy, post #MeToo thriller Rating: One of the oddities of these post #MeToo years in Hollywood is that Lolita-style stories about older men falling for much younger women or even schoolgirls have practically disappeared – while the opposite dynamic is suddenly all the rage. Hardly a month seems to pass without an older woman bedding a chap 25 years her junior, as if to right a century of cinematic wrongs. Anyway, hot on the high heels of Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine getting it together in The Idea of You on Amazon Prime, and Nicole Kidman cavorting with Zac Efron in A Family Affair on Netflix, along comes Kidman again, entangled in more ways than one with 28-year-old British actor Harris Dickinson in the steamy psychosexual thriller Babygirl. Here at the Venice Film Festival, air-conditioned cinemas are currently offering a blessed relief from hotter-than-usual weather. But last night's world premiere of Babygirl brought a different kind of sizzle. Nicole Kidman attends a red carpet for 'Babygirl' during the 81st Venice International Film Festival on August 30 Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson in a scene from 'Babygirl' which will be released in January Antonio Banderas and Nicole Kidman in a scene from 'Babygirl' Kidman has described it as the most 'exposing' performance she has ever given – which, considering 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, is quite a claim. She plays Romy, a corporate hotshot who runs a thriving robotics company replacing warehouse staff with automatons, and making wise observations to her workforce such as 'one-day shipping has dramatically upped the ante'. On the face of it she is as serenely successful at home as she is at work. Her dishy theatre director husband Jacob (Antonio Banderas) seems only too delighted to cater to her somewhat vigorous sexual demands, and she to his. The family unit is completed by a couple of teenage daughters – not that Dutch writer-director Halina Reijn spends much time developing them. One of them is gay and the other likes dancing. Still, Reijn has other matters to attend to, and gets down to them with arresting urgency. Filmmakers sometimes start their features with sound rather than pictures – a hubbub of people chatting, perhaps, or a lone dog barking in the street. Here, it's Romy evidently in the throes of sexual ecstasy, although she needs to look at online porn to finish the job. 'Exposing' indeed. Later, on her way to work, Romy is struck by the sight of a young man calming a dangerous dog. The young man turns out to be Samuel (Dickinson), one of a new batch of company interns, who are duly ushered in to pay homage to Romy in her swanky office. She instantly clocks his good looks and his swagger, and soon enough she finds that she cannot resist him. But Babygirl is not just the story of an illicit office affair across the age divide. Far more interestingly, it is about power and workplace politics. Samuel senses that Romy, whose job is telling others what to do, has a kinky yearning to be the one jumping to orders. So the CEO and the intern switch roles; the boss becomes the bossed. Kidman has described it as the most 'exposing' performance she has ever given – which, considering 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, is quite a claim It is a smart, sexy film, brilliantly and boldly acted by Kidman and Dickinson, with first-class support from Banderas, writes Brian Viner That is far from the end of the affair. There are revelations and recriminations, ambitions thwarted, and hints that Romy's sexual psychoses are somehow connected with a strange childhood spent in cults and communes. There is also an ending that couldn't possibly happen if this were a relationship between a male head honcho and a woman much lower on the corporate ladder. However, at the same time, I wonder if Heijn is being quite as counterintuitive as she thinks: this is still, for the most part, a story in which the man holds the cards. Nevertheless, it is a smart, sexy film, brilliantly and boldly acted by Kidman and Dickinson, with first-class support from Banderas (who has spent most of his career being absolutely nobody's idea of a cuckold). As for the almost-unmentionable, the alleged cosmetic work that sometimes seems to have limited Kidman's range of expressions from A only to about D, that is cleverly woven into the narrative. Romy is clearly the kind of woman who would make a friend of Botox. On the subject of injections, for the rest of us here in Venice, after some so-so early films, Babygirl has given us just the shot of adrenaline we required.

The ex-president has been trying to navigate the post-Roe landscape since 2022, with limited success. As his presidential campaign has progressed throughout 2024, Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn federal protections on abortion — while he has simultaneously sought to distance himself from hardline opponents of abortion who are seeking to ban IVF and other fertility treatments, as well as the stricter end of GOP-led proposals to ban abortion at various points during the pregnancy. Over the past week, the former president made his latest attempt. Speaking to NBC News minutes before taking the stage in Potterville, Michigan, the ex-president made two announcements on the issue. First, he put forward a plan to force insurance companies or the federal government to cover the costs of IVF for all Americans. And second, he came out against Florida’s six-week abortion ban, which he said restricted abortion too early into the pregnancy. Campaign aides would clarify over the next few days that this did not mean he would support a ballot measure up for debate this year in Florida that would enshrine abortion access into the state constitution. Both statements triggered furious responses from within his own party. Anti-abortion groups and supporters of Florida’s conservative Governor Ron DeSantis ripped Trump for his supposed betrayal in statements to the press and on social media. And on Sunday, two Republican senators appearing in separate interviews across NBC and ABC took opposite positions on the pledge by Trump to fund IVF either through public or private means — suggesting that the plan will cause more internal divisions for the right as the general election nears. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton — a MAGA populist — said that he could see himself supporting the former president’s plan and added that he thought “most Republicans” would be open to doing so. “It’s something I’m open to, that most Republicans would be open to,” he said, before adding that he would need to determine the “fiscal impact” of such a proposal first and consider “whether the taxpayer can afford to pay for this, what impact it would have on premiums.” He went on to claim that to his knowledge, no Republicans in Congress opposed the legality of IVF (a factually untrue statement, whether he knows it or not) and claimed that no state governments made fertility care “unaccessible” — though it was briefly blocked in Alabama earlier this year after a push by conservatives to extend the rights of a human being to unborn fetuses through the courts. That same strategy is being pushed by supporters of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the federal government, which is tied to numerous former Trump administration officials. “In principle, supporting couples who are trying to use IVF or other fertility treatments — I don’t think that’s controversial at all,” Cotton added. But the same morning that Cotton proclaimed Republicans would be open to Trump’s proposal, Lindsey Graham appeared on ABC’s This Week and immediately dimissed that idea. Trump, he argued, was trying to show his support for the practice of providing IVF treatments to families seeking to have children. The furthest Graham seemed prepared to go was a hypothetical tax credit for families undergoing IVF but he was firmly opposed to forcing insurance companies to directly fund the procedure. He added that it may be an issue on which Republicans could find “common ground” with Democrats. “I wouldn't [support that] because there's no end to that,” he said. “I think a tax credit for children makes sense, means tested.” “We’ve been accused — the party has — of being against birth control. We’re not. We’ve been accused of being against IVF treatments. We’re not,” Graham added as his explanation for Trump’s latest announcement. First, though, he’ll have to find common ground with the rest of his party. Graham remains the lead Senate supporter of efforts to restrict abortion at the national level — an idea the Trump campaign has repeatedly insisted the former president opposes. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate and Graham’s colleague in the Senate GOP caucus, echoed that opposition last week on NBC’s Meet the Press. Regardless of how GOP senators and members of Congress come out on the issue of funding for IVF over the next days or weeks, the Republican party will still have to contend with the push by the anti-abortion right to extend “personhood” rights to unborn fetuses through the court system. Many on the far right are looking at the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 2022, as the easiest vessel to achieve their goal of banning abortion and some fertility care nationwide without going through Congress. The Harris campaign continues to pummel Trump over the twin issues of abortion and IVF as well. Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has talked about his own experiences seeking fertility treatments with his wife as Democrats have argued that Republicans are overreaching into Americans’ personal and private medical choices. “Donald Trump’s own platform could effectively ban IVF and abortion nationwide,” Sarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said on Thursday. “Trump lies as much if not more than he breathes, but voters aren’t stupid. Because Trump overturned Roe vs. Wade, IVF is already under attack and women’s freedoms have been ripped away in states across the country. There is only one candidate in this race who trusts women and will protect our freedom to make our own health care decisions: Vice President Kamala Harris.”","summary":"Senator Tom Cotton said he was ‘open’ to the plan while Senator Lindsey Graham quickly dismissed the idea","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ivf-lindsey-graham-tom-cotton-b2605330.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/01/19/tomcotton_NBC.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VT51YucE-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:51:54","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.542},{"id":255408106,"title":"President Biden responds to Trump’s Arlington cemetery behavior","text":"United States President Joe Biden was asked by the press his opinion of Donald Trump's behavior at an Arlington cemetery visit.

The poll, which was published on Saturday, surveyed 1,293 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.This narrow margin comes as former President Donald Trump won the state by 19 percentage points in the 2020 election when he faced off against President Joe Biden. The poll results suggest that Nebraska, traditionally considered a Republican stronghold, may be more competitive than previously thought in the 2024 U.S. Senate race in November.Newsweek contacted Fischer and Osborn's press contact as well as Trump's campaign via email on Sunday for comment.The SurveyUSA poll is not an outlier. A YouGov poll conducted from July 31 to August 12 showed Fischer with a similarly slim 2-point lead (43 to 41 percent). Even more surprising, a November 2023 poll by Change Research had Osborn leading by 2 points (40 to 38 percent). However, a Torchlight Strategies poll from July showed Fischer with a more comfortable 26-point lead (50 to 24 percent)—highlighting the volatility of the race.Osborn, a former U.S. Navy veteran and labor union leader, has positioned himself as a centrist alternative to Fischer. His campaign strategy appears to be paying off, as he has managed to close the gap with the incumbent senator despite having lower name recognition. The SurveyUSA poll found that 42 percent of voters haven't heard anything about Osborn, indicating potential for further movement in the race.The Nebraska Democratic Party's decision not to field a candidate and instead tacitly support Osborn seems to be a calculated move that may be yielding dividends. This strategy mirrors the 2022 Utah Senate race where independent candidate Evan McMullin managed to keep the race surprisingly close against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Lee.Osborn's approach of distancing himself from both major parties appears to be resonating with voters across the political spectrum. The polls show him performing well not only in the more educated and urban 2nd Congressional District, but also overperforming in the exurban 1st District and rural 3rd District relative to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.The tight race in Nebraska could have significant implications for control of the Senate. With several competitive seats up for grabs this year, both parties are fighting for every possible advantage.

On Thursday, Musk shared a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform by another user, who cited a forecast from the US government budget for fiscal year 2025 that said that the budget deficit could increase from the current $1.8 billion to almost $16.3 billion by 2035. \"At current rates of government spending, America is in the fast lane to bankruptcy,” Musk wrote. The tech billionaire also suggested that “government overspending is what causes inflation” in the country. The US annual inflation rate dipped below 3% in July for the first time since 2021, according to a Labor Department report, issued two weeks ago. The prices for goods and services went up by 2.9%, while core inflation, which excludes food and energy industries, rose by 3.2% over the previous 12 months. In late July, the US Treasury Department announced that the country’s national debt surpassed $35 trillion for the first time in history, increasing by a trillion since January. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicted that by 2034 the debt will exceed $50 trillion, amounting to more than 122% of America’s GDP. The CBO also said that it expects the country’s average annual GDP growth rate to be at around 1.8% from 2029 to 2034. In June, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) think tank claimed that the national debt grew by $4.3 billion under incumbent US President Joe Biden, compared to $8.4 billion during Donald Trump’s term in office. In August, Trump gave a lengthy interview to Musk on X. Shortly after that, the Republican presidential candidate said that he would consider the tech billionaire, whom he described as a “brilliant guy,” for a role in his administration if he wins the election in November.

Taylor Hoover to mark the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Kabul airport during the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2021. Hoover was one of 13 American service-members killed in the attack on Abbey Gate at the airport's perimeter, where evacuees were being processed. Trump was accompanied by a photographer and other staffers. He was pictured giving a thumbs up and recording footage that was later shared on social media, behavior that upset other Gold Star families. (The former president took to TruthSocial on Sunday to defend these actions, posting a statement from the families that invited him to the cemetery which said they had asked his campaign to take photos and videos.) Electioneering and other partisan political activity at Arlington is against federal law; the former president’s campaign was made aware of this in advance of their visit. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants,” a spokesperson for the memorial said. Gabbard, however, claimed Trump campaign was “approved to bring a camera there to document this historic and momentous day.” She did not specify who gave the alleged permission. Dodging questions about disgruntled families and cemetery policies, the former lawmaker pivoted to criticizing Trump’s opponent. “I know President Trump wanted to share (the anniversary) with others, especially given the fact that President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn't come, they didn't even respond to that invitation,” she claimed. Neither Harris nor Biden have addressed allegations that they were invited to the ceremony on Aug. 26. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) echoed Gabbard’s criticisms, slamming the Vice President—and current presidential candidate—for “politicizing” Trump’s visit to Arlington, and pinning the blame on her for the soldiers’ deaths. When the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021, the Biden administration was following a withdrawal commitment and deadline negotiated by the Trump administration with the Taliban. “She was the last person in the room advising Joe Biden, and yet they're criticizing Donald Trump's invitation from those families at Arlington,” Stefanik said on Fox News. “Kamala Harris is a disgrace, and we need to make sure she never becomes commander in chief.”","summary":"Photo composite by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/CNN/FOXDonald Trump's allies and surrogates are quickly falling in line to defend the former president’s controversial visit to Arlington National Cemetery after Kamala Harris accused the GOP candidate of disrespecting “sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.”\n\nDuring a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, former Democratic congresswoman and current Trump acolyte Tulsi Gabbard described Trump's trip to the cemetery—and Section 60 specifically— as a “very grave and somber remembrance and honoring of those lives that were lost.”\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee was invited to a wreath laying ceremony by the family of fallen Marine Staff Sgt.

Tom Cotton and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two were speaking about former President Donald Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery last week, where he has drawn criticism for posing for photos with Gold Star families in a section of the cemetery where photos are traditionally prohibited. Last week, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said Trump’s visit was a “personal invitation by families.” “There are many ways that we as a nation and our leaders can observe the third anniversary of Abbey Gate,” Kirby said. “Another way is to continue to work, maybe not with a lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with TV cameras, but to work every single day to make sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and wounded — not just at Abbey Gate but over the course of the 20-some-odd years that we were in Afghanistan — have the support that they need.” The U.S. Army also accused a member of Trump’s campaign staff of “abruptly push[ing] aside” a cemetery staff member who sought to enforce restrictions on taking photos and video footage at the location. Cotton was asked about the incident on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” Sunday and told moderator Kristen Welker, “These families, Gold Star families, whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ incompetence invited [Trump] to the cemetery and they asked him to take those photos …You know who the families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting at a beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington D.C.” Cotton mentioned that he spoke to Kelly Barnett and Darin Hoover, the parents of Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover, who died in Afghanistan three years ago. Cotton didn’t specify whether Barnett and Darin Hoover were the family members he claims extended an invitation to Biden and Harris. Gabbard echoed Cotton, telling CNN on Sunday, “President Biden and Harris, I heard, were invited by some of these family members. They not only didn’t come. They didn’t even respond to that invitation.” Trump earlier this week defended the photos and videos he took at the cemetery, telling NBC News in Michigan on Thursday that a Gold Star family, “asked me whether or not I would stand for a picture at the grave of their loved one who should not have died.” He said he didn’t initiate the photo, adding: “While I was there, I didn’t ask for a picture. While I was there, they said, ‘Sir, could we have a picture at the grave?’” Trump’s campaign posted a TikTok video of the ceremony and Trump’s campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita posted a video on X of the former president laying flowers at a grave. The former president defended that on Thursday too, saying, “Well, we have a lot of people … TikTok people.” “I don’t know who did it, and it could have been them. It could have been the parents. It could have been somebody,” he added. On Friday, during a rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Trump said “Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I use their graves for public relations services, and I didn’t.” Trump took to X Saturday night, posting multiple videos of family members of killed service members criticizing Harris and Biden and defending the former president. In one video, Darin Hoover addresses Harris directly saying Trump treated the family with the “utmost respect” and asked where the vice president and Biden were on “Aug. 26, 2024,” he added that they were “nowhere near Arlington Cemetery. You couldn’t be bothered to be with us or say our kid’s names.” In a statement accompanying the videos released by the Trump campaign Sunday members of the Gold Star families said they were “appalled” by Harris’s attempts to “politicize” Trump’s visit to the cemetery. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,” the statement said. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.” The videos were posted in response to a statement Harris put out on Saturday saying that Trump “disrespected sacred ground” during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were not invited to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: White House confirms families of service members killed in Afghanistan withdrawal did not invite Biden and Harris to Arlington Cemetery first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/white-house-confirms-families-of-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan-withdrawal-did-not-invite-biden-and-harris-to-arlington-cemetery/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-White-House-says-Biden-and-Harris-werent.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:37:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":255406502,"title":"GOP operatives prop up liberal third-party candidates to draw votes away from Kamala Harris","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina’s presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help. Though Medelius, co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” welcomed the assistance, the offer would complicate his life, provoking threats and drawing him into a state election board investigation of the motivations, backgrounds and suspect tactics of his new allies. His is not an isolated case. Across the country, a network of Republican political operatives, lawyers and their allies is trying to shape November’s election in ways that favor former President Donald Trump. Their goal is to prop up third-party candidates such as West who offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It is not clear who is paying for the effort, but it could be impactful in states that were decided by miniscule margins in the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden. This is money West’s campaign does not have, and he has encouraged the effort. Last month the academic told The Associated Press that “American politics is highly gangster-like activity” and he “just wanted to get on that ballot.” Trump has offered praise for West, calling him “one of my favorite candidates.” Another is Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump favors both for the same reason. “I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.” Democrats are exploring ways to lift Randall Terry, an anti-abortion presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, believing he could draw voters from Trump. But the GOP effort appears to be more far-reaching. After years of Trump accusing Democrats of “rigging” elections, it is his allies who are now mounting a sprawling and at times deceptive campaign to tilt the vote in his favor. “The fact that either of the two major parties would attempt financially and otherwise to support a third-party spoiler candidate as part of its effort to win is an unfortunate byproduct” of current election laws “that facilitate spoilers,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program. “This phenomenon is equally problematic whichever of the two major party engages in it.” One key figure in the push is Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina. Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show. In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either. His history is complex. Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other. Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama’s Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate’s Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories. Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate. For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach. Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run “ghost candidates” against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility. Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022. Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man’s campaign. Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor’s seat in 2020. Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West’s name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona’s secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector. After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman’s husband, trying to rectify the situation and “gave some information.” Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails. The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors. Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show. Hamrick declined to comment on the role of Johnson and Reeve. They did not respond to requests for comment. West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot. Other Republican-aligned law firms also have been involved in the national push, opposing Democrat-backed challenges to West’s placement on the ballot: — In Georgia, Bryan Tyson, a partner at the Election Law Group, represented the state Republican Party as it tried to keep West on the ballot. The firm has collected $60,000 in payments from the RNC since April, campaign finance records show. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger overruled an administrative law judge and placed West, Stein and Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee Claudia De la Cruz on the ballot. Tyson did not respond to a message seeking comment. — In North Carolina, Phil Strach, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, successfully challenged in court a North Carolina State Board of Elections decision to bar West from the ballot. Strach did not respond to a message left for him. — In Michigan, John Bursch, a senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that helped overturn Roe v. Wade, successfully fended off a challenge to West’s placement on the ballot. Bursch’s firm, Bursch Law PLLC, was paid $25,000 by Trump’s campaign in November 2020 for “RECOUNT: LEGAL CONSULTING,” according to campaign finance disclosures. Bursch did not respond to a request for comment. — In Pennsylvania, a lawyer with long-standing ties to Republican candidates and causes, unsuccessfully argued in August for West to stay on the ballot. The attorney, Matt Haverstick, declined to say in an interview who hired him or why. People Over Party, the group Hamrick is affiliated with, had tried to get West on the ballot. None of these actions was funded by West’s campaign, though he and his “Justice for All” party have coordinated at times with Hamrick’s People Over Party, according to legal filings, a news release and social media posts. In North Carolina, People Over Party, worked with Blitz Canvassing and Campaign & Petition Management — two firms that routinely work for the GOP — to gather signatures for West. Hamrick later responded in writing on behalf of workers for the two companies after the state election board opened its inquiry. Jefferson Thomas, a longtime Republican operative from Colorado, submitted petition signatures that his firm, The Synapse Group, gathered on behalf of Stein in New Hampshire, records show. He did not respond to requests for comment. In Wisconsin, Blair Group Consulting oversaw West’s petition signature drive to qualify for the ballot, as previously reported by USA Today. David Blair, the firm’s president, was a the national director of Youth for Trump during the 2016 campaign and was a spokesman in the Trump administration. Blair declined to comment. Mark Jacoby, whose signature gathering firm Let the Voters Decide often works for Republicans, was involved in the failed Arizona push to get West on the ballot. The California operative has was convicted in 2009 of voter registration fraud, court records show. Jacoby did not respond to a message left at a phone number listed to him. Medelius, the North Carolina co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” said the partisan battles over third-party candidates amounted to a “gang war.” “If they want to use us for cannon fodder, there’s not much I can do about it,” he said.","summary":"Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina's presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/01/us-news/gop-network-props-up-liberal-third-party-candidates-in-key-states-hoping-to-siphon-off-harris-votes/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-pu0o1eotl-1725219113681.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725204759&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zrfNTnvb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-01 19:34:15","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":255407392,"title":"Trump explains Barron’s reaction to assassination attempt: ‘He loves his father’","text":"Donald Trump had been speaking to supporters at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July when gunfire shots were heard, with at least one of the bullets skimming the former president’s ear before Secret Service members surrounded him. Donald Trump’s wife, former first lady Melania Trump, had been watching the rally on television when the shooting occurred, during which Barron Trump, their son, was in the middle of a tennis lesson. “He’s a good tennis player, he’s outside playing tennis, and somebody ran up ‘Barron, Barron, your father’s been shot,’” Donald Trump said on Fox News’s Life, Liberty, and Levin. “You know, he loves his father. He’s a good kid, good student, good athlete, actually. And he ran, ‘Mom, what’s going on, what’s going on?’ She couldn’t believe it. She was actually watching it live, can you imagine?” The former president added that it was “a miracle” he survived the shooting, as the shot fired at him should have been “a sure thing.” Donald Trump Jr., the oldest of the Trump children, who the former president said is “great” with guns, contacted his father after the shooting, telling him he could not believe his father was not dead. Donald Trump also credited God for saving his life from the shooting, stating that he knows of people who have become believers in God since the historic event. Since the shooting, various investigations have been started to look into the failures of the rally’s security.

In the wake of the shooting, the Secret Service told the Washington Examiner that an unspecified number of agents were put on desk duty, walking back its earlier statement that agents were put on leave and not allowed to return to work.

Tim Walz has actually lost her ground in his home state. That’s the takeaway from new polling of 635 Likely Voters from Minnesota’s KSTP, which found that the Democratic presidential nominee’s advantage over Donald Trump has been cut in half since she picked Walz as her running mate last month and showcased the ticket at the Democratic National Convention. Harris now leads Trump 48% to 43%, a significant decline for her from the previous survey that showed her up 50% to 40%. The the opposite of a post-convention bump that normally would have been expected. This is particularly remarkable given that this was a poll that included more Democrats than Republican respondents — with Dems making up 40% of the sample, Republicans 35%, and independents the remainder. And the poll data suggests Walz is the one costing Harris support. Only 52% of Minnesota voters see him as an excellent or good choice, with 12% saying he’s a fair selection, and a staggering 34% saying he’s a poor pick. Walz is underwater with men, with 49% approving of his selection and 50% opposing it. About 40% of male respondents called him a poor choice running mate. Voters under the age of 35, a key demographic Harris needs in November, also aren’t enthusiastic. 49% called Walz an excellent or good pick; the other 51% regarded him unfavorably. These voters make up 25% of the anticipated November electorate. Walz is also one percentage point underwater with parents, with 48% regarding him favorably and 49% panning the pick. 35% of people with children say he was a poor selection. A dramatic urban/rural divide also appears on this question, with 38% of rural residents approving of the pick, compared to 59% of those in the suburbs and 61% of those in urban areas. While 59% of Twin Cities residents rate the selection as excellent or good, only 48% of those in Northeast Minnesota, 46% of those in Western Minnesota, and 35% of those in Southwestern Minnesota make the same claim. The gender gap that afflicts Harris in most polls extends to Walz also, with 49% of men supporting the selection compared to 57% of women.

Cotton — a Republican from Arkansas who served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan — defended Trump’s visit to the military burial grounds to help commemorate the third anniversary of the deaths of service members killed by a suicide bomber at the Kabul International Airport during the botched US pullout from the country. Harris, 59, has derided her 78-year-old GOP presidential foe’s appearance at the cemetery as a “political stunt.” Cotton retorted Sunday, “He didn’t take campaign photos there. “These families — Gold Star families — whose children died because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s incompetence, invited him to the cemetery, and they asked him to take those photos” during the wreath-laying event, Cotton said of Trump on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The senator said he spoke to the parents of fallen Marine Staff Sgt. Taylor Hoover and that they indicated “they wanted President Trump there, they wanted to take those photos. “You know who those families also invited? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,” Cotton claimed. “Where were they? Joe Biden was sitting at a beach. Kamala Harris was sitting at her mansion in Washington, DC,” he said, referring to the 81-year-old president’s vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he’s been since last Sunday, and Harris’ residence on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory. “She was 4 miles away — 10 minutes,” Cotton said of Harris. “She could’ve gone to the cemetery and honored the sacrifice of those young men and women, but she hasn’t. “She never has spoken to them or taken a meeting with them,” he continued. Cotton also blamed Biden and Harris for the deaths of the 13 service members outside the Kabul airport, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. “It is because of her and Joe Biden’s incompetence that those 13 Americans were killed in Afghanistan,” the senator aid. Cotton’s blistering response follows videos messages released by relatives of seven of the 13 victims of the suicide blast criticizing Harris’ attack on Trump. “We, the families of the brave service members who were tragically killed in the Abbey Gate bombing, are appalled by Vice President Kamala Harris’ recent attempts to politicize President Trump’s visit to Arlington National Cemetery,” they said in a joint statement released by the Trump campaign. “President Trump was invited by us, the Gold Star families, to attend the solemn ceremonies commemorating the three-year anniversary of our children’s deaths,” they added. “He was there to honor their sacrifice, yet Vice President Harris has disgracefully twisted this sacred moment into a political ploy.”","summary":"“Where were they?
