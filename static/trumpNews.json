I don't want them to go higher because at a certain point you make it where people don't buy, Trump told reporters about tariffs at the White House. So, I may not want to go higher or I may not want to even go up to that level. I may want to go to less because you know you want people to buy and, at a certain point, people aren't gonna buy. Trump's comments further pointed to a diminished appetite for sharply higher across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries after markets reacted violently to their introduction on April 2. The Republican president slapped 10% tariffs on most goods entering the country but delayed the implementation of higher levies, pending negotiations. Still, he hiked rates on Chinese imports, now totaling 145%, after Beijing retaliated with its own counter-measures. Last week, China said will not respond to a numbers game with tariffs, its own signal that across-the-board rates would not rise further. Trump said China had been in touch since the imposition of tariffs and expressed optimism that they could reach a deal. While the two sides are in touch, sources told Reuters that free-flowing, high-level exchanges of the sorts that would lead to a deal have largely been absent. Speaking with reporters, Trump repeatedly declined to specify the nature of talks between the countries or whether they directly included Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump has repeatedly extended a legal deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the U.S. assets of the short video app used by 170 million Americans. On Thursday, he said a spin-off deal would likely wait until the trade issue is settled. We have a deal for TikTok, but it'll be subject to China so we'll just delay the deal 'til this thing works out one way or the other, Trump said.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump indicated a possible easing of tariff tensions with China, suggesting he may not raise tariffs further to avoid discouraging consumer spending. While he previously imposed 10% tariffs and later increased rates on Chinese imports (totaling 145%), both the U.S. and China now appear less inclined to escalate the trade conflict.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-signals-tit-for-tat-china-tariffs-may-be-near-end-tiktok-deal-on-ice/articleshow/120396030.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120396079,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-106964,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:54:45","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":312291362,"title":"Trump Softens On Zelensky, Says Mineral Deal Coming \"Soon\"","text":"US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he does not hold Volodymyr Zelensky \"responsible\" for Russia's invasion of his country but continued to criticize the pro-Western Ukrainian leader.Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that Ukraine started the war and this week accused Zelensky of responsibility for \"millions\" of deaths.\"I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started,\" Trump said at the White House alongside visiting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\"I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job, OK?

Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement announcing the new fees, most of which will begin in mid-October.Under the new rule, per tonnage or per container fees will apply to each Chinese-linked ship's US voyage, and not at each port as some in the industry had worried.The fee will be assessed only up to five times per year, and can be waived if the owner places an order for a US built vessel.Dominant after the Second World War, the US shipbuilding industry has gradually declined and now accounts for just 0.1 percent of global output.The sector is now dominated by Asia, with China building nearly half of all ships launched, ahead of South Korea and Japan.The three Asian countries account for more than 95 percent of civil shipbuilding, according to UN figures.There will be separate fees for Chinese operated ships and Chinese built ships, and both will gradually increase over subsequent years.For Chinese built ships, the fee starts at $18 per NT or $120 per container -- meaning a ship with 15,000 containers could see a whopping fee of $1.8 million.US groups representing some thirty industries had voiced their concerns in March about the risks such fees could have on the prices of imported products.One business surveyed by the groups expressed worry that proposed fees, alongside tariffs on China and other countries, as well as duties on steel and aluminum imports, would put extraordinary pressure on US retailers. All non-US built car carrier vessels will also be hit with a fee beginning in 180 days.Washington is also introducing new fees for liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers, though those do not take effect for three years.A fact sheet accompanying the announcement said fees will not cover Great Lakes or Caribbean shipping, shipping to and from US territories, or bulk commodity exports on ships that arrive in the United States empty. In addition to the fees, Greer also announced proposed tariffs on some ship-to-shore cranes and on Chinese cargo handling equipment. The Trump administration's actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships, Greer said.","summary":"The United States unveiled new port fees on Chinese built and operated ships Thursday, in a bid to boost the domestic shipbuilding industry and curb China's dominance in the sector.

A ChinaFile Conversation with Wendy Cutler, Michael Hirson, Lizzi C. Lee, Isabel Hilton, Andrew Polk, and Arthur R. Kroeber\n\n—Jeremy Goldkorn\n\nBeijing denies sending cannon fodder to Russia\n\nChinese soldiers in Ukraine\n\nLast week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted (with video evidence) that the Ukrainian military had captured two Chinese citizens fighting with the Russian army in the Donetsk region. \n\nOn April 9, at the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s daily press briefing, the spokesperson was asked about this. He said that “the Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals to stay away from areas of armed conflict, avoid any form of involvement in armed conflict, and in particular avoid participation in any party’s military operations.” In response to a question about Zelenskyy’s claim in his tweet that he had “information suggesting that there are many more Chinese citizens in the occupier's units than just these two,” the spokesperson said “Such claim has no basis in facts.” \n\nLater that day, Zelenskyy tweeted: “As of now, we have precise data on over 150 Chinese citizens who were involved in the war against Ukraine by Russia. We know that the actual number is higher.”\n\nAnalysis: In my view, it’s highly unlikely that the Chinese government is sending any soldiers to Russia. The young men going to fight for Russia seem to be doing it out of financial need and machismo alone—they don’t need the state to encourage them. \n\nSee also: Translation: Chai Jing Interviews a Chinese Mercenary Fighting for Russia in Ukraine on China Digital Times, and ‘Do you want to show strength here?’: Russia’s ads recruiting Chinese mercenaries in the Guardian. \n\nSuddenly, everybody ❤️ China\n\nAs Donald Trump and his representatives threaten, horrify, and tariff the rest of the world, China is making friends: \n\nXi Jinping is on three country tour to meet the leaders of Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, and shore up economic and political ties. Earlier this month, a “joint logistics and training center established by the armed forces of China and Cambodia was officially inaugurated and put into operation…at the Ream Naval Base in Cambodia.”Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez met Xi Jinping in Beijing; they talked of increasing cooperation and trade between China and the European Union and especially Spain to resist Trump’s “bullying.” Sanchez spoke positively about Chinese electric cars, which are currently tariffed by the EU. European Union leaders “are planning to travel to Beijing for a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in late July,” according to the South China Morning Post.“The head of the British military has visited Beijing for the first time in a decade,” reports the Financial Times.“Korea will promptly push for a trilateral free trade agreement with Japan and China in a bid to jointly tackle U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff tussle,” the Korea Joongang Daily reported last week. This follows noises from Beijing earlier this month about a co-ordinated response by the three countries. The Chinese government last week held a leadership conference on work with neighboring countries during which Xi vowed to forge closer ties. \n\nThe major trade war events of the last week \n\nChina: Trump is a bully and a joker \n\nThis a timeline of the past eight day’s craziness: \n\nApril 7: Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports if Beijing did not retract a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods that China had announced in response to Trump's initial tariff measures. NPR\n\nApril 8: China vowed it would not back down in the face of Trump's threat, with officials stating they would “fight to the end” in the escalating trade war. NPR\n\nApril 9: China announced an additional 50% retaliatory tariff on all U.S. imports, bringing the total tariff level to 84%. NPR\n\nIn response to China's increased tariffs, Trump announced he was hiking tariffs on China even higher to 125%. CNBC\n\nThen Trump made a sudden reversal, lowering most global tariffs to 10% for a 90-day period, but maintaining the higher 125% tariff rate specifically for China. Reuters\n\nApril 10: A White House official confirmed that the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports now effectively totals 145%, which includes the new 125% tariff plus a previous 20% fentanyl-related tariff. Beijing filed complaints accusing the U.S. of breaching World Trade Organization rules. CNBC\n\nApril 11: China raised its tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, effective April 12. In a statement, China's State Council Trump's tariffs as a “joke” that \"no longer have any economic significance\" because the current levels make U.S. exports to China financially unviable. Reuters\n\nXi Jinping told visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez that China and the EU should “join to oppose unilateral acts of bullying.” Reuters\n\nApril 12: The Trump administration announced tariff exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronics from China. Reuters\n\nApril 15: As of today, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, aside from electronics, remain at 145%, while China has maintained its increased tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods, including semiconductors, which research form Trivium says will “cause havoc with China's supply chains, hitting manufacturers who rely on semiconductor inputs,” but will also “undermine U.S. efforts to reshore chip manufacturing,” and “force Chinese buyers to source their chips elsewhere—supporting China's chip manufacturing base.”\n\nBut how is China really feeling? \n\nBeijing remains refreshingly uncompliant with Trump. “China does not want to fight these [tariff and trade] wars but is not scared of them,” said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson last week: “If the U.S. is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China’s response will continue to the end.”\n\nMany Chinese people are stoic: “Look around; people live their lives as usual. Who cares about the crazy Yankees?” said one commenter cited by Global Voices. But China’s many export-oriented factories and their employees are feeling the pain already, as these anecdotes and quotes compiled by the Following the Yuan newsletter illustrate. \n\nWhat is to be done? The Pekingnology newsletter summarized advice from Chinese economists and public intellectuals. This includes recommendations to:\n\nBoost the domestic economy by stimulating consumption.Launch a major public rental housing project to address social welfare for migrant workers which could “ would create tens of trillions in internal demand over the coming years.”Push rural land reform which would give the rural poor capital.Encourage entrepreneurs and the private sector.Support the real estate industry.Eliminate tariffs on all countries except the U.S. while removing restrictions on foreign investment. \n\n The Sinification newsletter has also compiled reactions from Chinese scholars and analysts, who express concern about “the negative repercussions that China’s ballooning trade surplus is having—and will continue to have—on its relations with the rest of the world,” and who share “broad consensus that China should continue reducing its overall reliance on the U.S. as it deepens ties with the Global South,” and note that “the current trade war seems to be accelerating pre-existing trends, such as China’s ongoing drive towards greater economic self-reliance and security.”\n\nThe dysfunctional PLA \n\nAnother military leader purged \n\nGeneral He Weidong 何卫东, the second highest ranking uniformed member of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and the second of two vice-chairs of the Central Military Commission has been purged, according to the Financial Times. \n\n\"This is by far the largest shake-up of PLA leadership and state-owned enterprises involved in military procurement in recent memory,” Lyle Morris at the U.S.-based Center for China Analysis told India’s Economic Times: “It suggests deep anxiety and dysfunction within the ranks of China's military, and a failure of trust between Xi and the military.”\n\nNew technology \n\nThe robots are coming \n\nHere are some noteworthy tech developments from the last week. \n\n“Chinese state-owned automaker GAC Group said it will set up a humanoid robot demonstration zone this year, aiming to begin mass production of the machines in 2027,” per Nikkei. China has gained the “dexterous upper hand in humanoid robot tussle” with U.S., says the Financial Times.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Finance have announced details of a 60 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) state fund to incubate early-stage investments in AI. “Government bodies nationwide have been eager to show they are using DeepSeek’s A.I. technology since the company’s founder met with Xi Jinping, China’s leader,” according to the New York Times. Some are reporting DeepSeek’s “outstanding results” in using DeepSeek for public security and public opinion response (i.e. censoring the internet and controlling public discourse): see this translation from China Digital Times. \n\nThe low altitude economy\n\nThe Ministry of Transport issued new “management measures for pilot projects for building a strong transportation nation” that include guidelines for the development of the low-altitude economy, i.e. drones, flying cars, and air taxis etc. AutoFlight, a Chinese company that develops and manufactures eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft, has broken ground on a new testing facility and factory in Wuhan, Hubei Province. This follows a 157 million yuan ($21.5 million order “announced in February by the Wuhan Hanyang Investment Development Group for 12 aircraft. \n\nElectric cars\n\nChina’s “battery king CATL joins with Sinopec to build swapping-station network,” for electric vehicles (EVs) reports the South China Morning Post. Some in China believe that battery swapping, rather than charging, is the future of EVs.Electric car company BYD’s premium marque Denza is set to launch in Europe, where Wired says it will “take on Audi, BMW, and Mercedes with its crab-walking, blowout-beating Z9GT.”","summary":"","url":"https://www.thechinaweek.com/p/chinese-mercenaries-fighting-for","image":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde12173a-beca-41da-8d83-6b65c0653150_602x400.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:42:58","author":"Cindy Carter,Jeremy Goldkorn","authors":["Cindy Carter","Jeremy Goldkorn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.061},{"id":312291944,"title":"Trump and Italy's Meloni talk up EU tariff deal hopes","text":"Donald Trump and Giorgia Meloni hit an optimistic note about a possible US-EU tariffs deal Thursday as the far-right Italian prime minister mounted a charm offensive at the White House.Casting herself as the only European who can de-escalate Trump's trade war, Meloni highlighted their conservative common ground and said she wanted to make the West great again.

If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic, France's Industry Minister Marc Ferracci warned last week.

Electioneering never seems to end; it transitions seamlessly from one election cycle to another, with little respite in between. Elected officials rarely get a break once they assume office, as opposition politicians persist with media campaigns and politicking, which inevitably unsettle and distract incumbent officeholders.\n\nThe ultimate political prize, of course, is the presidency. Rival politicians spare no effort or expense in pursuing it, utilizing any feasible method to secure power. The political realignments we are witnessing today, even with President Tinubu yet to complete half of his four-year term (as many governors elected alongside him in 2023 are also still in office), are a normal feature of our political system.\n\nHowever, no political system can survive in an environment of relentless, high-stakes conflicts and tensions. Governance stagnates when development programs and policies cannot be implemented because key political actors are embroiled in infighting over appointments, or when power grabs become the driving force of political action, rather than a focus on the welfare of the people.\n\nWhat President Tinubu, a governor, or other elected officials are doing wrong should be evaluated and criticized. However, these issues should not be elevated to campaign material or used as ammunition to attack tribal and religious groups by the opposition. Instead, opposition politicians should offer viable and realistic policy alternatives, rather than merely calling for regime change or the dismissal of errant officials. The notion that a politician should not be reelected simply because they didn’t secure a desired appointment or board position is untenable. Such thinking is self-serving and flawed from the outset.\n\nOne person’s political misfortune should not be used as a rallying cry to mobilize regions, tribes, religious groups, or demographic bases against a president or governor. For example, the dismissal of a political officeholder in a cabinet reshuffle does not justify launching a tirade or smear campaign against the president, who may have valid reasons for making that decision. Nigeria’s interests should always be the primary motivation for political action.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not always the case. What is clear in today’s political climate is the frustration stemming from the fallout of the 2023 election defeat. The widespread indignation within the opposition regarding the president’s policies, appointments, and actions is a direct consequence of their exclusion from power in our winner-takes-all political system. Not being in power means politicians cannot recover the substantial investments made during the elections. For those who are not extremely wealthy, this is a significant setback.\n\nIncumbent officeholders, especially the president, must focus on performance and delivering the dividends of democracy. Wasting energy on daily media skirmishes with the opposition is a dangerous distraction, one that could hurt them come election day. The scorecard of an officeholder seeking reelection will ultimately determine whether they secure a fresh mandate.\n\nPresident Tinubu is advised to focus squarely on his programs and not dismiss opposition criticisms or public outcry. It is wrong for the federal government to perceive every move or comment from the opposition as an attempt at blackmail or sabotage. Some criticisms are genuine, valid, and legitimate. While street protests should not become a permanent outlet for public frustration, as they risk losing their potency or being hijacked by hoodlums, the federal government should not deny the public the right to protest, as such rights are guaranteed by our constitution.\n\nOur politicians should also understand that opposition in a U.S.-style presidential system operates differently than in a Westminster system, such as that practiced in Britain. In a presidential system, once an election is over, the opposition generally goes into abeyance, remaining active in parliament but not outside it. Until the unique, extraordinary era of Donald Trump, it was rare for a former president to publicly criticize an incumbent president in the United States. The president in power in America does not face a vociferous opposition like we do in Nigeria. What is happening in the U.S. now, with Trump’s policies and controversial actions, is stoking a fire of loud reactions from the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Britain, the main opposition party forms what they call a “shadow cabinet,” where opposition members propose policy options for the incumbent prime minister to accept or reject. In contrast, we seem to be mixing up these two models in our practice of the presidential system. While opposition politicians are free to present their ideas, they should not abuse, denigrate, or attack the incumbents in the manner that our opposition politicians often do. A thorough political education is needed to teach our politicians how to properly behave in a presidential system.\n\n•Ayodeji, speaker, author, pastor, can be reached on 09059243004 (SMS, WhatsApp only)","summary":"The 2027 general election may still be a long way off, but the political atmosphere is already heating up, with politicians vying to succeed President Bola Tinubu.

Previously enslaved black Americans and their children were not considered citizens. The amendment gave them citizenship by saying all people born in the U.S. had that right.\n\nBut courts also ruled the amendment applied to those of any nationality born in the United States. \n\nIn 1898, the Supreme Court affirmed birthright citizenship in a landmark case, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, guaranteeing automatic citizenship for nearly all children born in the country. \n\nSince then, courts have upheld that expansive interpretation. \n\nBut some conservatives have a different view. \n\nThe 14th Amendment includes a phrase that citizenship applies only to people who are 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States. \n\nSome conservatives have argued that foreign national parents who are in the US illegally may not be viewed as meeting that requirement. \n\nIn his January 20th executive order, Trump tried to redefine the 14th Amendment by saying children born to illegal immigrants or to those on temporary non-immigrant visas are not citizens at birth.\n\nHe called citizenship 'a priceless and profound gift.'\n\nThe Trump administration argued that children of noncitizens are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States, a phrase used in the amendment, and therefore are not entitled to citizenship. \n\nStates, immigrants and rights groups sued to block Trump's executive order and accused the administration of trying to unsettle the broader understanding of birthright citizenship that has been accepted since the amendment's adoption. \n\nThe order remains paused until the Supreme Court can hear the case next month.\n\nThe Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to find that lower courts had erred in imposing bans on the birthright citizenship policy that extended beyond the parties involved in the litigation. \n\nThe administration instead wants the justices to allow Trump's plan to go into effect for everyone except the handful of people and groups that sued. \n\nFailing that, the administration says that the plan could remain blocked for now in the 22 states that sued. \n\nIt did not ask the court to weigh in on the constitutionality of that executive order, which was challenged soon after it was signed. \n\nBut the justices probably will find it hard to avoid that underlying issue. \n\nIf the court is inclined to agree with the administration, it risks creating a confusing patchwork of rules in which the state in which a child is born could determine whether citizenship is granted automatically.\n\nSeveral justices have raised concerns in the past about nationwide, or universal, injunctions, but the court has never ruled on the matter.\n\nThe administration made a similar argument in Trump's first term, including in the Supreme Court fight over his ban on travel to the U.S. from several Muslim majority countries.\n\nThe court eventually upheld Trump's policy, but did not take up the issue of nationwide injunctions.","summary":"President Donald Trump was ecstatic on Thursday when the Supreme Court decided to hear his birthright citizenship case.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14624105/trump-reaction-birthright-citizen-supreme-court.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/18/01/97412973-0-image-a-17_1744935597541.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:28:54","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin,Nikki Schwab,Wires","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin","Nikki Schwab","Wires"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":312291690,"title":"Ceasefire in Ukraine unrealistic at this point, Russia’s UN envoy says","text":"UNITED NATIONS, April 18. /TASS/.

Can a new government fix it?","text":"Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem. \n\nWillow Yamauchi says she was just a \"regular\" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; £236,400) in today's dollars.\n\nThat same property is now worth several million. \n\nIn the city in Canada's pacific northwest, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.\n\n\"My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,\" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side. \n\nThe same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without \"the bank of mom and dad\" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.\n\nVancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report by Chapman University in California last year listed it among the top \"impossibly unaffordable\" cities in the world. \n\nBut it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.\n\nIn 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nFor many Canadians, housing is one of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada. Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis. Its success on pocketbook issues in general had threatened to collapse of the governing Liberal party, which only recently catapulted to the top of the polls in the wake of a trade war with the US.\n\nEven with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two federal leaders debate this week. During the French debate, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade. \n\n\"I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,\" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y75v5l7o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b557/live/83ad2730-1a34-11f0-b287-9bbf4848835b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:25:02","author":"Nadine Yousif","authors":["Nadine Yousif"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":312292324,"title":"U.S.-born citizen held by ICE in Florida jail despite birth certificate presented in court","text":"A 20-year-old United States citizen was held in a Florida jail at the request of federal immigration authorities despite his mother showing his birth certificate and Social Security information to a judge in court.\n\nJuan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was taken to Leon County Jail after a traffic stop and charged with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien” under a state law that has been temporarily blocked from enforcement by a federal judge.\n\nThe charge was dropped, but Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans claimed on Thursday that she did not have jurisdiction to release him after Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested that he remain in detention, according to court records. The Florida Phoenix first reported the arrest.\n\nLopez-Gomez was eventually released on Thursday evening.\n\n“The Constitution provides guardrails to protect due process and prevent unlawful arrests,” American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Florida legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney Amy Godshall said in a statement to The Independent.\n\nHis detention was “based on a patently false allegation that he entered the state while undocumented,” she said. “All this despite his mother appearing in court with his Social Security card and his birth certificate showing his place of birth as the United States.”\n\nHe was traveling from Georgia when he was stopped by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper. Governor Ron DeSantis’s sweeping anti-immigration law, signed in 2023, makes it a state crime for an undocumented immigrant to enter the state without legal permission.\n\nThat law was blocked two weeks ago, “meaning that law enforcement cannot make arrests under its blocked provisions. Full stop,” Godshall said.\n\n“U.S. citizens should not be detained by ICE, yet they are continuing to get swept up in these racially motivated raids and collateral arrests,” she said.\n\nLopez-Gomez’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, according to the Florida Phoenix.\n\nHis mother burst into tears when she saw her son virtually at his court hearing on Thursday, the outlet reported.\n\n“I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there,” she said.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from ICE.\n\nThe arrest and ongoing detention of an American-born citizen follows Donald Trump’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda that has deployed federal agents into communities across the country and summarily removed dozens of immigrants.\n\nThursday’s court hearing came as a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. issued a blistering ruling that rejected the president’s attempt to block a lower-court ruling instructing the administration to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongly deported Salvadoran father now imprisoned in a notorious jail in his home country.\n\n“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” Appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?”\n\nA federal judge in Florida is considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction to further block Florida’s law, which makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter the state “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”\n\n“The Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda and Florida’s anti-immigrant law can only be implemented by abandoning the fundamental principle of due process,” Godshall said. “We are seeing this in real-time.

excluding training - in the last five years. \nBut it isn't only coppers heading south of the equator, as an increase of 'Poms' arriving in Australia has only been bolstered by visa rules bringing up the cut-off age of applicants from 30 to 35.\nAnd while many would be put off by the higher cost of living, others who are drawn to the improved work-life balance and higher salaries are willing to make the 24-hour flight across the other side of the world.\nJames Smith, 35, first took the plunge to move to Australia after taking an 'introspective' look at his live as a personal trainer in Bracknell in 2016 - and after a decade in the sun he has never looked back.\nThe former door-to-door salesman has only gone from strength-to-strength since restarting his life Down Under and is now at the helm of several firms including Business Mentorship.\nExplaining the difference between British life and that on the sandy beaches in Oceania, he told MailOnline: 'You don't realise your life is a five out of 10 until maybe you go somewhere a bit better.\n'Everything in my career started taking off when I hit Australia, and I think it was from a few things - I think its because my lifestyle here.'\nThe personal trainer, who recently became a proud father for the first time, divulged he initially made the decision to move after discovering his profession was taken 'more seriously' in Australia.\n\nJames Smith, 35, first took the plunge to move to Australia after taking an 'introspective' look at his live as a personal trainer in Bracknell in 2016\n\nDespite loving the Aussie lifestyle, Ms Egan - who runs YouTube account Eat Venture Vlogs - warned that the cost of housing was an issue\n\n'If I really wanted to do well and succeed in [personal training], I had to go somewhere where they at least care about it a bit more,' he told MailOnline.\nBut at the spritely age of 26 - in true British fashion - the now successful businessman was looking for people to discourage him from flying south of the equator.\n‘I remember I turned to my dad and I said “I might go to Australia for a bit” and the said to me “I've always imagined you living somewhere like that” and that really shocked me,’ he said.\n‘Not one person said to me, now you should stay in the UK - and this was from people older wise and more experienced than me.’\nExplaining how is lifestyle dramatically improve once setting sail for the Sydney, he revealed it is commonplace to wake up early, head to a local shop for a coffee and enjoy the sunshine - even on a Sunday morning.\n'When first arrived here, my housemates were like, \"Okay, tomorrow morning. It's one of our birthdays. We're all going to go down the beach at 6 am\"\n'We got up we grab a towel, we brush our teeth, we went to the beach, bought coffees, and watched the sunrise, and swam in the sea, even in the dead of winter.'\nHe added: 'UK summers, we have the sun coming up at 4am and then it goes down at 10pm, then we have the depression in the winter going and coming to work in the dark.\n'But in Australia it doesn't get that bright in the summer, and it doesn't get that dark in the winter.\n'Even when Brits come here, they don’t realise how little and infrequent we have blue skies.’\nBut life in Aus doesn't come cheap, with the average person paying A$2,715 (£1,344) per month on rent compared to £1223 in the UK.\n\nDarren (pictured with his wife Debbie and daughters Rebecca and Sophie) decided to take the plunge and move Down Under 26 years ago\n\nAmber Myrlea, 23, from Isle of Man made the journey down under after the loss of her brother adding she was worried she would 'get stuck in that cycle of island life'\n\nEXCLUSIVE We left our old lives in Britain for the sun in Australia - here's why YOU should consider it too \nGroceries are also more expensive, with researchers at Edith Cowan University pricing a trolley of supermarket goods at £160 ($324) compared to £140 in the UK.\nHowever, salaries are higher in the 'Lucky Country', averaging $100,000 (£49,480) compared to £37,430 in Britain.\nMr Smith said although housing prices in Australia were 'astronomical', day-to-day life Down Under was 'significantly' cheaper than in the UK.\nThe first apartment I had in Bondi was maybe a 10 min walk from the beach, and it was a hundred £50 a week,' he said.\n'Whereas when I lived in London during the pandemic it was £3,000 a month to have a flat in Fulham, and it was a s***hole.\n'There was people always fighting outside my house, and there was no aircon, so I always had to have the window open and the buses would piss and wake me up.'\nAnd even though most of his clientele are UK-based, as well as more opportunities on this side of the globe, the father-of-one would never return back to British soil.\n'Every time I go back it just becomes a little bit less appealing,' he said: 'in the UK, I wake up and there's nothing else to do in the dark for four hours, I'm starting my day with by scrolling on social media.'\n'Would rather live in peace right now. As we speak, I've got my dog on the lead and I'm looking at the ocean, my house is just behind me,' he said.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'I'll earn less money and have less opportunity. It means that all my time between work is much happier If I lived in London I'd probably have a Lambo, but I'd be miserable.'\nDespite missing his family a great deal, Mr Smith was fortunate enough to get his residency in Australia - but if he was unable to he would move anywhere but the UK.\n'If I couldn't leave live here I would look to America, and if I couldn't live in America I'd probably go to Dubai at the moment\n'I'm telling my friends like, go somewhere where they care more about your ambition,' he added: ‘When you come out here it gives you a brand new opportunity to reinvent yourself.’\nEncouraging other 'Poms' to take advantage of the myriad opportunities Australia has to offer, he said: 'Young people, especially if they're not sure what to do with their lives -come out here.\n'You could get a job in a coffee shop and have the best 3 months of your life, rather than being so focused on career.\n'Social media is making people feel like if they've not made a million dollars at 25 that they're old.\n'Come out to Australia, hit, pause on life. The best party is here. We're right in the middle of summer.'\n\nJames told MailOnline: 'You don't realise your life is a five out of 10 until maybe you go somewhere a bit better.\n\nSince arriving in Australia nearly a decade ago James has established his own family and is at the helm of several businesses\n\n'Come out to Australia, hit, pause on life. The best party is here. We're right in the middle of summer,' he said\n\n We moved to Australia and are never coming back \nDarren Bowles, 57, took the plunge and moved to Australia for a better quality of life and more opportunities for his children 26 years ago.\nAnd after over two-decades in sunny paradise, the father-of-two gave a vehement 'no' when asked if he would ever return to Britain, adding: 'I couldn’t stand the cold weather and dark nights.\n'When you're my age my knees and my elbows will start to hurt in the cold weather again. I couldn't do it.'\nDarren was working in Manchester as a senior electrical engineer for Kellogg's, when he and his wife decided to relocate their then family-of-three Down Under.\nHis in-laws had already moved to Australia but after realising how much his then two-year-old daughter Rebecca loved the country, he knew it was the right way to go.\nHe told MailOnline: 'What tipped it for me is when we came over on holiday. We brought Rebecca here on holiday, when she was aged 2 and she just loved it, going to the beach paddling in the sea, we could do more outdoors.'\nThree months after they moved to the other side of the globe, he and his wife welcomed their youngest daughter Sophie.\nDespite the overall higher living costs, Darren said he knew the decision would be better for his daughters in 'the long term'.\n'There are more opportunities and a better lifestyle,' he said: 'I think Australia's has some great education and universities.\n'My youngest daughter's still living with us at home, but my eldest daughter's living, my eldest daughter's living in Sydney, which is a fabulous city.'\n'Even when it's not in the summertime. It's nice and warm. At 6 o'clock in the morning quite often my youngest daughter will go to the beach for a walk or a swim.'\n\nHe is adamant he made the right decision for his family, with describing the Aussie lifestyle as 'better' and divulging there were more opportunities in the country for his daughters (Pictured left to eight: Rebecca, her husband Ryan, Darren, his wife Debbie and their youngest child Sophie)\n\nOver the last few years, the 57-year-old has also taken advantage of the abundance of opportunities in Australia exponentially growing his electrical engineering business - something he believes would't have been possible in the UK (pictured with friends and family)\nHe added: 'You just feel as though that you're not stuck in the house watching TV. You're going out and enjoying your life.'\nDarren said there was a 'significant difference' between British and Aussie life, divulging there was 'more of a positive feeling' on the other side of the Equator. \nOver the last few years, the 57-year-old has also taken advantage of the abundance of opportunities in Australia.\nHis mining electrical engineering business - the GTE group - has grown from a workforce of three to 104 in only eight years, a feat he believes would not have been possible in the UK.\n'You push yourself to actually go and do more,' he said: 'I would say I've done pretty well, and that I’m very successful. I wouldn't have achieved this success in England.'\nAlthough he missed family, friends and attending Manchester United matches, Darren said there was more of a 'sense of community', noting that Aussies were more willing to help.\n'There used to be that [sense of community] in the UK and certainly in the seventies when I was growing up,' he said.\n'I think England's changed a lot, because a lot of lots of you know, more people move around a lot more these days.'\n\nAmber found it incredibly difficult to find work when she first came to Australia and even considered moving back home\n\nBut after meeting her 'adopted grandma' Kay Setches - previous minister for Victoria - through a Work Away position, she quickly learned the ropes of the country\n\n British expat branded a 'whingeing Pom' after making wild claim about Aussies \nDarren revealed that 'virtually every person' he knows, who has visited the sunny country has wanted to move\n'The only difficult thing is leaving family and friends at home, it was very very difficult. It took a bit of a toll on myself,' he quipped.\nDespite the difficulties, he urged other Brits to take the plunge, advising sun-seeking hopefuls to make sure they have 'the right skills' when making the move.\n'I think when people come over here, they've just got to give everything a go. They've got to give it the best shot,' he added.\n'Come here with an idea of going to give you the best shot for two years and see how you get on - and meet people and talk to people.'\n23-year-old Amber Myrlea also traded in her everyday life on the Isle of Man for work away job on Phillip Island off the coast of Melbourne after the loss of her brother.\n'Being stuck on an island for 23 years of my life, there's not a lot of opportunities for young people and it kind of sucks the life out of you,' she said.\n'You only have your connections and that's it. There's no fun and nowhere to go.\n'I understand why people would be skeptical - I had to quit my job, sell my car - and I didn't know what I was coming to. I just had hope and faith it would work out.'\n\nCrediting Kay as well as other Aussies for their kindness, the 23-year-old now hopes to stay Down Under permanently\n\nEchoing Darren on how 'welcoming Australians' are, Amber said: 'They're very helpful, whenever you've got an issue. They're generous people.'\nShe added:' if I hadn't met Kim, the lady I moved in with, maybe I would have had to return home to the UK.\n'But I needed somewhere to stay and she needed someone to look after her.\n'She's been very influential to me. She's an ex-member of parliament and there's so much about Australia she has to teach me.\n'She has become an adopted member of my family - my adopted grandma.'\nAmong those taking advantage of the growing relocation opportunities in Australia is content creator Kody Egan, who moved to Australia in August with her partner, Joseph Horrocks.\nThe couple, who are both 27 and previously lived in Atherton, Greater Manchester, now live in Queensland's Sunshine Coast. Despite only planning to stay in Australia for a short time, they now want to make a new life there.\n'We wanted a new challenge and to try something new after coming for a month of travelling the year before,' Ms Egan told MailOnline.\n'We saved up and made the plunge - mostly to experience more of an outdoor lifestyle including the beach, surfing, hiking and all the amazing nature.\n\nYouTuber Ms Egan loves the outdoor lifestyle that's on offer Down Under \n\nKody Egan moved to Australia in August with her partner, Joseph Horrocks. They previously lived in Atherton, Greater Manchester\n'It's a big change and we'd recommend doing what we did and come for a holiday first. We had no intention of living here at first, but wanted to after experiencing the people and the lifestyle! We're so grateful for the Aussies, they're great.'\nDespite loving the Aussie lifestyle, Ms Egan - who runs YouTube account Eat Venture Vlogs - warned that the cost of housing was an issue.\n'Like in the UK there's a housing crisis here, so rentals are really expensive - as are living costs in general. So it's important to factor that in when budgeting for a move,' she explained.\n'Coming over to live and work is very different from the holiday but we really are enjoying the experience. We're big nature lovers so seeing all the new species of plants, birds etc has been incredible.\n'We started our YouTube vlog so our family and friends could see what we got up too daily as some of them really missed us when we left, but we've since reached a much bigger audience and the vlog is growing every day.'\nEmily Brady, a 25-year-old nurse, headed Down Under last December with her 29-year-old partner Harry Bridges, a motor mechanic.\n\nDespite only planning to stay in Australia for a short time, the couple now want to make a new life there\nThey quickly found well-paying jobs in Kalgoorlie, a mining city 370 miles east of Perth in Western Australia.\nMs Brady, who previously worked on a paediatric oncology ward in Wales, now earns up to three times more than she did in the UK.\n'While I loved the job, it was very underfunded, very short staffed and you could work as many hours as you wanted but you weren't really given any recognition for that,' she told The Times.\n'And I felt like it was just always an uphill battle. It was really exhausting. So I wanted to try nursing over in Australia where it was meant to be one of the best places in the world for nursing.'\nThe nurse said she particularly valued the better working conditions in Australia, adding that she and her partner now plan to stay and have children in the country.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAustralian police launch campaign to lure disillusioned British cops across the world - as officer who made the move says it was 'best decision I've ever made'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

In three of the videos, he was walking a dog during the vandalism.\n\nA 33-year-old man was arrested and booked into jail Wednesday morning, before being released Thursday afternoon. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said it has the case and is reviewing for possible charges. The Minnesota Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged.\n\nIt appeared the man was writing something on the cars in some of the videos, but police did not disclose what was written or what the motive may have been. \n\nOver the past couple of months, people across the country have vandalized Tesla vehicles in protest of Elon Musk, an advisor to President Donald Trump, and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as they significantly cut the amount of federal government workers. \n\nThe estimated damages to the Teslas ranged from about $1,600 on one car to $10,370 on another, according to a Minneapolis police spokesman.\n\nChristine Vander Hook, one of the vandalized Tesla owners, shared pictures showing a single letter, “F” that was scratched into her passenger door around 2 p.m. on March 24, while she was at work. On the back of the car, there was less clear scribbling. She and her husband think it looks like a failed attempt at a swastika.\n\nVander Hook was frustrated by the decision to target her car that sustained about $2,000 worth of damage, adding that it had a bumper sticker indicating her family is not in support of the Trump administration.","summary":"Police say the videos show the 33-year-old walking up to the Tesla cars and using a key to scrape them.

The two deceased victims have not been publicly identified; however, police say they are not students.\n\n While speaking with reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, Trump was asked if there are any changes he wants to see in gun legislation due to the shooting.\n\n \"I'm a big advocate of the Second Amendment, I have been from the beginning,\" Trump said in a clip published by C-SPAN. \"I protected it.\"\n\n \"These things are terrible. But the gun doesn't do the shooting, the people do — a phrase that's used probably too often,\" Trump continued. \"It's a shame. I'm just hearing about it now. I know the area very well, I know the school very well, it's Florida.\"\n\n Trump said he will \"have more to say\" in the future, \"Only in terms of what happened.\" However, he does not plan on pushing for changes in legislation.\n\n \"This has been going on for a long time. I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment, I ran on the Second Amendment among many other things, and I will always protect the Second Amendment.\"\n\n Throughout the 2024 presidential election, Trump kept the protection of the Second Amendment at the forefront of his campaign. In 2025, the Trump administration announced plans to roll back a program that cracks down on federally licensed gun dealers who falsify business records, and has plans to skip customer background checks, per the New York Times.\n\n Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also addressed the fatal shooting in a video shared to his official X account. He stated that he and his wife, Casey DeSantis, \"stand in solidarity and are praying for the entire Florida State community.\"\n\n \"We're mourning the two individuals who lost their lives,\" DeSantis continued, adding, \"And we wish well those who are currently recovering in the hospital. This killer must and will be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\n DeSantis also thanked first responders who were able to neutralize the suspect and stop him \"from inflicting more harm.\"\n\n \"We are all Seminoles today,\" said DeSantis, referencing the university's mascot.\n\n Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil stated in a press conference earlier that Ikner is the son of a sheriff's deputy who had been with the department for 18 years.\n\n Authorities believe he is a student at the university, per the Associated Press. Florida State University Police Department is in charge of the investigation, the Leon County Sheriff's Department told PEOPLE.\n\n Three different guns were found in connection with the suspect: a handgun on him at the scene, a shotgun in the student union, and another handgun in the suspect's car, CNN reports.\n\n A motive for the mass shooting at Florida State University remains under investigation.","summary":"The shooting occurred on the University's Tallahassee campus on April 17","url":"https://people.com/trump-reacts-to-deadly-florida-state-university-shooting-11717650","image":"https://people.com/thmb/vOdyEuE0f1O5NVhBXqIo2RpDORE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1026x477:1028x479)/Donald-Trump-oval-office-041725-237620d2bfeb4a628174e594593d22cc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:14:41","author":"Madison E.

Kilmar Ábrego García, 29, was booted out of the US earlier this year following an \"administrative error\", the government admitted, but still finds himself in the jail, which is home to gang members. Pressure grows on the Trump administration to release the young father, who lived in Maryland with his wife Jennifer and children. Jennifer spoke this week of her heartbreak to continue to be without her partner . Now, a federal appeals court says it is \"shocking\" The Trump administration claims it can’t do anything to free Mr Ábrego García. When asked about the findings of the three-judge panel at the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals, Mr Trump ducked reporters' questions on Thursday evening. The world leader had sent more than 260 Venezuelans and Salvadorans, who officials were gang members, packing last month - but Mr Ábrego García was not linked to such crime and had protected legal status in Maryland. This was considered on Thursday by the judges, who unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with her instruction to facilitate the dad's return. The panel said the Republican president's government is \"asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.\" \"Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, wrote in the scathing seven-page report. The appeals court panel concluded the man deserves due process, even if the government can connect him to a gang. The report adds: \"If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order.\" But when asked by journalists if he believed Mr Ábrego García was entitled to due process, Mr Trump dodged the grilling. The 78-year-old politician said: \"I have to refer, again, to the lawyers. I have to do what they ask me to do.\" Speaking in the Oval Office, the President added: “I had heard that there were a lot of things about a certain gentleman — perhaps it was that gentleman — that would make that case be a case that’s easily winnable on appeal. So we’ll just have to see.

That would be \"catastrophic for our business,\" Le says.\n\nAnd selling to Vietnamese consumers is not an option, he adds: \"We cannot compete with Chinese products. This is not just our challenge. Many Vietnamese companies are struggling in their own home market.\"\n\nTrump tariffs in 2016 sent a glut of cheap Chinese imports, originally intended for the US, into South East Asia, hurting many local manufacturers. But they also opened new doors for other businesses, often into global supply chains that wanted to cut their dependence on China.\n\nBut Trump 2.0 threatens to shut those doors. And that's a blow for fast-growing economies like Vietnam and Indonesia that are gunning to be key players in industries from chips to electric vehicles.\n\nThey also find themselves stuck between the world's two biggest economies - China, a powerful neighbour and their biggest trading partner, and the US, a key export market, which could be looking to strike a deal at Beijing's expense.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been visiting Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week, urging unity against Trump's tariffs. The trip was long planned but has fresh urgency given how significant South East Asia is to the Chinese economy.\n\nChina earned a record $3.5tn from exports in 2024 - 16% of its exports go to South East Asia, making it the biggest market.\n\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC on Tuesday, ahead of Xi's visit.\n\n\"If the issue is about something that we feel is against our interest, then we will protect [ourselves].\"\n\nA wake-up call\n\nIn the days after Trump unveiled his sweeping tariffs, South East Asian governments scrambled into deal-making mode.\n\nIn what Trump described as a \"very productive call\" with Vietnamese leader To Lam, the latter offered to completely scrap tariffs on US goods.\n\nThe US market is crucial to Vietnam, an emerging electronics powerhouse where manufacturing giants like Samsung, Intel and Foxconn, the Taiwanese firm contracted to make iPhones, have set up shop.\n\nMeanwhile, Thai officials are headed to Washington with a plan that includes higher US imports and investments. The US is their largest export market, so they are hoping to avoid the 36% levy on Thailand that Trump may reinstate.\n\n\"We will tell the US government that Thailand is not only an exporter but also an ally and economic partner that the US can rely on in the long term,\" Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said.\n\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has ruled out retaliation against Trump's tariffs, instead choosing to emphasise their economic and political importance to the US.\n\n\"We understand the concerns of the US,\" Mr Zafrul told the BBC. \"That's why we need to show that actually we, Asean, especially Malaysia, can be that bridge.\"\n\nIt's a role that South East Asia's export-driven economies have played well - they have benefitted from both Chinese and US trade and investment. But Trump's paused levies could derail that.\n\nIndonesia, which could face 32% tariffs, is home to vast nickel reserves and has its sights set on the global electric vehicle supply chain. Malaysia, which is gearing up to be a semiconductor hub, could be hit with 24% tariffs.\n\nCambodia, a Chinese ally, faces the steepest levies: 49%. One of the poorest countries in the region, it has thrived as a trans-shipment hub for Chinese businesses seeking to skirt US tariffs. Chinese businesses currently own or operate 90% of the clothes factories, which mainly export to the US.\n\nTrump may have hit pause on these tariffs but \"the damage is done,\" says Doris Liew, an economist at Malaysia's Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs.\n\n\"This serves as a wake-up call for the region, not only to reduce reliance on the US, but also to re-balance overdependence on any single trade and export partner.\"\n\nChina's loss and South East Asia's gain\n\nIn these uncertain times , Xi Jinping is tyring to send a steadfast message: Let's join hands and resist \"bullying\" from the US.\n\nThat is no easy task because South East Asia also has trade tensions with Beijing.\n\nIn Indonesia, business owner Isma Savitri is worried that Trump's 145% tariffs on China means more competition from Chinese rivals who can no longer export to the US.\n\n\"Small businesses like us feel squeezed,\" says the owner of sleepwear brand Helopopy. \"We are struggling to survive against an onslaught of ultra-cheap Chinese products.\"\n\nOne of Helopopy's popular pyjamas sells for $7.10 (119,000 Indonesian rupiah). Isma says she has seen similar designs from China going for around half that price.\n\n\"South East Asia, being close by, with open trade regimes and fast-growing markets, naturally became the dumping ground,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, visiting fellow at the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"Politically, many countries are reluctant to confront Beijing, which adds another layer of vulnerability.\"\n\nWhile consumers have welcomed competitively-priced Chinese products - from clothes to shoes to phones - thousands of local businesses have not been able to match such low prices.\n\nMore than 100 factories in Thailand have closed every month for the last two years, according to an estimate from a Thai think tank. During the same period in Indonesia, around 250,000 textile workers were laid off after some 60 garment manufacturers shut, local trade associations say - including Sritex, once the region's largest textile maker.\n\n\"When we see the news, there are lots of imported products flooding the domestic market, which messes up our own market,\" Mujiati, a worker who was laid off from Sritex in February after 30 years, tells the BBC.\n\n\"Maybe it just wasn't our luck,\" says the 50-year-old, who is still hunting for work. \"Who can we complain to? There's no one.\"\n\nSouth East Asian governments responded with a wave of protectionism, as local businesses demanded to be shielded from the impact of Chinese imports.\n\nLast year, Indonesia considered 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese goods and blocked e-commerce site Temu, popular among Chinese merchants. Thailand tightened inspections of imports and imposed an additional tax on goods worth less than 1,500 Thai baht ($45; £34).\n\nThis year Vietnam has twice imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel products. And after Trump's latest tariffs announcement, Vietnam is reportedly set to crack down on Chinese goods being trans-shipped via its territory to the US.\n\nAllaying these fears would have been on Xi's agenda this week.\n\nChina is concerned that channelling its US-bound exports to the rest of the world would \"end up really alienating and aggravating\" its trading partners, David Rennie, the former Beijing bureau chief for the Economist newspaper, told BBC's Newshour.\n\n\"If a tidal wave of Chinese exports ends up swamping those markets and damaging employment and jobs … that's a massive diplomatic and geopolitical headache for the Chinese leadership.\"\n\nChina has not always had an easy relationship with this region. Barring Laos, Cambodia and a war-torn Myanmar, the others are wary of Beijing's ambitions. \n\nTerrirorial disputes in the South China have soured ties with the Philippines. This is also an issue with others such as Vietnam and Malaysia, but trade has been a balancing factor.\n\nBut that might change now, experts say.\n\n\"South East Asia had to think about whether they really wanted to offend China. Now this complicates things,\" says Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore.\n\nChina's loss could be South East Asia's gain.\n\nHao Le, in Vietnam, says he has seen a surge in enquiries from American customers scouting for new electronics suppliers, outside of China: \"In the past, US buyers would take months to switch suppliers. Today, such decisions are made within days.\"\n\nMalaysia, with sprawling rubber plantations and the world's largest medical rubber glove maker, has nearly half the world's market for rubber gloves. But it is poised to grab a bigger share from its main competitor, China.\n\nThe region still faces a 10% baseline tariff, like most of the world. And that is bad news, says Oon Kim Hung, president of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association.\n\nBut even if the paused tariffs kick in, he says, customers will find paying an additional 24% on Malaysian gloves vastly preferable to the 145% levy they will jave to cough up for Chinese-made gloves.\n\n\"We're not exactly jumping with joy, but this may well benefit our manufacturers, as well as those in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.\"","summary":"When US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in his first term, Vietnamese entrepreneur Hao Le saw an opportunity.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trumps-tariffs-leave-chinas-neighbours-with-an-impossible-choice/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-982.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:06:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.04},{"id":312291554,"title":"Japan rice prices soar as core inflation accelerates","text":"Rice prices in Japan last month were almost twice what they were a year earlier, official data showed Friday, as core inflation accelerated in the world's number four economy.\n\nThe price of the grain has soared in recent months, prompting Japan's government to release some of its emergency stockpile into the market.\n\nExcluding fresh food, consumer prices rose 3.2 percent in March year-on-year compared to 3.0 percent in February -- in line with market expectations.\n\nExcluding energy as well, prices rose 2.9 percent last month, up from 2.6 percent in February.

He’s extremely cautious and prefers others to lay the groundwork before he acts,” said Professor Lee Jun-han of Incheon National University.\nHan garnered public attention on Monday by announcing his intention to take an active role in trade negotiations with the United States – prompting sharp criticism from opposition lawmakers, who accused him of overstepping his authority as acting president.\n“If necessary, I will directly communicate with President [Donald] Trump to find a resolution,” Han said, following a phone conversation with Trump last week.\nOpposition figures voiced concerns that a caretaker government should avoid engaging in significant diplomatic negotiations.\n“It is unacceptable for an acting president with fewer than 50 days left in office to initiate international negotiations that could bind the next administration,” said lawmaker Kim Joon-hyung of the splinter Rebuilding Korea Party.\nKim, who previously led the National Diplomatic Academy, warned that Han’s actions appeared calculated to boost his presidential prospects amid a global trade crisis linked to Trump’s policies.\nA Straight News poll released on Thursday showed Han leading among conservative voters with 29.6 per cent support, followed by Kim Moon-soo at 21.5 per cent and former Justice Minister Han Dong-hoon at 14.1 per cent. However, a separate poll of the general electorate found 66 per cent opposed Han entering the race, with just 24 per cent in favour.\nHan also suffered a setback on Thursday when the Constitutional Court suspended his controversial appointment of two justices – one a close ally of Yoon – to replace outgoing members.\n\nOpposition lawmakers accused him of trying to extend conservative influence over the judiciary amid potential legal challenges, including efforts to dissolve the PPP over its role in Yoon’s December 3 martial law debacle.\nMeanwhile, facing an uphill battle against the liberal Democratic Party of Korea, PPP candidates have increasingly embraced nationalist and anti-China rhetoric to gain support.\n“In our society, there are still forces pushing pro-North Korea, anti-US, pro-China, and anti-business agendas, denying liberal democracy and undermining the foundations of our nation,” Kim Moon-soo said last week.\nAnother PPP contender, Na Kyung-won called for the removal of a reading room at Seoul National University dedicated to Chinese President Xi Jinping. The room contains books donated by Xi during his 2014 visit to South Korea.\nThe PPP is also pushing to amend election laws to strip foreign residents – mostly ethnic Chinese Koreans – of the right to vote in local elections starting next year.","summary":"A new poll shows acting president Han Duck-soo, a 75-year-old technocrat, leading among conservative voters after Yoon Suk-yeol’s impeachment.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3306948/wild-card-emerges-south-koreas-presidential-race-prime-minister","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/17/72717e90-6416-4f6a-944e-7ea2e7bb756c_9b984850.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 00:00:11","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.35},{"id":312288208,"title":"'Reckless disregard': Trump’s FDA to end routine food inspections","text":"President Donald Trump's administration recently made a major announcement that could impact the United States' food supply in a significant way.\n\nCBS News reported Thursday that the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) is preparing to end all of its routine food inspections, though how and when it plans to end it depends on Congress.

President Donald Trump's trade war.The streaming television service declared itself \"off to a good start in 2025\" with a profit of $2.9 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion in the first quarter of the year.Revenue grew thanks to higher subscription and ad earnings, along with the timing of some expenses, according to Netflix.Shares in the Silicon Valley-based company were up nearly three percent in after-market trades.\"The will-they-or-won't-they tariff situation is destruction to many industries and will make entertainment more expensive to produce,\" said Emarketer senior analyst

row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink","text":"The tussle between Starlink boss Elon Musk and South Africa over the company's failure to launch in the country stems from the nation's black empowerment laws, and could be one factor behind the diplomatic row between the US and Africa's most industrialised nation.\n\nTo his more than 219 million followers on his social media platform X, Mr Musk made the racially charged claim that his satellite internet service provider was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black\".\n\nBut the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence.\n\nAs for the foreign ministry, it said the company was welcome to operate in the country \"provided there's compliance with local laws\".\n\nSo what are the legal sticking points?\n\nTo operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.\n\nThis mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid.\n\nWhite-minority rule ended in 1994 after Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress (ANC) came to power.\n\nSince then, the ANC has made \"black empowerment\" a central pillar of its economic policy in an attempt to tackle the racial injustices of the past.\n\nThis has included adopting legislation requiring investors to give local black firms a 30% stake in their businesses in South Africa.\n\nMr Musk - who was born in South Africa in 1971 before moving to Canada in the late 1980s and then to the US, where he became the world's richest man - appears to see this as the main stumbling block for Starlink to operate in the country.\n\nStarlink, in a written submission to Icasa, said the black empowerment provisions in legislation excluded \"many\" foreign satellite operators from the South African market, according to local news site TechCentral.\n\nBut foreign ministry spokesperson Clayson Monyela challenged this view in March, saying on X that more than 600 US companies, including computing giant Microsoft, were operating in South Africa in compliance with its laws - and \"thriving\".\n\nAre there attempts to end the impasse?\n\nMr Musk's Starlink has a potential ally in South Africa's Communications Minister Solly Malatsi.\n\nHe comes from the Democratic Alliance (DA) - the second-biggest party in South Africa - which joined a coalition government after the ANC failed to get a parliamentary majority in last year's election.\n\nThe DA is a fierce critic of the current black empowerment laws, claiming they have fuelled cronyism and corruption with investors forced to link up with ANC-connected companies to operate in South Africa or to win state contracts.\n\nLast October, Malatsi hinted that he was looking for a way to circumvent the 30% black equity requirement, saying he intended to issue a \"policy direction\" to Icasa with the aim of clarifying \"the position on the recognition of equity equivalent programmes\".\n\nIn simple terms, Malatsi seemed to be suggesting that Starlink would not require a black business partner in South Africa, though it would have to invest in social programmes aimed at benefiting black people - especially the poor.\n\nBut some six months later, Malatsi has failed to change the policy, with a spokesperson for his department telling the BBC that their legal team was still looking into the matter.\n\nIt seems the communications minister may be facing political resistance from ANC lawmakers in parliament.\n\nKhusela Diko, the chairperson of the parliamentary communications committee to which Malatsi is accountable, warned him earlier this month that \"transformation\" in the tech sector was non-negotiable, appearing to oppose giving Mr Musk's Starlink any special treatment.\n\nDiko said that \"the law is clear on compliance\" and, crucially added, that \"cutting corners and circumvention is not an option, least of all to appease business interests\".\n\nDiko's tough position comes as no surprise, as relations between the South African government and the US have hit rock bottom during US President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nWhy have relations deteriorated?\n\nMr Musk, part of Trump's inner circle, has railed on X against what he calls \"racist ownership laws\" in South Africa, while the US president has threatened to boycott the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in the country later this year.\n\n\"How could we be expected to go to South Africa for the very important G20 Meeting when Land Confiscation and Genocide are the primary topics of conversation? They are taking the land of white Farmers, and then killing them and their families,\" Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nHis claims of a genocide against white farmers have been widely dismissed as false, but they echo those of the tech billionaire.\n\nLast month, Mr Musk accused \"a major\" political party in South Africa - a reference to the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which came fourth in last year's election - of \"actively promoting white genocide\".\n\n\"A month ago, the South African government passed a law legalising taking property from white people at will with no payment,\" Mr Musk said.\n\n\"Where is the outrage? Why is there no coverage by the legacy media?\n\nSouth Africa did pass a law earlier this year allowing the government to seize property without compensation, but only in certain cases.\n\nNevertheless, Musk links these issues to his failure to get a licence for Starlink, making the comment in March that this was down to him not being black.\n\nHis hard-line stance comes despite meeting South Africa's president in New York last year.\n\nAt the time, Mr Musk described the meeting as \"great\", while President Cyril Ramaphosa said he had tried to persuade the billionaire to invest in South Africa.\n\n\"Meeting Elon Musk was a clear intention of mine... Some people call it bromance, so it's a whole process of rekindling his affection and connection with South Africa,\" Ramaphosa told South Africa's public broadcaster, SABC.\n\nBut he added that nothing had yet been \"bedded down\".\n\n\"As it happens with potential investors, you have to court them; you have to be talking to them, and you've got to be demonstrating to them that there is a conducive environment for them to invest. So, we will see how this turns out,\" the president said.\n\n\"He is South African-born and South Africa is his home, and I would want to see him coming to South Africa for a visit, tour or whatever.\"\n\nBut the \"bromance\" has long ended, with Mr Musk appearing to move closer to South Africa's right wing.\n\nHas Starlink had problems elsewhere in Africa?\n\nLesotho appears to have bowed to pressure from the Trump administration by announcing on Monday that it had given a 10-year licence to Starlink.\n\nIt comes after Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Lesotho, threatening thousands of jobs in the country.\n\nTrump subsequently paused that for 90 days, but a 10% tariff still came into effect on 5 April.\n\nSome reports suggest the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) cleared regulatory hurdles to stave off the threat of a further tariff hike by granting Starlink a licence.\n\nHowever, this was denied by Foreign Minister Lejone Mpotjoane.\n\n\"The licence application and the tariff negotiations should not be conflated,\" he said.\n\nThe decision to grant the licence was condemned by civil society group Section Two, which raised concern that Starlink Lesotho was 100% foreign-owned and lacked local ownership, South Africa's GroundUp news site reported.\n\n\"Such actions can only be described as a betrayal - a shameful sell-out by a government that appears increasingly willing to place foreign corporate interests above the democratic will and long-term developmental needs of the people of Lesotho,\" Section Two's co-ordinator Kananelo Boloetse was quoted as saying.\n\nDuring public consultations over Starlink's application, Vodacom Lesotho had also argued that Mr Musk's company should establish local shareholding before receiving a licence, the Space in Africa website reported.\n\n\"These concerns highlight broader tensions surrounding Starlink's operations across Africa, particularly the growing demand for local partnerships,\" it added.\n\nStarlink also appears to be seeking an exemption in Namibia from the requirement to bring in a local partner.\n\nNamibia is a former colony of Germany, and was under the rule of South Africa's white-minority regime until it gained independence in 1990.\n\nIt has more stringent requirements than its post-apartheid neighbour, with businesses operating in Namibia needing to be 51% locally owned.\n\nThe Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (Cran) told the BBC that Starlink had submitted an application for a telecommunications service licence in June 2024.\n\nCran said that while this process usually took between three to six months, a decision had not yet been taken because it \"must first wait for the ownership exemption application to be finalised\" by Namibia's information and communication technology minister.\n\nHow big is Starlink's Africa presence?\n\nStarlink is now operating in more than 20 African countries, with Somalia, hit by an Islamist insurgency, giving it a 10-year licence on 13 April, two days before Lesotho's decision to do so.\n\n\"We welcome Starlink's entry to Somalia. This initiative aligns with our vision to deliver affordable and accessible internet services to all Somalis, regardless of where they live,\" Technology Minister Mohamed Adam Moalim Ali said.\n\nStarlink aims to provide high-speed internet services to remote or underserved areas, making it a potential game-changer for rural areas unable to access traditional forms of connectivity, such as mobile broadband and fibre.\n\nThis is because Starlink, rather than relying on fibre optics or cables to transmit data, uses a network of satellites in low Earth orbit. Because they are closer to the ground, they have faster transmission speeds than traditional satellites.\n\nNigeria was the first African state to allow Starlink to operate, in 2023. The company has since grown into the second-biggest internet service provider in Africa's most-populous country.\n\nBut Starlink still has no presence in South Africa - the continent's most industrialised nation.\n\nEnterprising locals had found a way to connect to the service by using regional roaming packages purchased in countries where the service was available.\n\nStarlink put an end to this last year while Icasa also warned local companies that those found providing the service illegally could face a hefty fine.\n\nYet with an estimated 20% of South Africans not having access to the internet at all - many in rural areas - it could prove beneficial for both Starlink and the government to reach a compromise.\n\nFor Starlink, it could prove a lucrative market, while satellite broadband may help the government achieve its goal of providing universal internet access by 2030.\n\nOn Monday, Ramaphosa appointed former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas as his special envoy to the US, signalling his determination to mend relations with the Trump administration.\n\nBut Jonas' appointment faced a backlash in right-wing circles, as in a 2020 speec,h he called Trump a \"racist homophobe\" and a \"narcissistic right-winger\".\n\nIn an interview on the Money Show podcast, Jonas said that he made the comments when he was not in government and \"people move on\".\n\nHe acknowledged that it would be a \"long slog to rebuild understanding\", but added that South Africa's relationship with the US was \"fundamentally important\" and he was determined to improve it.\n\nJonas' comments are not surprising as the US is a major trading partner for South Africa. With Trump having threatened a 30% tariff on its goods, Ramaphosa cannot afford to see relations continuing to deteriorate and the economy taking further knocks.","summary":"The tussle between Starlink boss Elon Musk and South Africa over the company's failure to launch in the country stems from the nation's black empowerment laws,","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/racially-charged-row-between-musk-and-south-africa-over-starlink/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/starlink23.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:53:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Foreign Minister Lejone","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Foreign Minister Lejone"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":312285728,"title":"Temu and Shein to raise US prices from next week over Trump’s tariffs","text":"China-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for US customers starting next week, a ripple effect from US President Donald Trump’s attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world’s two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China.\nTemu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate but nearly identical notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs”.\nBoth companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting on April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases. It was unclear why the two rivals posted almost identical statements on their shopping sites.\nSince launching in the United States, Shein and Temu have given Western retailers a run for their money by offering products at ultra-low prices, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising.\nThe 145 per cent tariff Trump slapped on most products made in China, coupled with his decision to end a customs exemption that allows goods worth less than US$800 to come into the US duty-free, has dented the business models of the two platforms.\nE-commerce companies have been the biggest users of the widely used exemption. Trump signed an executive order this month to eliminate the “de minimis provision” for goods from China and Hong Kong starting May 2, when they will be subject to the 145 per cent import tax.\nAs many as 4 million low-value parcels – most of them originating in China – arrive in the US every day under the soon-to-be cancelled provision.\nUS politicians, police agencies and business groups lobbied to remove the long-standing exemption, describing it as a trade loophole that gave inexpensive Chinese goods an advantage and served as a portal for illicit drugs and counterfeits to enter the country.\n\nShein sells inexpensive clothes, cosmetics and accessories, primarily targeting young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Temu, which promoted its goods through online ads, sells a wider array of products, including household items, humorous gifts and small electronics.\nLast year the companies were among the largest advertising spenders on social media platforms, but they have both slashed that spending in recent weeks, according to data analytics provider Sensor Tower. That could be bad news for the platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snap, X and TikTok that rely on advertising.\nIn November, American e-commerce giant Amazon launched a low-cost online shopfront featuring electronics, clothing and other products priced at under US$20. Many of the electronics, clothing and other products on the shopfront on Wednesday resembled the types of items typically found on Shein and Temu.\nIn their customer notices about the pending price increases, the companies encouraged customers to keep shopping in the days ahead.\n“We’ve stocked up and stand ready to make sure your orders arrive smoothly during this time,” Temu’s statement said. “Were doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimise the impact on you.”","summary":"The China-founded e-commerce sites said they would be making ‘price adjustments’ from April 25 but did not

aiming to revive Fleet Street's cultural legacy. \n\nOnce the powerhouse of British journalism and birthplace of the printing press, the thoroughfare was the epicentre of the country's literary and publishing output for centuries.\n\nNow, the rich heritage of this part of London is set to be reawakened next month with The Fleet Street Quarter Festival of Words.\n\nThe four-day event's programme is headlined by Booker Prize-winning author Ben Okri, who will discuss his latest novella Madame Sosostris, while Kate Mosse OBE celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Women's Prize for fiction.\n\nAmong the guests is former British spy Chris Steele, best known for compiling the so-called 2016 Steele dossier on unverified claims that Mr Trump had been 'compromised' by the Kremlin.\n\nThe ex-agent, who led MI6's Russia desk, will discuss his book Unredacted in which he warns of the threats posed to democracy by the US President and his connections to Russia.\n\nBroadcaster Jeremy Vine will also take part, hosting a new crime fiction series called Murder on Line One alongside fellow broadcaster and writer Simon Mayo. \n\nFestival director Damian Collins OBE, a former chairman of the Commons committee for culture, media and sport, said: 'Fleet Street is known around the world as a centre of news, ideas and great storytelling, and is therefore the perfect setting for this festival.'\n\nHe added: 'We are building a programme that embraces all forms of expression from the best of non-fiction and fiction books to journalism, screen writing and the spoken word.' \n\nThe former MP will be taking part in a panel on AI alongside Baroness Beeban Kidron, the filmmaker who is campaigning against government plans to overhaul copyright rules for AI companies.\n\nThe festival, to be held from May 14 to 17, will include breakfast news briefings on the day's headlines, lunchtime discussions and a series of evening talks.\n\nTickets can be booked here.","summary":"Chris Steele is best known for compiling the so-called 2016 Steele dossier on unverified claims that Donald Trump had been 'compromised' by the

immediately clear when the 26-year-old will be arraigned. \n\nA message seeking comment was left by AP for a spokesperson for his lawyers.\n\nMr Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a prominent

following through on the president's campaign promise to vigorously pursue capital punishment.\n\nIt is the first death penalty case sought by the Justice Department since US President Donald Trump returned to office in January with a vow to resume federal executions after they were halted under the previous administration.\n\nThe killing and ensuing five-day manhunt leading to Mr Mangione's arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings.\n\nIt also galvanised health insurance critics — some of whom have rallied around Mr Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.\n\nSurveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Mr Thompson from behind. \n\nPolice say

certificate presented in court","text":"A 20-year-old United States citizen was held in a Florida jail at the request of federal immigration authorities despite his mother showing his birth certificate and Social Security information to a judge in court.\n\nJuan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was taken to Leon County Jail after a traffic stop and charged with illegally entering the state as an “unauthorized alien” under a state law that has been temporarily blocked from enforcement by a federal judge.\n\nThe charge was dropped, but Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggans claimed on Thursday that she did not have jurisdiction to release him after Immigration and Customs Enforcement requested that he remain in detention, according to court records. The Florida Phoenix first reported the arrest.\n\n“The Constitution provides guardrails to protect due process and prevent unlawful arrests,” American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Florida legal fellow and immigrants’ rights attorney Amy Godshall said in a statement to The Independent.\n\nHis detention was “based on a patently false allegation that he entered the state while undocumented,” she said. “All this despite his mother appearing in court with his Social Security card and his birth certificate showing his place of birth as the United States.”\n\nLopez-Gomez was eventually released on Thursday evening.\n\nHe was traveling from Georgia when he was stopped by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper. Governor Ron DeSantis’s sweeping anti-immigration law, signed in 2023, makes it a state crime for an undocumented immigrant to enter the state without legal permission.\n\nThat law was blocked two weeks ago, “meaning that law enforcement cannot make arrests under its blocked provisions. Full stop,” Godshall said.\n\n“U.S. citizens should not be detained by ICE, yet they are continuing to get swept up in these racially motivated raids and collateral arrests,” she said.\n\nLopez-Gomez’s first language is Tzotzil, a Mayan language, according to the Florida Phoenix.\n\nHis mother burst into tears when she saw her son virtually at his court hearing on Thursday, the outlet reported.\n\n“I felt immense helplessness because I couldn’t do anything, and I am desperate to get my son out of there,” she said.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from ICE.\n\nThe arrest and ongoing detention of an American-born citizen follows Donald Trump’s aggressive anti-immigration agenda that has deployed federal agents into communities across the country and summarily removed dozens of immigrants.\n\nThursday’s court hearing came as a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. issued a blistering ruling that rejected the president’s attempt to block a lower-court ruling instructing the administration to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongly deported Salvadoran father now imprisoned in a notorious jail in his home country.\n\n“If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?” Appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote. “And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?”\n\nA federal judge in Florida is considering whether to issue a preliminary injunction to further block Florida’s law, which makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter the state “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”\n\n“The Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda and Florida’s anti-immigrant law can only be implemented by abandoning the fundamental principle of due process,” Godshall said. “We are seeing this in real-time. And it is coming at the cost of lives and the rule of law.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/u-born-citizen-held-ice-234540202.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bfcd9aecf3e90101a96ffa08c8e30835","video":"","publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:45:40","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":312290416,"title":"O’Leary explains why he wants more than a trade deal with China as Trump isolates the country in tariff pressure campaign","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air April 17, 2025 06:03 \n\n O’Leary explains why he wants more than a trade deal with China as Trump isolates the country in tariff pressure campaign \n O’Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O’Leary offers his perspective on the trade war with China and comments on the ‘squawking’ between President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOSPOLITICSTRADE WARCHINA TARIFFS","summary":"O’Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O’Leary offers his perspective on the trade war with China and comments on the ‘squawking’ between President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371620836112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/801eec10-4808-4555-acdc-9db97658c278/ee90d9fb-d1ed-49c3-8e06-5a8262bb99e4/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:44:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.054},{"id":312291556,"title":"US unveils new port fees for Chinese-linked ships","text":"The United States unveiled new port fees on Chinese built and operated ships Thursday, in a bid to boost the domestic shipbuilding industry and curb China's dominance in the sector.\n\nThe move -- which stems from a probe launched under the prior administration -- comes as the United States and China are locked in a major trade war over President Donald Trump's tariffs and could further rachet up tensions.\n\n\"Ships and shipping are vital to American economic security and the free flow of commerce,\" US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in a statement announcing the new fees, most of which will begin in mid-October.\n\nUnder the new rule, per tonnage or per container fees will apply to each Chinese-linked ship's US voyage, and not at each port as some in the industry had worried.\n\nThe fee will be assessed only up to five times per year, and can be waived if the owner places an order for a US built vessel.\n\nDominant after the Second World War, the US shipbuilding industry has gradually declined and now accounts for just 0.1 percent of global output.\n\nThe sector is now dominated by Asia, with China building nearly half of all ships launched, ahead of South Korea and Japan.\n\nThe three Asian countries account for more than 95 percent of civil shipbuilding, according to UN figures.\n\nThere will be separate fees for Chinese operated ships and Chinese built ships, and both will gradually increase over subsequent years.\n\nFor Chinese built ships, the fee starts at $18 per NT or $120 per container -- meaning a ship with 15,000 containers could see a whopping fee of $1.8 million.\n\nUS groups representing some thirty industries had voiced their concerns in March about the risks such fees could have on the prices of imported products.\n\nOne business surveyed by the groups expressed worry that proposed fees, alongside tariffs on China and other countries, as well as duties on steel and aluminum imports, would put \"extraordinary pressure on US retailers.\"\n\nAll non-US built car carrier vessels will also be hit with a fee beginning in 180 days.\n\nWashington is also introducing new fees for liquified natural gas (LNG) carriers, though those do not take effect for three years.\n\nA fact sheet accompanying the announcement said fees will not cover \"Great Lakes or Caribbean shipping, shipping to and from US territories, or bulk commodity exports on ships that arrive in the United States empty.\"\n\nIn addition to the fees, Greer also announced proposed tariffs on some ship-to-shore cranes and on Chinese cargo handling equipment.\n\n\"The Trump administration's actions will begin to reverse Chinese dominance, address threats to the US supply chain, and send a demand signal for US-built ships,\" Greer said.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"The United States unveiled new port fees on Chinese built and operated ships Thursday, in a bid to boost the domestic shipbuilding industry and curb China's dominance in the sector.

This was also compared to the 3% climb in February.\n\nThe data release comes as Japan is locked in trade talks with the U.S., with U.S. President Donald Trump writing that \"big progress\" has been made.\n\nAsia's second largest economy had been hit with 25% on auto imports effective April 3, and 25% levies on steel and aluminum came into effect on March 12.\n\nTrump, however, has suspended his \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 24% on Japan for 90 days, leaving a baseline tariff of 10%.A strong inflation figure would allow the Bank of Japan to increase interest rates and normalize its monetary policy. However, with tariffs from the U.S. looming, Japan's GDP could face downward pressure, and constrain the BOJ's room for rate hikes.\n\nThis view was shared by Nomura analysts in a April 16 note, which said that they revise their outlook from two hikes to one hike by the BOJ from now to March 2027. Nomura now expects the BOJ to hike only once, in January 2026.\n\nNomura expects Japan's real GDP to grow at \"close to zero\" on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the July to September 2025 quarter due to the Trump tariffs.As such, wage growth, which is a lagging indicator, is likely to come under downward pressure around the time of 2026 shunto, or spring wage negotiations, according to Nomura. This would likely make it harder for the BOJ to hike rates during or after the 2026 shunto.","summary":"Japan's inflation grew 3.6% year on year in March, marking three straight years that the headline inflation figure is above the Bank of Japan's 2% target.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/japan-inflation-comes-in-at-3point6percent-surpasses-boj-target-for-three-straight-years-.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108133154-1744867915503-gettyimages-2200123617-AFP_36Y84TQ.jpeg?v=1744867928","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:41:55","author":"Lim Hui Jie","authors":["Lim Hui Jie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":312286726,"title":"Hayward: ‘Maryland Man’ Is the Democrats' Latest Example of Immigration Disinformation","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters \n\n BREITBART\n\nTariff Battle\nKilmar Abrego Garcia\nGoogle Guilty\nTrump vs Harvard\nJust DOGE It!\nUkraine Peace Push\n\nHayward: ‘Maryland Man’ Is the Democrats’ Latest Example of Immigration Disinformation\n\n Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nJohn Hayward17 Apr 2025 \n\nImmigration\n\nborder security\nChris Van Hollen\nDeportation\ndisinformation\nDonald Trump\nEl Salvador\nillegal immigration\nimmigration\n\nNayib Bukele\nStephen Miller \n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\nAt Least One in Custody After Shooting Reported on FSU Campus\nReport: Karmelo Anthony Renting $900K home, Bought New Car\nMan Representing Karmelo Anthony Claims Rittenhouse Used AK-47\nOcasio-Cortez Viewed as Most Likely Democrat Presidential Nominee\nFamily of Texas Murder Suspect Karmelo Anthony Cries over Death Threats\nRosie O'Donnell: My Irish Citizenship Application Has Not Been Approved\nGov.

In mid-March, the agency announced another 1,000 jobs as part of an effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that the White House says is designed to reduce federal spending.The cuts to NOAA and the National Weather Service (NWS) have sparked concerns that storms could become more deadly without the proper staff to issue forecasts and warnings. Now, the staff cuts are named as the reason for the NWS reduction of its weather balloon launches.What To KnowA public alert issued Thursday confirmed that the NWS \"may temporarily reduce or suspend scheduled radiosonde launches at selected NWS upper air sites due to staffing limitations or operational priorities.\"Thursday's announcement comes less than a month after a similar announcement shared that NWS offices in Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska; and Riverton, Wyoming, would be reducing launches to once per day.NWS weather balloons carry sensors that gather detailed temperature, humidity and wind data.\"These data support weather modeling and forecasting and are complemented by observations from aircraft, satellites, radars, surface stations, and ocean buoys,\" the NWS announcement said.The data is especially valuable in regions like the central Rockies and High Plains, where many of the recent cuts are concentrated.\"The really unfortunate thing is, where these balloons are now missing—the Colorado Rockies, the Wyoming Rockies, the northern and central High Plains—is where a lot of severe weather happens in the spring and summer months,\" said Chris Vagasky, a meteorological researcher, in an interview with NBC News.Nick Bassill, director of the State Weather Risk Communication Center at the University at Albany, explained the stakes: \"Here in New York, we often have very messy weather systems where they start as snow and turn into sleet and then freezing rain and rain,\" he told NBC News. \"We might have just one little thin layer that bumps you up above freezing, then suddenly your snowstorm turned into a rainstorm or freezing rainstorm.\"What People Are SayingAn NWS spokesperson previously told Newsweek that NOAA \"remains dedicated to its mission of providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation's environmental and economic resilience.\"City of Raleigh, North Carolina, meteorologist Ethan Clark posted on X: \"Bad, bad news: More data is being lost. This is not a good sign heading into Hurricane Season. Weather service offices are severely understaffed and underfunded. Weather data will continue to be degraded across the United States. This is unacceptable.\"Social media account @ScottDimmich posted: \"NWS Headquarters stated this morning that they \"may temporarily reduce or suspend scheduled radiosonde [weather balloon] launches at selected NWS sites due to staffing limitations or operational priorities.\" No mention of the specific sites, but not great to see this anywhere.\"NBC 6 hurricane specialist John Morales posted on X: \"And now, a blanket announcement.

The US troops have been critical not only in the operations against the Islamic State but as a buffer for the Kurdish forces against Turkey, which considers them to be aligned with terror groups. President Donald Trump tried to withdraw all forces from Syria during his first term, but he met opposition from the Pentagon because it was seen as abandoning allies and led to the resignation of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

The departure of the 600 troops will return force levels to where they had been for years, after the US and its allies waged a multiyear campaign to defeat IS. The US had maintained about 900 troops in Syria to ensure that the IS militants did not regain a foothold, but also as a hedge to prevent Iranian-backed militants from trafficking weapons across southern Syria. The number of US troops was raised to more than 2,000 after the Oct 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas in Israel, as Iranian-backed militants targeted US troops and interests in the region in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza. Three US troops in Jordan were killed by a drone fired by an Iranian-backed militia in January 2024. In December 2024, Syrian President Bashar Assad fled the country. In the months since, Syrians displaced by more than a decade of war have returned home, but the country remains unstable. Israel has targeted Syrian weapons installations, and there are some indications that the Islamic State group is trying to reconstitute itself, and Iranian-backed militias in Syria remain a threat to US interests. The withdrawal of the 600 troops was first reported by The New York Times.

As analysts warned of a looming recession — with Goldman Sachs placing the risk at 45% — the President seemed to double down on his decision, telling Americans that short-term pain was a necessary sacrifice for long-term economic sovereignty.\n\nBut by April 9, amid a dramatic sell-off in U.S. bonds and a five-point drop in Mr. Trump’s approval ratings, the President abruptly hit pause. In a partial reversal, he delayed most of the new tariffs he announced for 90 days, excluding the harsh levies on China. While the markets showed signs of stabilising slightly, the political damage had been done.\n\nWithin the Republican party, responses were fractured, blending steadfast loyalty with rising alarm over inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the global perception of America’s unpredictability.\n\nEven among MAGA loyalists, the tariffs drew scrutiny. Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump donor now leading the U.S. DOGE department’s charge to shrink government spending, raised opposition and argued against the tariffs sparking a public spat with one of the President’s economic advisers, Peter Navarro, calling him a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.\n\nA vocal supporter and hedge fund mogul, Bill Ackman, too, warned Mr. Trump of a “self-induced economic nuclear winter”, urging the President to reconsider.\n\n“Business is a confidence game. The President is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe,” Mr. Ackman posted on X after the tariff announcement, but soon after the pause was announced, he hailed the move, calling it “textbook, Art of the Deal.”\n\nThe discontent even spread to the influencer community that helped gain Mr. Trump’s popularity with a legion of young supporters during his 2024 campaign, including podcaster Barstool Sports’ David Portnoy, who claimed to have lost $20 million after Mr. Trump introduced his latest tariffs. In his podcast, he speculated his worth had gone down by 10 to 15%, saying, “If I had to guess, I’m down in these last three days probably close to [$20 million].”\n\n“But I’m still here. That’s the game,” he added. “Do I like it? No. Am I crying like, ‘Oh, woe is me, I wish I voted for Kamala,’ no.”\n\nDiscontent on the right\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Trump has championed tariffs as a tool to revive American manufacturing, viewing tariffs and trade as a matter of fairness and patriotism.\n\nEven during his campaign last year, he called for a 10% baseline tariff on almost all imports, threatened far higher rates in other circumstances and declared “tariff” to be “the most beautiful word in the dictionary”.\n\nBut the rollout of the 2025 tariffs was messy. Within hours of the ‘Liberation Day’ announcement, global markets reacted with panic. U.S. farmers faced immediate threats from China’s retaliatory 125% tariffs on American goods. .\n\nThe United States exported $143.5 billion of goods to China last year and imported $438.9 billion from that country, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\nFor decades, American agriculture has depended on exports and imported tools and fertiliser. “More than 20% of farm income comes from exports,” the American Farm Bureau warned in a statement on April 2. “These tariffs will drive up input costs and devastate access to foreign markets.”\n\nConservative commentator Ben Shapiro slammed the rollout as “about as bad as you can do,” in a video podcast released by him. “The idea that this is inherently good and makes the American economy strong is wrongheaded,” Shapiro told his audience. “It’s untrue.”\n\nStill, some GOP lawmakers stood by the President. Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Glenn Thompson, called the tariffs “an effective tool for fair trade,” pointing to how past threats had yielded concessions from countries like Colombia.\n\nOthers, however, showed signs of unease. Behind closed doors, key allies pressed Mr. Trump to reconsider. Capitol Hill, too, began to show signs of fracture.\n\nSeveral Republican senators joined the Democrats backing the Trade Review Act, a bipartisan Bill sponsored by Democrats that could strip away the President’s power to slap tariffs without congressional consent, signalling Mr. Trump’s grip on his party may be loosening.\n\nParty split\n\n“The Republican Party appears to be split on its reaction to the Trump administration’s tariffs. While they publicly applaud the President, privately, some are worried. With every member of the House of Representatives up for re-election next year, members in close districts are nervous that the administration’s policies will upset their constituents, opening space for the Democrats to win in those districts,” said David Richards, associate professor and chair of the International Relations and Political Science Department at the University of Lynchburg.\n\n“Already, district meetings held by some members have been confrontational as government cuts begin to affect people. The key will be whether the economy does not slip into recession or worse. However, with the administration seemingly changing its policies on a daily basis, party members are unsure how to explain things to the voters,” he added.\n\nDip in ratings\n\nFollowing the “Liberation Day” market chaos, public approval for the President dipped immediately. Mr. Trump’s approval rating fell to 43%, the lowest since his return to office, as Americans soured on his tariff moves and his administration’s handling of information about a military strike in Yemen, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nA Quinnipiac University survey released on April 9 found Americans widely sceptical of Mr. Trump’s tariff campaign. And an Economist/YouGov survey found a five-point spike in disapproval of Mr. Trump’s job performance, to 51%, after the tariff announcement.\n\n“I know what the hell I’m doing,” Mr. Trump told a gathering of House Republicans the night before announcing the pause of the reciprocal tariffs, bragging that countries are lining up to make trade deals. The U.S. President was speaking to political donors at the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual fundraising dinner in Washington.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent later framed the 90-day pause as a strategic masterstroke: “This was his strategy all along,” he claimed, citing calls from over 75 countries requesting negotiations.\n\nJust hours after urging freaked-out investors and voters to “BE COOL” on Truth Social media, Mr. Trump suddenly reversed course on April 9, pausing some of his sweeping tariffs for 90 days.\n\n“Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” he wrote.\n\nFollowing a week of market turmoil that rippled from stocks to crucial government bonds, Mr. Trump’s announcement on the pause came abruptly but was not surprising.\n\nCritics argue that it was investors offloading U.S. debt and demanding a high premium for buying U.S. Treasuries that compelled Mr. Trump to take the call. “The bond market is tricky,” Mr. Trump admitted to presspersons after adjusting his tariff policy. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy... jumping a little bit,” he said.\n\nMr. Richards, of the University of Lynchburg, also noted that the Democrats were capitalising on the “economic chaos.”\n\n“An important bellwether election will be the upcoming 2025 gubernatorial race in Virginia. Virginia is currently run by a popular Republican Governor who is not permitted to run again due to term limits. The problem is that the Democratic candidate is polling well ahead of the Republican one. The Democratic Party in Virginia is already running ads highlighting the economic chaos caused so far by the Trump administration, tying it back to the Republican Party. How well the GOP does in Virginia might preview how well they do in 2026,” he said.\n\nTrade war with China\n\nMr. Trump announced his first “trade war” in 2018 during his first term as President with tariffs on China, leading China to retaliate by limiting purchases of agricultural products. This is not the first time Mr. Trump has asked his supporters for patience.\n\nAmerican soybean farmers still haven’t recovered from losing one of their biggest markets in China during Mr. Trump’s first term, and for cattle ranchers especially, the tariffs will likely result in the loss of one of their biggest customers—they sold $1.6 billion worth of beef to China last year.\n\n“Our farmers are GREAT, but because of their GREATNESS, they are always put on the Front Line with our adversaries, such as China, whenever there is a Trade negotiation or, in this case, a Trade War,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday. “The same thing happened in my First Term,” he added, pointing to the $28 billion he spent bailing out farmers from his first trade war with China.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau has warned increased tariffs could threaten the economic sustainability of farmers.\n\n“Trade is critical to the success of farmers and ranchers across the country. We share the administration’s goal of levelling the playing field with our international partners, but increased tariffs threaten the economic sustainability of farmers who have lost money on most major crops for the past three years,” they said in the April 2 statement.\n\nWhether this tariff pause for all but China will extend beyond the initial 90 days Mr. Trump earmarked remains to be seen, but the change in tone signalled a rare admission of boundaries — imposed by the markets, politics, and even his own allies.\n\n(Anisha Dutta is a freelance journalist based in New York.)","summary":"Within the Republican party, responses were fractured, blending steadfast loyalty with rising alarm over inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the global perception of the U.S.’s unpredictability; even among MAGA loyalists, the tariffs drew scrutiny, with Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump donor, raising opposition, sparking a public spat with one of the President’s economic advisers, Peter Navarro","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cracks-emerge-in-gop-unity-amid-trump-trade-war/article69461252.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/7js89q/article69462011.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_38271.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:30:00","author":"Anisha Dutta","authors":["Anisha Dutta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.116},{"id":312282954,"title":"Trump says he’s in ’no rush’ to end tariffs as he meets with Italy’s Meloni","text":"President Donald Trump said Thursday (April 17, 2025) he is in “no rush” to reach any trade deals because he views tariffs as making the United States wealthy. But he suggested while meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni that it would be easy to find an agreement with the European Union and others.\n\nMr. Trump played down the likelihood of an accelerated timeline to wrap up deals, saying other countries “want to make deals more than I do.”\n\n“We're in no rush,” said Mr. Trump, hinting he has leverage because other countries want access to U.S. consumers.\n\nEven though Mr. Trump has a warm relationship with Ms. Meloni, she was unable in their meeting to change his mind on tariffs.\n\n“No, tariffs are making us rich. We were losing a lot of money under Biden,” Mr. Trump said of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. “And now that whole tide is turned.”\n\nMr. Trump is convinced that his devotion to tariffs will yield unprecedented wealth for his country even as the stock market has dropped, interest on U.S. debt has risen and CEOs are warning of price increases and job losses in what increasingly looks like a threat to the existing structure of the world economy.\n\nA bond market panic was enough for Mr. Trump to partially pull back on his tariffs, causing him to pause his 20% import taxes on the EU for 90 days and charge a baseline 10% instead. Ms. Meloni's visit showed the challenge faced even by leaders who enjoy a rapport with Trump.\n\nAfter they met, Mr. Trump told reporters that trade talks were easier than other business negotiations such as mergers. He said he had spoken with Chinese officials about tariffs “a lot” and the amount of his import taxes could be influenced by China approving a sale of the social media site TikTok. He also seemed to contradict his previous statement Thursday morning about being in no rush to make trade deals “over the next three or four weeks.”\n\nEven then, Mr. Trump showed no interest in fully severing his tariffs.\n\n“Tariff negotiations are actually simpler than everyone has said,” Mr. Trump said. “A number of people are going to pay that number or they’re going to decide to go elsewhere if there is such a place. There really is no elsewhere.”\n\nMs. Meloni had, in a sense, been “knighted” to represent the EU at a critical juncture in the fast-evolving trade war that has stoked recession fears. The U.S. administration has belittled its European counterparts for not doing enough on national security while threatening their economies with tariffs, sparking deep uncertainty about the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance.\n\nShe sought to portray the U.S. and Europe as natural allies in Western civilization and said it was important to “try to sit down and find solution” to tensions over trade and national security.\n\n“The goal for me is to make the West great again,” Ms. Meloni told Mr. Trump.\n\nThe EU is defending what it calls “the most important commercial relationship in the world,’’ with annual trade with the U.S. totaling 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion). It was unclear, based on Meloni's public interactions with Trump, whether the premier has a clear understanding of what Trump wants as part of an agreement.\n\nHis administration has said its tariffs would enable trade negotiations that would box out China, the world's dominant manufacturer. But Trump maintains that rivals and allies alike have taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, a position that has frustrated long-standing partners and raised concerns about whether Mr. Trump is a trustworthy dealmaker.\n\nMr. Trump tried to push back against claims that his tariffs are harming the economy, saying that gasoline and egg prices are already dropping. The president blamed the Federal Reserve for interest rates rising on U.S. debt. Rates largely increased because investors were worried about Trump's tariff plans and they became less willing to buy Treasury notes, while the central bank has held steady on its own benchmark rates because of economic uncertainty.\n\n“We have very little inflation,\" Mr. Trump said. “I would say we have essentially no inflation.”\n\nThe EU had already engaged with Trump administration officials in Washington. Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commissioner for trade and economic security, said he met Monday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Šefčovič said afterward on X that it would “require a significant joint effort on both sides” to get to zero tariffs and work on nontariff trade barriers, with Trump's team specifically objecting to Europe's use of value added taxes.\n\nAs the head of a far-right party, Ms. Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni’s unwavering support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe two leaders discussed the war and Italy's role in an eventual postwar reconstruction of Ukraine. Trump has previously pressed Ms. Meloni to increase Italy's defense spending, which last year fell well below the 2% of gross domestic product target for countries in the NATO military alliance. Italy’s spending, at 1.49% of its gross domestic product, is among the lowest in Europe.\n\n\"We didn’t speak about how much that percentage would be increased, even though we are truly aware that the theme of defense is particularly important,” Ms. Meloni said.\n\nDespite the differences on Ukraine and defense spending, Meloni is seen by some in the U.S. administration as a vital bridge to Europe.\n\nShe was the only European leader to attend Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration and she has responded with restraint as shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the U.S.-European alliance. Meloni has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that “dividing the West would be disastrous for everyone” after Trump’s heated White House exchange with Ukraine’s president.\n\nItaly maintains a 40 billion euro ($45 billion) trade surplus with the U.S., its largest with any country, fueled by Americans’ appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.\n\nThe meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy’s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.\n\nThe White House has imposed tariffs on much of the world, arguing that other countries have taken advantage of the U.S., as evidenced by its trade deficits. But with the 90-day pause, it increased Trump's tariffs on China to 145% while keep separate ones as much as 25% on Canada, Mexico, autos, steel and aluminum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with Japan's chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Trump, on social media, summarized the meeting as achieving “Big progress!” but he did not offer any specifics. \n\nChina is simultaneously seeking to strike deals that could possibly undercut claims made by Trump that his tariffs will ultimately lead to more domestic factory jobs and stronger growth.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday the administration is working on the “big 15 economies” first when it comes to trade deals.

I may want to go to less, because, you know, you want people to buy.”\nHowever, just hours after Trump voiced hesitation about further raising China tariffs, the US Trade Representative’s Office rolled out a two-phase plan that could further escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nBeginning in six months, ships that are either Chinese-owned or built in the country will be required to pay fees when docking at US ports, with charges increasing over time based on vessel size and cargo.\nA second phase, set to take effect in three years, will gradually limit the amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that foreign vessels can transport, with increasingly strict rules phased in over 22 years to encourage the use of US-built LNG carriers.\nThe announcement follows a year-long investigation into whether China’s shipbuilding sector poses a threat to US national security.\nLast week, Trump signed an executive order giving the USTR authority to collect millions in docking fees and tariffs on China-related cargo equipment, including cranes, an effort to challenge China’s maritime logistics dominance.\nTrump has justified his disorganised tariff roll-out, reversals, doubling down and occasional contradictory explanations – along with the shock in global markets it has engendered – as necessary to revitalise US manufacturing, although companies say it is difficult to plan amid the uncertainty and tumult.\nTurning to the social media app TikTok, owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance, Trump similarly expressed confidence that the sale he seeks would be forthcoming.\n“We have a deal for TikTok but it is subject to China so we will delay it until this thing gets worked out,” he said.\nHe added that the deal would not take more than “five minutes” to finalise when a discussion took place.\nTrump touted anew his “very good relationship” with Xi but suggested that trade terms would be established, even without China’s agreement.\n“We’re going to have a deal with China,” he said. “And if we don’t, we’re going to have a deal anyway, because we will set a certain target, and that’s going to be it.”\nTrump’s comments came a few hours after a senior Chinese diplomat called on Washington to drop the 145 per cent tariffs and to stop blaming Beijing for the US fentanyl opioid crisis.\nIn a news briefing, Ma Xiaoxiao, the Chinese deputy consul general in New York, said that Beijing was willing to resume dialogue, provided the two sides “treat each other as equals”. He did not mentioning any senior Chinese officials already in discussions with Washington.\nMa declined to say how far Beijing was willing to go to defend its corner, including whether it might sell down its reserve of roughly US$800 billion in US Treasury debt; block exports of rare earth minerals essential for many tech products; or play hardball with any sale of TikTok.\n\n“We all know this is a critical time,” he said, without mentioning the US president by name.\n“China will fight to the end, not only for itself but for the world order and the justice of the international community,” Ma said.\nIn a presentation heavy on statistics and light on new arguments, Ma said that China would not be bullied, its sovereignty had to be safeguarded and that it sought “win-win” US-China solutions.\nThursday’s outreach by the consulate came as relations between the world’s two largest economies hit new lows amid historic distrust over trade, security, diplomacy and economic policy.\nTrump’s aggressive policies in the three months since he returned to the White House have included tamped-up rhetoric, mercurial decision-making, draconian tariffs against long-standing US allies and threats to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal potentially by force.\nTrump’s behaviour has allowed China to position itself as a responsible global player defending world order and fighting protectionism, despite international concerns that Beijing’s state-led economy and non-market barriers would lead China to swamp global markets with goods to prop up its domestic economy.\nMa said it was time to “break away from the old way” and urged the US to avoid “setting up imaginary enemies”.\n\n“If the US wants to talk, the door on China’s side remains open,” he said. But “we will not bend our legitimate rights and interests to accommodate the unreasonable demands of other countries”.\nMa claimed widespread support within the international community, UN and World Trade Organization for China’s fight against Trump’s tariff policies.\nBut Ma’s points were unlikely to sway the “America first” Trump administration, which has expressed outright hostility toward allies and multilateral institutions.\nThis week, Xi embarked on a Southeast Asia charm offensive to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, part of a region that has been wary of Beijing’s muscular South China Sea policy and disregard for competing territorial claims.\nIn an article in Nhan Dan, the official newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist Party, Xi called for greater collaboration among developing countries to promote “an equal and orderly multipolar world”.\nThe European Union and China are also planning a summit in Beijing in July despite deep-seated tension over EU charges that China is exporting its industrial overcapacity to bolster its swooning economy. Beijing hosted EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic last month.\nAnd Japan and South Korea have agreed to work with China to advance trade and investment as even these historically adversarial states reconsider the geopolitical chessboard.\nTrump’s erratic approach contrasts sharply with the more methodical efforts of his predecessor Joe Biden, providing China an opening to promote its soft power.\nOn Tuesday in his first major statement since leaving the presidency, Biden said that in “fewer than 100 days, this new administration has … done so much damage and so much destruction”.\n“It’s kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon.”","summary":"Earlier, Chinese consulate official says Beijing is willing to resume dialogue, provided the two sides ‘treat each other as equals’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307006/trump-says-us-and-china-are-trade-talks-and-confident-deal-will-be-reached-soon","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/18/bad764a3-ea15-47c7-862a-3e62640beb0c_d4793db6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:27:39","author":"Khushboo Razdan,Mark Magnier","authors":["Khushboo Razdan","Mark Magnier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.01},{"id":312284684,"title":"Florida State gunman used deputy mom’s former service weapon, authorities say","text":"Tallahassee, Fla. — The 20-year-old son of a sheriff’s deputy opened fire Thursday at Florida State University with his mother’s former service weapon, killing two people and wounding at least six others, investigators said.\n\nOfficers quickly arrived and shot and wounded the shooter after he refused to comply with commands, said Tallahassee Police Chief Lawrence Revell.\n\nAuthorities have not yet revealed a motive for the shooting, which began around lunchtime just outside the student union, sending students and frightened parents hiding for cover in a bowling alley and a freight elevator inside the building.\n\nThe shooter, identified by police as Phoenix Ikner, is believed to be a Florida State student, investigators said. The two people who died were not students, said Florida State University Police Chief Jason Trumbower, adding that he would not release additional information about the victims.\n\nThe shooter obtained access to a weapon that belongs to his mother, who has been with the sheriff’s office for over 18 years and has been a model employee, said Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil. Police said they believed Ikner shot the victims using his mother’s former service handgun.\n\nThe alleged shooter was a long-standing member of the sheriff’s office’s youth advisory council, the sheriff said.\n\n“He has been steeped in the Leon County Sheriff’s Office family, engaged in a number of training programs that we have,” McNeil said. “So it’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons.”\n\nWitness says the suspect’s shotgun jammed\n\nAmbulances, fire trucks and patrol vehicles from multiple law enforcement agencies raced toward the campus just west of Florida’s capital after the university issued an active shooter alert.\n\nAidan Stickney, a 21-year-old studying business management, was running late to class when he said he saw a man get out of a car with a shotgun and aim at another man in a white polo shirt.\n\nThe gun jammed, Stickney said, and the shooter rushed back to his car and emerged with a handgun, opening fire on a woman. Stickney ran, warning others as he called 911.\n\n“I got lucky today. I really did. I really, really did,” he said.\n\nTrumbower said investigators have no evidence that anyone was shot with the shotgun.\n\nShots sent students scattering\n\nRyan Cedergren, a 21-year-old communications student, said he and about 30 others hid in the bowling alley in the union’s lower level after seeing students running from a nearby bar.\n\n“In that moment, it was survival,” he said.\n\nChris Pento said he and his twins were getting lunch at the student union during a campus tour when they heard gunshots. “It was surreal. And people just started running,” he told WCTV in Tallahassee.\n\nThey crammed into a service elevator after encountering locked doors at the end of a hallway. “That was probably the scariest point because we didn’t know. It could get worse, right?” he said. “The doors opened and two officers were there, guns drawn.”\n\nDozens of patrol vehicles, including a forensics van, were parked outside the student union hours after the shooting. Officers blocked off the area with crime scene tape.\n\nStudents and staff who left behind phones, keys and other items in the rush to evacuate waited in the shade and prayed for the victims.\n\nTallahassee Memorial Hospital confirmed it was treating six people wounded in the shooting, one in critical condition.\n\nShooting shocks campus and the nation\n\nPresident Donald Trump said from the Oval Office that he had been fully briefed on the shooting. “It’s a horrible thing. It’s horrible that things like this take place,” he said.\n\nBut Trump also suggested that he would not be advocating for any new gun legislation, saying, “The gun doesn’t do the shooting, the people do.”\n\nAfter receiving warnings of an active shooter, students and faculty took cover and waited in classrooms, offices and dorms across campus.\n\nThe first thing you think of is just, ‘This can’t be true,’ right?” said Kai McGalla, a sophomore who spoke by phone while locked down at a campus testing center.\n\nJunior Joshua Sirmans, 20, was in the main library when alarms went off. Law enforcement officers escorted him and other students from the library with their hands over their heads, he said.\n\nUniversity President Richard McCullough said he was heartbroken by the violence. “Our hearts go out to our students and the victims of this terrible tragedy,” he said.\n\nAnother shooting a decade ago at Florida State\n\nFlorida State is one of Florida’s 12 public universities, with its main campus in Tallahassee. About 44,000 students are enrolled in the university, per the school’s 2024 fact sheet.\n\nIn 2014, the main library was the site of a shooting that wounded three people. Officers shot and killed the gunman, 31-year-old Myron May.\n\nThe university canceled classes for the rest of the week and canceled home athletic events through Sunday.","summary":"Two people were killed and at least six wounded in the shooting.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/04/florida-state-gunman-used-deputy-moms-former-service-weapon-authorities-say.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/FQHORELZRVAQ5L4B3HS3YBRMYE.jpg?auth=37240ffc40670fafd3449d1012832730cdae868de9f404bfba7cf74d2fe271fb&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-17 23:27:28","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.444}]}
