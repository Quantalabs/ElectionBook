Authorities said at least two children were killed and more than a dozen were injured after a gunman opened fire during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis. In the aftermath of mass shootings, Americans often offer prayers for victims, their families and communities. In Catholic and Orthodox traditions, prayers for the dead ask that their souls be received into heaven. But many gun control advocates deride prayer, arguing that it's is not enough and government action must be taken to stop mass shootings. Psaki echoed that view in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. WHO IS ROBIN WESTMAN, SUSPECT IN ANNUNCIATION CATHOLIC SCHOOL SHOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS? MINNESOTA SCHOOL SHOOTING GUNMAN KILLS 2 CHILDREN, INJURES 17 OTHERS DURING CATHOLIC MASS \"Prayer is not freaking enough. Prayers does not end school shootings. prayers do not make parents feel safe sending their kids to school. Prayer does not bring these kids back. Enough with the thoughts and prayers,\" Psaki said. Psaki followed up with another tweet, writing, \"When kids are getting shot in their pews at a catholic school mass and your crime plan is to have national guard put mulch down around DC maybe rethink your strategy.\" Her comments appeared to reference Trump’s decision to deploy National Guard troops and assume oversight of the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle rising crime in Washington, D.C. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The suspected shooter, who was found dead at the scene, was identified as Robert or Robin Westman by law enforcement sources. Court records show that a Minneapolis juvenile named Robert Westman had his name legally changed to Robin in 2019, with one document saying, \"Minor child [redacted] identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\" Some social media users objected to Psaki’s commentary and turned her words back on her. \"I don’t expect a spiritually blind person to understand prayer, but it is real. Today I attended the funeral of a baby, and often when parents are in the depths of grief, Jesus is their greatest comforter. You should investigate why that is, rather than belittling it,\" Karen Hamilton, a candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates, responded. Washington Examiner contributor Kimberly Ross pointed out that Psaki had posted her own message in 2017 saying, \"Thoughts and prayers with @SteveScalise and officers shot. And thank you to members, hill staffers for your public service.\" \"Your party encourages mental illness in telling men they can be women, then encourages them identify as victims when the world does not indulge their perverse fantasies, and then screams 'prayers are not enough' when insane transgenders shoot up schools,\" journalist Megan Basham said. \"Prayer is vital. So is a mentally balanced populace that recognizes reality.\" \"Good of you to point out that the National Guard needs to be deployed to every major Democrat-run city to prevent their mentally ill trans groupies from killing people,\" Red State reporter Rusty Weiss wrote.

Or is this a page torn from the Trump playbook?\n\n'Because what we're witnessing is an abuse of executive power. Denying senators the means to scrutinize legislation isn't just unfair, he's in breach of the spirit of our Constitution, undermining the very purpose of the Senate as a house of review.\n\n'Does he understand how this looks, petty, authoritarian?

With August nearing its end, families are driving homewards after their summer holidays. The following scene will play out in many a car.\n\nMother, in passenger seat: ‘We should probably have turned right at that last junction.’ Father, in driving seat: ‘Was there a sign?’ Mother and children: ‘Yes, we told you.’ Father: ‘Well you should have spoken louder. Let’s keep going. This road is bound to head in much the same direction, believe me.’ And so they do. And it doesn’t. And everything goes more spectacularly wrong.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, who sits at our nation’s steering wheel, is one of those drivers. They are, my wife assures me, usually male and they stubbornly insist that they know best, despite evidence to the contrary from satnav, the AA’s route finder and as many road atlases as you might wish to consult.\n\nSir Keir has taken wrong turns on Europe, Net Zero, immigration, the economy, education and much else. Will he be told? He will not. And so we plunge deeper into trouble and the more astray our country goes, the longer it will take to return to the correct route.\n\nNick Thomas-Symonds, minister for Europe, was on the airwaves yesterday boasting that the Government is going to return us to the European Union’s orbit. New trading rules on food and drink will force our manufacturers to follow Brussels regulations, even though we left the EU in 2020 after the 2016 referendum.\n\nMr Thomas-Symonds claimed his new agreements would be a ‘necessary step’ to bring economic growth. Economic what? The EU is, like Britain, economically stagnant. In the global growth tables we are deep in the relegation zone, alongside such notorious economic duds as Mexico and South Africa.\n\nIf it’s growth you want, look beyond the old trading certainties to places such as India, China, Indonesia and, tellingly, Argentina, which is suddenly booming thanks to its new, radically right-wing government. Mr Thomas-Symonds has, in opting for higher regulation and EU protectionism, turned in precisely the wrong direction. What we need is less regulation and greater distance from an EU that has been whacked hard by Donald Trump’s tariffs. To chain oneself willingly to a sinking Europe is madness.\n\nYesterday’s Daily Mail also brought news of the promotion of Torsten Bell, a junior Treasury minister. This blinky gulper has been appointed to help Rachel Reeves write her coming Budget, on which much depends.\n\nIt is widely accepted that Ms Reeves’s first Budget last year, which raised taxes by more than £40 billion, was a prize ponger. It has certainly had a disastrous effect on jobs and growth. Hoteliers and pub landlords, forced to pay a higher minimum wage and to fork out more for employees’ national insurance, say Ms Reeves has done the hospitality sector greater damage than even the Covid lockdown.\n\nIn other words that posh voice on the satnav is shouting that Ms Reeves should stop and head back in the other direction, towards lower taxes and less state spending. Yet Mr Bell, 42, who among other things was the architect of Ed Miliband’s risible ‘Ed Stone’ election stunt, is a leading enthusiast for big government and high taxes, particularly on pensions. It would be hard to imagine someone more resoundingly unsuitable as author of the coming Budget.\n\nWith every hazard indicator on the economic dashboard flashing, can Rachel Reeves really be so stupid – or so weak – as to turn further left? We will find out in a few weeks when she delivers tax-toting Torsten’s Budget.\n\nTo cheer us up, energy prices are on the rise. Energy regulator Ofgem yesterday morning signalled a likely two per cent hike in gas and electricity bills. Within minutes of Ofgem’s unwelcome announcement, the Energy Security and Net Zero department issued a defiant press release saying that ‘this is why the only answer for Britain is this government’s mission to get us off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and onto clean homegrown power we control, to bring down bills for good’.\n\nTo use an unlikeable new phrase, this was ‘doubling down’. It meant: we’re not going to alter course. There was no acknowledgement that Whitehall’s Net Zero taxes are responsible for almost a fifth of your electricity bill. One way the Government might improve our nation’s energy security would be to approve fracking, the drilling of shale gas, but our political elite has firmly set its face against that controversial technique. No one is more anti-fracking, and more pro-Net Zero, than Sir Keir’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband. When asked in the Commons to justify his policies, he just shouts and scoffs, refusing to contemplate that he might be wrong.\n\nThe late John Maynard Keynes, economist and civil servant, said ‘when the facts change, I change my mind’. Facts at present might, arguably, include the leap in UK borrowing costs, which this week reached a 27-year high. Will that have any bearing on Ms Reeves and her amanuensis Torsten? Dream on.\n\nOther facts might include the prime minister’s approval ratings, which are now as low as Beaufort’s Dyke in the Irish Sea. Not that a man of Sir Keir’s bullet-proof vanity will listen to such things.\n\nOr how about the fact of the record numbers of ‘irregular’ migrants crossing the English Channel on inflatable dinghies? Under the Keynes dictum, might it not now be time for Labour to change its mind on the Rwanda deterrent, so haughtily abandoned when Labour won the election last July?\n\nBut no. Ministers just stick to their dreary slogans about ‘smashing the gangs’, and the problem merely worsens. The same is true in education, where the secretary of state sets her hard face against the wreckage she is causing to independent schools. And at the foreign office the obvious, costly lunacy of the Chagos Isles surrender is ignored, all because the Starmer government wants to look virtuous.\n\nOur priggish PM, when faced by changing facts, merely grips the steering wheel ever tighter and presses his petulant foot to the accelerator. At this point you might cough lightly and remind me that Sir Keir has, in recent months, acquired a reputation for ‘U-turns’. Mathematics may not be my strongest suit but even I know the geometry here is wrong. A U-turn represents a 180 degree turn. King-of-the-roads Sir Keir is more adept at 90 degree turns, for they have always been leftwards.\n\nFaced by the fact of a tanking economy and renewed inflation, he increased public sector wages and benefits payments. When any A-level economics pupil knows that you encourage growth by dropping taxes, he and Rachel Reeves hiked national insurance rates. With the EU economy at a standstill, he accepted new Brussels constraints on our food and drink industries. And with electric car sales heading in reverse, he introduced an electric car grant to hose yet more public money on a failing market.\n\nLike that father in the family car, Sir Keir hasn’t a clue where he is travelling but is determined not to listen to advice.

The 600,000 figure is also more than double the number of Chinese students studying in this country in 2023-2024.\n\n“We are going to allow it,” Trump said during a White House meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, according to an Associated Press story. “It’s very important—600,000 students.”\n\nTrump reiterated this sentiment during a Cabinet meeting the next day, saying that Chinese students help keep U.S. colleges and universities financially afloat, according to the AP story.\n\n“I told (Chinese) President Xi that we’re honored to have their students here,” Trump said. “Now, with that, we check and we’re careful, we see who is there.”\n\nWelcoming Stance Contrasts With Rubio’s Statement in May\n\nThis stance on allowing such a large number of Chinese students to enroll at American colleges and universities is a significant shift from the administration’s earlier position on this group of students. In May, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had announced the U.S. would start “aggressively” revoking the visas of Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or those pursuing study in sensitive academic fields.\n\n“Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,” Rubio’s statement said.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n“We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applicants from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong,” the statement added.\n\nTrump’s Stated Figure More Than Doubles Chinese Student Numbers\n\nThe 600,000 figure Trump cites is also much higher than the number of Chinese students most recently tracked by the Institute of International Education (IIE). According to the IIE’s Open Doors data, there were 277,398 Chinese students in this country in 2023-2024, down from a peak of 372,532 in 2019-2020, before the pandemic. Enrollment has been steadily declining in recent years due to deteriorating U.S.-China relations, China’s shrinking youth population, and restrictions imposed during Trump’s first term.\n\nThere had been indications that Chinese students may be opting for study destinations other than the U.S. due to volatile visa policies. For example, 75 percent of non-local students at universities in Hong Kong are from mainland China. In a recent intake, there was a 48 percent increase in students from mainland China compared with the year before.\n\nIn addition, Chinese students also represented just under 40% of international enrollments in Japan, a country where tuition is much cheaper than in Anglophone destinations. A large number of Chinese graduate students are skilled enough in Japanese to pursue degrees in the local language.\n\nInternational Student Contribution to the U.S. Economy Endangered\n\nEarlier, a study indicated that the U.S. could lose as much as $7 billion in local economic activity this fall due to a steep decline in international student enrollments triggered by heightened scrutiny of student social media accounts, the implementation of visa bans and shifting student visa policies.\n\nData from the Department of Homeland Security’s SEVIS system and the State Department point to a 30-40% fall in new international students, which could culminate in a 15% overall decline in international students for fall 2025. This shortfall could translate to more than 60,000 U.S. job losses, according to the study.\n\nInternational students added $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported more than 378,000 jobs during the 2023–2024 academic year, according to data from education organization NAFSA. In remarks defending Trump’s position, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick noted in an interview that international students contribute significantly to U.S. higher education and that as many as 15% of colleges could close without their financial support.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"President Donald Trump announced the U.S. would permit 600,000 Chinese students to study at American universities, a sharp pivot from his administration’s earlier stance.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/annaesakismith/2025/08/27/trump-says-he-welcomes-600000-chinese-students-to-us-in-sharp-reversal/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68af9e57e6116d2a1caaef18/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:34:43","author":"Anna Esaki-Smith,Contributor","authors":["Anna Esaki-Smith","Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":354982492,"title":"This is how American companies benefit from President Trump's promotion","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nMornings With Maria August 27, 2025 07:00 \n\n This is how American companies benefit from President Trump's promotion \n Dominari Securities CEO Kyle Wool discusses President Donald Trump's efforts to promote American companies and the deal with Intel on 'Mornings with Maria.'\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSMORNINGS WITH MARIA | LATEST EPISODESMORNINGS WITH MARIAV-VIDEOSTECHNOLOGY","summary":"Dominari Securities CEO Kyle Wool discusses President Donald Trump&apos;s efforts to promote American companies and the deal with Intel on &apos;Mornings with Maria.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6377542870112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/d29b9fd0-d316-4609-a0ee-23bc37198d83/c4cbb5f6-ed7b-4379-bbc1-d318b563ed23/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:31:38","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":354978852,"title":"Final Plea of Minnesota School Shooter Revealed in Suicide Note","text":"Minnesota school shooter Robin Westman made a desperate plea to loved ones in a suicide note written before taking the lives of two children in a mass shooting.\n\nWestman, aged 23, shared the note on a now-removed YouTube channel just hours before firing shots through stained glass windows at Annunciation Catholic School’s church, targeting children in the pews on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe attack resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and left at least 17 others injured, including 14 children and three adults, before Westman took her own life, authorities reported.\n\nIn the note, Westman attempted to justify the attack in Minneapolis, expressing regret to family and friends while making a final request.\n\n‘Pray for the victims and their families,’ Westman ended her heartfelt message, despite possessing a rifle magazine inscribed with ‘For the children, hahahahahahaha.’\n\nEarlier in the note, Westman detailed a long battle with depression and thoughts of suicide, exacerbated by a conviction that vaping-related cancer was afflicting her.\n\n‘I was corrupted by this world and have learned to hate what life is,’ she wrote after telling her parents that they have not failed her and she feels she ‘was raised to be a good person.’\n\n‘There is too much to accept, too many things to put with just to live,’ the shooter continued. ‘I’m tired of the pain this world gives out.’\n\nShe then goes on to say that she has ‘wanted this for so long’ and knows the school shooting ‘is wrong, but I can’t seem to stop myself.\n\n‘I am not well, I am not right. I am a sad person, haunted by those things that do not go away,’ Westman wrote, saying she had recently ‘lost all hope and decided to perform my final action against this world.’\n\nThe loss of hope apparently came as Westman started to believe she was dying of lung cancer, which she called a ‘tragic end as it’s entirely self-inflicted.\n\n‘I did this to myself, as I cannot control myself and have been destroying my body through vaping and other means,’ Westman explains, noting that she has ‘felt many pains that make me think I am past the point of recovery.\n\n‘I do not want to recover – I do not want to throw my life away by rotting in a hospital bed. I don’t want the rest of my life to be as a cancer patient, in and out of hospitals, constantly being fretted about with people afraid to be too happy around me.\n\n‘F*** that! I want to go out on my own means,’ she explains.\n\n‘Unfortunately, due to my depression, anger and twisted mind, I want to fulfill a final act that has been in the back of my head for years.’ \n\nIn much of the rest of the suicide note, Westman tried to apologize to her family and friends as she pleaded with them to move on.\n\n‘I don’t expect forgiveness and I don’t expect an apology,’ the shooter began her letter. ‘I have to hold much weight, but to my family and those close to me, I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.\n\n‘Please know I care for all of you so much and it pains me to bring this storm of chaos into your lives.’\n\nWestman then told her parents to ‘please move on and continue to give your love to my brothers and sisters and to the rest of the world.\n\n‘Forget my life and the pain I’ve brought,’ Westman asked before making a similar request to her siblings, who she admitted may now want to change their names.\n\nAt the end of her letter, Westman pleads with loved ones to ‘find hope, find love and stand up to injustice.’\n\nIt was not clear if the shooter was motivated at least by politics, but a gun part she showed off in one of her videos included a message aimed at President Donald Trump – calling for him to be killed.\n\nOther gun parts had the names of other mass shooters scrawled on them.\n\nOfficials said in a press conference the shooter was armed with three guns – a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. All three weapons were fired during the attack, police said.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the shooter approached the side of the church and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews.\n\nIt is unclear if the shooter fired any of the weapons from inside the church or carried out the entire mass shooting outside before going inside.\n\nPolice said at least two of the church doors appeared to have been blocked by two by fours before the shooting, suggesting the gunman wanted to trap the people inside.\n\n‘This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,’ O’Hara said at a news conference. \n\n‘The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.’ \n\nThe students at the Catholic grade school had started school on Monday and were attending mass when the shooter stormed the church, which is connected to the school.\n\nIt has since emerged that Westman’s mother, Mary, was an employee at the school before she retired in 2021. \n\nJust a few years prior, Mary had signed an application for Robin to have her name changed from Robert, according to court records seen by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe petition cost the family $311 and was ultimately approved in January 2020.\n\nIt adds that Westman ‘identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.’\n\nYet it seemed Westman still struggled with her gender identity, writing at one point that she doesn’t ‘want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it.\n\n‘I know I am not a woman but I definitely don’t feel like a man,’ she wrote, adding: ‘I really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.’\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey denounced transphobia after the revelations about Westman’s identity emerged Wednesday afternoon.\n\n‘I have heard about a whole lot of hate that is being directed at our trans community,’ he said.\n\n‘Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity. We should not be operating out of a place of hate for anyone.’\n\nHe added: ‘We should be operating from a place of love. Kids, kids died today. This needs to be about them.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMinnesota school shooter Robin Westman made a desperate plea to loved ones&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Final Plea of Minnesota School Shooter Revealed in Suicide Note first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/final-plea-of-minnesota-school-shooter-revealed-in-suicide-note/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Disgusting-final-plea-made-by-Minnesota-school-shooter-in-suicide.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:29:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.473},{"id":354978850,"title":"UN Security Council to Decide on Concluding Lebanon Peacekeeping Mission by December 31, 2026","text":"TANZANIA – The Security Council has arranged a vote for Thursday on a resolution that would conclude the over 40-year operation of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon by December 31, 2026.\n\nAccording to two council diplomats on Wednesday evening, the United States, initially advocating for the termination of the force, known as UNIFIL, within a year, did not oppose the French-proposed draft resolution which sets the end date at 16 months from now.\n\nThis development indicated that the resolution was likely to pass, but it remained uncertain whether the U.S. would vote in favor or choose to abstain, as per the diplomats who spoke under anonymity as negotiations have been confidential.\n\nUNIFIL was established to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon following Israel’s invasion in 1978. The mission’s responsibilities increased after the 2006 month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe resolution plans to cease UNIFIL’s mandate and operations by the end of 2026. The extraction of its 10,800 military and civilian staff and equipment is set to commence immediately, in coordination with the Lebanese government, and be finalized within a year.\n\nThe draft stipulates that the objective is for the Lebanese government to become “the sole provider of security” in southern Lebanon above the U.N.-designated border with Israel, known as the Blue Line. It also urges Israel to retract its forces from north of this boundary.\n\nThe multinational force has played a significant role in monitoring the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the Israel-Hezbollah war last year, but has drawn criticism from both sides and numerous U.S. lawmakers, some of whom now hold prominent roles in President Donald Trump’s administration or wield new influence with the White House.\n\nTrump administration political appointees came into office wanting to shut down UNIFIL as soon as possible and have secured major cuts in U.S. funding for the force.\n\nThey regard the operation as a waste of money that is merely delaying the goal of eliminating Hezbollah’s influence and restoring full security control to the Lebanese armed forces. The government says its forces are not yet capable of assuming full control. \n\nEuropean nations, notably France and Italy, objected to winding down UNIFIL too quickly. They argued that ending the peacekeeping mission before the Lebanese army was able to fully secure the border area would create a vacuum that Hezbollah could easily exploit.\n\nDuring the one-year withdrawal period, the draft resolution says UNIFIL is authorized to provide security and assistance to U.N. personnel, “to maintain situational awareness in the vicinity of UNIFIL locations,” and to contribute to the protection of civilians and safe delivery of humanitarian aid “within the limits of its capacities.”\n\nThe draft urges the international community “to intensify its support, including equipment, material and finance” to the Lebanese armed forces.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTANZANIA – The Security Council has arranged a vote for Thursday on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: UN Security Council to Decide on Concluding Lebanon Peacekeeping Mission by December 31, 2026 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/un-security-council-to-decide-on-concluding-lebanon-peacekeeping-mission-by-december-31-2026/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/UN-Security-Council-to-vote-on-ending-peacekeeping-mission-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:28:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":354982442,"title":"ISIS Beatle 'Jihadi Ringo' who was part of a gang that filmed the killings of hostages makes a bid to return to the UK","text":"An IS terrorist who was part of a beheading gang dubbed The Beatles has applied to move back to his 'home country' Britain so he can be closer to family and friends.\n\nEl Shafee Elsheikh - known as Jihadi Ringo - is currently serving life in a high-security US jail after he was convicted in 2022 of hostage-taking and conspiring to murder.\n\nHis gang videoed the killings of captives, of which one was aid worker David Haines - whose daughter Bethany has called Elsheikh's bid to move prisons an 'outrageous insult'.\n\nElsheikh was born in Sudan and grew up in London but had his British citizenship revoked in 2018.\n\nThe gang's victims also included Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.\n\nElsheikh was tried by a Federal jury in Virigina and handed eight life sentences.\n\nHe has now applied to be switched from his Colorado prison to a UK jail under the International Prisoner Transfer Program, claiming he would like to be closer to family and friends, The Sun reports.\n\nFamilies of the victims fear Elsheikh could be moved to somewhere like London's Belmarsh where convicts have access to a number of luxuries like TVs and games consoles and can mix with other extremists.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka recently called for the UK to honour a 'commitment' to take back IS Brits.\n\nBethany, whose father was tortured and starved before being publicly beheaded, said: 'He left this country to bring terror to the world and inflicted the most appalling treatment on my father and others when he held him captive.\n\n'He is one of the worst terrorists to come from this country and it's an outrageous insult to our families for him to apply to return to one of our prisons for an easier life.'\n\nA US notice sent to victims' relatives, seen by The Sun, says: 'This is to inform you that El Shafee Elsheikh has applied to transfer to the UK, the country of which the inmate is a national.\n\n'The United States has prisoner transfer relationships with many countries.\n\n'These treaties permit foreign nationals to apply to transfer and serve their sentence in their home country. Before making a decision, the US collects information about the prisoner, the views of law enforcement and any views provided by victims.'\n\nMr Haines, of Perth in Scotland, was abducted while working at a refugee camp in Syria in 2013. He was held hostage by Elsheikh, Kotey, Mohammed Emwazi and Aine Davis.\n\nA horrific 2014 video showed Mr Haines kneeled next to knife-wielding Emwazi - dubbed Jihadi John - and eventually beheaded.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said: 'We have not received any application from the US, but we have the right to refuse any request.'\n\nA spokesman added any prisoners who are transferred will serve the rest of their sentence in Britain.\n\nDaughter Bethany said: 'As well as better conditions here, my biggest fear is he one day walks free and would be allowed to live within hours of the same place I live. It’s a horrible thought.'\n\nBethany and other relatives were given 30 days to make submissions to the US Department for Justice, which sent out its notice earlier this month.\n\nIn her concerns the bereaved daughter said she was worried Elsheikh would receive cushy treatment in the UK, adding the 'sociopath and narcissist' in reality had 'no real interest' in returning to be closer to family.\n\nShe said the convicted terrorist was 'manipulating the system to receive better conditions in prison' and so he could 'cause further pain to the victims' families'.\n\nThe IS Beatles were given their name by hostages who noticed their distinctive British accents. \n\nAll the hostages except Ms Mueller were executed in videotaped beheadings that ISIS released online.\n\nMs Mueller was forced into slavery and raped multiple times by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before she was killed.\n\nThe deaths of Foley, Sotloff and Kassig were confirmed in 2014, while Ms Mueller's death was confirmed in early 2015.\n\nElsheikh's sentencing hearing came on the eight-year anniversary of the day that ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube showing the gruesome beheading of Foley.\n\nFoley's mother Diane spoke to reporters following the sentencing hearing, saying: 'Today we remember four extraordinary young Americans.\n\n'These brave Americans saw the suffering of the Syrian people and decided to help, whether by providing humanitarian aid or telling the world about the tragic Syrian crisis.\n\n'The left a legacy of profound moral courage.'\n\nThe charges against Elsheikh, whose British citizenship was withdrawn in 2018, carried a potential death sentence, but US prosecutors had agreed not seek his execution in a deal with British officials to carry forward the case.\n\nElsheikh's trial, and emotional testimony from the families of his victims, gripped observers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n'This prosecution unmasked the vicious and sadistic ISIS Beatles,' said First Assistant US Attorney Raj Parekh, noting that Elsheikh and the other Beatles always wore masks when they appeared in front of their hostages.\n\n'This is one of the most significant international terrorism cases ever brought to trial,' said Commander Richard Smith, head of counterterrorism at London's Metropolitan Police Service.","summary":"El Shafee Elsheikh - known as Jihadi Ringo - is currently serving life in a high-security US jail after he was convicted in 2022 of hostage-taking and conspiring to murder.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15041187/ISIS-Beatle-Jihadi-Ringo-hostages-return-UK.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/28/01/61546443-0-image-m-46_1756340091150.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/05/28/5366434518548630570/1024x576_MP4_5366434518548630570.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:27:33","author":"Editor,Noor Qurashi","authors":["Editor","Noor Qurashi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.082},{"id":354978842,"title":"Iowa Democrats Celebrate Special Election Victory, While Republicans Stay Optimistic","text":"Iowa Democrats have faced tough times recently. However, a series of impressive results in special legislative elections this year — significantly surpassing the performance of the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in each — has sparked hope that the party might secure some significant Republican-held offices in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nExcitement was already brewing among Democrats about their chances in the forthcoming governor’s race, the U.S. Senate, and a couple of competitive House contests.\n\nIn the meantime, Democratic contenders in four off-cycle, special legislative contests demonstrated double-digit improvements compared to Harris’ 2024 vote share, the latest political benchmarks in those areas. As of Tuesday night, this streak includes a victory that transformed a Republican seat and disrupted the GOP supermajority in the Iowa Senate. Party members are keen to link the stretch to public sentiment regarding President Donald Trump and their general prospects in what was once a swing state but has leaned decidedly red during the Trump era.\n\n“Iowa voters have seen Trump’s tariff tax blunders negatively impact farmers, and the GOP’s Medicaid cuts threaten their local hospitals — all while Iowa Republicans remain oblivious,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, shared with NBC News. “Working families across the Hawkeye state recognize they deserve more, which is why they’re gravitating towards state Democrats ready to oppose Trump’s disastrous policies, even in red districts he captured by large margins last November.”\n\nRepublicans argue that these predictions are easily dismissible, pointing to the very low turnout in these quiet off-year, down-ballot special elections.\n\nThey also highlighted how much effort and investment Democrats made in these races — and how strongly Republican the state has become over the past two decades, evidenced during regular campaigns when full electorates turn out to vote.\n\n“I think it’s a mistake to read too much into these special elections, because the turnout is so low — and when the Democrats are particularly motivated,” said David Kochel, a Republican strategist in Iowa. “I would caution anyone who tries to read too much into any of these special elections. They’re so poorly representative of what the overall vote in Iowa might look like in 2026.\n\n“Iowa is still a Republican state. It’s going to be a Republican state,” he added.\n\nIn Tuesday’s special election victory, Democrat Catelin Drey won a Sioux City-area district with 55% of the vote to Republican Christopher Prosch’s 45%, according to unofficial results with all precincts reporting. That’s a 22-point shift from the margin the presidential election last year, when Harris lost the district by 12 percentage points, according to data crunched by The Downballot, a left-leaning political site.\n\nDemocrats recorded double-digit improvements in three other special legislative elections in Iowa earlier this year. In April, Democrats held a seat in a special legislative election in a reliably blue Cedar Rapids district but expanded on Harris’ margin of victory by 26 percentage points, according to The Downballot’s analysis. \n\nIn March, Democrats lost a special legislative race in a safe GOP district in southeastern Iowa — but by only 3 percentage points in a district that Trump carried by 27 percentage points last year, that analysis showed.\n\nAnd in a January special Senate election, Democrats flipped an eastern Iowa district by 4 points, after Trump won it by 21 percentage points, according to The Downballot.\n\nThe special elections precede a busy midterm year in 2026. Next year, there is an open race for governor, with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds not seeking a third full term. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report with Amy Walter rates the contest “Lean Republican.”\n\nMultiple candidates are running in the primaries on both sides. Iowa Auditor of State Rob Sand is seen as the Democratic front-runner. On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra is seen as the front-runner, having outraised all of his opponents in the first half of the year. Feenstra hasn’t formally launched his campaign, but he has formed an exploratory committee and said he would formally announce in September.\n\nIowans haven’t elected a Democratic governor since 2006.\n\nThere are also two House races that are expected to be competitive. \n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, which encompasses a southeastern chunk of the state, Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks faces a competitive road to re-election. Miller-Meeks won her 2024 race over Democrat Christina Bohannan by just under 800 votes, and Bohannan is among the Democrats running for the seat next year. Cook rates the 2026 race as a “toss-up.”\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, centered on Des Moines, Republican Rep. Zach Nunn could also face a competitive race. Nunn won his race last year by 3.8 percentage points after having flipped the seat in the 2022 midterms. Several Democrats have already jumped into the race or have signaled they will. Cook rates the 2026 race as “Lean Republican.”\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, is up for re-election next year, too, though she hasn’t yet announced whether she is running again. Cook rates her race as “Likely Republican.” \n\nIowa hasn’t sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.\n\nTrump won Iowa last year by more than 13 percentage points and by more than 8 percentage points in 2020. \n\nDespite that recent record, several Democratic candidates were eager to say their gains in the recent slate of special elections were part of a broader trend in the state that they said was feeding their optimism.\n\n“It really confirms what we’ve been seeing and feeling on the ground here for the last couple of months,” Bohannan said. “Iowans are ready for change. They are absolutely fed up with the status quo.”\n\nState Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, who is running in the 3rd District, said Democrats’ gains are “a really great sign that Iowans are fed up and they’re ready for something better and something different.” \n\nBut only a slice of the voters who participate in national elections showed up for the recent races.\n\nFor example, just 7,600 voters cast ballots in Drey’s race, according to the unofficial results — only 24% of all eligible voters. That’s compared with the more than 14,000 who voted in the last regular general election for the state Senate seat, in November 2022.\n\nRepublicans also pointed to the great lengths — with regard to volunteers and door-knockers — that Democrats went to to help turn out their voters.\n\n“A special election doesn’t necessarily indicate anything for the next election cycle, because voter turnout is so different in a special election,” a national Republican operative familiar with Iowa politics told NBC News. “Democrats spent a ton of money, they flew in volunteers, they rushed the gates on this just to try and make a point.”\n\nJeff Kaufmann, the Iowa GOP chair, said, “National Democrats were so desperate for a win that they activated 30,000 volunteers and a flood of national money to win a state Senate special election by a few hundred votes.”\n\nMany Democrats also acknowledged that they would have to do more to continue their successful streak into the midterms.\n\n“It’s a snapshot in time. I don’t think we should put all of our stock in it,” said Debbie Cox Bultan, the CEO of NewDEAL, a left-leaning political strategy firm. “It’s encouraging, but absolutely we cannot rest on our laurels and think we’re going to get there only by people voting against Trump. We’ve got to give them something to vote for.”\n\nA Democratic strategist in Iowa attributed the party’s gains in recent local special elections to the fact that “people are not happy with the direction that the state is going” while it’s under GOP control — but added that Democrats’ overperformance in recent state legislative elections are “not necessarily indicative of the national environment.” \n\nBut Drey’s win Tuesday “signals the fact that Iowans are looking around” for change, the strategist said.

According to a report by The Washington Post, which cited sources familiar with the matter, Monarez, who assumed office on July 31,has been ousted, leaving the agency currently without a permanent leader.\nThe development was confirmed in a post by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on X (formerly Twitter), which read, “Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. [HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.”\n\nSusan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious…\n— HHS.gov (@HHSGov) August 27, 2025\n\nHer departure comes amid a turbulent period for the agency. On August 8, the CDC’s main campus in Atlanta was targeted in a shooting that resulted in the death of DeKalb County police officer David Rose. The incident sent shockwaves through the public health community and intensified scrutiny on the agency’s internal security and leadership.\nIn the days following the shooting, the CDC issued termination notices to approximately 600 employees, citing restructuring and budgetary constraints. The agency has also found itself at the centre of a growing controversy regarding long-standing vaccination policies, many of which have been challenged or overturned by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine sceptic.\nWhile Monarez’s departure has been confirmed, the exact reason for her sudden removal remains unclear. HHS officials have not provided an explanation, and Monarez herself declined to comment, telling the Associated Press, “I can’t comment.”\nHer exit follows the resignation of several other high-ranking CDC officials in recent weeks. Among them are Dr Debra Houry, deputy director; Dr Daniel Jernigan, head of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases; and Dr Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\nMonarez, a veteran federal scientist with a background in infectious disease research, was nominated by President Donald Trump earlier this year after he withdrew his initial nominee, former congressman Dave Weldon, due to criticism of Weldon’s views on vaccines and autism.\nMonarez’s appointment had already drawn attention, as she was the first CDC director in five decades without a medical degree.","summary":"Her exit follows the resignation of several other high-ranking CDC officials, including Dr Debra Houry, Dr Daniel Jernigan, and Dr Demetre Daskalakis.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/cdc-director-susan-monarez-removed-less-than-a-month-after-appointment-ws-l-9532886.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-5-2025-08-d5b72a113a9b117f1e611a81235fa5ae.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:19:04","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":354983206,"title":"The Vivienne's mother shares heart wrenching family update in new documentary Dear Viv after star's tragic ketamine death","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Aug 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Catholic student to lunatic transgender assassin: As praying children are slaughtered, America is left looking for clues\n\nRevealed: Girl, 17, stabbed to death by migrant in Netherlands was highly intelligent, middle-class student - as detectives admit they DON'T KNOW the identity of the suspect they have in custody\n\nA decade after throwing open its borders to millions of migrants, Germany is now proof Farage's deportation flights pledge can work, writes SUE REID\n\nThe 100 best state schools in Britain: Experts reveal where to get the top taxpayer-funded education in every part of the UK.

We went in and he was lying on the floor. He just looked really peaceful.'\nThe reality TV star was discovered with five empty 'snap bags' of ketamine in the house, the coroner was told.\nA friend said the drag queen had been sober for years but had recently relapsed.\nJames had opened up about his addiction to ketamine on RuPaul's Drag Race UK back 2019, but was four years sober at the time of filming.\nAddressing his addiction Caroline said: 'I didn't know until that point about it at all so he obviously hid it from me...I think he held that from us to protect us.'\nThe Vivienne's manager Simon Jones also features in the documentary as he admitted he too knew about James' addiction. \nHe said: 'Viv and I were so close, she was completely open with me. I didn't know until later with us working together that it had reared its head again.\n'There were times when it crept back in and there were times when it disappeared.

Kennedy Jr.’s push to change vaccine policy. \n\nAt the heart of the matter was whether Monarez would support rescinding certain approvals for Covid-19 shots, according to the sources. \n\nKennedy, a vaccine skeptic, has already made efforts to roll back Covid-19 shots. \n\nIn May, he said Covid-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. And earlier this month, he canceled $500 million in vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, which is used to fight respiratory viruses, including Covid-19. \n\nMonarez would not commit to supporting the vaccine policy change without consulting her advisers, the sources said. This made Kennedy press her to resign for “not supporting President Trump’s agenda,” according to one person who spoke to The Washington Post. \n\nMark S. Zaid, a lawyer for Monarez, shared a statement on X Wednesday night suggesting she had been politically targeted and indicated she neither resigned nor received a termination notice. \n\n“When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she had been targeted. \n\nDr. Morarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign,” the statement read. \n\nThe Independent has reached out to HHS and the White House for comment. \n\nMonarez was named acting director in January and then tapped as the nominee in March after President Donald Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. \n\nShe was sworn in on July 31, less than a month ago, making her the shortest-serving CDC director in the history of the 79-year-old agency.\n\nDuring her Senate confirmation process, Monarez told senators that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence. But she largely dodged questions about whether those positions put her at odds with Kennedy.\n\nThe Washington Post reported at least three senior CDC officials resigned shortly after Monarez’s removal, including Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \n\nDaskalakis wrote in a resignation email obtained by the publication, “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Susan Monarez was weeks into her job as CDC director when the Health and Human Services Department announced her removal","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/susan-monarez-rfk-jr-cdc-director-b2815405.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/28/0/48/GettyImages-2222107417.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/aD65qlcD-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:17:10","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.218},{"id":354975902,"title":"CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez is being ousted just weeks into her tenure, sources say, and other officials follow","text":"(CNN) — Dr. Susan Monarez, who was sworn in as director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on July 31, is being ousted, according to three sources familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition that they not be named because they were not authorized to share the information.\n\nHer departure was quickly followed by the resignation of of several high-level veteran agency officials, leaving the CDC leaderless at a perilous time.\n\nMorale, which was already low after deep staff cuts this spring, plummeted after a gunman opened fire on the agency’s main campus in Atlanta on August 8, pocking the buildings with hundreds of bullet holes and killing DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose. Shortly afterward, a further 600 employees got official termination notices.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services said in a post on X on Wednesday, “Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. [HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad.”\n\nThe ouster was first reported by the Washington Post.\n\nOther high-level leaders depart\n\nShortly after Monarez’s departure was confirmed Wednesday, three other top CDC officials also announced that they were leaving. Dr. Debra Houry, the agency’s chief medical officer and deputy director of programs and science; Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; and Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, were agency veterans whom staffers said were well-liked and trusted.\n\n“For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses and interpretations,” Houry wrote in a resignation email to staff that was shared with CNN.\n\n“Vaccines save lives – this is an indisputable, well-established scientific fact,” she said. “Informed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks, but also on the true lifesaving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities.”\n\nWhile it is important to question and analyze research, “this must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence,” she wrote.\n\nHoury then said that misinformation has already cost lives, citing the record high number of measles cases in the US this year.\n\nDaskalakis shared his resignation email to Houry in a post on X.\n\n“It is untenable to serve in an organization that is not afforded the opportunity to discuss decisions of scientific and public health importance released under the moniker of CDC,” he wrote. “The lack of communication by HHS and other CDC political leadership that culminates in social media posts announcing major policy changes without prior notice demonstrate a disregard of normal communication channels and common sense. Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function.”\n\nDr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, also left the CDC on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to share the information.\n\n“Our agency is crumbling,” said a source within the CDC who is not allowed to speak to the news media and did not want to be identified for fear of retribution. “All of our top people who kept us protected … from the new administration. From twisting science for their agenda. Science is data and facts. We’re simple people that way … we trust numbers and facts.\n\n“The bullet holes aren’t even repaired on our buildings.”\n\nClashes with Kennedy\n\nMonarez’s ouster followed days of internal pressure led by Kennedy’s deputy chief of staff and close confidante, Stefanie Spear, according to two people familiar with the situation. It also came soon after Kennedy summoned Monarez to Washington and demanded that she fire Houry, Jernigan and Daskalakis, according to two people familiar with the matter. Monarez refused, angering Kennedy and triggering his move to remove her.\n\nMonarez also clashed with Kennedy and his team over vaccine policies, including an impending announcement that could draw links between immunizations and autism, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nKennedy suggested in a Tuesday meeting of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet that HHS would reveal research in September showing that “certain interventions now are clearly, almost certainly, causing autism.” Trump responded that “there has to be something artificially causing this, meaning, a drug or something.”\n\nThe CDC is readying to announce a new slate of appointees to its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the coming weeks, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kennedy dissolved the panel of independent vaccine advisers in June and days later named eight new members, many of whom have cast doubt on the safety of vaccines and public policy around vaccination. One member later dropped out during the required financial review.\n\nMonarez’s attorneys, Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Wednesday that “Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk.”\n\n“When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted. Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign,” they wrote.\n\n“This is not about one official. It is about the systematic dismantling of public health institutions, the silencing of experts, and the dangerous politicization of science.”\n\nMonarez was President Donald Trump’s second pick to lead the CDC; the nomination of Dr. Dave Weldon was withdrawn in March after White House officials privately voiced concerns about his comments expressing skepticism about vaccines.\n\nShe was the first CDC director to be confirmed by the Senate, and her tenure was the shortest of any in the agency’s history.\n\nMonarez was principal deputy director and acting director at the CDC from January to March. She has a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology but is not a medical doctor, making her the first CDC director since the 1950s not to have a clinical background.\n\nMonarez’s tenure in government spans Republican and Democratic administrations. Before coming to the CDC, she was deputy director for the Advance Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H, and was founding director of the Center for Innovation at the Health Resources and Services Administration. She held other leadership positions at the Department of Homeland Security and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\n\nIn a news release the day of her swearing-in, Kennedy said that Monarez had “unimpeachable scientific credentials” and that he had full confidence in her ability to restore Americans’ trust in the agency.\n\n“It is a great honor to join Secretary Kennedy and his HHS leadership team,” Monarez said in the news release. “I consider it a privilege to work alongside the public servants at CDC. Together we will strengthen and modernize the nation’s public health preparedness and response through science and innovation. We will work every day at CDC to Make America Healthy Again.”\n\nFormer CDC Principal Deputy Director Dr. Nirav Shah said Wednesday that Monarez’s ouster “is another example of the chaotic leadership we’ve seen under Secretary Kennedy, and in times of increasing public health threats, stable leadership matters.”\n\n“The instability we’re seeing at CDC will not help making Americans healthy again.”\n\nCNN’s Michelle Krupa contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

'I don't want the rest of my life to be as a cancer patient, in and out of hospitals, constantly being fretted about with people afraid to be too happy around me.\n\n'F*** that! I want to go out on my own means,' Westman explains.\n\n'Unfortunately, due to my depression, anger and twisted mind, I want to fulfill a final act that has been in the back of my head for years,' the shooter wrote ominously.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has warned that vaping can cause serious lung damage as 'tiny particles... can be inhaled deep into the lungs' and certain vape flavorings are linked to lung disease.\n\n'Some flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be safe to eat, but not to inhale because the lungs process substances differently than the gut,' the federal agency notes.\n\nIt also says that youth vaping is associated with mental health issues like depression and 'nicotine addiction or withdrawal can contribute to these feelings or make them worse.'\n\nWestman had been suffering from depression for years, the shooter wrote in the suicide note. \n\n'I was corrupted by this world and have learned to hate what life is,' Westman wrote.\n\n'There is too much to accept, too many things to put with just to live,' the shooter continued. 'I'm tired of the pain this world gives out.'\n\nWestman then goes on to say that 'I have wanted this for so long.\n\n'I am not well, I am not right. I am a sad person, haunted by those things that do not go away,' Westman wrote. \n\n'I know this is wrong, but I can't seem to stop myself,' the shooter continued. 'Only recently, have I lost all hope and decided to perform my final action against this world.'\n\nIn much of the rest of the suicide note, Westman tried to apologize to family members and friends and pleaded with them to move on.\n\n'I don't expect forgiveness and I don't expect an apology,' the shooter began her letter. 'I have to hold much weight, but to my family and those close to me, I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.\n\n'Please know I care for all of you so much and it pains me to bring this storm of chaos into your lives.'\n\nWestman then told her parents to 'please move on and continue to give your love to my brothers and sisters and to the rest of the world.\n\n'Forget my life and the pain I've brought,' Westman asked before making a similar request to her siblings, who she admitted may now want to change their names.\n\nAt the end of her letter, Westman pleads with loved ones to 'find hope, find love and stand up to injustice.'\n\nIt now appears the shooter was motivated at least in part by politics after showing off a gun part in a video which included a message aimed at President Donald Trump - calling for him to be killed.\n\nOther gun parts had the names of other mass shooters scrawled on them.\n\nOfficials said in a press conference the shooter was armed with three guns - a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. All three weapons were fired during the attack, police said.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the shooter approached the side of the church and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews.\n\nIt is unclear if the shooter fired any of the weapons from inside the church or carried out the entire mass shooting outside before going inside.\n\nPolice said at least two of the church doors appeared to have been blocked by two by fours before the shooting, suggesting the gunman wanted to trap the people inside.\n\n'This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,' O'Hara said at a news conference. \n\n'The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.' \n\nThe students at the Catholic grade school had started school on Monday and were attending mass when the shooter stormed the church, which is connected to the school.\n\nIt has since emerged that Westman's mother, Mary, was an employee at the school before she retired in 2021. \n\nJust a few years prior, Mary had signed an application for Robin to have her name changed from Robert, according to court records seen by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe petition cost the family $311 and was ultimately approved in January 2020.\n\nIt adds that Westman 'identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.'\n\nYet it seemed Westman still struggled with her gender identity, writing at one point that she doesn't 'want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it.\n\n'I know I am not a woman but I definitely don’t feel like a man,' she wrote, adding: 'I really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.'\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey denounced transphobia after the revelations about Westman's identity emerged Wednesday afternoon.\n\n'I have heard about a whole lot of hate that is being directed at our trans community,' he said.\n\n'Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity. We should not be operating out of a place of hate for anyone.'\n\nHe added: 'We should be operating from a place of love. Kids, kids died today.

Per capita, it was the highest number of any EU country at the time.\n\nBut its stance has also since hardened, with officials significantly tightening the criteria for residency, reducing asylum rights to the minimum possible under EU law, and pushing voluntary returns for failed applicants. \n\nThe number of first-time asylum applications to Germany dropped by 49.5 per cent in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. \n\nMeanwhile, Denmark has emerged as an unlikely posterchild for conservatives after slashing asylum claims by 90 per cent through a 'zero refugee' policy. \n\nIn 2018, the country's previous government brought in the so-called 'anti-ghetto law', which aims to reduce the number of 'non-Western' residents in certain housing areas to less than 30 per cent by 2030.\n\nEven more controversially, Denmark's border force has powers to confiscate items such as jewellery and watches from incoming migrants to help fund the cost of their stay. \n\nFrance has also strengthened immigration laws, which have made it easier to deport migrants with criminal convictions. But other measures, including restricting family reunions, have been ruled unconstitutional. \n\nIn Italy, Georgia Meloni's Right-wing government now offers asylum to fewer than 10 per cent of applicants, although many who are refused simply head to Northern Europe. \n\nIn the Netherlands, the election of a coalition including nationalist firebrand Geert Wilders showed a significant shift to the Right in the famously liberal country. \n\nAlthough that collapsed last year, the next elections in October are again set to be dominated by immigration and asylum after an illegal immigrant allegedly raped and murdered a woman in Amsterdam. \n\nBelgium has also seen major gains by Right-wingers but continues to see record asylum claims. \n\nIllegal migration has become the biggest issue in British politics amid a series of anti-migrant protests outside asylum hotels. \n\nThe latest Home Office figures show another 871 migrants arrived in 13 boats over the Bank Holiday weekend, taking the total since Labour won the election to more than 52,000.\n\nMr Farage, at Oxford airport on a stage adorned with mock departure boards for deportation flights, said yesterday: 'The only way we will stop the boats is by detaining and deporting absolutely anyone that comes via that route. \n\n'If we do that, the boats will stop coming within days, because there will be no incentive to pay a trafficker to get into this country.'\n\nAnd, after a weekend that saw dozens of protests against asylum hotels, he warned: 'The mood in the country around this issue is a mix between total despair and rising anger.\n\n'Without action, without somehow the contract between the Government and the people being renewed, without some trust coming back, then I fear deeply that that anger will grow.\n\n'In fact, I think there is now, as a result of this, a genuine threat to public order.'\n\nAt the major policy launch, Reform UK produced an eight-page guide to 'Operation Restoring Justice', described as a 'five-year emergency programme' it would enact if it wins the next election.\n\nIt would combine an 'uncompromising legal reset' – involving the repeal of human rights laws and Britain's withdrawal from major international treaties – with a 'relentless foreign policy campaign' to agree returns deals.\n\nUnder a new UK Deportation Command, all illegal migrants would be held and deported, including those already living here.\n\nDowning Street stopped short of criticising the detail of Mr Farage's plans – and even suggested the Government could seek its own deals with pariah regimes such as the Taliban.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman told reporters: 'We're not going to take anything off the table in terms of striking returns agreements with countries around the world.' \n\nNo 10 did rule out leaving the European Convention on Human Rights. Labour Party chairman Ellie Reeves said: 'Nigel Farage can't say where his detention centres will be, can't say what will happen to women and children, and can't say how he'll convince hostile regimes like Iran to take people back.'\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch said: 'Farage's 'immigration plan' looks very familiar. We set out our Deportation Bill months ago. He's copied our homework but missed the lesson.'\n\nAnd while Reform vowed to pull out of the ECHR and repeal the Human Rights Act, lawyers said asylum-seekers would still have legal redress and the entire scheme could be challenged under judicial review.","summary":"The Reform UK leader vowed to deport as many as 600,000 people if he wins power after detaining them in 'large-scale raids' - an echo of the crackdown by US president Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15038951/Britain-illegal-migrants-Europe-country-lagging-Continental-neighbours-bid-tackle-migrant-crisis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/27/14/101594781-0-image-m-44_1756302404966.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-28 00:04:50","author":"Editor,Rory Tingle","authors":["Editor","Rory Tingle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":354981232,"title":"Feed them words","text":"FOR aeons, famine has been a feared word.

During those years, the far-sighted Netanyahu became a friend of Fred Trump — President Donald Trump’s father.

Jesus Christ prophesied that in time “nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines”. And the Holy Quran warns of “hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits”.\n\nOver history, famines have been seen variously as divine punishment, or as natural disasters, or manmade afflictions. Perhaps the most infamous occurred during wartime in Bengal in 1943-44. PM Winston Churchill is supposed to have had little sympathy for the colony that supported his war effort but whose people were denied sustenance.\n\n One can count the ribs through the paper-thin skin.\n\nLike many Britishers, Churchill admired individual Indians (he liked Nehru) but loathed India: “They are a beastly people with a beastly religion. The famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.” Caustically, he wondered why, if there were food shortages, Mahatma Gandhi — whom he dismissed as “a half-naked fakir” — was still alive?\n\nSince independence, the spectre of a near famine has haunted every Pakistani government. Mismanagement in western Punjab — once the granary of pre-1947 India — made the country dependent on the US and its PL-480 programme. That drip-feed lifeline was designed to help Pakistan with food aid but to keep it dependent on American largesse.\n\nSuccour under PL-480 continued from 1954 until 1991. It was suspended not because Pakistan became self-sufficient in food grains but because the US objected to its nuclear programme. (Z.A. Bhutto once famously boasted that “We [Pakistanis] will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own [atom bomb]!”) If PM Modi persists in his suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, we may well need to squabble with cattle over grass.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, India undertook a Green Revolution, led by an agricultural scientist M.S. Swaminathan. He and his team used technology, mechanisation and high-yielding seeds. In parallel, villages were lin--ked to towns by road, electrification ext-ended a farmer’s working hours, and above all, an aggressive drive encouraged interaction between farmers and agricultural universities. By 1970, Indian Pun-jab (which had received 30 per cent of the least arable land under the notorious Radcliffe Award) produced 70pc of all India’s food grains.\n\nIn today’s world, famine should not be a natural phenomenon. Modern famines are caused by human failure. The 19th-century British administrator Charles Trevelyan, who witnessed the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-52 in which one million died and another 2m migrated, argued that famines were not caused by a physical evil but “the moral evil of the selfish, perverse and turbulent character of people”.\n\nPM Netanyahu and his accomplices could hardly be ex--pected to agree with Trevelyan. They are practising a targe-ted genocide (a mass murder without gas chambers) that will replace the Holoca-ust in the memory of mankind. Pales-tin-ians in Gaza are dy--ing even as they queue for food. They are losing their bir-th-right, their land, as they are losing their lives, inch by inch.\n\nThis is not to denigrate the efforts of courageous outspoken governments, the UN and its various aid agencies. Their too little is already too late and clearly not enough. Their utterances — however well-meaning — cannot fill a child’s belly. Death is a dismal prospect for a young Palestinian not old enough to spell the word ‘decimation’.\n\nReaders may recall a photo taken in 1972, during the Vietnam War. It showed a nine-year-old girl, fleeing naked after a napalm attack on her village. It became an iconic symbol of that senseless war.\n\nIts equivalent today would be the image published of an emaciated, skeletal Palestinian child cradled in the lap of a helpless mother. One can count the ribs through the paper-thin skin. More disturbing, that photograph showed that the starving child wore imported paper diapers.\n\nOne could almost hear the echo of an earlier French cynic: ‘What if they have no milk; let them wear Pampers!’ \n\nThe writer is an author.\nwww.fsaijazuddin.pk\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025","summary":"FOR aeons, famine has been a feared word.

The war in Gaza has taken a devastating toll not only on Palestinians but also on Israel’s economy, democracy, and global standing. Without an immediate change of course, Netanyahu’s agenda could make Israel an international pariah for decades to come.\nTrue, the current round of violence started with the malicious attack by Hamas terrorists on Israeli civilians in October 2023. True, this attack included murder, sexual assaults, and kidnappings, with almost 1,200 civilians killed. And true, as of now, almost two years after the attack, 50 (mostly) Israelis remain missing, either as hostages held by Hamas or dead.\nYet what began as an existential Israeli response to that Hamas atrocity has degenerated into mass destruction. The United Nations World Food Programme has warned that one-third of Gazans have gone days without food.\nAlthough the international outcry at the lack of available food did lead to an increase in supply, this has been of little benefit, owing to a distribution method encouraged by the Israeli government, executed by a private company, and forced upon the obedient, though reluctant, army to supervise.\nA recent UN experts’ report found that famine now affects at least a half-million people in northern Gaza, including Gaza City. The Israeli government’s proposal in July to create a “humanitarian city” that would force hundreds of thousands of Gazans into confinement, and the August decision to conquer Gaza City, including more forcible transfers, indicate that the situation will only get worse.\nNetanyahu’s government persists on its ruinous course because his own political survival depends on it. Weakened by corruption trials, Netanyahu’s means of clinging to power is through endless war.\nThis desire is giving the most extreme members of his coalition the whip hand, with some openly advocating the mass transfer of the Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank. For them, famine and displacement are not unintended consequences but goals.\nThis ongoing Israeli response is more than a moral calamity. As 24 leading academic economists – among them 11 Nobel laureates – wrote in a recent open letter to Netanyahu, Israel is on the brink of inflicting lasting self-harm.\nWestern leaders should not treat Israel’s policies in Gaza as “business as usual”. To continue backing Netanyahu’s government is to enable a rogue regime, one more akin to Vladimir Putin’s Russia than to a Western democracy.\nEurope, facing immense domestic pressure to act to save the people of Gaza, will not stand idle. Targeted sanctions on Israel are becoming ever more likely. These would undermine Israel’s trade with the European Union, its largest trading partner, and jeopardise much research funding that supports Israel’s booming tech sector.\nCredit downgrades are under way, borrowing costs are rising, and skilled Israelis are emigrating in significant numbers. While the US may, for its own strategic reasons, choose to bear part of these costs, it is hard to see any way that the Israeli economy is not badly wounded, for many years, by Netanyahu’s policies.\nUS president Donald Trump’s administration, reluctant to bankroll foreign wars, has its own reasons to reconsider its support of Israel’s Gaza strategy. Leading Israeli economists who have consulted for Netanyahu and his government for decades have concluded that Israel cannot finance the conquest of Gaza City and the indefinite “hosting” of more than two million people.\nAs with the aftermath of the 1982 war between Israel and Lebanon, further aggravation of the already terrible situation in Gaza would probably end up costing the US billions of dollars, on top of the more than US$20 billion already spent on military aid to Israel since Oct 7, 2023.\nThe path forward is well articulated in the economists’ letter. First, Israel must restore sufficient provision of food and medical aid to keep Gazans alive, measured by its efficiency and not merely by the volume of food entering Gaza (only to be kept out of people’s reach).\nSecond, Israel must renounce any plans to herd Gazans into camps. Third, Israel must recommit publicly to basic human rights as per international law, even in periods of armed conflict.\nAnd finally, Israel must seek a genuine ceasefire that brings home the hostages and ends the fighting. Western governments should use diplomacy, economic measures, and politics to press for these steps.\nIsrael today stands at a crossroads.

In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal in which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of China sales of the H20 going to the U.S. government.\n\nAfter the meeting, Trump said he was open to making a deal for Blackwell chips, which is Nvidia's latest AI technology that currently comprises the majority of its data center revenue.\n\nHuang has said that it is better for Chinese AI developers to use Nvidia's chips rather than force them to use homegrown Chinese options by preventing exports, which could incentivize the Chinese tech industry to catch up.\n\nIf Nvidia were to release a Blackwell chip in China, it could spur a large amount of sales as Chinese AI developers opt for the most powerful chips available. Nvidia would have to modify its Blackwell chips for the U.S. market to make them slower in certain aspects in order to comply with U.S. export regulations.\n\n\"The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that,\" Trump said in August, before adding that it was possible to make a deal for a \"somewhat enhanced in a negative way\" version of Blackwell.\n\nHuang's bullish comments on Wednesday come after the company reported second-quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 56% to $54 billion, despite not selling a single H20 chip to China during the quarter. Nvidia said it released $180 million in H20 inventory to a customer outside of China, which accounted for $650 million in sales.\n\nNvidia said it is not counting on any H20 sales in the October quarter as part of its forecast for $54 billion in revenue, but that the company could sell between $2 billion and $5 billion in H20 chips, depending on the geopolitical environment.\n\n\"If we had more orders, we can build more,\" Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said on the call with analysts.\n\nNvidia said that while it had received some licenses after the meeting with Trump, the U.S. government has yet to publish official regulations outlining how its cut of sales will work. \n\n\"USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement,\" Kress said.\n\nHuang told analysts that China is the second-largest AI market in the world.\n\n\"The China market I've estimated to be about $50 billion of opportunity for us this year, if we were able to address it with competitive products,\" Huang said. \"And if it's $50 billion this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year.\"\n\nRecent reports have indicated that the Chinese government is encouraging AI developers to use homegrown chips over those from Nvidia.\n\n\"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,\" Kress said.\n\nWATCH: Nvidia sales drop more than 4% as chipmaker says no Q2 H20 sales to China-based customers","summary":"Huang predicted the artificial intelligence market in the world's second-biggest economy will grow 50% next year.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/nvidia-jensen-huang-real-possibility-blackwell-ai-chip-to-china.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108174923-1753172600849-gettyimages-2224782286-AFP_66Z86KE.jpeg?v=1753172679","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M08D27/7000387016/1756326531-41376667549-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:58:16","author":"Kif Leswing","authors":["Kif Leswing"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":354978200,"title":"Nato says all countries to finally hit 2% defence spending goal","text":"Western militaries and intel agencies warned that Moscow could be ready to attack a NATO country within five years if the war in Ukraine ends.

Everything seemed normal,” Loveridge remarked about his neighbors, the Westmans, including the suspect who legally altered his name from Robert Paul Westman to Robin M. Westman in 2020.\n\n“I don’t understand any of this.”\n\nLoveridge spoke highly of his neighbors and recalled Robin Westman appearing “content” just weeks before the tragedy at Annunciation Church, a school accommodating students from pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.\n\n“Never noticed anything. She appeared content merely two weeks ago. She had landed a new, promising job she seemed to enjoy. I once took her climbing,” Loveridge disclosed to The U.S. Sun during a phone conversation.\n\n“And I just don’t understand how any of this happened and why.\n\n“They’re a wonderful, kind, generous, amazing family,” Loveridge continued when asked about the shooter’s family.\n\n“They’ve been the best neighbors I could ever imagine. And this is an absolute tragedy.”\n\nSHATTERED INNOCENCE\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department quickly responded to Annunciation Church on Wednesday following reports of gunfire at the premises shortly before 8:30 am.\n\nA mass celebrating the first week of school was taking place at the church at the time Westman unleashed hell, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.\n\n“During the mass, a gunman approached on the outside of the side of the building, and began firing a rifle through the church windows, towards the children sitting in the pews in the mass,” said O’Hara.\n\n“Shooting through the windows, he struck children and worshippers that were inside the building.”\n\nWitnesses reported hearing what sounded like 30-50 gunshots over a period of several minutes.\n\nO’Hara said Westman was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and a pistol.\n\n“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,” the police chief added.\n\nWhat we know so far:\n\nTwo children, ages 8 and 10, were killed while praying in pews\n17 others were injured, including 14 children, and a local hospital is currently treating nine pediatric patients\nThe suspect has been identified as Robin Westman, a 23-year-old man whose mother worked at the school until 2021, who died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot\nWestman uploaded a sick video manically laughing minutes before the shooting showing off disturbing messages written across multiple guns, including a rifle, a shotgun, and a pistol with several magazines\nSobbing children were evacuated from the church to reunite with their worried parents, with one boy overheard telling his dad, “I don’t feel safe”\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz said he was briefed and is “praying for our kids and teachers”\nPresident Donald Trump has been briefed on the situation and ordered flags at half-staff to mourn the victims\n\nO’Hara said that when authorities arrived at the scene, they began to provide assistance to the injured victims inside the church, and described in gut-wrenching detail how several children were hiding, shielding themselves from gunfire.\n\nAuthorities located Westman’s body in the rear of the church.\n\nThe police chief said Westman died from a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nTwo children, aged 8 and 10, were killed, 14 additional minors as well as three adults were injured, O’Hara said.\n\nAll of the injured victims are expected to survive, authorities added.\n\nSHOOTER’S DARKNESS\n\nWestman, who was dressed in all black, attempted to block the building’s doors with a “two-by-four” plank, O’Hara, the police chief, said.\n\nThe gunman uploaded a video on YouTube showing off multiple weapons, bullets, and disturbing writings before committing the vicious attack.\n\nWestman could be heard giggling and muttering while showcasing an apparent manifesto addressed to his parents, siblings, and friends.\n\nThe shooter even wrote disturbing messages on his guns and ammunition, with one of the weapons had “Rupnow” scribbled on it, an apparent reference to Nashville school shooter Natalie Rupnow.\n\nRupnow killed two and hurt six at her Christian school last December.\n\nWestman’s handwritten letters to family and friends included a chilling message telling the readers to “pray for the victims and their families.”\n\n“I love you all. I will remember you,” Westman wrote, according to the video shared on his YouTube page, which has since been removed.\n\nA sketch of a church’s layout was included in his writing, but it’s unclear if the drawing depicted was that of Annunciation Church.\n\nNIGHTMARE SCENE\n\nA parent who was attending the church service said students were packed into pews when the killer opened fire.\n\n“He just pepper-sprayed through the stained-glass windows into the building, 50 to 100 shots,” the unnamed parent told the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\n“This is terrible. This is evil. I don’t know how you defend against this.”\n\nEndre Gunter Jr. was in the school year’s first 8:15 am Wednesday mass when he looked out the church window and saw the shooter approaching the building.\n\n“Then he heard boom, boom, boom,” Denis Roberts, the child’s grandmother, told the outlet.\n\n“A girl next to him got hit in the head. He saw flesh fly. Endre was shot in the stomach,” Roberts, who spoke to her grandchild after he got out of surgery, added.\n\nWestman had a connection to the Annunciation Church through his mother, who retired from working there in 2021.\n\nA motive for the shooting has not been established.\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text Crisis Text Line at 741741.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRobin Westman, the Minneapolis church shooter, had just commenced a new position&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Neighbors Speak Out About Robin Westman&#8217;s Final Weeks Before Minneapolis Church Tragedy Involving Two Children first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/neighbors-speak-out-about-robin-westmans-final-weeks-before-minneapolis-church-tragedy-involving-two-children/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Minneapolis-gunman-Robin-Westmans-neighbors-break-silence-on-his-last.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:53:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":354977358,"title":"Trump holds meeting on Gaza with UK’s ex-PM Blair and former envoy Kushner","text":"US President Donald Trump was presiding over a policy meeting on the Gaza war on Wednesday with input from former British prime minister Tony Blair and former Trump Middle East envoy Jared Kushner, a senior White House official said.\nTrump, top White House officials, Blair and Kushner were discussing all aspects of the Gaza issue, including escalating food aid deliveries, the hostage crisis, post-war plans and more, the official said.\nThe official described the session as “simply a policy meeting”, the type frequently held by Trump and his team.\nKushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, was a key White House adviser in Trump’s first term on Middle East issues.\nBlair, who was prime minister during the 2003 Iraq war, has also been active on Middle East issues.\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff previewed the meeting in an appearance on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier on Tuesday.\n“It is a very comprehensive plan we are putting together on the next day [in Gaza] and many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is and it reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here,” Witkoff said.\nTrump had promised a quick end to the war in Gaza during last year’s presidential campaign but a resolution has been elusive seven months into his second term.\nTrump’s term began with a ceasefire which lasted two months, until Israeli strikes killed around 400 Palestinians on March 18.\nMore recently, images of starving Palestinians in Gaza, including children, have shocked the world and fed criticism of Israel over the deteriorating conditions.\n“President Trump has been clear that he wants the war to end, and he wants peace and prosperity for everyone in the region.

Days later, Ontario premier Doug Ford – a blunt-spoken, burly populist with a knack for politics – entered a high-stakes meeting with other premiers and the prime minister wearing the hat. The move kicked off a frenzy of online orders and created a rare moment of political consensus.\n\nBut Ford’s love of the hat cost the province nearly C$300,000 (US$218,000), according to reporting by the Trillium.\n\nAccording to newly disclosed public election finance filings, the Progressive Conservative party of Ontario paid C$278,910.71 to Jackpine Dynamic Branding, the company producing the viral hats, during the province’s election campaign period last spring.\n\nThe party also transferred more than 600 hats – bought for C$23.19 each before the election – to the campaign, according to the Trillium.\n\nLiam Mooney, who runs Jackpine Dynamic Branding with his fiancée, Emma Cochrane, previously told the Guardian the couple wanted a simple but firm message with the hat. “It was a small act of patriotism to respond to these big threats and this big bluster,” Mooney said.\n\nTheir online store, which sold red and navy blue headwear featuring the wording “Strong and Free” and “Canada Is Not For Sale”, as well as “Fort et libre” and “Le Canada n’est pas à vendre”, was quickly overwhelmed with traffic. The couple ended up selling tens of thousands of the hats, which they eventually managed to produce in Canada after weeks of manufacturing headaches.\n\nFord and campaign surrogates also wore the hat often during the provincial election in February, in which his government won in a rare, third majority mandate.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/ontario-premier-doug-ford-party-234907649.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iW9PwTqh1Sp_63wfUUtTKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xMzUwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/c680b4d49fe36ccfcf1f7f2bb6325733","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:49:07","author":"Leyland Cecco In Toronto","authors":["Leyland Cecco In Toronto"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.143},{"id":354976108,"title":"Redistricting Battle 2026: Trump Lashes Out After Judge Orders Utah Map To Be Redrawn","text":"President Donald Trump sharply criticized Utah Judge Dianna Gibson after she ordered the state to redraw its congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterms, a ruling that could diminish Republican dominance in the traditionally red state. Trump labeled the decision “absolutely unconstitutional” and accused the judge of political bias, claiming her ruling threatens the GOP's advantage in Utah’s four congressional districts. Trump's frustration stems from Gibson’s decision to enforce a 2018 voter-approved ballot measure requiring Utah’s congressional districts to be drawn by an independent commission. The ruling prevents the Legislature from using its own maps, which had preserved Republican-leaning districts. Trump argued that such a move undermines the will of Utah’s conservative electorate and questioned how a “wonderful Republican State like Utah” ended up with what he called “Radical Left Judges.” Ironically, Judge Gibson was appointed in 2018 by then-Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican. Nonetheless, Trump accused her of judicial activism, aligning with state GOP lawmakers who also claim the ballot measure is unconstitutional. In contrast, Gibson ruled that both the US and Utah Constitutions allow citizens to participate in redistricting through legislation and ballot measures, stating: “Because legislative power is shared co-equally and co-extensively between the Legislature and the people... the people have the fundamental constitutional right and authority to propose redistricting legislation that is binding on the Legislature.” Utah has four seats in the US House of Representatives, all of which are currently held by Republicans. Under the current map, all four seats lean heavily towards the GOP. However, that was made possible after the deep-blue state capital of Salt Lake City was divided into four parts, with each part added to deep-red parts of the states to dilute Democratic voters. Judge Gibson's order could force the creation of a map that could net Democrats at least one seat in the state. Trump’s attacks on the Utah decision mirror his broader redistricting strategy. At his request, Texas has adopted a new map that creates five more Republican leaning seats. In response, California is moving with its plan to redistrict and create five Democratic districts in the state via a ballot measure. Similar efforts are also underway in Florida and Indiana.

We both laughed hard at that.' \nLast November, the Long Lost Families presenter underwent an operation to remove a benign colloid cyst from her brain after it was found during a routine check-up while she was advocating for menopause health.\nA scan revealed she had a rare type of tumour that 'very, very rarely' can 'cause sudden death' for which she underwent successful surgery to remove the tumour via a craniotomy.\nBut a side effect was temporary short-term memory loss, which she said was 'improving every day'. \nBy April 2025, following a final MRI scan, she announced the tumour 'is not coming back'\nFor her, it was a terrifying ordeal and she is incredibly grateful – and relieved – to have got through it.\nMichael was at her bedside as she recovered and took to social media at the time to keep Davina's fans updated with her progress.\nBut he has also been her rock for recovery, which she said included going back to work after three months convalescing.\n\nBut it's only now that Davina's hairdresser-turned-boyfriend feels he can be honest about finding her 'annoying' - since the TV presenter's brain operation last year\n\nPosing on the cover of Good Housekeeping UK, she told the publication: 'Michael (Douglas) has been mega helpful with me on all of this. It's exhausting looking after someone so vulnerable and needy'\n\nShe continued: 'At one point, I thought his behaviour was a bit odd, but I couldn’t remember why it felt odd. I said to him, \"Michael, I've noticed you don't want to be around me much. If you feel differently about me, it's fine, I understand\"\n\nShe went on: 'He said, \"It's because you're annoying at the moment,\" and I've never been so relieved to be told that I'm annoying. I knew I was, because I'd repeat the same questions over and over again. We both laughed hard at that' (both pictured 2024)\n\n My brain tumour terror and the man who helped me through it: DAVINA MCCALL on how her outlook has changed, her extraordinary next steps - and why she fell for her hairdresser \nAs a self-confessed workaholic, Davina needed little encouragement to get back in front of the cameras as soon as possible.\nAnd so after three months convalescing, she returned to film the ITV series, Long Lost Family. It was, she said, 'like coming home'.\nShe told Daily Mail: 'Michael knew it would help me, so he supported me in going back. It was a terrifying to go through, but Michael knew it would be what would make me happiest. He was absolutely right. I had three months off, but that was it.' \nMichael and the BBC presenter became a couple in 2019 and publicly confirmed their relationship the same year after she had split from her husband of 17 years, Matthew Robertson, in 2017.\nThe My Mum, Your Dad host found love again with her hairdresser, and the pair look after the children she shares with her ex-husband - Holly, 23, Tilly, 21, and Chester, 18.\nDavina previously told Daily Mail: 'He knew everything about me before we got together.\n'We just told each other everything because we didn't fancy each other, so you could be really honest, more honest than you would if you fancied someone.' \nDavina's full interview can be read now in the October issue of Good Housekeeping UK. \n\nLast November, the TV presenter announced that she had been diagnosed with a colloid cyst, a rare type of benign brain tumour \n\nShe had a six-hour operation to remove a 14mmm colloid cyst from her brain on November 15, after a health check discovered the tumour \nDavina McCallMichael Douglas\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall's hairdresser-turned-boyfriend Michael Douglas admits he finds her 'annoying' since brain operation left her with short-term memory loss\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Erdoğan is doing everything to stop him","text":"A Turkish proverb – düştüğün yerden kalk – counsels that one should arise from where one has fallen. \n\nEkrem İmamoğlu, the jailed mayor of Istanbul and main rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey’s 2028 election, has taken this advice to heart. \n\nImprisoned in March on charges widely viewed to be concocted, İmamoğlu refuses to be silenced. Earlier this month, he published a by-invitation essay in The Economist setting out his vision for Turkey as an open democracy that plays a constructive role on the global stage.\n\nİmamoğlu’s proverbial fall was not mere clumsiness. Members of his opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) called his arrest a “civilian coup”, pointing the finger at the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Erdoğan. \n\nİmamoğlu was also charged with corruption and terror links just days before he was set to be anointed the CHP’s candidate for the 2028 presidential election.\n\nTurks from Istanbul to Anatolia immediately rose up to vent their fury. Protests continued for weeks despite bans on public gatherings. The government has since widened its net to arrest dozens of other opposition figures.\n\nErdoğan duly accused the opposition of fomenting unrest. But much like uprisings in 2013 that started over a government plan to redevelop an Istanbul park and metastasised into a wider protest movement, these rallies were a spontaneous reaction to Erdoğan’s own policies.\n\nTurkey’s creeping authoritarianism under Erdoğan\n\nErdoğan was once hailed a reformer who might provide a governance model marrying Islamic observance and democracy that could be replicated throughout the Muslim world. \n\nBut after ruling for two decades, first as prime minister and then president, he has centralised power and bent state institutions to his will. \n\nSo enmeshed is he in conceptions of the Turkish state and its political and economic architecture, it has spawned new terminology: “Erdoğanism”. Neighbouring states witnessing similar concentrations of power are said to be undergoing “Erdoğanisation”.\n\nTurkey under Erdoğan provides a potent example of “new authoritarianism”, a political model where the leader or ruling party maintains a veneer of democracy while skewing the system to their own advantage. “New authoritarians”, such as Vladimir Putin in Russia and Viktor Orban in Hungary, allow regular elections and grant some space to opposition parties. However, they have also constricted institutions and processes, hobbled the judiciary, the media and civil society, and rendered themselves unassailable. \n\nDocumenting the deterioration under Erdoğan, Freedom House rates Turkey’s political freedom at 33 out of 100, ranking it between Pakistan and Jordan. It notes shortcomings in electoral processes, political participation, the functioning of government, freedom of expression and rule of law. \n\nMeanwhile, Amnesty International points to: \n\ngovernment interference in judicial processes\nunjustified prosecutions and convictions of human rights defenders, journalists and opposition politicians \nrestrictions on freedom of assembly \nviolence against women.\n\nDespite this, international leaders seem reluctant to admonish Erdoğan for democratic backsliding under his watch. Other than some tepid statements from the European Union, İmamoğlu’s arrest attracted little criticism.\n\nIn recent months, US President Donald Trump has described Turkey as a “good place” and praised Erdoğan’s qualities as a leader. The EU has also resumed discussions with Ankara on security issues. \n\nThis reflects the increasingly important role Turkey plays on the international stage. It has harboured millions of Syrian refugees and has mediated between Ukraine and Russia to try to end the war there.\n\nAs such, Western leaders are reluctant to get Erdoğan offside by raising Turkey’s internal politics.\n\n Read more:\n Inaction from Brussels over the arrest of an opposition leader in Turkey may be a strategic mistake\n\nYouth movement pushing for change\n\nYet, like all authoritarians, Erdoğan is most wary of the electorate. \n\nHe has long defined his leadership as the personification of milli irade – the “national will”. However, after years of economic downturns and shrinking personal freedoms, fewer Turkish voters are buying it. \n\nSeveral polls have İmamoğlu well placed to win the next presidential election in 2028, even though his university degree has been revoked (in dubious circumstances), which makes him ineligible to run. Indeed, İmamoğlu has grown even more popular since his arrest. \n\nSuch was Erdoğan’s concern that he banned images of Imamoğu, only to see his wife, Dilek, raise her voice to become an opposition figurehead.\n\nIn particular, a younger generation of voters, having known nothing but Erdoğan’s rule, is looking for an alternative and turning towards İmamoğlu. \n\nThe Turkish journalist and political commentator Ece Temelkuran suggests the energy and new ideas of politically disenfranchised youth are capable of overturning old-school authoritarianism.\n\nIndeed, demonstrations since İmamoğlu’s arrest have seen high turnouts of Gen Z protesters. Even Pikachu made an appearance – a protester dressed in a costume of the video game character fleeing the police in Antalya. And a youth delegate recently raised the issue of İmamoğlu’s imprisonment at the Council of Europe, only to be arrested on returning to Ankara.\n\nAnd even as Erdoğan has restricted the political playing field in Turkey, İmamoğlu has proven to be a canny and agile operator. \n\nHe presents as affable and engaging, both domestically and internationally, in contrast with Erdoğan’s often belligerent posture. He won the Istanbul mayoral race in 2019 on a platform of “radical love”. The approach won hearts and minds in an electorate long defined by polarisation and nationalist rhetoric.\n\nWhen he was detained in March, İmamoğlu reportedly even quipped to police officers that their work conditions were so poor, they should come and work in his municipality. \n\nDespite Erdoğan’s consolidation of power, democracy may yet have legs in Turkey. Even with İmamoğlu in prison, an energised opposition and younger generation hankering for greater freedoms seem fully intent on arising from where they fall.","summary":"Young Turks, in particular, are increasingly looking for an alternative to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s authoritarian rule.","url":"https://theconversation.com/polls-suggest-this-man-could-become-turkeys-next-president-erdogan-is-doing-everything-to-stop-him-263034","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/687628/original/file-20250827-56-uve33p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C30%2C3283%2C1641&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:44:36","author":"Monash University,Teaching Associate in Politics & International Relations at the School of Social Sciences,William Gourlay","authors":["Monash University","Teaching Associate in Politics & International Relations at the School of Social Sciences","William Gourlay"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":354973556,"title":"Taylor Swift cưới gấp để “chạy bầu”?","text":"Nếu Taylor Swift đang mang thai thì đây hẳn sẽ là hạnh phúc nhân đôi với vợ chồng cô. \n\n Taylor Swift – Travis Kelce sắp kết hôn đang là tin tức nóng nhất thế giới .

The drop was driven by a $4 billion decrease in sales of H20 chips--specialized processors the company designed for the Chinese market, according to the earnings report.For the current quarter, Nvidia projected $54 billion in revenue but said its forecast assumes no H20 sales.Nvidia's high-end GPUs remain in hot demand from tech giants building data centers for artificial intelligence applications. However, investors are questioning whether the massive AI investments are sustainable.\"The data center results, while massive, showed hints that hyperscaler spending could tighten at the margins if near-term returns from AI applications remain difficult to quantify,\" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \"At the same time, US export restrictions are fueling domestic chipmaking in China.\"Nvidia shares fell slightly more than 3 percent in after-market trading.Earlier this month, President Donald Trump confirmed that Nvidia would pay the United States 15 percent of its revenues from sales of certain AI chips to China. Trump called Nvidia's H20 chips \"obsolete,\" despite their previous targeting under export restrictions.Beijing has responded by expressing national security concerns about Nvidia chips and urging Chinese businesses to rely on local semiconductor suppliers instead.Nvidia developed the H20 specifically for export to China to address US concerns that its top-tier chips could be used for weapons development or AI applications in the rival nation.\"There is interest in our H20s; we have supply ready to ship,\" Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said of the China market, which he estimated to be a $50 billion opportunity for Nvidia this year.\"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do.\"Huang said Nvidia is talking with the Trump administration about the importance of US companies being able to compete in China.\"We just have to keep advocating the sensibility of, and the importance of, American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard,\" Huang said.The earnings report comes amid market worries about an AI spending bubble that could burst and hurt the chip giant's fortunes. Nvidia serves as a bellwether for the AI market and became the first company to reach $4 trillion in market value last July.\"We're just seeing just enormous amount of interest in AI and demand for AI right now,\" Huang said on an earnings call.The top four cloud computing service providers are on pace to spend about $600 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and it's reasonable to think Nvidia is in line for a lot of that money, Huang reasoned.","summary":"AI powerhouse Nvidia reported quarterly earnings Wednesday that beat expectations, but shares slipped amid concerns about an AI chip spending bubble and the company's stalled business in China.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/ai-giant-nvidia-beats-earnings-expectations-shares-fall-3781796","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4618178/nvidia-chief-executive-jensen-huang-has-stressed-importance-china-market-its-ai-chips.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ee05e915c0733deea4f44be1b6069457","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:42:19","author":"Glenn Chapman","authors":["Glenn Chapman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":354972450,"title":"Will AI Glitches Harm Its Buoyant Stock Performance?","text":"AI has propelled the market well lately. Will that last?\n\nWhat could slow the pell-mell stock market advance of artificial intelligence? If there is any pothole ahead, it’s the glitch factor. A host of AI-related screwups is circulating in public and social media.\n\nSo far, stories about missteps haven’t derailed the AI stock market express, but there is a chance that enough of them could introduce a wariness about this new capability and impede the sector’s stock performance.\n\nAI harnesses high-end computer power to reason, learn, solve problems and make decisions, which previously have been humans’ exclusive purview. The momentum is potent. Big tech firms like Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are pouring billions into AI.\n\nNvidia, which boasts the world’s largest market cap, has seen its stock leap 15-fold over the past five years. Small wonder: AI’s earnings and revenue growth are often spectacular. AI-centric Nvidia’s just-announced second quarter showed a 56% profit boost over the year-prior period. It’s significant that, when the chip designer predicted Wednesday that Nvidia’s enviable revenue expansion might not maintain such a torrid pace up ahead, the stock flagged 2%.\n\nUp to now, worries over AI have centered on its strengths, rather than its weaknesses. The AI mania has had many folks worried that AI might someday supplant humanity, a scenario envisioned with HAL, the homicidal spaceship-running computer in the sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey. Thus, it is natural that some people might increasingly seize on AI pratfalls as a reassuring counter-narrative, and weaken AI equity prices.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAlready, doubts centered on AI fallibility have causes ripples of anxiety among tech investors. A recent MIT survey found that most of the $40 billion that companies have sunk into the technology have reaped zero returns and warned that many may never see any upside. And tellingly, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the godfather of artificial intelligence, has warned that AI investors may be in a stock bubble resembling the late 1990s dotcom disaster.\n\nPoor data, cybersecurity concerns, resistance to change, regulatory obstacles and insufficient AI talent were the biggest challenges AI faces to achieving full returns on investment, the MIT poll found.\n\nAccording to the tech mavens at Tech.co, glitches are sufficiently plentiful to raise questions about AI’s prospects. As Aaron Drapkin, the firm’s content manager, wrote, “AI errors have become as much a part of the technology as its accomplishments in 2025, with popular platforms experiencing enough hallucinations to make users concerned about the future of the tech.”\n\nAmong the recent problems Tech.co found: an AI-run hiring system for McDonald’s led to the exposure of millions of applicants’ personal information. Plus, an AI-generated summer reading list recommended a batch of fictitious titles, and the list appeared in several big newspapers. And AI-produced imagery last year suggested that singer Taylor Swift had endorsed Donald Trump for president; she hadn’t.\n\nThe good news is that “AI will get better,” said Jackson Garton, chief investment officer at Makena Capital Management, in an interview. Indeed, he observed, people tend to be more critical of machines’ mistakes: “The tolerance for human error is great than for machine error.” Garton advises that people use AI to appreciate its usefulness. “If you use it yourself, you will see how it will help you.” Companies that employ it well will benefit, as will their stocks, he said.\n\nAn old satirical illustration from the early 1900s, when automotive technology was poor, featured a frazzled motorist and his broken-down jalopy, as a grinning farmer on horseback passed by. The farmer yelled: “Get a horse.” We all know how the world of travel has changed since then. So will the tech world, driven by artificial intelligence, with a large potential for share appreciation among AI companies, tech in general and equities overall.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Investor doubts surface as the new hot technology encounters problems.

'I'm tired of the pain this world gives out.'\n\nShe then goes on to say that she has 'wanted this for so long' and knows the school shooting 'is wrong, but I can't seem to stop myself.\n\n'I am not well, I am not right. I am a sad person, haunted by those things that do not go away,' Westman wrote, saying she had recently 'lost all hope and decided to perform my final action against this world.'\n\nThe loss of hope apparently came as Westman started to believe she was dying of lung cancer, which she called a 'tragic end as it's entirely self-inflicted.\n\n'I did this to myself, as I cannot control myself and have been destroying my body through vaping and other means,' Westman explains, noting that she has 'felt many pains that make me think I am past the point of recovery.\n\n'I do not want to recover - I do not want to throw my life away by rotting in a hospital bed. I don't want the rest of my life to be as a cancer patient, in and out of hospitals, constantly being fretted about with people afraid to be too happy around me.\n\n'F*** that! I want to go out on my own means,' she explains.\n\n'Unfortunately, due to my depression, anger and twisted mind, I want to fulfill a final act that has been in the back of my head for years.' \n\nIn much of the rest of the suicide note, Westman tried to apologize to her family and friends as she pleaded with them to move on.\n\n'I don't expect forgiveness and I don't expect an apology,' the shooter began her letter. 'I have to hold much weight, but to my family and those close to me, I do apologize for the effects my actions will have on your lives.\n\n'Please know I care for all of you so much and it pains me to bring this storm of chaos into your lives.'\n\nWestman then told her parents to 'please move on and continue to give your love to my brothers and sisters and to the rest of the world.\n\n'Forget my life and the pain I've brought,' Westman asked before making a similar request to her siblings, who she admitted may now want to change their names.\n\nAt the end of her letter, Westman pleads with loved ones to 'find hope, find love and stand up to injustice.'\n\nIt was not clear if the shooter was motivated at least by politics, but a gun part she showed off in one of her videos included a message aimed at President Donald Trump - calling for him to be killed.\n\nOther gun parts had the names of other mass shooters scrawled on them.\n\nOfficials said in a press conference the shooter was armed with three guns - a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol. All three weapons were fired during the attack, police said.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the shooter approached the side of the church and shot through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews.\n\nIt is unclear if the shooter fired any of the weapons from inside the church or carried out the entire mass shooting outside before going inside.\n\nPolice said at least two of the church doors appeared to have been blocked by two by fours before the shooting, suggesting the gunman wanted to trap the people inside.\n\n'This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,' O'Hara said at a news conference. \n\n'The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.' \n\nThe students at the Catholic grade school had started school on Monday and were attending mass when the shooter stormed the church, which is connected to the school.\n\nIt has since emerged that Westman's mother, Mary, was an employee at the school before she retired in 2021. \n\nJust a few years prior, Mary had signed an application for Robin to have her name changed from Robert, according to court records seen by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe petition cost the family $311 and was ultimately approved in January 2020.\n\nIt adds that Westman 'identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.'\n\nYet it seemed Westman still struggled with her gender identity, writing at one point that she doesn't 'want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it.\n\n'I know I am not a woman but I definitely don’t feel like a man,' she wrote, adding: 'I really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.'\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey denounced transphobia after the revelations about Westman's identity emerged Wednesday afternoon.\n\n'I have heard about a whole lot of hate that is being directed at our trans community,' he said.\n\n'Anybody who is using this as an opportunity to villainize our trans community or any other community out there has lost their sense of common humanity. We should not be operating out of a place of hate for anyone.'\n\nHe added: 'We should be operating from a place of love. Kids, kids died today. This needs to be about them.","summary":"Minnesota school shooter Robin Westman made a shocking final plea to her family and friends in a suicide note she penned before she slaughtered two children at mass on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15040975/Robin-Westman-Minnesota-school-shooter-pray-victims.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/28/00/101611517-0-image-m-11_1756336312583.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/08/27/4966221814192322000/1024x576_MP4_4966221814192322000.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:39:20","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.565},{"id":354978198,"title":"ByteDance sets TikTok valuation at over US$330bil as revenue grows","text":"ByteDance, which owns TikTok, earned over US$43 billion in Q1, overtaking Meta to become the top social media company globally. (EPA Images pic)\nHONG KONG: ByteDance, the owner of short-video app TikTok, is set to launch a new employee share buyback that will value the Chinese technology giant at more than US$330 billion, driven by continued revenue growth, said three people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe company plans to offer current employees US$200.41 per share in the repurchase programme, the people said, up 5.5% from US$189.90 each it offered them about six months ago which valued ByteDance at roughly US$315 billion.\nThe buyback is expected to be launched in the autumn.\nThe latest buyback at a higher valuation will come as ByteDance consolidates its position as the world's largest social media company by revenue, with its second-quarter revenue up 25% year-on-year, the people said.\nThat jump resulted in the company's second-quarter revenue hitting about US$48 billion, two of the people said, most of which is from the Chinese market as it continues to face political pressure to divest its US arm.\nThe revised valuation and the second-quarter revenue growth details had not been reported previously. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to discuss the information with media.\nByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn the first quarter, ByteDance's revenue rose to more than US$43 billion, making it the world's No 1 social media company by sales, topping Facebook and Instagram owner Meta's US$42.3 billion in that period.\nBoth firms maintained sales growth above 20% in the second quarter, helped by robust advertising demand.\nByteDance's biannual buybacks allow employees of the privately held company to cash out some holdings and reflect a balance sheet strengthened by its expanding domestic and international businesses.\nIt is increasingly common for late-stage private companies to conduct regular buybacks to retain and provide liquidity to employees without an exit such as an initial public offering.\nMany, including SpaceX and OpenAI, use external investor capital to fund these programmes. ByteDance has been an outlier, steadily using its own balance sheet in a signal of financial flexibility and healthy margins.\nByteDance is also widely regarded as one of China's artificial intelligence leaders, having invested billions of dollars in buying Nvidia chips, building AI-related infrastructure and developing its models.\nTikTok sale\nDespite outpacing Meta on revenue this year, ByteDance's valuation remains less than a fifth of Meta's roughly US$1.9 trillion market capitalisation - a gap analysts attribute largely to political and regulatory risks in the US.\nByteDance faces intense pressure in Washington, where lawmakers have raised national security concerns over its Chinese ownership.\nCongress last year passed a law requiring ByteDance to divest TikTok's US assets by Jan 19, 2025 or face a nationwide ban of the app, which has 170 million US users.\nPresident Donald Trump has granted TikTok multiple reprieves and last week extended the deadline for the company to divest its US assets to Sept 17. He said US buyers were lined up for TikTok and the deadline could be pushed back again.\nSome lawmakers have criticised the delay, arguing his administration is flouting the law and ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok.\nByteDance is profitable as a company, but TikTok's US business has been loss-making so far, said two of the people. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\nIf the sale of TikTok's US business is finalised, it is expected to be owned by a joint venture formed by an American investor consortium and ByteDance, which will maintain a minority stake.\nThe consortium, which has emerged as the frontrunner, includes ByteDance's current shareholders Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR as well as Andreessen Horowitz, Reuters previously reported.\nBlackstone recently dropped out of the consortium after several delays in the deal's timeline.\nThe new ByteDance buyback could help bolster morale among its US-based staff, some of whom are concerned about TikTok's uncertain future.\nTikTok has also been working on preparing a potential standalone app for US users, sources told Reuters earlier, though it remains unclear if any contingency plan will be finalised amid Trump's ongoing trade talks with Beijing.","summary":"Current employees will be offered US$200.41 per share in a repurchase programme, up 5.5% from six months earlier.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/08/28/bytedance-sets-tiktok-valuation-at-over-us330bil-as-revenue-grows","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/8d382e25-11180532.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:36:29","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":354974014,"title":"Freddie Mercury's 'alleged love child says music legend would have hated his biopic Bohemian Rhapsody' and confesses it is 'full of fabrication'","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Aug 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMinneapolis school shooter Robin Westman revealed as transgender and anti-Trump as Democrats call for shooting to be de-politicized\n\nEpping hotel migrant tells court 'I'm not a wild animal' as he denies sexually assaulting schoolgirl - as moment police arrest him is released\n\nFather of Cambridge graduate, 23, who died after refusing chemotherapy on her anti-vaxxer mother's advice blames 'members of her family' for her death, inquest hears\n\nThe 100 best state schools in Britain: Experts reveal where to get the top taxpayer-funded education in every part of the UK.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:23 BST, 28 August 2025 |Updated:00:32 BST, 28 August 2025 \n\nFreddie Mercury's alleged love child has said the music legend would have hated his biopic Bohemian Rhapsody because it is 'full of fabrication'.\nThe Queen star's alleged daughter, who is only identified as 'B', was revealed earlier this year by biographer Lesley-Ann Jones, who says Freddie secretly fathered a child during an affair in 1976.\nShe alleges the late singer kept in contact with his daughter and even gave her 17 volumes of detailed personal journals before his death in 1991. \nAnd now The Sun has reported that B says Freddie would have blocked the 2018 film about the band unless he had some input.\nSpeaking about lead actress Rami Malek, who played Freddie, she said he never smiled or looked happy, unlike her dad. \nShe is also upset with how his AIDS diagnosis was handled, accusing producers of factual inaccuracies surrounding the dates. \n\nFreddie Mercury's 'alleged love child has said the music legend would have hated his biopic Bohemian Rhapsody' and confesses it is 'full of fabrication'\n\nSpeaking about lead actress Rami Malek (pictured in the 2018 film), who played Freddie, his alleged daughter, only known as B, said he never smiled or looked happy, unlike her dad\nThe woman told the publication she came forward as Freddie's daughter only to correct 'a movie that is full of fabrication'.\nShe added: 'Freddie would have been appalled by the movie. It would have made his hair stand on end. This film presents a version of him so far removed from the truth.'\nJones, who has written several books on Mercury, says the 48-year-old woman – identified only as 'B' – is the result of a fling between Mercury and the wife of a close friend – that she now has DNA evidence to back it up. \nThe new biography, titled Love Of My Life, claims Freddie shared the secret with his bandmates before he died – and that the woman now lives in Europe with a family of her own.\nIn a handwritten letter included in the book, the woman writes: 'Freddie Mercury was and is my father. We had a very close and loving relationship from the moment I was born and throughout the final 15 years of his life.\n'He adored me and was devoted to me. The circumstances of my birth may seem, by most people's standards, unusual and even outrageous. That should come as no surprise. It never detracted from his commitment to love and look after me. \n'Those who have been aware of my existence kept his greatest secret out of loyalty to Freddie.'\nEarlier this month B made an emotional statement ahead of publication of a book.\n\nB said: 'Freddie would have been appalled by the movie. It would have made his hair stand on end. This film presents a version of him so far removed from the truth' (Rami pictured) \n\nThe new biography claims Freddie shared the secret with his bandmates before he died – and that the woman now lives in Europe with a family of her own - pictured left to right are drummer Roger Taylor, Mercury, guitarist Brian May and bassist John Deacon \n\nThe astonishing claim was made by biographer Lesley-Ann Jones (pictured), who says the Queen frontman secretly fathered a child during an affair in 1976 – and that she now has DNA evidence to back it up \n\nHe is known to have had several relationships with women including Mary Austin - they are pictured here in September 1985\n\n Brian May's wife Anita Dobson breaks silence on Freddie Mercury secret lovechild claim \nShe penned: 'I didn't want to share my Dad with the whole world. After his death, I had to learn to live with the attacks against him, the misrepresentations of him, and with the feeling that my Dad now belonged to everyone.\n'I cried and mourned my Dad, while fans all around the world mourned Freddie. When you are 15 years old, it's not easy.\n'I had to become an adult without him, and live all the structuring moments and events without his support.\n'For 30 years I had to build my life and family without him and accept that he wouldn't be there to share the happy moments with us. For 30 years, while the rest of the world was reinterpreting Mercury's life, his music and all that he had been, I needed to have my Dad just for me and my family. How could I have spoken before?'\nB provided a statement after becoming aware that Mercury's one-time lover and close friend Mary Austin is allegedly saying she did not know B existed.\nMary, who inherited much of Freddie's fortune and avoids the public eye, is understood to have cast doubt on B's story in an interview with a Sunday newspaper. \nB said: 'I am devastated by Mary Austin's alleged response. For 34 years, the truth of Freddie's life has been distorted, twisted and rewritten, but she said nothing - with the exception of her comment about the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, which she called 'artistic licence'.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFreddie Mercury's 'alleged love child says music legend would have hated his biopic Bohemian Rhapsody' and confesses it is 'full of fabrication'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The Sandy Hook killer’s name – along with those of other mass shooters – was written on a gun clip, or magazine, laid on what appears to be a bed, scattered with guns and ammunition.\n\n‘I have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,’ Westman wrote in a journal entry on May 23, which was shared in the YouTube video. ‘Sandy Hook was my favorite, I think, exposure of school shootings.’\n\nIn the video, Westman showed the camera a handwritten note to her family (which includes five siblings) and friends.\n\nMessages in both English and Russian – including ‘kill Donald Trump’, ‘Where Is Your God?’ and ‘for the children’ – had been scrawled in white on the magazines.\n\nIn a 20-minute video, titled ‘So long and thanks for all the fish’ (the title of a sequel to The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy written by author Douglas Adams), a person believed to be Westman flips through a handwritten journal written in both English and Cyrillic.\n\nOne message was translated from Russian and read: ‘I have had thoughts about mass murder for a long time. I am very conflicted with writing this journal.’ \n\nThe journal also included a floor plan of a church, presumably Westman’s eventual target, which the reader then repeatedly stabs with a knife. \n\nWestman also explained why she had chosen to attack the Annunciation Catholic School, where her mother worked until she retired in 2021.\n\n‘I am feeling good about annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy, and I want to do more research,’ she wrote.\n\nAnother page read: ‘I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off.’\n\n‘Maybe I could attack an event at the on-site church,’ she went on. ‘I think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan … Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can.’\n\nWestman’s journal also hinted at her disturbing and confused political views which appeared to have been virulently Left-wing and anti-Semitic.\n\nOne page included a trans pride flag sticker with ‘Defend equality’ printed across the bottom and a sticker of an AK-47 assault rifle on top.\n\nIn another, she wrote ‘I hate fascism’ but soon added: ‘I also love when kids get shot, I love to see kids get torn apart’.\n\nIn another entry, however, she wrote: ‘If I carry out a racially motivated attack, it would be most likely against filthy Zionist jews’.\n\nShe called Jewish people ‘penny-sniffing’ and added: ‘FREE PALESTINE!’\n\nWestman said she wanted to carry out a ‘final act’ against ‘a target of political or societal significance…. Targets like [Elon] Musk, Trump or some significant exec.’\n\nWestman applied to change her birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minnesota, when she was 17 years old.\n\nAccording to court documents that name change was granted in January 2020.\n\nThe petition stated that Westman: ‘Identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.’\n\nWestman grew up in Richfield, a suburb about 15 mins drive outside Minneapolis. Her mother, Mary Grace Westman, 67, originally from Lexington, Kentucky, now lives in Naples, Florida.\n\nShe joined the Annunciation Catholic School as an administrative assistant in the school’s Business Office having been a secretary at another local Catholic school for seven years. At the time, she had six children (including Robin) and a grandchild.\n\n‘Mary Grace is eager to get to know everyone at Annunciation,’ announced the school magazine. ‘You will find that she usually has treats on her desk!","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nImagining a crime more horrific than the murder of children praying in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: America Analyzes the Disturbing Online Posts of Another Shooter first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/america-analyzes-the-disturbing-online-posts-of-another-shooter/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/America-picks-apart-yet-another-shooters-sick-online-ramblings.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:25:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":354970924,"title":"From #MeToo to #FreeKilmar: Democrats keep trashing their dearest values over Trump","text":"Just eight years ago, in those halcyon days of 2017, millions of women took to the streets in pink “pussy” hats to protest the election of President Donald Trump, who they saw as an affront to women.\n\nThe Women’s March planted leftists’ enraged flag in the sand — and eight months later they swamped social media and America’s airwaves to excoriate sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nProtecting and believing women was the movement’s clarion call, with the hashtag #MeToo a symbol of women standing together against predators and abusers.\n\nAnd now, in 2025, they have once again taken to the streets to rally around . . . a credibly accused wife-beater.\n\nJust because Trump is trying to deport him.\n\nYou read that right: The left is out in full force — marching, singing, chanting, even traveling to Central America — to defend Kilmar Abrego Garcia, known to the sycophantic legacy media as the “Maryland man wrongfully deported by the Trump administration.”\n\nIn fact, Abrego Garcia is from El Salvador.\n\nHe’s an illegal immigrant who gamed the asylum system to remain here after a judge issued a deportation order due to his apparent ties to MS13, a notorious gang whose members, experts say, “systematically use gender-based violence . . . to exert territorial control.”\n\nHe’s also an alleged serial wife-beater, according to his spouse Jennifer Abrego Garcia, who has been recorded begging a judge to step in and protect her.\n\nAnd he was caught in the act of human trafficking, for which he’s now facing charges.\n\nThe only mistake Trump made was in first deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, an error he’s trying to correct by sending him to Uganda instead. \n\nYet as Trump tries to rid America’s streets of this lowlife, the media and the Democrats have rallied to Abrego Garcia’s side, demanding his freedom.\n\n“Kilmar is all of us,” tweeted Democratic Socialist Rep. and progressive standard-bearer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nReally? Why are we all Kilmar the wife-beater and not Jennifer, the American citizen who said he repeatedly beat her up?\n\nWhat happened to “Believe All Women”?\n\nIt’s truly amazing: The left went from pussy hats and #MeToo to adoringly boosting a wife-beating gangbanger in just eight short years, for no other reason than that the wife-beating gangbanger is someone Trump wants removed from the country.\n\nA Trump deportation order was all it took for the warriors of the #MeToo movement to embrace a violent misogynist.\n\nThere’s not a value leftists hold dear that they won’t immediately turn on if they suspect Trump agrees with it.\n\nRemember when the left fought for free speech?\n\nNot anymore! The Biden administration routinely pressed social media companies to censor posts that didn’t align with the regime agenda.\n\nOr remember when the left supported “my body, my choice” — until Biden pushed mandatory COVID vaccines?\n\nOr when the left stood for women’s rights — then started demanding access for trans athletes in women’s sports and women’s locker rooms?\n\nThe age of Trump has scrambled the categories of left and right, but nothing makes liberals renounce their own values like Trump himself.\n\nNot so long ago, a hawkish immigration policy was a left-wing preoccupation. As recently as 2015, Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders was calling open borders “a Koch brothers proposal.”\n\nLabor unions used to oppose immigration on the grounds that a mass supply of cheap labor hurts working-class wages.\n\nBut when Trump made that exact case, every single Democratic politician — including Sanders! — turned on a dime and promised to decriminalize illegal border crossing, and Biden went on to do just that.\n\nThey’ve done the same 180 on economics: Remember when it was the left that supported tariffs and a strong manufacturing base? That was the basis of the Democrats’ electoral “blue wall.”\n\nNow they’re all-in on free trade, condemning Trump’s tariffs as a tax on consumers — even though corporations seem to have eaten the lion’s share of them.\n\nLeftists spent the last five years braying about greedflation and demanding higher corporate taxes — yet when Trump actually got corporations to eat $100 billion in tariffs, they pivoted yet again.\n\nThe Je Suis Kilmar-ification of the Democrats reveals a party adrift — from its voters and its values.\n\nIt’s a party that has supplanted any positive platform, policy or message with a reflexive mandate: oppose Trump, whatever he does.\n\nHe is a singular threat to Democracy! they insist.\n\nThe truth is, Trump is a singular threat to Democrats — not because he opposes them, but because he’s pilfered their best material, and with it their base.\n\nAnd rather than fight for either, they’ve abandoned both.\n\nBatya Ungar-Sargon is the author of “Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America’s Working Men and Women” and hosts “Batya” on NewsNation.","summary":"There's not a principle leftists hold dear that they won't immediately turn on if they suspect Donald Trump agrees with it.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/27/opinion/from-metoo-to-freekilmar-dems-trash-their-values-over-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-7jsg3fnoj-1756334782979.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1756320395&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SVqn1w0R-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:21:28","author":"Batya Ungar-Sargon","authors":["Batya Ungar-Sargon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":354969598,"title":"The student turned killer: As praying children are slaughtered, America is left looking for clues in yet another mass shooter's sick online ramblings","text":"It's difficult to imagine a more horrific crime than killing children as they pray in church, so it will be a particular challenge trying to understand the sort of person prepared to do it.\n\nRobin Westman was the 23-year-old transgender woman who is accused of opening fire through the stained-glass windows of the Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis on Wednesday morning during a celebratory back-to-school mass packed with children.\n\nTwo children were killed, and 17 others injured, when the shooter sprayed bullets as the young congregants scrambled down in the pews to escape the deadly fire.\n\nBefore beginning her onslaught, Westman had reportedly used wooden planks to barricade the church's two side doors shut.\n\nArmed with a rifle, shotgun and handgun - all used in the slaughter (and, say police, all purchased legally and recently) - Westman died at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nSchool shootings are in danger of losing their shock value in modern America.\n\nAnd while each is tragic in its own way, there are common themes among the perpetrators that have become grimly familiar - mental health issues, easy access to guns and an obsession with emulating or surpassing previous mass killers.\n\nThe shooters often target the school where they were themselves educated, suggesting a feeling of lingering hatred and desire for revenge against their alma mater.\n\nWestman's victims all attended the Annunciation Catholic School where she was herself once a pupil.\n\nAnd the connection with these school shooters sometimes goes further than having been a pupil at the establishment they target.\n\nNancy Lanza once worked at Sandy Hook, the Connecticut elementary school where her 20-year-old son, Adam, a former pupil there, shot and killed 26 people in 2012.\n\nSo Westman's mother had previously been an administrative assistant at the school whose church service she devastated on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn fact, it should perhaps come as no surprise that Westman admitted she had a particular admiration for the monstrous Lanza - who'd been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome aged 13 and, according to his father, suffered from undiagnosed schizophrenia.\n\nThe similarities between the killers are many and chilling.\n\nLanza's mother, whose relationship with her son so degenerated that they were only communicating by email despite sharing the same house, was the first victim that Lanza killed.\n\nNow it appears that Westman may have had a particular animus against his own mother, Mary Grace – or at least the religion in which she raised her family.\n\nMary Grace is a devout Catholic and past anti-abortion activist who once wore a necklace of crucifixes to protest outside a Minneapolis Planned Parenthood clinic in March 2005.\n\nWithin hours of the shooting, FBI director Kash Patel announced they were investigating the killings as an 'act of domestic terrorism' and anti-Catholic hate crime.\n\nLike Lanza, who committed one of the worst mass killings in US history, Westman had no previous involvement with the police.\n\nAnd like Lanza, this was no sudden explosion of random anger and violence but a carefully planned and targeted strike against her former school.\n\nHours before the shooting Westman shared a series of home-made videos that appeared to include a deeply twisted manifesto.\n\nPolice said the manifesto posted on a now deleted YouTube account was timed to be released just before the attack.\n\nIt included a photo of Lanza.

The poll also shows strong concern over urban crime, with 80 percent of respondents calling it a serious problem in large cities. \n\nThe poll additionally shows Trump with his highest-ever approval rating, jumping five points in the last month.\n\nData released by the Associated Press on Wednesday revealed that 45 percent of Americans view the job that Trump is doing favorably. \n\nThat is Trump's highest approval rating in the AP-NORC poll across both terms.\n\nPolling by JL Partners found Trump's approval to be at 49 percent in July.\n\n Attorney General Pam Bondi shared on X Monday that 1,178 arrests had been conducted and 123 illegal guns had been seized amid Trump's push to make D.C. safe again.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser noted in a Wednesday press conference that amid Trump's actions in her city, carjackings were down by 87 percent. \n\n'We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD has been able to do in this city,' Bowser stated.\n\n'We know that when carjackings go down, when use of gun goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer, so this surge has been important to us,' the mayor noted.\n\nOther elected leaders in the city were not as quick to sing the president's praises.\n\nCouncilmember Robert White Jr., a Democrat, said in a video posted on X that 'We should not, as the District of Columbia, be giving people the impression that this is a good thing, that we are OK with it, that it is helping the city. It is not doing any of those thing.'\n\n'I am not OK with this. The average resident is not OK with this. D.C. residents, D.C. voters, are not OK with this,' White added.\n\nWard 1 DC Councilmember Brianne K. Nadeau wrote in her own X post that D.C. was 'under siege.' \n\n'Our residents are afraid, hesitant to go out & to work, angry that our limited autonomy is being eroded. There is nothing welcome about this,' Nadeu added. \n\nThe president on Friday said he's considering sending National Guard troops to other cities such as Chicago after the success of his D.C. crackdown.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker fired back at the president, noting that 'If you hurt my people, nothing will stop me — not time or political circumstance — from making sure you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.'\n\nLast week, Trump said he was considering Chicago and New York for troop deployments, adding that Chicago was 'a mess.' \n\n'You have an incompetent mayor - grossly incompetent. And we'll straighten that one out probably next. That will be our next one after this, and it won't even be tough,' the president noted at the time.","summary":"New polling shows Americans are huge fans of President Donald Trump 's new crime crackdown.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15040941/Shock-poll-shows-Americans-really-Trumps-military-takeover-crime-ridden-cities.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/28/00/101611995-0-image-a-8_1756335976782.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-27 23:17:04","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":354982986,"title":"US raises India tariff to 50% in response to Russian oil imports","text":"A Storm at the Gates: The New US Tariffs Shake India’s Trade Landscape\n\nOn a crisp morning in April 2024, the sun rose over the bustling ports and factories of India, but beneath the daily hum of commerce, a fresh chill settled over many exporters. The United States, one of India’s largest trading partners, had just thrown down the gauntlet, imposing a staggering 50% tariff on a range of Indian goods. This isn’t just another skirmish in the global trade wars—it marks a profound shift in the economic ties between two giants, and sends ripples far beyond the border.\n\nAt first glance, the picture is clear: this steep tariff doubles existing duties, a move spearheaded by the administration of President Donald Trump. The strategic aim? To punish India for its energy dealings with Russia, particularly its continued imports of Russian oil—a lifeline Moscow depends on as it wages war in Ukraine. But as always in diplomacy, the surface obscures the undercurrents simmering below.\n\nNew Duties, Old Tensions: The US-India Trade Rift Deepens\n\nThe 50% duty level stands among the sharpest tariffs the US has imposed on any trade partner, drawing gasps from market watchers and industry leaders alike. “It’s like a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel,” remarked Rakesh Mehta, a Mumbai-based textile exporter, whose family business suddenly finds itself grappling with canceled orders and rising uncertainty.\n\nFor India, which exported $87.3 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024, an abrupt tariff hike spells trouble—not only in lost revenue but in the shadows cast over countless small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Textiles, jewellery, and seafood exporters are already reporting cuts in demand, as buyers turn to cheaper rivals in Bangladesh and Vietnam. “My workers are asking if their jobs will survive this,” said Mehta, his voice a mix of worry and resolve.\n\nRemarkably, the tariff list excludes some critical sectors—pharmaceuticals, computer chips, smartphones, and even steel and aluminium remain exempt, though investigations into some of these domains are ongoing. This cautious approach suggests Washington’s desire to avoid a complete economic rupture. Yet, the message is unmistakable: the US is serious about pressing India on its Russian oil imports, a bold geopolitical gambit in the shadow of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe Heart of the Matter: Russian Oil and Energy Security\n\nIndia’s gambit is rooted in pragmatism. Russia accounted for nearly 36% of India’s crude oil imports in 2024, a critical component of its energy security strategy. “The global energy market is turbulent, and sourcing affordable oil is vital to keep our economy stable,” explained Meena Krishnan, an energy analyst based in Delhi. “By buying Russian oil, India saved billions, ensuring fuel prices at home didn’t spiral.”\n\nThis economic calculus, however, collided headlong with US foreign policy priorities. Washington views these oil transactions as indirectly funding Russia’s war effort, a stance the Trump administration has been vocal and unyielding about. “India doesn’t appear to want to recognize its role in the bloodshed,” said Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, last week, underscoring the administration’s hard stance.\n\nThe foreign ministry in New Delhi retorted that the US had initially encouraged such trade to stabilize global markets. “These tariffs are unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” declared a spokesperson in a sharp response. Here unfolds a complex narrative where economic necessity, geopolitical strategy, and diplomatic frictions intertwine.\n\nWinds of Change: India’s Strategic Response\n\nFacing this tariff tempest, India is charting a course of cautious defiance and resilient adaptation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent Independence Day address, promised to lighten the tax burden on citizens and reaffirmed his commitment to “Atmanirbhar Bharat” — a vision of self-reliance that echoes through India’s factories and farms alike. It’s a call not just to overcome adversity, but to seize a new economic destiny.\n\n“India is no stranger to navigating complex trade landscapes,” observes Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former US trade official. “What’s troubling is how quickly the US-India relationship has soured—from a promising partner in trade negotiations to a country facing some of the harshest tariffs imposed by America.”\n\nCutler warns of eroded trust that may take years to rebuild. “Tariffs are more than just economic barriers; they’re political signals. The high duties now risk turning a strong bilateral partnership into a precarious standoff.”\n\nLooking Beyond: What This Means for Global Trade\n\nIndia’s predicament is a microcosm of broader shifts shaking the architecture of international commerce. The renewed US enthusiasm for tariffs reflects a deeper unease about trade imbalances, supply chain vulnerabilities, and geopolitical rivalries. While trade deficits have long been a hot button for Washington—impacting deals from the EU to Indonesia—the blunt instrument of tariffs often carries unintended consequences.\n\nConsider the ripple effect. Small exporters strained by these duties may face bankruptcy or layoffs, which impacts local communities and workers reliant on these industries. As orders dry up, entire supply chains— from shrimpers off the coast of Kerala to silk weavers in Gujarat—feel the pressure. It’s a stark reminder that behind every statistic lies a human story.\n\nMeanwhile, India’s drift towards closer ties with China—the very rival the US sees as its main competitor in Asia—adds a geopolitical dimension that transcends economics. “Trade is never just about money. It’s about alliances, influence, and values,” notes Dr. Anjali Rao, a geopolitics professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nAre we witnessing a new era where economic strategies are weaponized to enforce political goals? And how will emerging economies like India navigate these treacherous waters without losing their footing? The answers remain uncertain, but the stakes could not be higher.\n\nQuestions to Ponder\n\nCan India pivot economically to reduce its dependence on Western markets without sacrificing growth?\nWill the US revisit these tariffs as diplomatic dialogue continues, or are we facing a prolonged period of trade hostility?\nHow do these developments shape the global balance of power, particularly between democracies and autocracies?\nWhat role do global consumers play—can public demand for ethically aligned policies influence these trade decisions?\n\nAs we watch the story unfold, it’s essential to remember that behind every tariff and trade deal lies a complex web of human ambition, political calculation, and economic survival. For the millions whose livelihoods now hang in the balance, this isn’t just headline news—it’s their reality.\n\nSo where do you stand in this global theater? As a citizen, business owner, or observer—how do you interpret this collision of commerce and diplomacy, and what hopes do you hold for a world where trade fosters cooperation instead of conflict?","summary":"A Storm at the Gates: The New US Tariffs Shake India’s Trade Landscape On a crisp morning in April 2024, the sun rose over the bustling ports and factories of India, but beneath the daily hum of commerce, a fresh chill settled over many exporters.

The video, which had been taken down from YouTube as of late Wednesday afternoon, also showed messages written on rifle magazines that said “For the Children” and “Where is your God.”\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said police hadn’t yet found any relationship between the shooter and the church, nor determined a motive for the bloodshed. The chief said, however, that investigators were examining a social media post that appeared to show the shooter at the scene and contained “some disturbing writings.”\n\n“This level of violence is unthinkable,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on social platform X where she discussed the messages. “Our deepest prayers are with the children, parents, families, educators, and Christians everywhere.

Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, gained new momentum during the Biden administration after U.S. intelligence collected evidence suggesting he mishandled classified material, according to a report in The New York Times.Citing people familiar with the matter, the Times said U.S. agencies obtained information from a foreign adversary's spy service, including emails that Bolton appeared to have sent on an unclassified system while in the Trump White House. The messages, reportedly containing sensitive material from classified documents, were allegedly sent to people close to Bolton who were helping him prepare his 2020 memoir, The Room Where It Happened.The revelations explain why FBI agents executed searches of Bolton's Maryland home and Washington office last week — a dramatic escalation in an inquiry that had long been viewed as dormant. No charges have been filed, but prosecutors sought the warrants to determine if Bolton possessed evidence corroborating the foreign spy service's cache, the Times reported.The investigation began years earlier under Trump, when the administration sought to delay publication of Bolton's book and accused him of disclosing classified information. A judge later said Bolton may have revealed sensitive material but did not block release. The criminal probe appeared to languish until U.S. intelligence intercepted Bolton's alleged emails years later, during Biden's presidency, the Times said.The intercepted material, which has not been made public, reportedly included classified information Bolton did not ultimately use in his book. That could suggest he was warned during manuscript reviews that the content remained classified, or that he omitted it for sensitivity reasons, according to the report.Federal judges approved the FBI's recent searches, which required prosecutors to demonstrate probable cause that Bolton had evidence of mishandling classified information. The warrants have reignited debate over whether Trump is pressuring the Justice Department to target critics. Bolton, once a staunch Trump ally, has since become one of his most vocal detractors.Bolton has retained discussions with Abbe Lowell, the high-profile defense attorney who has represented Jared Kushner and Hunter Biden, as well as other Trump adversaries currently under scrutiny, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.It remains unclear which foreign government intercepted Bolton's emails, though the Times noted that Iran, Russia, and China all had strong motives to monitor his communications during his time as national security adviser. Bolton played a key role in the Trump administration's decision to kill a top Iranian general, leaving him under threat of retaliation. Trump ended Bolton's U.S. security detail the day after taking the oath for his second term, the paper said.During Trump's second term, CIA Director John Ratcliffe briefed FBI Director Kash Patel on the intelligence, according to the Times report. Officials believed the unclassified emails transcribed information from classified material, triggering the new phase of the investigation.The case against Bolton is unfolding against a backdrop of high-profile investigations into the handling of national security secrets. Hillary Clinton was scrutinized over her private email server in 2016, Trump himself was charged — before the case was dismissed — for retaining classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, and President Biden faced a special counsel inquiry into records found at his home and office.The Bolton probe is proceeding under the Espionage Act, the 1917 law increasingly invoked in modern political disputes. While no charges are pending, the Times said the FBI searches were aimed at verifying whether Bolton still holds documents matching the intercepted material, which would bolster the case.This is a breaking news article.

Older children were protecting younger children. … It could have been significantly worse without their heroic action.”\n\nStill, “we lost two angels today,” he said of two students, ages 8 and 10, who were killed.\n\nThe suspect wounded an additional 17 people before dying by suicide in the back of the church, said Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.\n\nThe shooter was identified by O’Hara as Robin Westman, 23. The mother of a person of the same name and age as Westman previously worked at the site of the shootings, Church of the Annunciation. O’Hara said he could not confirm a relationship between the suspect and the church, “but that’s obviously something we’re looking very closely at.”\n\nRobin Westman had a manifesto and had timed it to be released on YouTube. It “appeared to show (the suspect) at the scene and included some disturbing writings,” O’Hara said. With the assistance of the FBI, the content has since been taken down and “it now remains under active review by our investigators,” the police chief said.\n\nO’Hara didn’t provide information about the manifesto and added: “I have no information to share on a motive,” he said.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said on X (formerly Twitter) that the shooting is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.\n\n‘Deliberate act of violence’\n\nWestman was outside the South Minneapolis church and shot through the windows, O’Hara said. The two children killed were sitting in the pews.\n\n“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshiping,” O’Hara said. “The sheer cruelty and cowardice firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.”\n\nAt Annunciation Catholic School, which resumed Monday after summer break, there was Mass to mark the first week of school. It was toward the beginning, so some children had already filed in and were seated, while others were coming in, O’Hara said. There were dozens of children present.\n\nMinneapolis police officers entered the church, attempted to provide first aid and rescued some of the children who were hiding throughout the building, according to O’Hara. First responders rushed victims to nearby hospitals.\n\nThe police chief said a wooden plank was placed to barricade some of the side doors, and that authorities found a smoke bomb but no explosives at the scene.\n\nO’Hara said Wednesday afternoon that there was “no indication of other suspects directly involved in carrying out this attack.”\n\nLaw enforcement were carrying out search warrants at the church and three residences “nearby in the metro that are related to this shooter,” and additional firearms were being recovered from those locations as of Wednesday afternoon, O’Hara said.\n\nVictims in critical condition\n\nThe 14 wounded juvenile victims are ages 6 to 15, and three adult victims are parishioners in their 80s who were attending the Mass. There is a range of injuries, but all the victims are expected to survive, O’Hara said.\n\nHennepin Healthcare in Minneapolis was caring for 10 victims as of 12:15 p.m. Wednesday. Six children and one adult were in critical condition, and another adult and two children were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, according to the hospital.\n\nChildren’s Minnesota said seven children ages 9 to 16 had been admitted to their hospital, and four patients had been released as of about 4:30 p.m.\n\nDanielle Gunter, whose eighth-grade son was injured in the shooting, said their “hearts are shattered — not only for him, but for everyone who was harmed. We grieve and we pray: for the others who were shot, for their families, and for those who lost loved ones.”\n\nShe said in a statement that they “feel the pain, the anger, the confusion, and the searing reality that our lives will never be the same. Yet we still have our child. Unlike others, we are blessed to hold onto him. We will help him rebuild his life, his trust and his confidence.\n\n“We don’t want others to ever feel the same. And we pray that everyone touched by this tragedy can find the strength to begin rebuilding, too.”\n\nGunter thanked first responders “who raced into danger for others, for us. … Our son shared with us that an MPD officer ‘really helped him.’ He said the officer rendered aid, hugged him, reassured him and prayed with him before getting into the ambulance.”\n\nWeston Halsne, 10, told WCCO-TV that a friend saved him by laying on top of him. He said his friend was injured, and that’s he praying for him.\n\n“It was, like, shots fired and then we kind of like got under the pews,” he said. “They shot through the stained-glass windows, I think, and it was really scary.”\n\nDozens of officers responded to the scene and “many of them are deeply traumatized by what they saw, as are obviously all of the children, all of the staff members … everyone who was at Mass this morning,” O’Hara said.\n\n‘Never again’\n\nAt Annunciation Catholic School, which serves preschoolers through eighth-graders, this school year’s theme is from the prophet Jeremiah chapter 29: “A future filled with hope.”\n\n“There’s nothing about today that can fill us with hope,” Principal DeBoer said. “We as a community have a responsibility to make sure that no child, no parent, no teacher ever has to experience what we’ve experienced today. … Never again.”\n\nAt a Wednesday morning press conference near the church, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged people to move beyond “thoughts and prayers.”\n\n“These kids were literally praying,” he said. “… They should be able to go to school or church in peace without the fear or risk of violence. … These are the sort of basic assurances that every family should have every step of the day, regardless of where they are in our country.”\n\nFederal officials referred to Westman as transgender, and Frey decried hatred being directed at “our transgender community.”\n\nWestman’s gender identity wasn’t clear. In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman’s mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”\n\nGov. Tim Walz ordered flags to fly at half mast at state buildings “immediately and continuing indefinitely” for the victims of the shootings.\n\n“It’s my strongest desire that no state, no community, no school ever experiences a day like this,” he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, with his leadership team of the attorney general and vice president, called Walz on Wednesday and offered “to provide the support to the folks here in Minnesota of what’s needed,” the governor said.\n\nPope Leo XIV sent a message to Archbishop Bernard Hebda of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis, via the Vatican’s secretary of state. It said the pope “sends his heartfelt condolences and the assurance of spiritual closeness to all those affected by this terrible tragedy,” Hebda read from the message.\n\nNeighbors heard shots, saw crying children\n\nPeople in the area heard gunshots ring out.\n\n“It was by far the loudest, most horrific thing I’ve ever heard,” said Renee Landers, who lives close by. “I feel like it was just going forever.”\n\nNeighbor Mark McLean said he saw “officers running from all directions.”\n\n“In the worst possible way,” McLean said.
