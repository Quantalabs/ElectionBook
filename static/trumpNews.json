The market is suggesting growth fears will dominate and is pricing-in almost four rate cuts this year.’\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, added: ‘There was this assumption that this administration would be brilliant for the US economy and difficult for the rest of the world.\n\n‘It’s increasingly evident this policy mix in the US is more difficult for the US itself.’\n\nBanks lead global stock market rout\n\n By PATRICK TOOHER\n\nBanks bore the brunt of the stock market sell-off yesterday amid fears of a global recession.\n\nThe hardest-hit were shares in Standard Chartered, which was down 13.3 per cent, and HSBC, off by 8.9 per cent – which led the fallers in the FTSE 100 index.\n\nBoth lenders are heavily exposed to Asia, where sweeping tariffs on goods entering the US are among the steepest.\n\nThey were closely followed by Barclays, which fell 8.7 per cent.\n\nAnalysts said it was exposed to any fall in deal activity which would affect its investment banking unit.\n\nReduced demand for loans and the prospect of deeper and faster interest rate cuts could also squeeze profits, they added.\n\nAll three banks have substantial operations in the US – where shares in local lenders were also hammered.\n\nJP Morgan, the biggest bank in the US, fell 7.1 per cent. Goldman Sachs was 9 per cent lower, Morgan Stanley was down 9.7 per cent and Citigroup slumped 12 per cent.\n\nAlso in the doghouse was JD Sports, whose shares dived 7.9 per cent.

His posts—punctuated with slogans like “ONLY THE WEAK WILL FAIL!”—insisted the pain was temporary, the strategy masterful.Markets didn’t agree.The Dow Jones nosedived 5.5%, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, and Nasdaq tumbled 5.8%, plunging it into bear market territory. The chaos mirrored losses in Asia and Europe, where major indices like Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 sank. Oil fell to its lowest level since 2021, copper dipped, and even the Japanese Nikkei slid 2.8%.China hits back, world reactsBeijing, which bore the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, struck back swiftly. A 34% duty on all US imports will kick in from 10 April. China also announced it would file a complaint at the World Trade Organization and cut off rare earth exports — essential materials for electronics and medical devices.Other trading partners were more cautious. The European Union, hit with a 20% tariff, said it would act “in a calm, carefully phased, unified way,” according to EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic. But he also warned the bloc “won’t stand idly by.”France’s Economy Minister Eric Lombard called on businesses to show “patriotism,” while hinting that retaliation might come in forms other than tariffs — such as digital taxes and tighter data regulations. Germany echoed calls for calm, but both countries have floated the idea of taxing American tech giants in response.Even Japan, slapped with a 24% tariff, urged restraint. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said the country would pursue a “calm-headed” response.Business confusion, supply shocksTrump's message from Mar-a-Lago was clear: “Big business is not worried about the Tariffs, because they know they are here to stay.” But not all businesses seemed on board.General Electric Healthcare and DuPont took major hits following China’s retaliation. Nintendo postponed preorders for its upcoming Switch 2 console, citing “evolving” conditions. Automaker Stellantis temporarily paused operations in some Canadian and Mexican plants. In contrast, Nissan said it would expand US production, while Volvo, owned by China’s Geely, followed suit.Still, the general mood was apprehensive. A sweeping 25% tariff on all foreign-made vehicles took effect this week. Canada responded with similar duties on US imports.‘He’s out golfing!’Back home, Trump’s critics slammed both his absence and his policy.“He’s messing around with people’s lives... while he’s out golfing!” fumed Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Even Republican Senator Ted Cruz — a usual ally — expressed concern, warning that the tariffs could “hurt jobs and hurt America.”Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a cautious tone. “Higher inflation and lower growth” were likely outcomes of Trump’s trade war, he said — not exactly a recipe for prosperity.Trump, undeterred, lashed out again. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!” he posted, breaking long-standing protocol around the Fed’s independence.A tax by another nameThe broader economic picture is worrying. Analysts say the tariffs function as a massive tax hike. JPMorgan put the figure at around $660 billion — the largest increase in decades — and warned it could push US inflation up by nearly 2% this year. The result? A likely recession.Paul Donovan, Chief Economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said, “The US isn’t sneezing, the US is hacking off one of its limbs.” A few months ago, he noted, America’s economy was in good shape. Now, the risk of recession is real — and global.JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have both flagged rising recession risks. US consumer prices were already 2.8% higher year-on-year in February. Add Trump’s tariffs, and inflation could climb steeply while growth stalls.Global shockwavesThe impact is unlikely to stay contained. If American households pull back spending, demand for foreign goods drops. That could lead to job cuts and economic slowdowns abroad, especially in Europe and Asia.Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, warned that the real burden would fall on businesses. “All businesses, big and small, will suffer from day one… The costs of doing business with the United States will drastically increase,” she said.Even without direct retaliation, European consumers may feel the pinch if their governments choose to answer Trump in kind. “European consumers will face the same sort of price increases that US consumers are facing,” said Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics.Others, like France’s Lombard, have floated more targeted moves — perhaps going after individual firms rather than imposing broad tariffs.Oxford Economics believes a global recession is still avoidable, but barely. “It would be the weakest annual growth rate since the global financial crisis, excluding the pandemic period,” noted Ben May, the firm’s director of macroeconomic research.Trump's strategy is built on economic brinkmanship — the idea that pain now means strength later. “My policies will never change,” he said. “This is a great time to get rich.”He’s betting the US can weather the storm better than its rivals. But analysts say the gamble might blow back. The US could be hardest hit if it finds itself isolated while the rest of the world imposes coordinated countermeasures.For now, Trump is all in — golfing, posting, and pushing a vision of America that rises through economic war. Whether that vision materialises, or whether the rest of the world gets dragged into a slowdown, is still playing out on trading floors across the globe.","summary":"Donald Trump dismissed the worst US market crash since the pandemic, brushing off investor panic as a \"great time to get rich\". His sweeping tariffs have sparked a global trade war, drawing retaliation from China and warnings from economists about recession and inflation. While markets reeled and global leaders called for calm, Trump posted defiant messages from his golf course, insisting his strategy would boost US manufacturing and force trade concessions. Critics warn the fallout could be far-reaching and painful.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/only-the-weak-will-fail-trump-tees-off-as-6-trillion-vanishes-in-market-meltdown-triggered-by-liberation-day-tariffs/articleshow/119997540.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119998055,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-124028,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 01:00:47","author":"Et Online","authors":["Et Online"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":307836670,"title":"Trump’s tariffs - Congress cedes authority, stocks plunge: Letter to the Editor","text":"“Emergency,” Have you heard that word in the reaction to President Donald Trump’s tariffs?

Now this grandmother reveals true barbarity and humiliation, or what happens next, to ANDY JEHRING","text":"Just hours after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Russian forces reached Kateryna and Maryna’s hometown and tortured their uncle for being a member of the local resistance.\n\nWeeks later, they dragged their auntie into a blood-soaked interrogation room for questioning over comments she had been overheard making against the invaders.\n\nNeighbours were rounded up and executed at random. Drunken soldiers would fire tanks on the local houses for fun.\n\nThen, a Russian artillery strike killed the little girls’ father, Oleh, on his 33rd birthday – June 16, 2023. Shrapnel from the same blast tore both legs from their mother Oleksandra, 25, who bled to death waiting for a Russian ambulance – with medics more interested in covering up the war crime than treating her.\n\nAged just seven and ten, the sisters were left to live with their maternal grandmother Oksana, 59, and remained prime targets for Moscow – not just in the daily shelling and drone strikes on their neighbourhood ten miles inside Russian-occupied territory, but also as part of Russia’s campaign to steal thousands of Ukrainian children.\n\nIndeed, if their grandmother were just a few years older, the Ukrainian sisters would now be entirely at the Russians’ mercy.\n\nIn occupied territory, once any family member caring for a young child is over 60, the authorities favour placing the youngster in state-run orphanages or putting them up for adoption in Russian homes, rather than granting that family member custody. It is a policy being ruthlessly exploited in a systematic drive to erase Ukrainian identity.\n\nIt took Oksana 18 long months to gain the necessary paperwork to make herself the legal guardian of the girls – who already had Russian birth certificates.\n\nOnly once she had attained this stamp of approval did she make a dangerous and circuitous 1,600-mile journey from the occupied Kherson region in the south of the country to reach an area of Ukraine not ruled by Russia. A journey that ended at the last open humanitarian corridor where she could make a crossing, far to the north-west of the country in the town of Domanove on the Belarusian border.\n\n‘I won’t forgive them,’ the determined grandmother said of the invaders on finally reaching unoccupied Ukrainian soil again.\n\nYet she and her granddaughters – whose names we have changed for their own protection – are among just the lucky few who managed to escape. There are more than three million Ukrainians still living in occupied territory.\n\nThe Daily Mail travelled to the Domanove crossing point to hear the horrifying realities of life for Ukrainians under Russian rule in occupied territory. Realities that, thanks to the new administration in Washington, Putin is on the cusp of making permanent.\n\nTwo weeks ago he signed a decree with the bombastic title: ‘On the Peculiarities of the Legal Status of Certain Categories of Foreign Citizens and Stateless Persons in the Russian Federation’.\n\nIn short, it gives Ukrainians in occupied territory until September to take Russian citizenship – or be forced from their homes.\n\nChillingly, in this endeavour he appears to have the tacit support of Donald Trump’s peace envoy Steve Witkoff. Just last month Mr Witkoff said families like Oksana’s have ‘indicated that they want to be under Russian rule’ by an ‘overwhelming majority’.\n\nHe was referring to a ‘referendum’ in September 2022 – recognised only by North Korea, until Mr Witkoff’s apparent endorsement – where votes were either falsified or collected at the barrel of a gun (other than those of a shameful yet significant minority of collaborators).\n\nMr Witkoff has met Putin in Moscow and, this week, held talks with Putin’s favourite negotiator, Kirill Dmitriev, in Washington – the first time a senior Russian official has attended discussions in America since the invasion.\n\nYet he has not deigned to visit Ukraine. If he did, just one day at Domanove might change his view.\n\nWhat we witnessed here is just a snapshot of the suffering and humiliation that Moscow’s war machine is inflicting on Ukrainians trapped in occupied territory.\n\n‘There were executions right from the first day,’ said Oksana. ‘One woman’s parents hid in their basement. They found them, and then they were shot – both father and mother, shot in the head,’ she said. ‘They took children. The Russians break in wherever they want. They take cars, they take everything. Whatever they like, they take.’\n\nCuddling her granddaughters to her and wiping away tears as she spoke of them, this extraordinarily resolute woman added: ‘Even though I love them, no one can replace parents. No one – not at such a young age.’\n\nWe spoke to another grandmother who had to flee occupied territory with her grandson just days after his parents were killed by Putin’s forces. Hours after their deaths, Russian officers had arrived at her home and demanded custody of the ten-year-old, as she was over 60.\n\nShe pleaded with Russians to let the boy attend his mother’s and father’s funeral before handing him over, and they agreed.\n\nBut she had no intention of letting him witness the service.\n\nInstead, she contacted a network of drivers who specialise in evacuating Ukrainians from occupied territory. They launched an immediate and daring rescue mission to smuggle both of them out. She was still too traumatised by her ordeal to speak at length, and had not been able to explain to the boy what had happened to his parents.\n\nEach day, about a dozen Ukrainians cross over at Domanove, after making the journey north.\n\nAs the front lines through south-east Ukraine are closed to civilians, they must travel exclusively through enemy territory – first to the ruined Russian-held southern city of Mariupol, and on into the mostly conquered region of Donbas.\n\nThey then go up through Russia itself towards Putin’s vassal Belarus, where they can secure documentation at the Ukrainian Embassy in the capital Minsk, before coming back into unoccupied Ukraine at Domanove.\n\nThe secret network of drivers runs the terrifying gauntlet, passing countless checkpoints where some are detained or subjected to brutal interrogations.\n\nMany opt to drive almost non-stop for 72 hours to minimise questioning. The elderly fear dying from stress en route, with the journey taking some over a week. But those we met had no choice.\n\nThe homes they had lived in for decades lie destroyed by shells, drones, bombs and sabotage.\n\nFriends and neighbours have been tortured and executed, relatives killed by the Russian invaders. And, astonishingly, all this is taking place in the area of Ukraine that contains the most pro-Russian demographic.\n\n‘They come with just one suitcase, their entire life in one suitcase, that’s all,’ says Serhii, a volunteer on the border for the charity Helping to Leave, which supports refugees’ return. ‘The stories – everyone is in pain, everyone wants to return home.’\n\nEach day, extraordinary tales of suffering and endurance come across the border. One woman decided to stay in war-shattered Mariupol for three years because, as occupied territory, it enabled her to get a Russian passport which in turn meant she could visit members of her family who had been taken prisoner and held in Russia. Only now that they have been freed has she escaped to an area of Ukraine that is not under Moscow’s control.\n\nAnother, Raisa, 61, lost the home she had lived in with husband Serhii, 63, for nearly 40 years when the Russians bombed the local dam and flooded their village. They rebuilt it – only for shelling to kill their neighbours and force them from their home.\n\nJust days earlier, a woman arrived at the crossing with a herd of exotic goats – she had undertaken a 1,600-mile trip to rescue the animals after the occupying forces threatened to eat them.\n\nFor Oksana, her family’s torment started within hours of the occupation as Russian forces took over her town on the first day of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. They discovered Maryna and Kateryna’s uncle (who cannot be named) had been part of the territorial defence and he was taken to a military base.\n\n‘They tortured him, beat him badly,’ she said. ‘They dug a pit for him at night and forced him to bury himself in the ground,’ she said. ‘They covered him up to his head and said, “If you want to live, dig yourself out”. Then they left.’\n\nHe screamed into the night until a neighbour heard and managed to get him out.\n\nSoon after this, the girls’ auntie was reported by a collaborator for calling the invaders ‘orcs’.\n\n‘She was taken into their interrogation room,’ Oksana said. ‘The walls were covered in blood. The guards said they usually deal with the men in here.’\n\nShe was let go with a terrifying warning but fled to unoccupied Ukraine soon afterwards.\n\nOksana believes the Russians deliberately targeted her daughter and son-in-law. The invaders monitored the village closely and his birthday preparations would not have escaped their attention.\n\nTwo strikes hit Oleh and Oleksandra’s neighbours and the couple ran out to help. A third strike hit and killed Oleh instantly at 6pm that day.\n\n‘He was torn apart,’ Oksana said, before adding: ‘My daughter’s legs were just ripped off. If the medical team had arrived in time, she could have been saved.’\n\nWhen they did arrive the paramedics began brushing the debris off Oleksandra rather than stem the bleeding.\n\n‘Instead of saving lives, they were clearing up evidence,’ her mother said.\n\nBy the time Oksana, who lived a few miles away, got to the scene both Oleh and Oleksandra were dead and she collected her granddaughters from a neighbour.\n\nIt took her two weeks to break the news to them. ‘You see those stars in the sky? That’s your mum and dad,’ she told Maryna and Kateryna one night.\n\nHaving witnessed so much death in their young lives, the girls immediately knew what she meant – they had been killed in the shelling, and were gone.\n\n‘They cried so much,’ Oksana said. Within days of the deaths, Oksana was handed paperwork blaming the Ukrainian army for the tragedy – despite neighbours witnessing the shell coming from a Russian position.\n\nOther refugees we spoke to said Putin’s forces had boasted they received bonuses if they hit Ukrainian houses – part of a campaign to drive them from their homes so the territories can be ‘Russified’. ‘The Russians laughed, as if it was a funny story,’ Oksana said. ‘They said, “Ha, ha, ha! Look what your AFU [Armed Forces of Ukraine] did.”’\n\nTheir report, which she has kept, states: ‘Due to AFU shelling, the family perished.’\n\nNo mention was given to the delayed ambulance, nor the neighbours’ testimony of the strike’s direction.\n\nThe grandmother had to shelter her orphaned charges from daily fire, while also caring for her blind 84-year-old mother, Halyna, and frail aunt Maria, 92.\n\nAll the while, she was battling to gain custody of Maryna and Kateryna to protect them from being kidnapped. Indeed, it was not long before the Russians offered to take Maryna and Kateryna to a ‘holiday camp’ in Crimea. If Oksana had accepted, they would likely not have returned.\n\nShe finally got the paperwork and, given her mother and aunt had sadly passed away, it was now time to get out.\n\nShe contacted the network of drivers and bundled her children into a bus to begin their journey to freedom.\n\n‘Mariupol was terrifying,’ she said. ‘Ruins. Completely destroyed homes. Everything is just broken, crumbled. On one side, there are high-rise buildings. On the other – completely destroyed houses.’\n\nThroughout occupied Ukraine there are Russian flags everywhere, far more so than in Russia itself. ‘They do it to remind people about their so-called “Russian world”,’ she said.\n\nOksana was on the road for a week before she made it to Domanove. She could see the Ukrainian flag fluttering just\n\n800 yards on the other side, but Belarusian officials blocked her entry as Maryna and Kateryna did not have Ukrainian birth certificates – a final humiliation.\n\nShe returned to Minsk, where the Ukrainian Embassy sorted the impasse, and crossed the following day. ‘I kissed the ground,’ she said. ‘Only then did it feel real.’\n\nBut their struggle is far from over. Oksana and her granddaughters live in a cramped, three-room apartment in Bila Tserkva, central Ukraine, with four relatives who also fled occupied territory.\n\nBoth girls are deeply traumatised, with Kateryna prone to mood swings while Maryna is ‘closed off and withdrawn’.\n\nStill, anything is better than life under occupation. ‘There, you went to bed and didn’t know if you’d wake up alive,’ Oksana said.\n\nPerhaps no one represents better how wrong Trump’s envoy Mr Witkoff is in his belief that these people want to live under Russian rule than Tamara, 77.\n\nThe retired teacher hobbled across the border this week with a walking stick, the pain from her 1,700-mile journey etched in her face. All her possessions were in a wheelie bag and sack, while her faithful five-year-old Maltese dog, Mickey, was at her side.\n\n‘Please, let the world know the truth,’ she told us after she crossed. ‘Let people know who Putin really is – a b*****d.’\n\nOf Putin – the president she once admired – she said simply: ‘To take it all from us, who is he? A king? A god? Who is he that he gets to decide?’\n\nWords, perhaps, that Putin’s admirers in Washington would do well to consider.","summary":"Just hours after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Russian forces reached Kateryna and Maryna's hometown and tortured their uncle for being a member of the local resistance.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14572887/Horror-children-snatched-Putin-Troops-slaughter-parents-ANDY-JEHRING.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/04/18/96931609-0-image-m-115_1743789429521.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:54:24","author":"Andrew Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andrew Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.047},{"id":307836986,"title":"Supreme Court allows Trump administration to cut teacher-training money, for now","text":"The Supreme Court on Friday granted the Trump administration’s plea to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in teacher-training money as part of its anti-DEI efforts, while a lawsuit continues.\n\nThe justices split 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts joining the three liberal justices in dissent.\n\nThe emergency appeal is among several the high court is considering in which the Justice Department argues that lower-court judges have improperly obstructed President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\nFriday’s order was the first time, in three attempts, that the nation’s highest court gave the administration what it wanted on an emergency basis.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously sided against the administration in another lawsuit over nearly $2 billion in foreign aid cuts in another divided 5-4 ruling, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority in both cases. \n\nIt remains to be seen whether Friday's decision marks a narrow win or a broader shift in Trump's favor.\n\nThe Trump administration is facing some 150 lawsuits in lower courts challenging his flurry of executive orders. That includes about two dozen over federal funding cuts, some totaling billions of dollars. \n\nThe teaching training case deals with cuts to more than 100 programs. They had been temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Boston, who found that they were already affecting training programs aimed at addressing a nationwide teacher shortage. \n\nU.S. District Judge Myong Joun issued a temporary restraining order sought by eight Democratic-led states that argued the cuts were likely driven by efforts from Trump’s administration to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nThe federal appeals court in Boston turned away an appeal from the administration to allow them to resume.\n\nThe Republican president also has signed an executive order calling for the dismantling of the Education Department, and his administration has already started overhauling much of its work, including cutting dozens of contracts it dismissed as “woke” and wasteful.\n\nThe two programs at issue — the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development — provide more than $600 million in grants for teacher preparation programs, often in subject areas such as math, science and special education, the states have argued. They said data has shown the programs had led to increased teacher retention rates and ensured that educators remain in the profession beyond five years.\n\nDespite Joun's finding that the programs already were being affected, the high court's conservative majority wrote that the states can keep the programs running with their own money for now. By contrast, the majority said in an unsigned opinion, the federal government probably wouldn’t be able to recover the cash if it ultimately wins the lawsuit.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent that there was no reason for the court's emergency intervention.\n\n“Nowhere in its papers does the Government defend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue here,” Kagan wrote.\n\nIn a separate opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote, “It is beyond puzzling that a majority of Justices conceive of the government’s application as an emergency.”\n\nRoberts joined neither dissent, noting only that he would have denied the appeal. \n\nThe administration halted the programs without notice in February. Joun, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, found that the cancellations probably violated a federal law that requires a clear explanation.\n\nThe appellate panel that rejected the administration’s request for a stay also was made up of judges appointed by Democrats.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the ruling as a “significant victory for President Trump and the rule of law.” \n\nCalifornia is leading the ongoing lawsuit, joined by Massachusetts, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York and Wisconsin. \n\nBoston Public Schools have already had to fire several full-time employees due to the loss of grant funding, and the College of New Jersey has also canceled the rest of its teacher-residency program.

Trump on Friday extended by 75 days a deadline for ByteDance to sell U.S. assets of the popular short video app to a non-Chinese buyer, or face a ban that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law. The deal, the structure of which was largely finalized by Wednesday, according to one of the sources, would have spun off TikTok's U.S. operations into a new company based in the U.S. and majority-owned and operated by U.S. investors. ByteDance would hold a position of less than 20%. The deal had been approved by existing investors, new investors, ByteDance and the U.S. government, the source said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, asked about the status of a deal for TikTok, said in a statement: China has stated its position on TikTok on multiple occasions. China has always respected and protected the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy. TikTok declined comment. The Associated Press was first to report China's disapproval. The deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, Trump said on social media, explaining why he was extending the deadline he set in January that was supposed to have expired on Saturday. We hope to continue working in good faith with China, who I understand is not very happy about our reciprocal tariffs. China now faces a 54% tariff on goods imported into the United States after Trump announced he was hiking them by 34% this week, prompting China to retaliate on Friday. Trump has said he would be willing to reduce tariffs on China to get a deal done with ByteDance to sell the app used by 170 million Americans. Trump has said his administration was in touch with four different groups about a prospective TikTok deal. He has not identified them. A major stumbling block to any deal for TikTok's U.S. business is Chinese government approval. China has not made a public commitment to allow a sale and Trump's comments suggested renewed Chinese opposition. We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the deal, Trump wrote on Friday. We do not want TikTok to 'go dark,' Trump added. Congress passed the measure last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, as lawmakers cited the risk of the Chinese government exploiting TikTok to spy on Americans and carry out covert influence operations. Democratic then-President Joe Biden signed it into law. Some lawmakers have said Trump must enforce the law, which had required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 unless ByteDance had completed a divestiture of the app's U.S. assets. Trump began his second term as president on January 20 and opted not to enforce it. The Justice Department in January told Apple and Google that it would not enforce the law, which led them to restore the app for new downloads. The new Trump order will set a mid-June deadline for a deal. The White House-led talks on the future of TikTok are coalescing around a plan for the biggest non-Chinese investors in parent company ByteDance to increase their stakes and acquire the app's U.S. operations, Reuters has reported. The plan entails spinning off a U.S. entity for TikTok and diluting Chinese ownership in the new business to below the 20% threshold required by U.S. law, rescuing the app from a looming U.S. ban, sources have told Reuters. Jeff Yass' Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford's General Atlantic, both of which are represented on ByteDance's board, are leading discussions with the White House, Reuters has reported. Walmart denied an ABC News report that it was also considering joining a group of investors in a deal for TikTok.","summary":"A deal to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations is on hold after China indicated disapproval following Trump's tariff increase.

Trump extended the divestiture deadline by 75 days, aiming for further negotiations.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/tiktok-deal-put-on-hold-after-china-indicated-it-would-reject-it-over-tariffs-sources-say/articleshow/119997868.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119997884,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-27206,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:47:48","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.323},{"id":307835484,"title":"Trump tariffs spark five-year Aussie Dollar low","text":"The Australian dollar has hit a five-year low as China hits back against Donald Trump’s trade war.\n\nThe Aussie Dollar is flirting perilously close to 60 US cents, surpassing the low recorded at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMassive losses across global sharemarkets spell trouble for superannuation balances.\n\nThe Australian Dollar is closely tied to the strength of the Chinese Yuan, because the Australian economy is strongest when China has plenty of money to buy our products.

Al Sharpton is giving PepsiCo three weeks to meet with him — or suffer a boycott — to discuss reversing the company’s recent move to do away with its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a letter shared with The Associated Press.\n\nOn Friday, Sharpton wrote to PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta expressing his “profound disappointment” that the company would end inclusion commitments that both helped build its brand and fostered trust with millions of its customers.\n\n“You have walked away from equity,” Sharpton wrote in the letter, adding that removing DEI hiring and retention goals and dismantling community partnerships with minority organizations “are clear signals that political pressure has outweighed principle.”\n\nSharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, announced in January that the civil rights organization would identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning their DEI pledges.\n\nA spokesperson for PepsiCo said it had not received the letter and was unable to comment.\n\nPepsiCo is one of the largest food and beverage companies in North America. Its brands include Gatorade, Lay’s potato chips, Doritos, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi.\n\nIn a memo sent to employees in February, Laguarta said the company will no longer set goals for minority representation in its managerial roles or supplier base.\n\nSince President Donald Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, U.S. government agencies, companies and schools have scrambled to reevaluate policies and programs aimed at increasing diversity among its employees and reducing discrimination against members of minority groups, women and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nTrump ended DEI programs within the federal government and has warned schools to do the same or risk losing federal money. Large retailers like Walmart and Target have also phased out DEI initiatives since Trump took office.\n\nFollowing decades of activism and protests by marginalized groups, several pieces of legislation and executive orders in the 1960’s laid the groundwork for what would become known today as the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion movement in the workplace. In the 1970’s, in response to the new laws and regulations, affirmative action policies were introduced, employee resource groups started to emerge, and businesses began implementing diversity trainings. This led to increased hiring of women and minorities.\n\nBy the 1980’s, new studies began highlighting the business incentive for fostering inclusive workplaces. Focus shifted from compliance with the law to “creating an environment where everybody feels that they can achieve their highest goal,” said Mary-Frances Winters, an author and strategist focusing on diversity and organizational development. “This was really about looking at changing demographics, looking at who was coming into the workforce and also looking at how people with different backgrounds can lead to greater innovation,” Winters said.\n\nResearch continued to emphasize that diversity in the workplace was a matter of business survival, with some businesses even beginning to mandate cultural competency within leadership. PepsiCo was one of those companies, Sharpton pointed out in his letter.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, PepsiCo hired some of the first Black sales and marketing executives in corporate America, Sharpton wrote, and by the 1980’s the company’s policies led to the creation of Black consumer advisory boards.\n\n“You did this not because it was easy — but because it was right,” Sharpton wrote in the letter. “That legacy is now in jeopardy.”\n\nIn the early 2000’s, Sharpton sat on PepsiCo’s African American advisory board.\n\nPepsiCo’s announcement in February that it would rollback inclusion efforts came as Coca-Cola reaffirmed support for its DEI efforts. In its annual report, Atlanta-based Coke warned that the inability to attract employees that reflect its broad range of customers could negatively affect its business.\n\n“Failure to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion … could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success,” the company said.","summary":"On Friday, Sharpton wrote to PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta expressing his “profound disappointment” that the company would end inclusion commitments that both helped build its brand and fostered trust with millions of its customers.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/04/us-news/al-sharpton-calls-on-pepsico-to-restore-dei-initiatives-threatens-boycott/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/101721911.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MaMwprGw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:45:42","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.075},{"id":307834574,"title":"U.S. to allow logging in national forest to spur timber production amid trade war","text":"April 4 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday announced will allow logging in national forests, which will help spur timber production amid reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\n\nA memo by USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins follows an executive order by President Donald Trump last month to expand timber production.\n\nThere are 154 national forests covering approximately 188.3 million acres.

The court decided 5-4 to put on hold Boston-based U.S. District Judge Myong Joun's March 10 order requiring the Department of Education to reinstate in those states funding for grants under two teacher training programs while litigation in the case continues. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision. The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. The brief and unsigned opinion from the court said that the administration is likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money, as occurred in this case. The eight states - California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin - sued after the Department of Education announced on February 17 that it had cut $600 million in teacher training funds that were promoting what it called divisive ideologies including diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI. Joun decided that the administration likely violated a U.S. law called the Administrative Procedure Act governing federal agency actions given that the Department of Education abruptly terminated grants awarded under programs authorized by Congress without providing individualized analyses of the programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator grant programs were established to help support institutions that recruit and train educators in a bid to address critical teacher shortages, especially in rural and underserved communities. The Republican president and officials in his administration have accused various judges who have issued rulings impeding his policies of overstepping their authority. The Justice Department told the Supreme Court in its request that in this case and others, federal judges are impermissibly micromanaging the government's spending decisions. Grant recipients received a standardized letter notifying them that the Department of Education does not support programs or organizations that promote DEI or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or another protected characteristic. Without an order to restore the funding, dozens of programs upon which public schools, public universities, students, teachers and faculty rely will be gutted, Joun, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, wrote in his temporary restraining order. Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have moved to dismantle the Education Department as part of their plan to slash the federal workforce and reshape the government. Trump on March 20 signed an executive order as a first step to eliminate the department, making good on a longstanding campaign promise to conservatives. Completely abolishing the department would require an act of Congress, and Trump currently lacks the votes for that. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on March 21 declined to pause Joun's order. The judge on March 24 had extended the order.","summary":"The U.S. Supreme Court permitted the Trump administration to cut millions from teacher training grants aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. The decision affects eight Democratic-led states, which sued over the abrupt termination of the funding. The court ruled 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and three liberal justices dissenting.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/us-supreme-court-backs-trump-on-teacher-training-grant-cuts/articleshow/119997419.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-119997430,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-274828,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:24:33","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":307833136,"title":"Suttar says US tariffs to hurt Pakistan’s economy","text":"KARACHI Founder Salt Manufactures Association of Pakistan (SMAP) Ismail Suttar has said that reciprocal tariff of 29 percent is the last nail hammered on Pakistan export coffin.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday 2nd April 2025 triggered a shockwave in the global trade market by introducing reciprocal tariffs on over 180 countries.\n\nWhether this benefit the US in the long run would depend on the broader economic and strategic context but as of today it has stirred a panic situation among Pakistani exporters.\n\nSMAP Ismail Suttar said that Pakistan’s economy is heavily reliant on textile, apparel, surgical instruments and salt, a significant portion of which goes to the US.

The company “chose profits over the marsh\" and allowed the environmental degradation caused by its operations to fester and spread, Carmouche said.\n\nThe jury awarded $575 million to compensate for land loss, $161 million to compensate for contamination and $8.6 million for abandoned equipment. The amount earmarked for restoration exceeds $1.1 billion when including interest, according to attorneys for Talbot, Carmouche & Marcello, the firm behind the lawsuit.\n\nPlaquemines Parish, the southeast Louisiana district which brought the lawsuit, had asked for $2.6 billion in damages.\n\nChevron's lead trial attorney Mike Phillips said in a statement following the verdict that “Chevron is not the cause of the land loss occurring” in Plaquemines Parish and that the law does not apply to “conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted.”\n\nPhillips called the ruling “unjust” and said there were “numerous legal errors.”\n\nHouston-headquartered Chevron reported more than $3 billion in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nHow are oil companies contributing to Louisiana’s land loss?\n\nThe lawsuit against Chevron was filed in 2013 by Plaquemines Parish, a rural district in Louisiana straddling the final leg of the Mississippi River heading into the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.\n\nLouisiana’s coastal parishes have lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of land over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, which has also identified oil and gas infrastructure as a significant cause. The state could lose another 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) in the coming decades, its coastal protection agency has warned.\n\nThousands of miles of canals cut through the wetlands by oil companies weakens them and exacerbates the impacts of sea level rise. Industrial wastewater from oil production degrades the surrounding soil and vegetation. The torn-up wetlands leave South Louisiana – home to some of the nation’s biggest ports and key energy sector infrastructure -- more vulnerable to flooding and destruction from extreme weather events like hurricanes.\n\nPhillips, Chevron's attorney, said the company had operated lawfully and blamed land loss in Louisiana on other factors, namely the extensive levee system that blocks the Mississippi River from depositing land regenerating sediment — a widely acknowledged cause of coastal erosion.\n\nThe way to solve the land loss problem is “not suing oil companies, it’s reconnecting the Mississippi River with the delta,” Phillips said during closing arguments.\n\nYet the lawsuit held the company responsible for exacerbating and accelerating land loss in Louisiana, rather than being its sole cause.\n\nChevron also challenged the costly wetlands restoration project proposed by the parish, which involved removing large amounts of contaminated soil and filling in the swaths fragmented wetlands eroded over the past century. The company said the plan was impractical and designed to inflate the damages rather than lead to real world implementation.\n\nAttorney Jimmy Faircloth, Jr., who represented the state of Louisiana, which has backed Plaquemines and other local governments in their lawsuits against oil companies, told jurors from the parish that Chevron was telling them their community was not worth preserving.\n\n“Our communities are built on coast, our families raised on coast, our children go to school on coast,” Faircloth said. “The state of Louisiana will not surrender the coast, it’s for the good of the state that the coast be maintained.”\n\nWhat does this mean for future litigation against oil companies?\n\nCarmouche, a well-connected attorney, and his firm have been responsible for bringing many of the lawsuits against oil companies in the state. Industry groups have accused the firm of seeking big paydays, not coastal restoration.\n\nLouisiana’s economy has long been heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry and the industry holds significant political power. Even so, Louisiana’s staunchly pro-industry Gov. Jeff Landry has supported the lawsuits, including bringing the state on board during his tenure as Attorney General.\n\nOil companies have fought tooth and nail to quash the litigation, including unsuccessfully lobbying Louisiana’s Legislature to pass a law to invalidate the claims. Chevron and other firms also repeatedly tried to move the lawsuits into federal court where they believed they would find a more sympathetic audience.\n\nBut the heavy price Chevron is set to pay could hasten other firms to seek settlements in the dozens of other lawsuits across Louisiana. Plaquemines alone has 20 other cases pending against oil companies.\n\nThe state is running out of money to support its ambitious coastal restoration plans, which have been fueled by soon-expiring settlement funds from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and supporters of the litigation say payouts could provide a much-needed injection of funds.\n\nTommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said the verdict against Chevron “undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader” and “threatens our country’s trajectory to America-first energy dominance across the globe.” He warned that “businesses here are at risk of being sued retroactively tomorrow for following the laws of today.”\n\nAttorneys for the parish said they hope that big payout will prompt more oil companies to come to the table to negotiate and channel more funding towards coastal restoration.\n\n“Our energy is focused on securing appropriate verdicts and awards for every parish involved in these actions,” Carmouche said in a statement. “If we continue to be successful in our efforts, these parishes, and Louisiana, will have sent a clear message that Louisiana's future must be built around a new balance between our energy industry and environmental necessities.\"","summary":"Oil company Chevron must pay $744.6 million to restore damage it caused to southeast Louisiana's coastal wetlands, a jury ruled on Friday following a landmark trial more than a decade in the making.","url":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/04/04/news/chevron-must-pay-744-million-damage-louisiana-coast-says-landmark-court-ruling","image":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/04/04/0c6edit_b724e-7799-4a26-aff2-4cac08fb4a88.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:15:51","author":"Associated Press,Plaquemines Parish","authors":["Associated Press","Plaquemines Parish"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.593},{"id":307832924,"title":"Senate kicks off all-night 'vote-a-rama' as Democrats plan to press GOP on Trump, DOGE","text":"The Senate kicked off a marathon vote series on Friday night, which Republicans need to get through in order to approve their changes to the House's plan for President Donald Trump's budget.

In a CNN appearance, the lawmaker argued that UAW support for Trump’s tariffs is misguided, noting that even if some elements of Trump’s policy are good, overall, they will hurt American families. \"Look, I respect them [UAW]. But the tariffs – if they wanted to do something about auto – should have been much more pinpointed and isolated than this massive assault on American families, all to help the billionaires,\" Schumer told CNN host Dana Bash. WALL STREET FIRMS SEE RECESSION RISK RISING OVER TARIFFS, TRADE WAR UAW president Shawn Fain praised Trump for enacting major tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and parts earlier this month. As reported by the Detroit Free Press, Fain told an audience at Wayne State University in Detroit, \"Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on.\" Fain, who has been a fierce critic of Trump – expressing support for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s White House run during the Democratic National Convention last year – added that the Democratic Party hasn’t done the work to protect the American auto industry. \"We’ve begged Democrats, politicians for years, to do something to get these companies in line,\" he said, also noting that he’s not afraid to praise Trump on the issue, even if the president is a Republican. TRUMP IS 'ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD NEGOTIATION,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS, AS APRIL 2 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS LOOM \"I’m not going to sit here now and say that since he’s a Republican or because he’s Donald Trump, I’m going to say, ‘screw you.’ That’s not how we do things. It’s having integrity,\" Fain said. Trump instituted 25% tariffs on outsourced cars and auto parts last week, which is primed to hit domestic brands like Chevrolet – which now produces vehicles in Mexico like the popular Equinox, and shuttered its major Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in 2020. However, Schumer suggested that UAW is ignoring the negative effects of Trump’s tariff policies on the whole country while focusing on the good it affords them. \"Look, there are certain tariffs that – pinpointed, careful, aimed at things that other countries are doing badly at us – makes sense. This is not that. This is across the board, 10% on everything, in addition to what other tariffs he‘s put on,\" the Senate Minority Leader said. When Bash asked about whether the auto tariffs by themselves are good, he replied, \"Well, look, you have to look at it in the whole context of things. When there‘s such chaos in America, I think fewer Americans are going to buy cars - American cars or otherwise - because it‘s so chaotically done. So, I think it hurts everybody.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Bash also asked Schumer about how he has been responding to Democratic lawmakers questioning his leadership in recent weeks after he broke party ranks and voted for a GOP-approved continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down. Schumer replied by stating that he and the Democratic Party are looking ahead and taking the fight to Trump with a united front. \"We are now focused on the future, and we are focused on showing how awful this administration is,\" he said. \"And you‘re going to find all of us [Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.], myself, and the whole Democratic Party united on what to do, and going forward, and going after Trump day in and day out, showing the American people that Trump has betrayed them, that he’s broken his promises, and that we’re on the side of working people, and he’s on the side of billionaires.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP","summary":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called out the UAW union on Friday for praising President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign automobiles and parts.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/schumer-slams-united-auto-workers-union-praising-trump-tariffs-hurt-everybody","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/schumer-cnn.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:09:48","author":"Gabriel Hays","authors":["Gabriel Hays"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":307834478,"title":"Trump hopeful of ‘great’ PGA-LIV golf merger","text":"MIAMI: President Donald Trump said on Thursday he is optimistic of an eventual merger between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf following a new report of a stalemate in negotiations to reunify the game.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One as he traveled to Florida ahead of this weekend’s LIV Golf Miami event at Trump National Doral, the US leader said he believed a merger was inevitable.\n\n“Ultimately, hopefully the two tours are going to merge,” Trump told reporters. “That’ll be good.

Gervais said.\n\nIn terms of sheer growth, the two big winners were Saskatchewan, which came in first for the second year in a row at 13.1 percent, and British Columbia at 11.3 per cent.\n\nOngoing interest in Saskatchewan farmland has been driven to a large extent by affordability, at least compared to most other provinces, said Gervais.\n\nFor example, farmland value per acre in northwestern Saskatchewan ranged from $1,700 to $5,000. By comparison, Alberta’s per acre value in the northern region ranged from $2,100 to $8,000.\n\nThe other reporting provinces featured growth in the single-digit range. New Brunswick’s cultivated average land values grew by nine per cent, Quebec reported a 7.7 per cent increase with Alberta close behind at 7.1 per cent. Manitoba grew at a rate of 6.5 per cent and Nova Scotia’s appreciated by 5.3 per cent.\n\nOntario’s farmland value grew by 3.1 per cent, while Prince Edward Island increased by 1.4 per cent.\n\nThe only provinces to report higher growth rates in 2024 than 2023 were B.C., Alberta and New Brunswick. There was insufficient data to fully assess changes in Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon.\n\nRecent dry seasons in concert with fierce consumer interest accelerated demand for irrigated land. For example, irrigated acres in Alberta increased by 8.6 per cent with a range of values per acre from $11,400 to $24,000.\n\nAlthough not as dramatic as Alberta’s growth, Manitoba’s irrigated acres saw a value increase of 3.5 per cent; the irrigated Westman and Central Plains-Pembina Valley areas saw farmland values range from $7,500 to $15,100 per acre. Saskatchewan’s irrigated land values run from $6,800 to $9,500 per acre.\n\nFCC chief economist J.P. Gervais presented his interpretation of the lenders 2024 farmland values report. | Photo courtesy FCC\n\nAccording to the report, supply of irrigated farmland is expected to remain tight as producers in this category tend to retain their land.\n\nAffordability was one of the factors slowing farmland growth in Canada in 2024. Farmland affordability relative to farm income continues to decline, said Gervais, making it harder for aspiring farmers — particularly young producers, Indigenous people and new entrants — to expand their land base.\n\n“The profitability pressures combined with the current uncertainty with regards to trade disruptions create significant headwinds for farm operations looking to invest,” said Gervais.\n\nSpeaking of trade disruptions, Gervais was questioned about what this all means in the context of U.S. President Donald Trump’s ongoing pursuit of 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods.\n\nHe chose to use the term “trade disruptions” instead of “tariffs” to acknowledge other potential barriers to trade, such as U.S. country-of-origin labelling, which is scheduled to take effect in January 2026.\n\nGervais monitors three factors when mulling trade disruptions: uncertainty, interest rates and revenues. Uncertainty is a major impediment to investment, he said, meaning producers are less likely to invest in their futures or businesses.\n\nThe farming sector is a highly intensive capital industry with small margins. Many other industries — mining, for example — also require a lot of capital but tend to have larger margins.\n\n“Usually, if you look at the margin over the long term, return on assets, return on equity of farming, that’s very thin compared to other sectors.”\n\nHis second thought is interest rates, which in Canada have been something of a roller coaster ride over the past few years.\n\n“Obviously in the last couple of years, we’ve had inflation go up, interest rates went up, we started to see inflation come down, and then we started to see interest rates come down starting in the summer in Canada.\n\n“So maybe the decline in interest rates has explained a little bit of the uptick in farm values we’ve seen.\n\n“If we do have low interest rates, maybe that’s going to cushion a little bit or offset some of the weaker demand for farmland because of the uncertainty.”\n\nFinally, he monitors revenue, which Canadian agriculture has taken a hit on over the past few years.\n\n“The bottom line, if you look at crops or grains, oilseeds and pulses, and if you look at the Prairies, we had an 11.3 per cent decline on the Prairies for crop revenues. Again, grains, oilseeds, pulses — the forecast now is another decline in 2025.”\n\nGervais pointed to canola as an example of a major drop in prices, citing a 2025 forecast of canola receipts that suggest revenue will drop by as much as 13 per cent.\n\nHe didn’t sugarcoat the impact tariffs and other trade disruptions will have on producer revenues.\n\n“If we have tariffs, whether it’s (from) China, the U.S., any type of other trade disruptions, anti-dumping investigations — all of those things are going to have a significant negative impact on the bottom line of Canadian farm operations.”\n\nHowever, Gervais remains optimistic.\n\n“The demand long-term is still very strong, I think. It doesn’t change the story we have for Canadian ag, which is the world needs more of what we grow. So that doesn’t change. But it’s the short term, and the extent to which these disruptions are going to last, that’s going to have an impact.”\n\nSo how long are these trade disruptions going to last? Your guess is as good as Gervais’s.\n\n“Your crystal ball is as good as mine. I can’t say anything other than what the markets are telling me today and the numbers I’m quoting are based off what the markets are telling us. It’s not what J.P. thinks.”","summary":"The average value of Canada&amp;rsquo;s cultivated farmland grew by 9.3 per cent in 2024, less than its growth in 2023 but nevertheless a &amp;ldquo;robust&amp;rdquo; number, says the chief economist of Farm Credit Canada, which released its annual Farmland Values Report March 18. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a little bit...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/542674/Value-of-Canadian-farmland-robust-but-cracks-are-appearing","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/4/glacier_148378_p.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:07:00","author":"Contributed,Jeff Melchior","authors":["Contributed","Jeff Melchior"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.152},{"id":307829240,"title":"Prominent MAGA Supporters Criticize Trump on Tariffs, Predicting a ‘Political Crisis’","text":"The MAGA movement faces a turning point as loyal conservatives publicly question whether Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff plan will cause them a ‘political bloodbath.’ \n\nThe White House announced a baseline 10 percent tariff on all imports, effective April 5, with higher rates for countries imposing steeper duties on US goods.\n\nTrump called it a ‘declaration of economic independence’ in a fiery speech, slamming ‘friend and foe’ for ‘ripping off’ America but the markets have seen a steep downturn since they were announced.\n\nRepublicans, particularly moderates, have been skeptical as the plan has been rolled out, with several joining a DOA Democrat bill to stop Trump’s tariffs.\n\nNow, however, some of Trump’s fiercest defenders are coming out of the woodwork to trash the economic plan.\n\nBen Shapiro called the tariffs ‘probably unconstitutional’ and ripped how it was ‘dropped on the market unilaterally.’\n\n‘[It’s] one of the biggest tax increases on American consumers in the history of America.’\n\nHe added that trade wars are ‘not good’ or ‘easy to win’ if ‘you don’t have a plan’ and that trade deficits aren’t important, noting America’s trading surplus was high during the entirety of the Great Depression. \n\nShapiro also appeared on the All In podcast and called the plan ‘a pile of rakes’ to be stepped on by Trump, saying that the rollout ‘was probably as bad as you could do.’\n\n‘The way that it was rolled out, with essentially kind of a surprise announcement… replete with contradictory justifications, statistics that are labeled one thing but are really not that thing. It opens itself up to all sorts of critiques from every side.’ \n\nIt wasn’t just limited to commentators, as Texas Senator Ted Cruz – who ran for re-election calling himself Trump’s ‘strongest supporter’ in the Senate – warned the agenda could ‘hurt jobs and hurt America.’\n\nOn his own podcast, he said that he’s not a fan of tariffs and was wary of Republicans defending Trump just to defend Trump. \n\n‘I’m seeing a lot of Republican cheerleaders reflexively defending what the White House is doing,’ Cruz said. \n\nCruz warned that nations reciprocating Trump’s tariffs for lengthy periods of time could hurt the country. \n\n‘If we’re in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs, and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on earth, that is a terrible outcome.’ \n\nHe said that while ‘the upside could be massive,’ Republicans running to keep their seats next year may face a hostile environment if the plan doesn’t work.\n\n‘If we go into a recession — particularly a bad recession — 2026 in all likelihood, politically would be a bloodbath,’ he said.\n\nAhead of the announcement, Trump tore into four Republican senators who oppose his tariffs late Tuesday.\n\nThe president urged Kentucky Sens. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, as well as Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski to get on board with his tariff proposal.\n\nTrump claimed in a post to his Truth Social account that these four senators are responsible for ‘allowing fentanyl to pour into our country unchecked’ and he warned them against voting with a Democrat bill aimed at stopping the new tariffs on Canada.\n\n‘What’s wrong with them,’ he questioned, claiming the four are ‘suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.’\n\n‘The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four,’ Trump claimed. ‘[I]t is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it.’\n\nJust hours before Trump prepares for the announcement of new tariffs on Wednesday, he took to his social media to tell his supporters in Kentucky, Maine and Alaska to reach out to their senators to urge them to support tariffs for Canada.\n\nTrump and his allies have often referred to more moderate Republicans or those who ever break with the party as a ‘RINO’ or Republican in Name Only. \n\nWhile he didn’t use that term in the post on Wednesday, the president did allude to the fact that these four Republican senators are traitors who will face backlash if they vote to block his tariffs. \n\n‘They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,’ Trump said. \n\nPaul, Collins, Murkowski and McConnell all ended up voting for a Tim Kaine-backed bill to undo tariffs Thursday. They would need 60 votes to override a presidential veto. \n\nTrump made the announcement Wednesday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden, unveiling broad 10 percent tariffs — with even higher rates for certain countries. This includes 34 percent on China, and 20 percent on the European Union.\n\nThe president used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the United States helped to build after World War II, saying ‘our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, plundered’ by other nations.\n\nHe has promised that factory jobs will return back to the United States as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes on autos, clothes and other goods.\n\n‘Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,’ Trump said in remarks at the White House. ‘But it is not going to happen anymore.’\n\nHe condemned ‘foreign scavengers.’ And he talked of other nations that had ‘pillaged, raped and plundered’ the U.S. and ‘foreign cheaters’ who ‘ransacked’ American factories.\n\nWall Street had its worst two-day wipeout in history – with $5 trillion wiped off the value of US stocks.\n\nStocks crashed again on Friday as it looks increasingly likely that President Donald Trump’s tariffs will cause a global recession.\n\nUS stocks have lost about $9.6 trillion in value since January 17 — the Friday before President Trump began his second term, according to MarketWatch analysis Dow Jones Market Data. \n\nRoughly $5 trillion of that was wiped out on Thursday and Friday alone — marking the biggest two-day loss of shareholder value ever recorded, according to the data. \n\nMarkets have seen bigger percentage drops, such as in 1929, but never as much in dollar terms. Wall Street’s biggest two-day plunge came during the 1929 crash, when the Dow tumbled around 25% over October 28 and 29.\n\nThe carnage has hit ordinary Americans whose retirement savings, including 401(K) are tied to the market. \n\nThe flagship Dow Jones index of America’s 30 biggest companies plunged an astonishing 2,200 points, its biggest daily drop since June 2020. \n\nIt came after China imposed fresh tariffs on all US goods in response to the Trump’s sweeping levies, escalating a global trade war.\n\nBut panicking Americans checking their 401(K)s, IRAs and trading apps were advised to sit tight for now and not panic sell.

No prizes for guessing which one.\n\nPressing play on this chart shows how the state's leaders have struggled to diversify the economy away from its most lucrative honeypot, which would reduce the risk of global shocks flowing through.\n\nBut Saffioti defended the government's efforts. \n\n\"We have embarked on a strong diversification through supporting new value-adding and new industries, such as in the north-west and of course new markets,\" she said.\n\n\"We've had a series of expansion of our international trade commitments in particular through South-East Asia as well as other parts of Asia.\"\n\nIs it too little too late, given the lopsidedness of that pie? \n\n\"Absolutely not,\" Saffioti said.\n\n\"We've made some major efforts already in diversifying … and of course, it's going to be the main focus of our government going into the future.\"\n\nMajor focus or not, turning around WA's reliance on what's beneath its surface won't come quickly or easily.\n\nNo 'serious attempt'\n\nAnd while some are optimistic it can be done, independent economist Conrad Liveris is less convinced.\n\n\"It's hard to see that there's been any serious attempt at that,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think we do need to take a step back and get some proper independent analysis to really outline what are the opportunities for Western Australia in the next five years, in the next 10 years, in the next 20 years and beyond.\"\n\nLiveris said those efforts needed to embrace mining and use its strengths to build other industries, not try and compete with the \"elephant that is in every room\".\n\n\"We've got this massive industry that dwarfs all others, and actually we've got to use that to our advantage, to diversify the economy, not to pretend that it's not there,\" he said.\n\nThat's something the government has spoken about with the 'Made in WA' pledge it took to the election.\n\nBut a glossy brochure is much easier to produce than real economic change, especially when so much money is flowing in one direction.\n\nBumpy road ahead\n\nAfter years of high iron ore prices and a boosted share of the GST making the job of managing WA's budget easy, in the eyes of critics, factors outside of the state government's control could force its senior members to earn their keep.\n\nHave they, and their predecessors, really built the budget into a stable set of books capable of weathering even a Trump-sized storm? Or will difficult decisions have to be made when push comes to shove?\n\nWestern Australians have become accustomed to big surpluses, huge spending on infrastructure and a healthy helping of cost-of-living handouts in recent years.\n\nA larger-than-expected economic shock could bring all of that to a sharp end, and take some of the shine off Saffioti's enthusiasm for one of the state's most important jobs.","summary":"WA's economic good times could be in the rear-view mirror, with the price of iron ore and Donald Trump's tariffs creating a bumpy road.

Is the Modi bromance dead?","text":"What do you get when two strongmen become mates?\n\nFor US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the answer so far has been chemistry, an aligning of ideas and a shared vision for \"MEGA prosperity\" that will make both their countries great again.\n\nBut when those political strongmen are nationalist — as they so often are — and prioritise domestic interests above all else, in a global economy, at some point, something's gotta give.\n\nA seemingly equal partnership will eventually tilt in favour of one party, who will emerge with more power — perhaps military, economic or, in this case, negotiating.\n\nAnd the other might be left wondering, like a kid in the playground whose friend has just turned on them: \"How could they do that to me?\"\n\nThat is certainly one way of looking at Mr Trump's doling out of 26 per cent tariffs to India as part of his \"Liberation Day\" sweep.\n\nDuring his announcement, he again described Mr Modi as a \"great friend\" before adding he told the Indian PM: \"You're a friend of mine, but you're not treating us right. They charge us 52 per cent, and we have charged them almost nothing for years and years.\"\n\nThat was despite days of trade negotiations between the two countries last week, working towards a bilateral trade agreement slated to start around September, which will likely see India shave huge numbers off the high tariffs it currently applies to US imports in exchange for concessions.\n\nThe Indian government has already reduced tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikes and Bourbon whiskey and has rolled back the \"Google tax\", a 6 per cent levy on online advertisements placed with foreign tech companies like Google.\n\nGovernment sources told Reuters last week that India would be open to cutting tariffs on more than half of US imports worth $23 billion in the trade deal's first phase.\n\nSpeaking to the ABC after Mr Trump's announcement, South Asia Practice head for the Eurasia Group Pramit Pal Chaudhuri said India had put forward a \"reasonably radical tariff proposal\" of zero tariffs for zero tariffs on 70 per cent of goods traded between the two countries.\n\nSome had hoped that proposal for the bilateral trade agreement, plus the goodwill from the longstanding friendship between the two countries' leaders, may have won India a complete exemption from this week's tariffs.\n\nNow that it hasn't, it has some asking the question — is the bromance over?\n\nUnsurprisingly, opposition politicians in India have cried foul that Mr Modi has bowed down to Mr Trump.\n\nBut others say this is exactly what Mr Modi knew would happen — and he's got a plan that, ultimately, will wind up benefiting India.\n\n'The optics are bad'\n\nLeader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi told parliament on Thursday that the 26 per cent tariff would \"completely devastate\" India's economy, and accused Mr Modi's BJP party of long-time deference to other nations.\n\n\"When asked, do you lean left or do you lean right? They say, 'No, no, no, we bow our head right in front of every foreigner that comes in front of us,'\" he said.\n\nThe party's president, Mallikarjun Kharge, said the tariffs showed Mr Trump was a \"businessman\" whose \"customer\", Mr Modi, was \"trapped\", despite a surface friendship of \"hugging, talking, laughing\".\n\nSenior Congress MP Manish Tewari described it as \"an abject failure of the negotiations that were taking place between the US and the government of India\".\n\n\"The government needs to develop a spine and stand up to the US,\" he said.\n\nThe tariffs are the latest in a series of recent incidents that some — especially, unsurprisingly, opposition politicians — have branded as the US bullying India.\n\nOutrage flared most notably over the way the US handled and deported illegal immigrants from India, shackled and chained, in the same week a video was shared on the White House's Instagram page titled \"ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight\", designed to have viewers find comfort in the sounds of handcuffs and chains being put on immigrants.\n\nOne Indian journalist said the images of deportees landed so badly with Indians not because they thought the illegal immigrants should not have been deported, \"but because Modi's India can't imagine any country meting out such a humiliating treatment to Indians when he is at the helm\".\n\nBut, when it came to the tariff announcement, it appears it's only the political opposition who is really concerned.\n\nPolitical analyst Pramit Pal Chaudhuri from the Eurasia Group and Ananta Aspen Centre of India conceded that, for Mr Modi, \"the optics are bad\".\n\nBut he doesn't think it will damage his reputation, nor impact how the Indian government deals with Mr Trump going forward.\n\n\"Modi's politically in a very strong position,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, among his right-wing backing — which is about 40 per cent of his vote share and about maybe 10 to 15 per cent would be his ideological supports — for them, the idea that he's conceding to the United States or to any other country on sovereignty grounds would be damaging.\n\n\"[But], I don't think he's that concerned.\n\n\"My sense is there's a 'keep calm and carry on' position in India.\n\n\"[Mr Trump] comes out violently against everybody, and he is much more critical of other countries and governments.\n\n\"So there's a sense in India of, OK, this guy is what he is. Let's just focus on the overall policies of the government, or what Trump does, as opposed to what he says.\"\n\nAll eyes on bilateral trade agreement\n\nIn initial comments to media after the announcement, a commerce ministry official said the Indian government was \"analysing\" the impacts of the tariffs.\n\n\"It is a mixed bag and not a setback for India,\" the official said.\n\nJunior finance minister Pankaj Chaudhary reiterated that a few hours later.\n\n\"For Donald Trump, it's America first, and for PM Modi, it's India first,\" he said.\n\n\"We will analyse it first, then assess its impact and see how to deal with it.\"\n\nThe seemingly business-as-usual approach is a stark contrast to countries that have vowed a stiff response to the tariffs.\n\nIndustry groups, on the whole, also do not appear particularly rattled by the announcement or by the likelihood of India scrapping its own tariffs significantly in any eventual bilateral trade agreement.\n\nOn the contrary, some are saying the comparatively low tariffs on Indian goods compared to many of its Asian neighbours mean India could swoop in and take over their markets.\n\nThere appears to be consensus among commentators and some industry groups that the focus should now be on nailing the bilateral trade agreement and that the tariffs are merely a bump in the road.\n\n\"Trump sees this as a leverage issue,\" Mr Pal Chaudhuri said.\n\n\"I've hit you with tariffs and now, therefore, I have leverage on you.\"\n\nHe argued that Mr Modi and his team understood this about the president — after all, his negotiation tactics were spelled out in his book, The Art of the Deal — and saw a few months of tariffs before a bilateral trade agreement kicked in as just the price of doing business.\n\nIn any event, the US's local manufacturing capacity — or lack thereof — means there was likely never a chance the two countries would ever let this get in the way of their relationship.\n\nThe market share India enjoys, and stands to widen, means they are willing to be \"more flexible than any other country in the world\", according to economics professor Dr Ashwini Mahajan.\n\nHe is the national co-convenor of the right-wing Swadeshi Jagaran Manch organisation, which is affiliated with the far-right, Hindu-nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, which has huge influence over Mr Modi's government.\n\n\"We know that the US is a high-cost economy,\" he said.\n\n\"They do not have much production capacity for many goods.\n\n\"India is not going to get any harm. There are certain commodities which are essential for the US population that they will have to import from us.\"\n\nMr Pal Chaudhuri said, despite the outcries from Congress, the relationship between India and the US was unlikely to be destabilised at all.\n\nHe said that now the Indian government was working with the US to stop, and deport, illegal immigrants, all that was left to smooth over was Mr Trump's issue with India's historically high tariffs.\n\n\"If we sign a bilateral trade agreement by the end of this year, you effectively [will] have removed the two biggest irritants in the relationship,\" Mr Pal Chaudhuri said.\n\n\"For India, this is not even a question. America is simply too important for us to consider anything else.","summary":"Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed a bromance but can their MEGA partnership continue with the US president's new tariffs regime coming in?","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-05/is-donald-trump-bromance-narendra-modi-dead-india-tariffs/105136850","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/dbc50267783d5984bc87a0acad8e265d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1601&cropW=2846&xPos=0&yPos=151&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:04:06","author":"Ellie Grounds","authors":["Ellie Grounds"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":307832868,"title":"Wall Street ‘Einstein’: ‘There’s blood on the streets.

As markets grappled with the fallout of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, he warned there was “blood on the streets” of the exchange. \n\nDuring a CNN appearance, as markets went into a free fall, Tuchman outlined the sense of fear and anxiety among traders as the effects of Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement cintinued to sink in.He acknowledged that his predictions of what Trump would do were way off the mark. \n\nThe last time the mood had been so grim on the trading floor had been “the beginning days of Covid, where you just had a sort of darkness around the room, and today was clearly that,” he recalled.\n\nTuchman recounted how he encountered Jim Cramer backstage and was reminded of the CNBC host's 2007 “they know nothing” rant in which he lambasted the Federal Reserve for not seeing the signs of the coming financial crisis. \n\n“I was reminded [of Cramer’s rant] and thought I was going to come out here and do the exact same thing,” said Tuchman. “Because it’s unbelievable. They know nothing. And the formula they used for these numbers to measure the trade deficit, it’s like ‘apples, oranges, a couple of cashews, divided by ten, times four’ — none of it makes any sense.”\n\nTuchman said that until just before Trump’s tariff announcement, he thought that the president would “lay it all out,” and that there would be a “big reveal” that would calm the markets. The markets have faced uncertainty for several weeks regarding Trump’s on-again-off-again tariff plans. \n\n“I could not have been more wrong,” he said. “Today’s sell-off was not even a capitulation, it was a devastating day on the market, blood on the streets in my opinion.”\n\nCramer appeared on CNN after Tuchman, saying: “I feel like a sucker tonight because I am not a free trader and I do not believe in free trade. And I was just as tough, if not tougher, than his people.”\n\nBut they “screwed it up and … they did it in a totally ill-advised way,” he added. “And I was very let down as someone who really, truly believes that free trade is awful for the American working person.

The epicentre, Sagaing, is both a rebel stronghold and the site of brutal scorched-earth campaigns by the junta’s military. Villages there were razed, civilians slaughtered and pro-democracy fighters pushed underground.\nThe junta’s enemies have since laid down their arms to address the aftermath of a disaster that has killed more than 3,000 people – though the true toll is likely far higher.\nHundreds of collapsed buildings, pagodas and mosques are feared to contain the bodies of thousands more victims, with the risk to life growing as survivors’ needs become ever more pressing.\n“This disaster gives the junta its greatest opportunity to advance its political agenda,” said Khin Ohmar, a pro-democracy activist from human rights group Progressive Voice Myanmar. “It happened when the junta was becoming so weak that it could only rely on aerial bombings because it doesn’t control the land.”\n\nAssistance denied\nSagaing had been at the heart of the resistance to Myanmar’s coup leaders.\nRebel forces based in the region gnawed into the key central heartlands of Mandalay and Sagaing – territory vital to the junta’s control. But now, with entire towns turned to rubble, observers say the junta has slowed aid deliveries to these devastated areas as it seeks to punish those communities that have risen against it.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the quake, the junta continued bombing rebel targets, including more than a dozen strikes in Sagaing. A ceasefire was only declared days later on Wednesday, after a junta air strike accidentally hit a Chinese Red Cross rescue team. Yet even now, relief efforts remain convoluted as reports persist of continued air strikes.\n“Where are the helicopters, where is the heavy machinery? Whatever they have in the military camps, nothing has come out [to help the civilian population],” Khin Ohmar said.\n“It is a form of collective punishment … they know which township is against them and where and how many people live there.”\nMeanwhile, unverified footage has emerged of attack helicopters firing on rebel positions in neighbouring Chin state, exposing a military exploiting a disaster to weaken its enemies.\n\nFor the people of Sagaing and Mandalay, the quake has made survival even more of a daily struggle. Residents who spoke to This Week in Asia described scenes of despair.\nSoldiers stand idly by at the edges of collapsed buildings, without the orders or capacity to help, leaving relatives to dig with their bare hands through rubble that reeks of death in search of their loved ones. Whole families, terrified of aftershocks, have been forced to sleep outdoors with monsoon rains fast approaching. Water, food and medicine – even snake antivenom – are all in scant supply.\n“Thousands are buried or missing. People are living next to piles of rubble where their loved ones are, we can’t just give up on hoping they are alive,” Meredith Bunn, founder of aid group Skills for Humanity, told This Week in Asia from Sagaing on Friday.\nShe said regime soldiers were blocking aid and waving away volunteers – or making it difficult for them to move around freely in Sagaing, where a nightly curfew is now in place.\n“Sagaing is a key strategic area, so as it seeks to get full control back, the junta is happy there are fewer civilians against them. The weaker the people are, the better it is for them … This is what the junta does and has been doing for decades.”\n\nThe United Nations, which sent its top disaster officials to the country this weekend, says more than 9 million people have been affected by the earthquake.\nThis is on top of the 20 million people in Myanmar who were already in need of humanitarian assistance after four years of conflict. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday that the quake had “supercharged the suffering”.\n“Myanmar today is the scene of utter devastation and desperation,” he said. “I appeal for rapid, safe, sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access to reach those most in need across the country.”\nVolunteers and foreign rescue teams face long delays at the web of military checkpoints dotted across the country. Journalists are denied entry as the junta’s isolationist tendencies kick in – and aid is slowly trickling into Sagaing, but days late.\nRelief efforts have instead coalesced around Naypyidaw, the junta’s remote capital, where the military elite, their families and civil servants live. It was also hit hard by the quake, but its operational airport has become a hub for international aid, with the junta boasting that 49 international flights had arrived by midweek, bringing 2,000 rescue personnel and more than 700 tonnes (689 tons) of relief.\n\nOutside Naypyidaw, the military’s history of weaponising aid looms large. In the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which killed an estimated 100,000 people, accusations of withheld aid by the military government swirled. Similar allegations have resurfaced since, including after Cyclone Mocha battered Rakhine state in 2023.\nThe National Unity Government (NUG), Myanmar’s democratically elected government-in-exile, has warned that aid received by the junta will be siphoned off for military use. Yet the generals remain the gatekeeper of airports and harbours, forcing the international community to engage with Min Aung Hlaing.\n“We fully understand the necessity of communication with him,” NUG spokesman Nay Phone Latt told This Week in Asia.\n“But Min Aung Hlaing doesn’t have the ability to govern our country. He has no goodwill for our people. The only thing he focuses on is the maintenance of his power.”\n\nA junta reborn?\nThe quake has offered Min Aung Hlaing not only a domestic reprieve but also a diplomatic opportunity.\nOn Thursday, the junta chief – who is wanted by the International Criminal Court – arrived in Bangkok to attend the BIMSTEC regional summit. Carrying a ceasefire pledge and portraying himself as a leader open to international cooperation, Min Aung Hlaing was attempting to claw back legitimacy on the world stage.\nHe was greeted with a banner slung over a bridge near the five-star hotel hosting the summit reading: “We do not welcome murderer Min Aung Hlaing”.\nThe general held talks with the leaders of Thailand, India and Bangladesh and others at the summit, state mouthpiece Global New Light of Myanmar said, trumpeting his attendance and “the potential for cooperation with the international community to carry out rescue and rehabilitation measures”. On Saturday, the foreign ministers of Thailand and Malaysia said they planned to visit quake-hit Myanmar.\nMake sure your aid is not manipulated, exploited and misused by the junta\nKhin Ohmar, pro-democracy activist\n“This plays to Min Aung Hlaing’s advantage,” Khin Ohmar said. “And there will be more opportunities for him if Asean and the international community fall into his trap.”\nShe urged donors to ensure aid reaches the people, not the junta, as activists called for the opening of a humanitarian corridor, stretching from India’s western border to Thailand’s east.\n“Make sure your aid is not manipulated, exploited and misused by the junta. Make sure it goes fairly and squarely to the people,” she said.\nMyanmar’s military rulers have announced a US$250 million allocation for quake relief and recovery, though questions remain over where the funds will come from and who will oversee their spending. Many fear this money will be misused to reward loyalists or punish dissenting regions.\nThe NUG has offered to support relief efforts, but its requests for reassurances that its personnel would be given safe passage through junta-controlled checkpoints “have not been answered”, Nay Phone Latt told This Week in Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, reports have emerged of young men of fighting age, travelling to Mandalay to help earthquake victims, being detained or coerced into joining the military. Even amid a natural disaster, the enmity of war persists, overshadowing humanitarian needs.\nA spokesman for the “96 Soldiers Battalion” – one of hundreds of anti-junta People’s Defence Forces – told This Week in Asia that the military had continued to focus on crushing dissent despite the tragedy.\n“While the junta showcases rescue efforts in the city to maintain its international image, it continues to bomb villages,” said Phoo, who uses only one name, referring to an air strike on the village of Let Pan Hla, just outside Mandalay city.\nAt the same time, underground resistance groups in Mandalay have been quietly aiding relief efforts. Their work comes at great risk, however. One member was arrested on the second day after the earthquake, Phoo said. The rest fled.\nSuch responses are emblematic of a junta that always “prioritises security over relief for the people”, she said.\n‘Running on empty’\nAdding to the challenges, international aid has been stifled by a global humanitarian system under immense strain. The Myanmar earthquake was the first major natural disaster to occur since the United States, until recently the world’s largest donor nation, significantly scaled back its relief operations.\nAround the time of the quake, Donald Trump’s White House confirmed the sacking of nearly all staff from the USAID relief agency, following deep cuts to state spending.\nIn the vacuum left by the diminished US presence, other nations have stepped in. China has emerged as a leading donor, dispatching well-equipped disaster response teams and pledging an initial US$13 million in aid.\nThe irony is palpable. China, long seen as one of the junta’s sole supporters, is now being lauded for its swift and visible response. By contrast, the US has contributed just US$2 million in aid and dispatched only three USAID experts to Myanmar, with reports suggesting that even these efforts have been held up by the junta’s refusal to issue visas.\nVietnamese and Malaysian teams have also arrived on the ground, earning gratitude from locals. Images showing residents thanking and feeding these rescuers have gone viral.\n\nBut the absence of robust American involvement is being acutely felt. “The global humanitarian system is running on empty,” Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert at the International Crisis Group think tank, wrote in a recent editorial.

Experts Warn Establishment is 'Sanewashing' the 'Obvious Signs' He Is Suffering From Alzheimer's","text":"Donald Trump is dealing with dementia during his second term as president, at least according to psychotherapist and author Dr. John Gartner.\n\nDr. Gartner has noted numerous symptoms Trump may be suffering from including his inability to \"even finishing a sentence,\" RadarOnline.com can reveal.After previously claiming \"there is absolutely no doubt” Trump has dementia, Dr. Gartner explained his reasoning to MindSite News in a new interview.\n\nHe said: \"When we’re diagnosing dementia, what we need to see is a deterioration of someone’s own baseline of functioning. What we see that a lot of people don’t appreciate is that when Donald Trump was younger in the 1980s, he was actually quite articulate. He spoke in polished paragraphs; now he has difficulty even finishing a sentence. \n\n\"His thoughts were logical and related: now they’re tangential. He goes off on these ramblings where he is confabulating things – weird things in which he’ll talk about Venezuelans and mental hospitals, and then he’ll talk about sharks and batteries or the late, great Hannibal Lector and Silence of the Lambs.\"Dr. Gartner added: \"And why is he talking about Hannibal Lector – a fictional character who was not great; he was a murderer, a serial killer. It makes sense in Trump’s mind but these are really random associations. And there is an accelerating rate of decline.\"\n\nHe also believes the controversial politician is \"losing his capacity for coherent speech,\" noting \"dozens and dozens of Trump’s phonemic paraphasias, in which you use sounds in place of an actual word (a hallmark of brain damage and dementia).\" \n\nDr. Gartner said: \"... Trump will say something like ‘mishiz’ for missiles, or 'Chrishus' for Christmas, because he can’t complete the word. Then we see also a lot of semantic paraphasias, in which he uses a word incorrectly, as in 'the oranges of the situation' because it rhymes with 'the origins of the situation.'\"\n\n\"This is not within normal limits; his basic ability to use language is breaking down,\" the Rocket Man: Nuclear Madness and the Mind of Donald Trump author added.Dr. Gartner also accused the establishment of \"sanewashing\" Trump, and that he has \"really populated the whole government with people who are more or less equally sick.\"\n\nWe have reach out to White House reps for comment.\n\nOther mental health experts and a computer analysis have apparently backed up claims the 78-year-old has dementia, calling out to his long, rambling, nonsensical outbursts and absurd rally speeches.\n\nAccording to the computer analysis, the former reality star's rally speeches are now nearly twice as long as they were in 2016, during his first term in the White House.Trump also uses more all-or-nothing terms like \"always\" and \"never\" than he did eight years ago, which some experts see as a sign of old age.\n\nEven former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci previously pointed to a sharp decline in Trump's communication skills, claiming he has \"lost an ability to put powerful sentences together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, despite his questionable behavior (and brain), Trump has hinted at somehow running for a third term... and it may be a reality, as it hinges on the interpretation of \"election\" in the 22nd Amendment and the loyalty of Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nThe text of the full 22nd Amendment reads: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"However, if Vance becomes the next president, he could choose to have Trump as his vice president in the 2028 election and, after winning the election, announce he resigns as soon as he's sworn in.","summary":"Donald Trump is said to be going through his second presidential term with dementia, and the signs may be all right in front of us.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/trump-dementia-obvious-signs-suffering-from-alzheimers/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/OKHv50BGI/0x0/trump-dementia-1743799378536.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-05 00:00:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.042},{"id":307832624,"title":"Distracted truck driver overturns swerving to avoid motorbike","text":"Evening StandardBus driver in crash that left Virginia Giuffre with 'four days to live' gives very different version of eventsRoss Munns speaks out after Prince Andrew’s accuser posted photo from hospital bed claiming she was close to death after being ‘hit by a school bus travelling at 110km/h’\n\nThe TelegraphMy children were on the school bus and Virginia Giuffre’s story doesn’t add upParents have defended a school bus driver accused of crashing into Virginia Giuffre at 70mph, which she alleges caused life-threatening kidney failure.\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nYork PressContainer ship owner launches legal action over crash off East Yorks coastA legal claim has been filed by the owners of a container ship which crashed into a tanker off the East Yorkshire coast.\n\nSutton and Croydon GuardianOne of three teens killed in horror crash near Heathrow named for first timeOne of the three teenagers killed in a tragic crash near Heathrow earlier this week has been named.\n\nThe IndependentM5: Body found on motorway prompting full road closureWest Midlands Police are at the scene of two incidents and closed the area of the M5\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nThe TelegraphRussian captain was alone on bridge of North Sea crash shipThe Russian captain of a container ship that crashed into a tanker carrying jet fuel for the US military was alone on his ship’s bridge, investigators said.\n\nReutersVolkswagen to introduce 'import fee' on tariff-hit cars, WSJ reportsThe German automaker has temporarily halted rail shipments of vehicles from Mexico and will hold at port cars arriving by ship from Europe, the report said, citing a memo to retailers.

'I have nothing but respect for her, even though I obviously disagree with her political views.\n\n'But I probably disagree with some of my wife's, my beloved wife Laura's political views.\n\n'So you always disagree with people, don't you?'\n\nThat such things even need saying tells you everything about the highly-polarised nature of the online world that Brand these days inhabits.\n\nOnce a darling of the Left, who guest-edited both the Guardian newspaper – where he was a columnist – and the New Statesman, he has, in the last half-dozen years, executed a remarkable political and personal volte face.\n\nIt has seen the celebrity, whose support was courted by then Labour leader Ed Miliband, and who dutifully laid into the Tories on the BBC's Question Time, embrace New Age practices such as yoga, along with Christianity, and, more recently, the MAGA principles of one Donald Trump.\n\nHis Rightwards shift became apparent during the pandemic, when he built an audience of millions from social media content in which he expressed scepticism about vaccines, and suggested Covid was deliberately engineered by pharmaceutical companies hoping to achieve 'power, profit and control'.\n\nClips in which he shared pro-Putin talking points about the Ukraine war, or suggested that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is at the centre of a secret cabal, attracted millions of followers, who have been monetised via adverts for cryptocurrency, gold bullion and debt advice.\n\nAfter being booted off YouTube for promoting vaccine misinformation, he moved to Rumble, a video site where subscribers pay for priority access to his content. And by last summer, he was considered a sufficiently important 'influencer' to be invited to attend Trump rallies and the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nCome February this year it emerged that he'd relocated from Henley, where he'd been living with Laura and their young children, to sunny Florida, where he's recently popped up at the spiritual home of the Trump movement, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIt capped a bizarre journey for the former comedian, who was born in 1975 to a working class couple in the Essex town of Grays.\n\nBrand's parents Ron and Barbara split up when Brand was six and he was largely raised by his mother, who was diagnosed with cancer multiple times, a period detailed in his bestselling mid-2000s memoir My Booky Wook. At 16, he started taking amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD. He also, in his own words, 'got very obsessive about sex and women and pornography', marking the start of a widely-documented sex addiction.\n\nAfter playing Bugsy Malone in a school production, Brand went to the Italia Conti stage school at 16, but dropped out after a year.\n\nIt wasn't until his twenties that he found success as a stand-up comedian, helping him bag a role as a video journalist for MTV.\n\nThe alleged incidents over which Brand has been charged relate to the early days of his career, in which his burgeoning fame was occasionally hampered by high-profile controversies.\n\nIn 2001, MTV fired him for arriving at the studios dressed as Osama Bin Laden the day after the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe following year, he was dismissed from the XFM radio station for reading inappropriate material on air on a Sunday afternoon show.\n\nAfter two stints in rehab, once to kick drugs and the next time in an effort to combat sex addiction, he started hosting E4's Big Brother spin-off show, later named Big Brother's Big Mouth.\n\nAnd in short order he was appearing on mainstream stations such as BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4\n\nMy Booky Wook, which detailed heroin addiction and numerous sordid encounters, became a bestseller in 2007, and the following year he lost his slot on a BBC Radio 2 show after calling up Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs to boast about having slept with his granddaughter, Georgina Baillie.\n\nAt the height of that controversy, he moved to Hollywood, where he landed roles in a string of major films, including Forgetting Sarah Marshall opposite Kristen Bell, and Get Him To The Greek with Jonah Hill, both in which he plays the same anarchic British rock star Aldous Snow. He also starred in the remake of the Dudley Moore comedy, Arthur, alongside Dame Helen Mirren.\n\nHis romance with Katy Perry, who he'd met at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2009, was of the whirlwind variety: Brand proposed outside the Taj Mahal two months after meeting her and they wed at a lavish ceremony in India in October 2010.\n\nHowever the relationship faltered after just 14 months and he returned to the UK, where he was embraced by the chattering classes and, for a time, enjoyed a relationship with socialite Jemima Goldsmith.\n\nBrand's stock among British liberals peaked at the 2015 election, where he endorsed Ed Miliband. That year also turned out to be the one in which Brand met Laura, the sister of TV presenter Kirsty, who was a lifestyle blogger keen on meditating, crystals and making her own beauty products.\n\nThey married in 2017 and have children aged eight, six and 22 months. She remained by his side following the broadcast of Channel 4's Dispatches documentary in September 2023 and she has embraced his conversion to Christianity, which saw him baptised in the River Thames by TV adventurer Bear Grylls last April.","summary":"The day before he was charged, Russell Brand used his podcast 'Stay Free' to discuss two of the more high-profile women on his romantic CV.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14573541/GUY-ADAMS-Russell-Brand-Trumps-MAGA-allies.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/05/00/96940923-0-image-m-124_1743810505734.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 23:58:09","author":"Editor,Guy Adams","authors":["Editor","Guy Adams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":307832732,"title":"Stocks slump again after China fires back in trade war with tariffs on U.S. goods","text":"BEIJING/WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH, Florida - Global stock markets plummeted further on Friday after China said it would strike back at U.S. President Donald Trump with additional tariffs of 34% on U.S. goods, escalating a trade war that has rattled investors and fed fears of a coming recession.The trade war has spurred the biggest market losses since the COVID-19 pandemic.The Nasdaq Composite's slide confirmed a bear market for the tech-heavy index, compared to its record closing high of 20,173.89 on Dec. 16.

We wish him and his family well,” Parnell said.\n\nMultiple media reports, however, suggested that Haugh’s ouster came at the suggestion of a far-right internet activist, Laura Loomer, who supported President Donald Trump’s campaign for re-election in 2024.\n\nDemocrats also seized upon the fact that Trump did not fire anyone involved in the recent controversy over the use of the messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen – something that came to light after a journalist was accidentally added to the chat.\n\n“Gen. Haugh led the NSA and Cyber Command with steady, effective leadership,” Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona wrote on social media Friday.\n\n“By dismissing him and failing to hold anyone accountable for the threat to U.S. pilots over Signal, Trump has shown he values loyalty over competence – making us all less safe.”\n\nAnother Democratic senator, Mark Warner of Virginia, echoed that sentiment, calling the situation “so crazy it defies belief”.\n\n“Trump refused to fire the people that embarrassed America and risked servicemembers’ lives in the Signalgate scandal,” Warner wrote, “but fired Gen. Haugh, a nonpartisan national security expert, at the advice of a self-described ‘pro-white nationalist’.”\n\nHaugh was just one in a slate of firings this week that came after Trump met with Loomer at the White House.\n\nMedia reports indicate Haugh’s civilian deputy at the NSA, Wendy Noble, was booted from her position as well and reassigned.\n\nIn addition, multiple members of the National Security Council also appear to have been removed from their positions, including Brian Walsh, a senior director of intelligence, and Thomas Boodry, the senior director of legislative affairs.\n\nThe Reuters news agency estimated that more than a dozen security officials were dismissed as part of the alleged purge.\n\nAs he flew to South Florida for a golf tournament on Thursday, Trump addressed the rumours, acknowledging “some” people were fired but refusing to give specifics about the total.\n\n“Always, we’re going to let go of people – people we don’t like or people that we don’t think can do the job or people who may have loyalties to someone else,” Trump said from Air Force One.\n\nHe also addressed his meeting with Loomer earlier in the week, offering high praise for the internet personality.\n\n“Laura Loomer is a very good patriot,” he said. “She’s a very strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations.”\n\nWhen pressed about what that meant, he conceded that Loomer not only recommends individuals to hire – but also to fire. He did, however, dismiss reports that Loomer was involved in a purge of security officials.\n\nLoomer herself addressed Haugh’s removal on Thursday, accusing the four-star general of insufficient loyalty to the Trump administration. She also attempted to paint Haugh as an acolyte of former President Joe Biden, the Democrat who bested Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n“NSA Director Tim Haugh and his deputy Wendy Noble have been disloyal to President Trump. That is why they have been fired,” she wrote.\n\n“Their firings are a blessing for the American people. Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”\n\nLoomer has long been a controversial figure on the US right. She once called herself a “proud Islamophobe” and has spread the debunked conspiracy theory that the attacks on September 11, 2001, were an “inside job”.\n\nHer proximity to the president has caused ripples of concern within Trump’s administration – and has been seized upon as a point of criticism for Democrats.\n\nThe ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, demanded an “immediate explanation” for Haugh’s firing, arguing it makes “all of us less safe”.\n\n“I have known General Haugh to be an honest and forthright leader who followed the law and put national security first,” Himes wrote. “I fear those are precisely the qualities that could lead to his firing in this Administration.”","summary":"US President Donald Trump acknowledged he has taken advice from a far-right media personality about who to fire.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/4/pentagon-confirms-four-star-generals-firing-amid-trump-security-purge?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-04-04T022149Z_746390756_RC2PQDA90R1C_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1743808570.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 23:50:24","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":307826808,"title":"Trump abruptly fires the 4-star general who headed the National Security Agency (World)","text":"President Donald Trump has abruptly fired the director of the National Security Agency, according to U.S. officials and members of Congress, but the White House and the Pentagon have provided no reasons for the move.\n\nSenior military leaders were informed Thursday of the firing of Air Force Gen. Tim Haugh, who also oversaw the Pentagon’s Cyber Command, the officials said. They received no advance notice about the decision to remove a four-star general with a 33-year career in intelligence and cyber operations, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel decisions.\n\nThe move has triggered sharp criticism from members of Congress and demands for an immediate explanation. And it marks the latest dismissal of national security officials by Trump at a time when his Republican administration faces criticism over his failure to take any action against other key leaders' use of an unclassified Signal messaging chat that included The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to discuss plans for a military strike.\n\nIt's unclear who now is in charge of the NSA and the Cyber Command.\n\nAlso fired was Haugh's civilian deputy at the NSA, Wendy Noble.\n\nThe NSA notified congressional leadership and top lawmakers of the national security committees of the firing late Wednesday but did not give reasons, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss the matter. The person said Noble has been reassigned to the office of the defense undersecretary for intelligence.\n\nThe White House did not respond to messages seeking comment. The NSA referred questions about Haugh to the Defense Department. The Pentagon did not respond to questions about why he was fired or provide other details.\n\nSean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, would only say, in a statement, that the department thanks Haugh \"for his decades of service to our nation, culminating as U.S. Cyber Command Commander and National Security Agency Director. We wish him and his family well.”\n\nFar-right activist and commentator Laura Loomer appeared to take credit Friday in a post on X, saying she raised concerns to Trump about Haugh’s ties to Gen. Mark Milley and the Biden administration and questioned the NSA chief's loyalty to the president. Milley served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Trump’s first term but has since become an outspoken critic.\n\n“Given the fact that the NSA is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a Biden nominee to hold that position,” Loomer wrote. “Thank you President Trump for being receptive to the vetting materials provided to you and thank you for firing these Biden holdovers.”\n\nIt's unclear what Loomer meant about Haugh's ties to Milley — who served in the Army. Milley retired in September 2023, a few months before Haugh took over at the NSA. Haugh would not have been a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Milley's tenure. As chairman, Milley could have provided input or advice on dozens of military nominations for senior officer slots, so it remains to be seen if any or all officers who were promoted during that time are also considered vulnerable.\n\nLoomer, who has claimed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an “inside job,” had discussed staff loyalty with Trump in an Oval Office meeting Wednesday, according to several people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel manner. A day later, Trump said he fired “some” White House National Security Council officials.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, sent a letter to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth demanding to know why Haugh and Noble were fired.\n\n“Public reporting suggests that your removal of these officials was driven by a fringe social media personality, which represents a deeply troubling breach of the norms that safeguard our national security apparatus from political pressure and conspiracy theories,” Himes, D-Conn., wrote.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said Friday that he has “long warned about the dangers of firing military officers as a political loyalty test.”\n\n\"In addition to the other military leaders and national security officials Trump has fired, he is sending a chilling message throughout the ranks: don’t give your best military advice, or you may face consequences,” Reed said in a statement.\n\nHe added that Trump “has given a priceless gift to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea by purging competence from our national security leadership.”\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the U.S. was “facing unprecedented cyber threats” and asked how firing Haugh, who has served in the military for more than 30 years, makes America safer.\n\nHaugh's firing sets off a 60-day process. Unless he is moved to another three- or four-star job in 60 days he would automatically revert to a two-star.\n\nAny new high-level job would be unlikely since that would require a nomination from Trump, who just fired him. As a result, Haugh, who was confirmed for the NSA job in a unanimous Senate vote in December 2023, would likely retire.\n\nTrump hasn't commented on Haugh or Noble, but on Thursday he dismissed the National Security Council firings as normal.\n\n“Always we’re letting go of people,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he made his way to Miami on Thursday afternoon. “People that we don’t like or people that we don’t think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else.”\n\nThe firings come as Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, fights calls for his ouster after using the publicly available encrypted Signal app to discuss planning for a sensitive March 15 military operation targeting Houthi militants in Yemen.\n\nWarner called it “astonishing” that Trump \"would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the National Security Agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app — even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office.”\n\nHaugh met last month with Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has roiled the federal government by slashing personnel and budgets at dozens of agencies. In a statement, the NSA said the meeting was intended to ensure both organizations are “aligned” with the new administration’s priorities.\n\nHaugh had led both the NSA and Cyber Command since February 2024. Both departments play leading roles in the nation’s cybersecurity. The NSA also supports the military and other national security agencies by collecting and analyzing a vast amount of data and information globally.\n\nCyber Command is known as America’s first line of defense in cyberspace and also plans offensive cyberoperations for potential use against adversaries.","summary":"President Donald Trump has abruptly fired the director of the National Security Agency, according to U.S. officials and members of Congress, but the White House and the Pentagon have provided no reasons for the move.

Former President Joe Biden's administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which are worsening as the world gets hotter, yet U.S. Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins did not mention climate change in Friday's directive, which called on her staff to speed up environmental reviews.\n\nIt exempts affected forests from an objection process that allows outside groups, tribes and local governments to challenge logging proposals at the administrative level before they are finalized. It also narrows the number of alternatives federal officials can consider when weighing logging projects.\n\nLogging projects are routinely contested by conservation groups, both at the administrative level and in court, which can drag out the approval process for years.\n\nThe emergency designation covers 176,000 square miles (455,000 square kilometers) of terrain primarily in the West but also in the South, around the Great Lakes and in New England. Combined, it is an area larger than California and amounts to 59% of Forest Service lands.\n\nMost of those forests are considered to have high wildfire risk, and many are in decline because of insects and disease.\n\n“National Forests are in crisis due to uncharacteristically severe wildfires, insect and disease outbreaks, invasive species and other stressors,” Rollins said in her directive, echoing concerns raised by her predecessor under Biden, Tom Vilsack.\n\nThose threats — combined with overgrown forests, more homes in wild areas and decades of aggressive fire suppression — add up to a “forest health crisis\" that could be helped with more logging, said Rollins, a former conservative legal activist and president of a Trump-aligned think tank.\n\nConcerns about lost safeguards\n\nEnvironmentalists rejected the claim that wildfire protection was driving the changes to forest policy.\n\nIn response to the new directive, Forest Service officials at the regional level were told to come up with plans to increase the volume of timber offered by 25% over the next four to five years. In a letter from Acting Associate Chief Chris French, they were also told to identify projects that could receive “categorical exclusions,” which are exemptions from stringent environmental analyses.\n\n“This is all about helping the timber industry,” said Blaine Miller-McFeeley of the environmental group Earthjustice. “It's not looking at what will protect communities. It's about the number of board feet, the number of trees you are pulling down.”\n\nThe Forest Service has sold about 3 billion board feet of timber annually for the past decade. Timber sales peaked several decades ago at about 12 billion board feet amid widespread clearcutting of forests. Volumes dropped sharply in the 1980s and 1990s as environmental protections were tightened and more areas were put off limits to logging. Most timber is harvested from private lands.\n\nUnder Biden, the Forest Service sought to more intensively manage national forests in the West, by speeding up wildfire protection work including logging in so-called “priority landscapes” covering about 70,000 square miles (180,000 square kilometers).\n\nMuch of that work involved smaller trees and younger forests that add fuel to wildfires but are less profitable for loggers.\n\nBiden proposed more protections for old-growth forests, drawing backlash from the timber industry, but that plan was abandoned in the administration’s final days.\n\nTimber industry wants more trees available\n\nIndustry representatives said they hope the Trump administration's actions will result in the sales of more full-grown stands of trees that are desired by sawmills. Federal law allows for the harvest of about 6 billion board feet annually — about twice the level that’s now logged, said Travis Joseph, president of the Oregon-based American Forest Resource Council, an industry group.\n\n“This industry needs a raw supply to remain competitive and keep the doors open,” he said. “We're not even reaching half of what forest plans currently call for. Let's implement our forest plans across the country, and if we did that, that should increase the volume that's available to American mills and create American jobs and create revenue.”\n\nTrump last month ordered federal officials to investigate the possible harms of lumber imports to national security. The administration said Canada and other countries engage in lumber subsidies that disadvantage the United States. Canadian timber was left out of the president's latest round of tariffs.","summary":"President Donald Trump&amp;#39;s administration acted to roll back environmental safeguards around future logging projects on more than half of U.S. national forests under an emergency designation announced Friday that cites dangers from wildfires.

That's the beauty of what we do, we put ourselves in the driver's seat. As long as they are giving us something that's good. For instance, with TikTok as an example, we have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, 'We'll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs?' The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. They always have.\"Navarro said of the tariffs, on CNBC's Closing Bell: Overtime, \"This is not a negotiation. This is not that.
