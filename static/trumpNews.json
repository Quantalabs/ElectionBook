Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary","text":"President-elect Donald Trump shocked Washington Thursday by nominating Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be his secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe latest appointment to a rapidly growing cabinet and West Wing packed with loyalists new and old immediately sent shockwaves through the public health sector given Kennedy’s reputation as an anti-vaxxer who has pushed conspiracy theories about a number of health-related topics. \n\nThe 70-year-old husband of actress Cheryl Hines has railed against processed foods, vowed to remove fluoride from public water systems and suggested COVID was engineered to be ‘ethnically targeted.’ \n\n‘I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),’ Trump posted on X. \n\nDailyMail.com previously reported that Dr. Ben Carson – a respected surgeon turned 2016 presidential candidate – was in the mix, though Trump had also said he would let Kennedy ‘go wild’ on federal health agencies. \n\nKennedy had boosted Trump’s 2024 run by suspending his independent presidential campaign the day after the Democratic National Convention wrapped up in August – telling his supporters to back the Republican in key swing states. \n\nKennedy later embraced Trump even more – telling his supporters across the U.S. to back Trump instead – arguing they had a vision to ‘Make America Healthy Again.’ \n\n‘For too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,’ Trump said. \n\nThe controversial pick comes just a day after Trump stunned Democrats and Republicans alike with his seemingly sudden choice of Matt Gaetz to be U.S. attorney general. \n\nGaetz, who resigned his seat as a Florida congressman hours after Wednesday’s announcement amid a roiling probe by the House Ethics Committee into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and bribery.\n\nHe is a MAGA firebrand who has taken aim at fellow House members form both parties and led the coup against former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Republican senators have publicly and privately expressed shock over the nomination.\n\nMeanwhile, of Kennedy heading his Health agency, Trump said Thursday: ‘The Safety and Health of all Americans is the most important role of any Administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming Health Crisis in this Country.\n\n‘Mr. Kennedy will restore these Agencies to the traditions of Gold Standard Scientific Research, and beacons of Transparency, to end the Chronic Disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!’ he added. \n\nTrump had promised an advisor role for the member of the Kennedy political dynasty, but now he will be responsible for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential services.\n\nThe move from the Republican could likely set up another battle in the Senate over his nominations, after he chose Rep. Matt Gaetz as his attorney general, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be his Director of National Intelligence and Fox News host Pete Hegseth to run the Department of Defense. \n\nIt is another sign that Trump intends to completely upend the establishment in the federal government and fill his White House with prominent political allies.\n\nKennedy launched his presidential bid in April 2023 as a Democrat – but when he didn’t get much traction in the party, announced a independent run that October. \n\nHe’s the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, who were both assassinated in the 1960s. \n\nRFK Jr. reached out to Trump about a potential endorsement on the heels of the president-elect’s own brush with death by a gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13th. \n\nKennedy then traveled to Milwaukee while the Republican National Convention was happening in the days following the July shooting, but cancelled planned counter-programming for his own presidential run as he started up a dialog about joining Trump’s team. \n\nIn a call – that was fantastically leaked by Kennedy’s own son Robert F. Kennedy III – Trump is heard floating that he could see a role in a future Trump administration for RFK Jr.\n\n‘I would love you to do stuff,’ Trump said. ‘And I think it would be so big for you.’ \n\nKennedy officially made the announcement the day after Vice President Kamala Harris officially became the Democratic nominee, knocking some wind out of her sails. \n\nThe majority of his famous family was supporting President Joe Biden – and then Harris once Biden dropped out – with his siblings putting out multiple statements throughout the election cycle expressing their anger and disappointment. \n\nAs Kennedy campaigned, he was trailed by curious anecdotes from his past – that a brain worm had embedded itself into his head, that he might have eaten dog in South Korea – which he says was goat in Patagonia – that he disposed of a dead bear cub in Central Park.\n\nHe plucked his vice presidential candidate Nicole Shanahan from the pages of the tabloids – as the ex-wife of billionaire Google co-founder Sergey Brin who reportedly had a marriage-ending tryst with Elon Musk – something both she and Musk deny.\n\nNow Musk is a key player in Trumpland. \n\nEven after Kennedy bowed out he was followed by drama.\n\nIn September, it was revealed that New York Magazine’s top Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi was put on leave after confessing to a digital-only affair with RFK. \n\nNuzzi has since parted ways with the magazine but is still producing headlines over the legal battle with her ex-fiance, Politico Playbook’s Ryan Lizza, after breaking up over the Kennedy revelations.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump shocked Washington Thursday by nominating Robert F.

Why Trump dynasty may look to youngest son","text":"American presidents must be citizens, born in the US, a resident in the country for 14 years, and at least 35 years of age.\n\nBarron William Trump was born in Florida on 20 March 2006.\n\nHe is the only child of Melania and Donald Trump, who has fathered four other children by his two previous wives.\n\nBarron has lived between Florida, New York City and Washington DC all his life.\n\nHe qualifies as a potential POTUS – except for his age – the 18-year-old was only a first-time voter this November.\n\nRead more:Who is Barron Trump?Meet the Trumps\n\nBut MAGA supporters seem ready to wait for the Trump dynasty to carry on in power – “Barron Trump President 2044” merchandise is already on sale on the internet.\n\nHaving guided his father on to the voter-rich “manosphere” of internet sites, Barron has become Donald’s favourite son and the main repository of the Trump family’s political ambitions – if he wants the role.\n\nYoung, blonde, with handsome Slavic looks, and towering over his 6ft 3in father, Barron, at least 6ft 7in, is a cult figure with the MAGA faithful who talk of his “aristocratic bearing”.\n\nThis year, when he made his first, rare, appearance at a campaign rally, his father suggested his other sons watch out for the competition he represents.\n\nOvertaking his older half-siblings – Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka – in the pecking order is a remarkable metamorphosis for the mommie’s boy who seemed on the brink of tears nine years ago at his father’s first victory rally in New York City.\n\nThis year at Mar-a-Lago, Barron and his mother were the First Family elect, the first on to the stage with the president-elect.\n\nBarron was singled out for thanks by his father. The young male voters Barron directed his father to woo had indeed made a significant contribution to the Republicans’ across-the-board victory.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported a shift to the right of some 28 points toward Trump in this group.\n\nAccording to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning, 56% of male voters aged 18-28 backed Trump in 2024, up from 41% in 2020.\n\nIn the last campaign, Jared Kushner was in charge of the internet, then in his 30s.\n\nThis time a 27-year-old Republican consultant called Alex Bruesewitz produced a list of possible podcast appearances, which Trump immediately referred him to his youngest son: “Barron knows this stuff very well”.\n\nBarron and his 18-year-old best friend, Bo Loudon, whose parents appeared on TV’s Wife Swap, then guided Trump to spend hours talking to hosts such as Logan Paul, Adin Ross, the Nelk Boys, Theo Von and, of course, Joe Rogan.\n\nTrump’s interview with the comedian Theo Von has been viewed 15 million times.\n\nHis appearance on Joe Rogan has notched up 50 million views on YouTube alone, far more views than the presidential debates and convention keynote speeches.\n\nThere are now recriminations in the Democratic camp because Kamala Harris turned down her invitation to go on Joe Rogan for fear of “a backlash with some of our progressive colleagues”.\n\nThe left-wing independent Senator Bernie Sanders is almost a lone voice on the left arguing that cancelling right-of-centre outlets is counterproductive.\n\nTrump burnished his celebrity on The Apprentice but was quick to understand that newer media outlets are the way to reach younger voters.\n\n“They don’t grow up watching television the same way as we did. They grow up looking at the internet and watching a computer, right,” he noted.\n\nJamie Tahsin of Vice, who has spent five years studying the ultimate online bro Andrew Tate, describes Barron as “chronically online”.\n\nThe looser conversational style of these podcasts suited Trump, who came across as less aggressive, partly because he was not challenged or asked to talk about policy detail.\n\nHe was in tune with their typical obsessions of sports, bling, macho anti-woke posturing, trucks, wrestling and cryptocurrencies.\n\nTate, an accused rapist and human trafficker, has not been directly involved with Trump but still summarised the election as “men vs gays and chicks”.\n\nBarron follows all this stuff and seems to be most interested in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHe joined his father and brothers to launch the World Liberty Financial.\n\nOn a livestream with two of WLF’s other founders, Chase Herro and Zachary Folkman, Trump commented: “Barron knows so much about this. Barron’s a young guy but he knows it. He talks about his wallet.”\n\nHerro is also known for running the Date Hotter Girls service and crypto markets have soared since Trump’s re-election.\n\nThe name Barron, with its aristocratic overtones, has long appealed to Trump.\n\nWhen he was making his way as a businessman, Trump used to call reporters claiming to be “John Barron”, a colleague of Trump’s, who would then go on to praise Trump’s various enterprises.\n\nThen he gave the name Barron to his son.\n\nBarron appears to share the family fondness for money-making schemes but it is not obvious yet that this diffident and polite young man has political ambitions. Those who know Barron say he is quiet, gentle and considerate – the opposite of a MAGA frat boy.\n\nBarron went to three high schools as his father moved around the US. He has just started as a freshman at New York University’s Stern Business School. When fellow students teased him asking how he voted, he declined to say he is a Republican.\n\nAs so often his mother, Melania, spoke up for him, also without being partisan. She posted a picture of her son in the polling booth captioned “Voted for the first time – for his dad”.\n\nEarlier Melania publicly turned down the invitation for Barron to speak at this year’s Republican Convention. His cousin Kia took the gig instead. Barron himself has no public social media presence.\n\nMelania and her parents did much of the work raising Barron. They came to the US from Slovenia, then part of Yugoslavia. Barron speaks fluent Slovenian and as a small boy he spoke English with an accent like his mother.\n\nHis father claims he also speaks Chinese. Like her, he is an enigmatic figure, though he dresses in a suit and tie for his public appearances and is unlikely to appear in a coat emblazoned with “I don’t really care do you.”\n\nAmerica may be a republic rather than a monarchy, but dynasties still matter. They accumulate wealth and political know-how. Two generations of the Bush family were elected president.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr has made a grotesque comeback as a Trump ally, trading on the family name of his father and uncle, President John F Kennedy.\n\nTrump’s other children are dimmer political prospects.\n\nFavourite daughter Ivanka was a close advisor last time her father was president but has repeatedly insisted that she has turned the page on politics.\n\nDon Jr and Eric are keen, but not very bright, even in their father’s estimation.\n\nEric is concentrating on the commercial side of the Trump empire, while his wife Lara, currently co-chair of the Republican Party, may be in line for a job in the next administration.\n\n👉Listen to The World with Richard Engle and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈\n\nDon Jr goes down well with the MAGA faithful but lobbied hard for JD Vance to be vice president, scoring an own goal by recruiting someone likely better placed to follow his father into the White House.\n\nTiffany was brought up by her mother, Marla Maples, in California and largely stays away from campaigning.\n\nThat leaves the burden of expectation on the shoulders of Barron.\n\nThe world will have to wait until 2044 to see if his own ambitions, his mother, and his father’s legacy, leave him with a shot at the presidency.","summary":"American presidents must be citizens, born in the US, a resident in the country for 14 years, and at least 35 years of age.

Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics.\"As the CEO of Denver-based fracking company Liberty Energy, Wright's nomination is likely to rile up progressives and Left-Wing politicians. However, Wright's addition has already drawn praise from at least one conservationist group.Newsweek reached out to the Trump campaign by email on Saturday evening for comment.The conservative American Conservation Coalition Eastern Regional Director Brian Martinez posted a video on social media platform X in which Wright expressed his views on climate change and the significant role energy plays in price fluctuations on everyday products such as food.\"Chris Wright will be an incredible Energy Secretary. He gave these remarks at ACC Action's summit in Salt Lake City last year,\" Martinez wrote.In the clip, Wright says, \"When we make energy more expensive, we make it harder for low-income people to satisfy their basic needs, to heat their home – what's the biggest cost of food?

Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to enact tariffs. But over the years, through various legislation, Congress has delegated a large degree of that authority to the president to be able to use tariffs for national security purposes, in an emergency, or to combat unfair trade practices by another country. That has allowed past presidents, including Trump himself in his first term, to levy hefty fees on a range of products from specific countries.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump faced little resistance from the courts and Congress for tariffs he placed on imports of steel and aluminum from certain countries and thousands of products coming from China. But Trump’s latest proposal would be much broader, covering every product from every country, raising more pressing questions about whether he’s overstepping the power he’s been given by Congress, according to lawyers and business groups.\n\nThe conservative-majority Supreme Court, which repeatedly ruled against President Joe Biden on the broad use of executive power without the approval of Congress, could be receptive to arguments that Trump would be going too far, some legal experts predict.\n\n“It’s a really important question whether the Congress can just turn over the running of the government to the president,” said Alan Morrison, a professor at George Washington University Law School who was involved in litigation against Trump’s earlier steel tariffs.\n\nNew legal challenges are certain and will be brought by “anybody who imports anything,” he added. The only thing stopping such lawsuits would be a reluctance to annoy Trump, who is widely seen as a “vindictive man,” Morrison said.\n\n‘Another bout of inflation’\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump made tariffs central to his plan to revive the American economy, arguing that putting significant duties on imports would encourage companies to relocate their manufacturing plants to the U.S. and protect industries from cheaper overseas competition. Tariffs are paid to the federal government by the company importing a product from overseas either to sell that product directly to consumers or to use it as a component in another product being assembled in the U.S.\n\n“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it’s my favorite word,” Trump said at the Chicago Economic Club in October. “It needs a public relations firm to help it, but to me, it’s the most beautiful word in the dictionary.”\n\nBut economists and businesses have warned that tariffs would likely have little effect on driving manufacturing back to the U.S. because of the costs, logistics, regulatory barriers and lack of labor that many industries would face in moving production stateside.\n\nInstead, companies in the past have largely passed the cost of the tariffs on to consumers in the form of higher prices or absorbed the costs, cutting into their profits, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nTrump’s 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum led to a reduction in U.S. manufacturing employment because of higher costs for companies using steel and aluminum in their products, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\n“If the tariffs that the former president suggested during the campaign go into effect, we think that’s going to have an inflationary effect,” said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade for the Consumer Technology Association. “Consumers just voted in the election in a way that suggests they did not like inflation over the last four years, and we don’t want another bout of inflation here in the United States.”\n\nAmong the tech products that would be most affected by the proposed tariffs are tablets, smartphones and video game consoles, Brzytwa said.\n\nCTA and other industry groups said they are preparing to mount legal challenges to the proposed tariffs and pushing Congress to take action on legislation to limit the president’s authority when it comes to tariffs, like a bill introduced in September by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would require congressional approval for nearly all tariffs.\n\nWhile Trump has said he has the power to enact tariffs without Congress, something he did during his first term, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., suggested that it would likely take action from Congress, including support from Democrats, to carry through with the tariff proposal.\n\n“The tariffs, that most likely is going to require 60 [votes] unless there’s some way we can get that done through reconciliation with 51,” Scott said during an interview on Fox News on Sunday. Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the Senate.\n\nBut outside of congressional action, the fight against tariffs will likely fall to the judicial branch. Courts have given the president a fair amount of leeway in imposing tariffs for national security reasons, leaving it largely up the the president to make the determination on whether a certain country or product poses a risk to the nation’s defense, said Petros Mavroidis, an expert on international trade at Columbia Law School.\n\n‘Ripe to challenge’\n\nDuring his first term, Trump slapped tariffs on Canada, a close ally, using a national security justification before granting the country an exemption. But a broad array of tariffs on allies “could cross the line,” especially as the Supreme Court has taken a generally pro-business stance in recent years, he added.\n\n“My bottom-line takeaway is that all statutes that delegate tariff authority to the president are tied to specific action on a product against a single country,” said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown Law Center who also specializes in international trade law.\n\nIt would be “really problematic” the more the Trump administration departs from what Congress has specifically authorized in delegating power to the president on tariffs, Hillman added.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, the Supreme Court embraced a theory called the “major questions doctrine.” Biden’s ambitious plan to wipe out billions of dollars in student debt was one of the proposals the Supreme Court faulted.\n\nIn fact, lawyers who challenged Trump’s tariffs on goods from China and lost in the Court of International Trade — before the recent Supreme Court rulings expanding the major questions doctrine — are now pushing those arguments on appeal.\n\n“This is a classic example of a ‘major questions’ case,” the lawyers wrote in a recent filing.\n\nThey argue that a provision of the Trade Act that allows for existing tariffs to be modified was not intended to be an avenue for the government to massively ratchet up those tariffs.\n\nThe same provision, Section 307, is “maybe one of the most obvious ways for Trump to follow through on a threat of increasing further tariffs on China,” said one of the lawyers involved in the litigation. “That is one that’s squarely vulnerable under the major questions doctrine.”\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not yet heard oral arguments in the case, but its ruling could have an impact on Trump’s new plans and tee up the issue for the Supreme Court.\n\nConservative justices have also appeared sympathetic to what is called the “nondelegation doctrine,” which states there are limits to how much of its core powers Congress can willingly assign to the executive branch.\n\nThe court narrowly ruled against embracing a version of the doctrine in a 2019 case challenging a law that gave the attorney general considerable leeway to implement the federal sex offender registry. Another opportunity to take up the issue is currently pending at the court. It involves legal challenges to the Federal Communications Commission’s role in imposing fees on phone users that are used to expand access to telecommunications services.\n\nIn the first Trump administration, that theory was pushed by groups challenging steel tariffs but did not gain traction. The Supreme Court declined to take up the issue.\n\nOne problem for any potential challengers is a Supreme Court precedent from 1976 called Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin, which said one of the key provisions that allow the president to impose tariffs — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act — does not raise any nondelegation issues.\n\nBut Hillman said that with the court’s current 6-3 conservative majority, there might be an appetite to revisit that and related questions.\n\n“There’s a notion that the time is becoming ripe to challenge the president’s authority to do these things under these statutes,” she said.\n\nDespite the legal grounds for opposing the tariffs that groups may have, any action in the courts could take years to resolve, with companies likely having to pay the tariffs until they wait for a resolution. In the meantime, companies have been ramping up their shipments of imports to try to get as many products into the U.S. as possible before any potential tariffs take effect.\n\n“I think people will be looking at every possible solution, and I think there are views on both sides about how promising a legal approach would ever be, but certainly not in the near term,” said an industry official involved in trade policy. “I don’t see a lot of hope or promise for any action in the immediate or near term.”\n\nWhen Trump imposed a 7.5% tariff on millions of shoes coming to the U.S. from China in 2019, the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America sued, arguing that footwear was outside of the scope of the original investigation into unfair trade practices by China. The case is still making its way through the courts.\n\nThis time around, the group is largely focused on working with the incoming administration to get its products excluded from future tariffs, arguing there isn’t a national security risk from importing shoes from China and that there is little chance shoe production would move back to the U.S. because of the lack of materials, supply chain and labor here, said Matt Priest, the trade group’s CEO.\n\n“We’ll continue to engage in the legal process around any action,” Priest said. “But our expectations are pretty low as it relates to finding some relief via the courts.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s consistent campaign pledge to impose sweeping tariffs&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/testing-trumps-authority-the-impact-of-imposing-sweeping-tariffs/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-Trumps-authority-to-impose-sweeping-tariffs-to-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 01:09:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":265279550,"title":"China \"ready to work\" with Trump administration, Xi tells Biden","text":"United States President Joe Biden met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the last time in Peru on Saturday, The Hill reported.Biden met with Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru on Saturday.As per The Hill, during the meeting, Xi said that China is ready to work with the new Donald Trump administration and emphasised maintaining communication, expanding cooperation and managing differences.

Public statements and recent activities In an interview with “Fox & Friends” in October, Melania stated, \"I have much more experience, much more knowledge. I was in the White House before. So when you go in, you know exactly what to expect.\" She emphasized the importance of having a supportive team aligned with her vision for the country. While her involvement in the 2024 campaign was minimal, she promoted her memoir in the months leading up to the election. The book revealed her strong support for abortion rights, contrasting with her husband’s stance on reversing ‘Roe v. Wade.’ Melania also launched a digital photography collection, \"On the Move,\" featuring images that she described as capturing \"the art of being present while moving forward into an exciting new world.\" The collection, priced at $195, showcases moments from her dynamic life, photographed by a Belgian artist. Looking back at her first term During Donald Trump’s first presidency, Melania delayed her move to the White House until June 2017, citing her son’s schooling. She maintained a relatively low public profile and focused on specific initiatives, such as her “Be Best” campaign. While Melania’s evolving role as a political spouse may differ from traditional expectations, her selective participation reflects her unique approach to life in the public eye. .Trump names vaccine skeptic as health chief","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2024/11/17/melania-trump-declines-white-house-return-as-first-ladys-role-evolves","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-11-17/0l5ploap/Melania.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 01:06:22","author":"Anna Price","authors":["Anna Price"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.482},{"id":265279422,"title":"Donald Trump is considering the Conservative Party’s proposal to relocate undocumented immigrants to Rwanda following the abandonment of a deterrent program by Keir Starmer.","text":"DONALD Trump’s team is looking at plans to deport illegal migrants to Rwanda, The Sun on Sunday can reveal.\n\nThe scheme was drawn up by the old British Tory government but ditched by Sir Keir Starmer when he became PM.\n\nAllies of Mr Trump said his team is considering deporting illegal immigrants to a number of countries – including Rwanda.\n\nA source close to Trump’s camp said: “Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration – and he is determined to stick to it.\n\nThe plan being reviewed involves the deportation of illegal migrants to Rwanda and other nations to prevent them from remaining in the US.\n\nMr Trump won a sweeping victory by promising to crack down on illegal immigration in America.\n\nHe accused Joe Biden and the Democrats of woefully failing to protect America’s borders.\n\nThe migrant crisis has hit new heights in America in recent years.\n\nBetween January 2021 and September 2024, US authorities documented an astonishing 10 million “encounters” with migrants believed to be attempting illegal entry into the country.\n\nBritain is in the grip of its open illegal migration crisis.\n\nSome 32,900 Channel migrants crossed over in small boats so far this year.\n\nThis is higher than the number for all of 2023.\n\nThe Tories said their Rwanda deportation scheme was central to their plan to finally grip the crisis.\n\nThey promised to pay the African country £370m over five years to deport hundreds of illegal immigrants there.\n\nSome of the cash was used to build Hope Hostel where the migrants would stay.\n\nThe building is still standing empty and could be used by another country.","summary":"DONALD Trump’s team is looking at plans to deport illegal migrants to&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/donald-trump-is-considering-the-conservative-partys-proposal-to-relocate-undocumented-immigrants-to-rwanda-following-the-abandonment-of-a-deterrent-program-by-keir-starmer/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Donald-Trump-looking-at-Tory-plan-to-send-illegal-migrants-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 01:05:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":265278992,"title":"Economists look to RBA minutes for clue on future rates","text":"Attention will turn to the Reserve Bank of Australia with the minutes from its last board meeting due as well as speeches by senior officials.\n\nThe central bank's opinion of Thursday's job figures will be of particular interest, with the October numbers a mixed bag.\n\nWhile job creation underwhelmed, it was the first weaker figure after a long run of surprisingly strong employment growth.\n\nThat lower number was accompanied by a step down in the participation rate -

This rate is lower than the U.S.' 2.1 percent for 2023 and 2024.\n\n“Tax regulations have been dragging down Korean businesses and they may lag further behind their U.S. peers when the U.S. corporate tax is reduced under a second Trump administration,” a senior official at a business lobby group said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official pointed out that the Yoon Suk Yeol administration initially proposed to slash maximum corporate income tax rates from 25 percent to 22 percent in its 2022 tax reform plan.\n\nThe plan, however, faced protests from opposition parties, who argued that the proposed tax cut would “only benefit wealthy enterprises.” Accordingly, the rate was reduced by just 1 percentage point to 24 percent, which exceeds the OECD average of 22 percent.\n\nThe official cited regulatory barriers as one of the reasons behind Korea’s lagging corporate innovation compared to the U.S., citing examples of the Kosdaq in Seoul and Nasdaq in New York, where innovative and pioneering startups are listed.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, Kosdaq has lost nearly 20 percent, while Nasdaq gained more than 30 percent.\n\nAhn Dong-hyun, a Seoul National University economics professor, called for faster regulatory reform. “Clearing business hurdles is especially crucial at a time of accelerated digitalization and technological transformation,” he said.\n\nWith regard to growth potential, the professor noted that Korea lagging behind the U.S. indicates “the serious nature of Korea’s future in the return of the Trump era.”\n\nAhn said the U.S. GDP is more than 15 times larger than Korea's, noting that a larger country's growth potential is lower in general compared to smaller peers.\n\n“Against this backdrop, Trump’s tariff policy can deal a blow to Korea’s stagnant growth potential, especially considering the U.S. overtook China as Korea’s largest export destination,” he said.\n\nAhn went on to explain that Trump wants to lower the chronic U.S. trade deficit and that his plan could make Korea a target. According to the Korea International Trade Association, Korea ranked higher over the years on the list of countries where the U.S. is seeing the biggest trade deficit.\n\nKorea was ranked 14th in 2021, but climbed to ninth in 2022, eighth in 2023 and is currently sixth in the first half of 2024.","summary":"The economic gap between Korea and the United States is feared to widen under a second Donald Trump presidency, as the former&apos;s financial dynamics are affected by its tax and regulation measures, analysts said Thursday.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/korea-us-economic-gap-feared-to-widen-under-2nd-trump-presidency-283792.html","image":"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/30aa68987df840aea817645ca868f72e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 01:00:23","author":"Yi Whan","authors":["Yi Whan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":265279108,"title":"New stamp to honour Betty White","text":"AP – The United States Postal Service might have found a way to unite a nation bitterly divided after this month’s election: It’s releasing a Betty White stamp.\n\nThe beloved actor known for roles in “The Golden Girls,” “The Mary Tyler Moore Show,” “Boston Legal,” and others will be on a 2025 Forever stamp, USPS announced Friday.\n\nWhite died in late December 2021, less than three weeks before her 100th birthday.

CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright is a vocal advocate of oil and gas development, including fracking, a key pillar of Trump's quest to achieve US energy dominance in the global market. Wright has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change and could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals by the Biden administration. Wright also has criticised what he calls a top-down approach to climate by liberal and left-wing groups and said the climate movement around the world is collapsing under its own weight . Wright, who has never served in government, has written that more fossil fuel production is needed around the globe to lift people out of poverty. Consideration of Wright to head the administration's energy department won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm. Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and advisor who played a key role on energy issues in Trump's first term. Hamm helped organise an event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate USD 1 billion to Trump's campaign, with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's top lobbying group, said Wright's experience in the energy sector gives him an important perspective that will inform his leadership of the Energy Department. We look forward to working with him once confirmed to bolster American geopolitical strength by lifting DOE's pause on LNG export permits and ensuring the open access of American energy for our allies around the world, Sommers said. Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright a champion of dirty fossil fuels and said his nomination to lead the Energy Department was a disastrous mistake . The Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century, Wong said. Given the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE's core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever. The Energy Department is responsible for advancing energy, environmental and nuclear security of the US. The agency is in charge of maintaining the country's nuclear weapons, oversees 17 national research laboratories and approves natural gas exports, as well as ensuring environmental cleanup of the nation's nuclear weapons complex. It also promotes scientific and technological research. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Trump promised bold choices for his Cabinet, and Wright's nomination delivers. He's s an energy innovator who laid the foundation for America's fracking boom. After four years of America last energy policy, our country is desperate for a secretary who understands how important American energy is to our economy and our national security? Barrasso said. If confirmed, Wright will join North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Trump's choice to be interior secretary, as a key player on energy policy in a second Trump term. Wright will be a member of a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The new panel will seek to establish US energy dominance around the world, Trump said. Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that supports fossil fuels, said Wright would be an excellent choice for energy secretary. Pyle led Trump's Energy Department's transition team in 2016. Liberty is a major energy industry service provider, with a focus on technology. Wright, who grew up in Colorado, earned undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California-Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive and campaign donor, to be his next energy secretary.

Almost immediately after President-elect Donald J. Trump announced that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be his choice to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, investors in vaccine makers lost more than $8 billion in market value in one day: Thursday, November, November 14.\n\nBefore I say another word or you presume where I’m going with this, let me make this clear. My charge here is to write on several things, one of which is leadership. I do not write on finance, investments, or financial markets, but it is within my purview to comment on leadership decisions, strategies, and so on.\n\nThere is a loud and unabashedly public conversation going on about this appointment in which Kennedy’s appropriateness for the job is being called to task. Reserving my personal view, the market’s reaction – which few observers believe is over – speaks volumes.\n\nI look at it this way. The vaccine business is only a part of the pharmaceutical universe, and $8 billion is not a whole lot of the overall big picture. But there is a big picture and it’s this. The pharmaceutical business in the United States in 2023 measured approximately $714 billion, which is 2.9% of the total U.S. GDP. That’s more than significant. Any time you can shake the rafters of something that large, there are consequences and subsequent fears moving forward.\n\nWe’re not overlooking the perspective here, that the $8 billion loss was a hit to investors in vaccine makers, not the whole industry, but only a fool would say that it ends there. Given the questionable nature of this appointment, a logical – and fair – question would be: What’s next? What will be the next shoe to drop and when will it drop?\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNetflix’s Best New Movie Is A Surefire Oscar Contender\n\nMike Tyson Vs.

In his latest episode, Maher took aim at those in his party who are still looking to defend trans inclusion in women's sports. \"Stop screaming at people to get with the program and instead make a program worth getting with,\" Maher lectured. \"What good is liberalism if you don't win elections?\" Maher brought up a recent situation in Massachusetts, where Rep. Seth Moulton has received fierce backlash by those in his own party for speaking out against the left's stance on trans athletes in a New York Times article. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,\" Moulton said in the piece. After the comments were made, Moulton's campaign manager and director of his \"Serve America\" political committee Matt Chilliak reportedly stepped down from his position, according to The Boston Globe. Maher believes that Moulton would be right to let Chilliak leave amid some Democrats' thinking on trans inclusion. \"Congressman Moulton sounds reasonable to me, but his campaign manager resigned in protest, let me make this as plain as I can to the smart people, the campaign manager that resigned, yeah, let that person go. Marginalize that guy,\" Maher said. Maher even advocated that it's time \"to make too woke be a cancelable offense.\" Moulton is not alone as a Democrat in wanting to pull back on support for transgender rights, and specifically trans athlete inclusion. His stance marks a growing divide within the party that Maher has now acknowledged, as the issue became one of the party's biggest and most surprising vulnerabilities in its recent election failure. Trump and other Republicans hammered Harris and Democrat opponents on the issue in the weeks leading up to the election. In response, the Democrats had no clear consensus on a response. Multiple Democrats who signed bills in support of trans inclusion in the past had to publicly pull back on their support ahead of the election. These include Texas Rep. Colin Allred, Texas Rep. Vicente Gonzalez and Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola. TRANS VOLLEYBALL PLAYER ACCUSED OF PLAN TO HARM TEAMMATE AFTER TAKING SCHOLARSHIPS FROM FEMALE PLAYERS Meanwhile, Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown was forced to defend himself when being linked to the issue by claiming he was never in favor of allowing biological males in women's sports. Still, many on the left have been vocal about defending trans inclusion. This includes one of Maher's HBO colleagues. \"Last Week Tonight\" host John Oliver recently delivered a passionate tirade against those who have spoken out against trans inclusion in one of his episodes. Oliver criticized the Harris campaign for not being more vocal in defense of trans inclusion, and spouted unsubstantiated claims that biological male trans athletes are not at an advantage to biological females. \"The Harris campaign failed to formulate a response, especially when it's pretty easy to do,\" Oliver said. \"There are vanishingly few trans girls competing in high schools anywhere, even if there were more, trans kids like all kids vary in terms of athletic ability, and there is no evidence they pose any threat to safety or fairness.\" The Biden-Harris administration issued a sweeping rule in April that clarified that Title IX’s ban on \"sex\" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and \"pregnancy or related conditions.\" And while the administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that it would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports. Bills like the Equality Act and a Transgender Bill of Rights have been proposed and co-sponsored by Democrats, which would help enable transgender inclusion in women's sports at a national level. Meanwhile, President-elect Trump has suggested a federal ban of transgender inclusion in women's and girls sports. In June, a survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago asked respondents to weigh in on whether transgender athletes of both sexes should be permitted to participate in sports leagues that correspond to their preferred gender identity instead of their biological sex. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sixty-five percent answered that it should either be never or rarely allowed. When those polled were asked specifically about adult transgender female athletes competing on women’s sports teams, 69% opposed it. The United Nations released study findings that say nearly 900 biological females have been denied medals in sports because they were beaten out by transgender athletes. The study, titled \"Violence against women and girls in sports,\" said that more than 600 athletes did not medal in more than 400 competitions in 29 different sports, totaling over 890 medals, according to information obtained up to March 30. \"The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males,\" the report said.","summary":"HBO&apos;s Bill Maher spoke out against Democrats who are still looking to defend trans inclusion in women&apos;s sports after Rep.

It's yet another wake-up call – one that we shouldn't need – that Ireland needs to bolster its naval capabilities and deepen its maritime security partnerships in Europe,' he said.\n\nThe Royal Navy dispatched HMS Cattistock to shadow the vessel while the RAF sent a Poseidon P8 reconnaissance plane to track its movements.\n\nMeanwhile, two Typhoon fighter jets from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland followed a Russian Tupolev-142, a maritime reconnaissance aircraft known as the 'Bear-F' in NATO countries, as it flew over the North Sea on Thursday. \n\nIt was the second time in three months that Russian ships and aircraft had been detected around UK airspace and waters within a week of each other.\n\n'Our adversaries should be in no doubt of our steadfast determination and formidable ability to protect the UK,' said armed forces minister Luke Pollard.\n\n'The Royal Navy and RAF (Royal Air Force) have once again shown they stand ready to defend our country at a moment's notice and I pay tribute to the professionalism and bravery of those involved in these latest operations,' he added.\n\nThe RAF scramble to intercept the Bear-F came days after the Royal Navy was forced to shadow Russian military vessels passing through the Channel that were accompanied by the Yantar. \n\nIt was the second time in three months that Russian ships and aircraft had been detected around UK airspace and waters within a week of each other.\n\nIncidents involving Russian and Western aircraft have multiplied over the recent months against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this week, Putin's most modern frigate passed through the English Channel on its maiden long-distance voyage.\n\nThe Admiral Golovko, the newest member of Russia's Northern Fleet, is armed with hypersonic Tsirkon missiles.\n\nThese projectiles can travel some 900km at several times the speed of sound, making it almost impossible for conventional air defence systems to shoot them down.\n\nThe warship, one of 10 planned for production as part of Russia's Project 22350, left its Arctic home base in Severomorsk almost two weeks days ago and sailed through the Barents, Norwegian and North Seas before heading for the Channel.\n\nIt came as the Kremlin leader looks to exploit Donald Trump's US presidential election victory. \n\nHis return to the White House is expected to see US submarines, which for decades have patrolled the North Sea and Irish Sea to keep Russian vessels at bay, being withdrawn from next year.","summary":"The Yantar, billed by Moscow as an 'oceanographic research vessel',  was spotted on Thursday lurking near the Isle of Man.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14090489/russian-spy-ship-irish-sea-navy-vessel-escorts.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/16/14/92143251-0-image-a-66_1731768740154.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2018/06/01/5984625484562739818/1024x576_MP4_5984625484562739818.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:36:14","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol,Matt Strudwick","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol","Matt Strudwick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":265279580,"title":"'The Bear' has a mirror image: Chicago crowns lookalike winner for show's star Jeremy Allen White","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories\n\n 'We're not the bad boy': Charity pushes back on claims made by 101-year-old widow in $40M will dispute\n\n Centenarian Mary McEachern says she knew what her husband wanted when he died.

Former White House executive assistant Madeleine Westerhout, for instance, revealed details about the dynamics between Donald and his wife, Melania Trump. Her testimony offered a softer perspective on their marriage, countering the controversies that have surrounded the couple for years. Taking the stand, Westerhout described Donald and Melania’s marriage as ‘special’ and rooted in ‘mutual respect.’ She noted that despite the scandals, including allegations involving adult film star Stormy Daniels, the bond between the former President and First Lady remained unshaken.\n\nAs per She Knows, Westerhout painted a picture of a couple who navigated their relationship with humor and affection. She revealed, “He was my boss, but she was definitely the one in charge. I remember thinking their relationship was really special.” These anecdotes contrasted with the public perception of a strained relationship. Westerhout recounted small, intimate gestures that showcased the couple’s bond. She shared, “I could figure out he was on the phone with Mrs. Trump. He would say (to Mrs. Trump) Honey come over to the window (in the residence). He would say come to the window and (they would) wave to each other.”\n\nThese actions, while seemingly simple, painted a picture of a husband who valued his wife’s presence and opinion. Another incident Westerhout narrated was of Melania texting her about Donald’s late nights at work. She remarked, “She’d text me, 'It’s past dinner time, when’s my husband coming home?'” This highlighted the normalcy of their relationship amid the chaos of the presidency. Westerhout’s testimony also addressed Daniels’ allegations, which dominated headlines during Trump’s presidency, as reported by Daily Mail.\n\nDespite the public scrutiny, she claimed the scandal had no visible impact on their relationship. Melania maintained her composure, and their interactions appeared unaffected. Westerhout’s account challenges the notion of a marriage solely defined by political alliances or personal conflicts. Westerhout also opened up about her tenure in the White House. Her career ended abruptly after an off-the-record dinner where she made indiscreet comments.\n\nReflecting on her mistakes, she expressed regret and shared, “I said some things I should not have said. Ultimately, it cost me my job and I’m very regretful of my youthful indiscretion. But I’ve learned a lot from my experience and I’ve grown a lot since then.” Her book, Off the Record: My Dream Job at the White House, How I Lost It, and What I Learned, served as a testament to her journey and admiration for Donald as her boss. Westerhout described him as a supportive leader who valued her contributions, even in a male-dominated environment. “He never made me feel like I didn’t deserve that job,” she told the court, highlighting his professionalism.","summary":"The staffer shared,  “He was my boss, but she was definitely the one in charge.

A mother raising two kids on her own in Passaic County on a barkeep’s income, she saw it not just in light of her own situation but those of the people around her.\n\n“Anybody can see what’s going on, you know? The prices of everything. And me being a single mom?” she said. “I notice that when I go shopping – just like everybody else does.”\n\nAlthough Trump’s win once again reflected a deep political divide across the United States, he made inroads in surprising places. From the suburbs of New Jersey to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s New York City congressional district to reliably liberal Hawaii, Trump gained ground even as support for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, dropped off.\n\nAP VoteCast, a far-reaching survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide, found that Trump made substantial gains among Black and Latino men, younger voters, and nonwhite voters without a college degree, compared with his 2020 performance.\n\nCommon themes emerged in the AP VoteCast data. Voters were most likely to see the economy and immigration as top issues facing the country. More voters said their family’s financial situation was “falling behind,” compared with 2020. When they voted, Trump supporters were thinking about high prices for gas, groceries and other goods and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nEven in Hawaii, dominated by Democrats since the 1950s when labor unions organized sugar and pineapple plantation workers who built the state’s middle class, Republicans had commanding victories.\n\nIn West Oahu, for example, where many plantations have given way to suburban development, school teacher Julie Reyes Oda, a Republican, flipped one state House district in the heavily blue-collar, working-class town of Ewa Beach. In the district next door, state Rep. Diamond Garcia held on to a seat he turned Republican two years ago. Democrats still control supermajorities in both chambers, but the GOP’s nine House and three Senate seats are the most the party’s had in the Legislature since 2004.\n\nNewly elected Republican state Sen. Samantha DeCorte said voters in her Waianae district west of Honolulu have long been frustrated by a lack of resources for basic needs such as public safety. Residents feel like they have to look over their shoulders when they are pumping gas, DeCorte said.\n\n“They don’t want to go to the grocery store at night because they have to walk back to their car in the parking lot,” she said.\n\nEconomic concerns, including the high cost of housing, may have figured prominently in the thinking of some Hawaii voters. On an island where the median cost of a single-family home tops $1.1 million, many people, including large numbers of Native Hawaiians, have been forced to move to the continental U.S.\n\nIn New Jersey, AP VoteCast showed that Trump grew his support among nonwhite suburban voters and younger women, in addition to the demographic swings that showed up nationally. In New York, the survey showed especially large movement toward Trump among nonwhite men without a college education, although a majority of that group still supported Harris, the vice president.\n\nAbout half of New Jersey voters said Trump would better handle the economy, according to AP VoteCast, while about one-third said this about Harris, giving him a slightly bigger advantage on the issue there compared with national numbers.\n\nFew places better demonstrated Trump’s strength in traditionally blue areas than Passaic County, where Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the county in more than three decades.\n\nInterviews with voters and experts suggest Trump’s hammering on the economy influenced how people voted or whether they stayed home.\n\n“Those people taking the subway into Manhattan, they live in a very different world than those people who live in Manhattan,” said Richard F. Bensel, a political historian at Cornell University. “They live in very different worlds in terms of the pressures that they feel, challenges that they feel in life, and they don’t want to be preached to.”\n\nSebastian Giraldo, a member of the Air Force stationed in Del Rio, Texas, who was home in Queens on leave recently, said it was a “no brainer” to vote for Trump despite having supported Democrat Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n“Just the current trajectory of the United States these last four years have obviously been downhill,” he said. “I mean, for everybody, I think it’s been harder to live. The grocery shopping, buying clothes and gasoline. Just living.”\n\nRamon Ramirez-Baez, a 66-year-old writer and community activist in the Queens borough of New York, said he voted for Trump and encouraged others to do so despite being a registered Democrat who had voted for Democrats in the past four presidential elections and even ran unsuccessfully for the Legislature as a Democrat.\n\nThe native of the Dominican Republic, who came to Queens more than three decades ago, blamed Biden administration immigration policies for the explosion of prostitution, illegal brothels and unlicensed food carts that have bedeviled his neighborhood in recent years.\n\nThe White House’s position on the war in Gaza peeled away some Muslim voters in key swing states such as Michigan, and it cost them elsewhere, too.\n\nSelaedin Maksut, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in New Jersey, said he voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein over Harris, though he backed other Democrats.\n\n“It’s a protest vote,” he said. ”We’re not going to just give you our vote.”\n\nIn New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, who previously captured a House district claimed by Trump in 2020, carried Passaic County in his winning Senate race. It shows, he said in an interview, that people see local and state issues differently than national ones. He said voters have told him they appreciate his focus on “broken politics.”\n\n“If these are people who are distrusting of government, I think my message is saying, like, look I am also frustrated with how things are happening.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, like Kim, invited split-ticket voters to weigh in on social media about how they could back both Trump and her. That resonated across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where John Coiro, a patron at Murph’s and a Trump supporter, said he respected her for asking the question.\n\nTrump’s performance could force a reckoning among Democrats in places where they are accustomed to winning regularly.\n\nRalph Caputo, a former state legislator from northern New Jersey, said Trump, unlike Democrats, connected with different groups of voters. Trump was sharper, too, Caputo said, because he had been tested in the primaries, something Harris did not face because of Biden’s late withdrawal from the race in July.\n\n“Those days are over where you just put somebody up for election and think they’re going to win because they’re on a Democratic ballot,” Caputo said. “They can’t win automatically.” (AP)","summary":"TOTOWA (US), Nov 16: Patrons at Murph&#8217;s Tavern are toasting not just Donald Trump&#8217;s return to the presidency but the fact that he carried their northern New Jersey county, a longtime Democratic stronghold in the shadow of New York City.

His nominations of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of Health and Human Services slammed the brakes on the honeymoon.\n\nPerhaps Thanksgiving came early to Mar-a-Lago and a restless Trump felt the need to act presidential and pick out two turkeys to pardon.\n\nThen again, calling Gaetz and Kennedy turkeys is an insult to the real thing.\n\nNot quality cabinetry\n\nIt’s not a close call to say both men are unfit for Cabinet jobs. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing in their backgrounds that supports giving them such vast power and responsibility.\n\nIn fact, their records make overwhelming cases against them. \n\nGaetz is a quicksilver provocateur with a unique reputation in Congress for being untrustworthy, which is quite something to behold given the competition.\n\nWith his sudden resignation from Congress, he aims to head off the release of an ethics report about various allegations, including that he had sex with an underage woman at a party.\n\nGiven the stakes, chances the report remains secret are next to zero.\n\nYet now Trump, in picking him to be the attorney general, says Gaetz is qualified to be the chief law-enforcement officer of the United States.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump writes that “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.”\n\nHe’s absolutely right, and nobody knows the impact of that weaponizing more than he does. \n\nBut that’s exactly why he must put the reform mission in the hands of someone whose legal experience is long and relevant and whose character is beyond reproach.\n\nGaetz meets neither of those requirements, and so any hope of sweeping change is doomed from the start. \n\nThat’s a gift to the Merrick Garland types who have corrupted Justice by playing politics and meddling in elections.\n\nKennedy isn’t so much venal as he is a walking-talking conspiracy theorist about pretty much everything — including food, medicine, water and the air.\n\nThe fact that he occasionally makes a good point is a very low bar for a Cabinet position.\n\nAt best, he’s a gadfly more likely to do harm than make lasting reforms. \n\nMerely to give him the title of secretary would damage the agency’s credibility and allow its failures to compound.\n\nIf those were the only problems with Gaetz and Kennedy, they would be reason enough for Trump to reward both men’s campaign support with jobs lower on the pecking order.\n\nBut an even greater consideration is the collateral damage they already are inflicting on the entire administration.\n\nIn nominating them, Trump has undercut his own agenda and his other, far more qualified choices.\n\nEasy ‘gotcha’ for libs\n\nIn addition, he has given the left a wake-up call, with Dems and their media stenographers seizing a renewed line of attack against him. \n\nThey already are riding to the battle full of “Gotcha” attitudes about how the choices reflect Trump’s poor character and sinister motives, blah blah blah.\n\nThey can’t make Russia, Russia, Russia claims again, but are delighted to declare that his Cabinet choices prove voters made a mistake.\n\nAnd it’s not just the left that’s alarmed. \n\nMany Republicans, not all of them RINOs, say there is little chance Gaetz and Kennedy can be confirmed by the Senate despite a solid GOP majority.\n\nIn response, Trump has made it clear he will demand an end-run around an actual floor vote through recess appointments.\n\nNaturally, that’s kindling for the almost-cold embers that he’s an authoritarian and will govern as a dictator.\n\nNeither man is worth the price.\n\nAll of which gets to the larger damage the Gaetz and Kennedy nominations will inflict. \n\nTrump is making it harder to achieve the dramatic reforms that he wants and that are so desperately needed.\n\nAnd not only in Justice and HHS, but throughout the entire federal Leviathan. \n\nThe beast must be cut down to size and reoriented to its original purposes.\n\nIn that sense, compare the Gaetz and Kennedy nominations to some of Trump’s excellent picks.\n\nChoosing Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State has created attention on what new policies he and Trump would use to approach Europe, China and the Mideast.\n\nThe backdrop is a widely shared belief that American leadership based on peace through strength is desperately needed, and that Trump and Rubio are poised to deliver it.\n\nHis choice of Rep. Elise Stefanik to be his ambassador to the United Nations is also exhilarating. \n\nIn her brilliance and fearlessness, Stefanik could be the second coming of Jeane Kirkpatrick who, under President Ronald Reagan, deftly carved up Turtle Bay’s army of kleptocrats and socialist dead-enders.\n\nPicks worth praising\n\nSimilarly, Trump’s nomination of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for Interior secretary is raising expectations that a revitalized energy sector will fuel the economy and again make America the envy of the world.\n\nThen there’s Trump’s naming of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to a government efficiency project. \n\nI believe it’s a stroke of brilliance that will be wildly popular because it holds the promise of vast savings to taxpayers and a reduction in the federal deficit.\n\nIf so, they will restore some trust in the federal government and may even lead state and local leaders to adopt the same approach to spending and regulations.\n\nTrump’s other nominees, such as Tulsi Gabbard for director of National Intelligence and Pete Hegseth for secretary of Defense, are controversial but very defensible examples of his determination to shake up Washington.\n\nThey represent a new generation of leaders who have proven their commitment to our history and ideals and will now be able to show their character and skills on bigger stages.\n\nBy contrast, picking Gaetz has overshadowed the partisan corruption at the Department of Justice. \n\nAnd that’s not likely to change as long as he remains in play.\n\nDitto for Kennedy. HHS is a sprawling bureaucracy in need of change, but meaningful reform is a long-term project that will never get out of the starting gate with an erratic Kennedy at the helm.\n\nBoth men will waste political capital and time, neither of which Trump can afford.","summary":"All victorious politicians get a honeymoon with the public and the press that can linger for months, perhaps even for 100 days into the term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/16/opinion/matt-gatez-and-rfk-jr-are-2-cold-turkeys-who-cannot-be-in-donald-trumps-cabinet/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/adviser-dan-scavino-takes-photos-93715603-e1731800982511.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:28:23","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":265276478,"title":"Bill Maher's hilarious response to liberal women's sex strike over Trump victory","text":"Bill Maher joked that liberal women's sex strike over Donald Trump's victory is the first time, 'progressives found a way to turn something blue'.\n\nThe Real Time host said that while half the country are 'ecstatic', Democrat women are, 'among the most p****d off' about the president-elect's win.\n\nA number of liberal women have declared they are swearing off dating, sex, marriage and children in protest at the election result as part of the so-called 4B movement which originated in South Korea.\n\n'This is a big thing to any guy who voted for Trump.

His announced Cabinet choices include notable hardliners on China, such as John Ratcliffe to head the CIA, Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense and Michael Waltz as national security adviser.\n\nAfter the two leaders greeted each other and shook hands outside of the meeting room, Biden ignored question about how the two nations would address North Korea and how he would advise Xi on working with his successor while the Chinese leader similarly brushed off a question about Trump.\n\n\"The United States has recently concluded its elections,\" Xi told Biden during his opening remarks. \"China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged.\n\n\"China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences, so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-US relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,\" he added.\n\nXi said that while relations between Beijing and Washington have had their \"ups and downs\" during his and Biden's tenures, \"the two sides have also been engaged in fruitful dialogue and cooperation and the relationship has been kept stable.\"\n\nThe Chinese leader said the two nations should avoid treating each other as rivals or adversaries and forego \"vicious competition.\"\n\n\"Humanity is faced with unprecedented challenges,\" Xi said. \"Major country competition should not be the underlying logic of the times.

Kicking out illegals was the mainstay of his run for the White House and he knows people expect action on Day One. They will get it.’\n\nThe source claims Trump will immediately sign a series of executive orders, the most radical of which will be to close the border. \n\nCiting an immigration crisis, he will temporarily shut the southern border to give officials a chance to clear a huge backlog of cases. \n\nTrump claims that the Joe Biden administration allowed more than 10 million people to illegally enter the US, bringing the total number of illegal immigrants to 20 million.\n\nThere are plans to significantly increase the number of armed officers on horseback patrolling the rugged terrain close to the US’s border with Mexico. \n\nAnd, of course, construction will resume on the infamous wall running between the two countries, which was a central – if unfulfilled – plank of Trump’s immigration policy during his first term. \n\nHaving lengthened the wall to around 700 miles (of the near 2,000-mile border), work abruptly stopped when Biden came to power. Trump has vowed to complete the $8 billion job by inviting businesses to ‘sponsor’ sections.\n\n‘Step One’ of the deportation programme is to target undocumented immigrants with ties to criminal gangs. \n\nIt is dubbed ‘Operation Aurora’, after the Colorado town where members of the ruthless Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua turned apartment complexes into bases for drug dealing and prostitution.\n\nTrump plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which gives presidents the authority to detain and deport non-citizens from ‘hostile nations’ during times of war and conflict. The law was used to justify the building of Japanese internment camps during the Second World War.\n\nAccording to those familiar with Trump’s plans, he will target the 700,000 Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans he has branded ‘vicious criminals from countries that hate us’, who have been allowed to stay in the US under a Biden parole programme.\n\nAnd what if, as is highly likely, countries refuse to take back violent gang members? Trump will cut off aid and ban travellers from those countries from entering the US, even on tourist visas.\n\n‘Step Two’ is to expel more than one million people whose applications to remain in the US have been denied and who are on the deportation list.\n\nThen the round-up of the millions of remaining illegal immigrants will begin as part of ‘Step Three’. Places of work, including farms and meatpacking plants, will be subject to raids (or ‘targeted enforcement activities’) – something the American Civil Liberties Union calls ‘vile, unconstitutional and un-American’.\n\nIndividuals will be taken to ‘holding centres’ before their deportation is fast-tracked.\n\nExperts say the cost of the first two steps could be as much as $300 billion and the cost of expelling every illegal alien – something even Trump privately admits is impossible – could be as much as $1 trillion.\n\nThe MoS understands Trump is considering deploying the military and National Guard to build ‘tent cities’ on unused federal land, including property belonging to schools and prisons.\n\nHe will reintroduce the ‘Remain in Mexico’ Act, which will compel potential immigrants – mostly from Central and South America but increasingly from China and Eastern Europe – to stay on the southern side of the border while their visa applications are processed.\n\nRonald Vitiello was director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump’s first term in office. His predecessor was Tom Homan, the man now anointed by Trump as his ‘Border Czar’.\n\nMr Vitiello told the MoS: ‘We wouldn’t be contemplating removing 20 million people if they [the Democrats] didn’t let them all in. It’s a travesty we’re in this situation and it’s completely preventable.\n\n‘Enforcement is difficult, expensive and risky for frontline operatives, but very necessary.\n\n‘The ICE is going to have to find people who don’t want to be found, plan safe arrest and custody, find a place for them to stay, have due process in court, and the logistics to send them home.’ So how exactly will it work?\n\nTrump is said to be planning to merge ICE and Border Patrol – the federal law enforcement agency – into one ‘uber’ organisation of 88,000 people and will release millions in central funding to add 40,000 new agents and 8,000 extra immigration court judges to expedite expulsions.\n\nIra Mehlman, from the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), is reportedly advising the incoming Trump administration. \n\nHe said last night: ‘There are about 647,000 people with criminal records who have been allowed into the United States. Of those, 435,000 have convictions, including 13,000 murderers. Nobody’s going to miss them if they’re sent home.’\n\nBut how will authorities find those who don’t want to be found?\n\n‘It’s like finding any criminal,’ a law enforcement source told me. ‘You target their homes, the people who are financially supporting them. These people are not rocket scientists. If you put pressure on their families to give them up, nine times out of ten it works.’\n\nMehlman defended raids on businesses saying: ‘The Government will go after employers who hire illegal immigrants. They have business licences and assets. You go in there, you bust the employers for violating the laws and you send a very clear message.\n\n‘Their competitor down the street, who might be doing the same thing, might then think, ‘I don’t want to risk this,’ and will stop hiring illegal immigrants.’\n\nBut it is the rounding up of the bulk of migrants under ‘Step Three’ that will likely produce the defining images of Trump’s second term.\n\nMany of these people will have children, after being in the US for years. Pictures of families being torn apart, of children being ripped from their parents’ arms, could backfire on Trump.\n\nBut the lawyer who has been speaking to Trump’s team says: ‘What you have to remember is that President Obama deported five million people, and no one talks about that because he’s a Democrat.’\n\nIt was under Obama, he observes, that controversial chain-link fence enclosures – or cages – in deportation holding centres were first built. ‘President Trump has a professional team around him,’ says the lawyer. ‘The best of the best. They have been working on this immigration plan for years.’\n\nAnd, crucially, Trump ‘has the mandate of the people’.\n\nHe insists that the President-elect isn’t against immigration, pointing out that Trump is married to Melania, a Slovenian-American; his first wife Ivana was born in what was then Czechoslovakia; and Elon Musk, ‘his best buddy’, hails from South Africa. \n\n‘He wants to make the American Dream achievable again, but only for people who have the legal right to be here,’ he says.\n\nIntriguingly, Trump is exploring paying ‘third-party safe countries’ to take non-violent applicants while their visas are being processed. The scheme is similar to Rishi Sunak’s now abandoned Rwanda plan, in which migrants who crossed the Channel illegally were to be flown to Rwanda to seek asylum there instead.\n\nThe source said: ‘Trump isn’t a monster. He understands many asylum seekers may face death if they have to return to their country of origin. There will be safe third-party countries which will house these people at some cost to the US taxpayers. But they will be the exception, not the rule.’\n\nAlfonso Aguilar, former chief of the US Office of Citizenship under President George W. Bush, told the MoS: ‘The biggest challenge will be communicating the immigration policy to the American people before the Democrats cry that it’s a humanitarian crisis or cruel and inhumane. The Trump administration will need to show that this is a fair and just process.’\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has amassed a team of lawyers to fight deportations, while California governor Gavin Newsom says public defenders will be available to all illegal immigrants ‘to ensure they get a fair trial’.\n\nBut Trump will try to bypass existing human rights laws and introduce ‘deport now, ask questions later’ legislation, and he has the numbers to do so given his party’s control of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nFurthermore, legal challenges will ultimately end up in the Supreme Court, which is currently weighted in Trump’s favour.\n\nNo doubt the deportation plan will present a bumper payday for lawyers, but construction and transport companies will benefit, too. While the intention is to use federal housing, the military and border agents, the sheer size of the job means it is likely the Government will hire contractors to build temporary housing and provide extra planes for transportation. \n\nTellingly, within 24 hours of Trump’s decisive victory on November 6, shares in ‘private prison’ firms such as CoreCivic and Geo Group surged.\n\nMany fear Trump’s plans could severely damage the US economy, often citing the example of Florida where governor Ron DeSantis issued the country’s most stringent anti-illegal immigration orders 18 months ago.\n\nToday, farmers in the state complain they do not have enough people to pick Florida’s trademark oranges, while small business owners say they are being forced to shut down because Americans don’t want to do menial jobs.\n\nOne restaurant owner who gave his name only as ‘Charles’ said: ‘It’s tough to find people to wash dishes. American students don’t want to do this.\n\n‘If Trump gets rid of everyone doing the dirtiest jobs, then who will do them?’\n\n‘There may be shortages at first, some holes in the system,’ concedes the lawyer close to Trump. ‘But most illegal immigrants come here because they want to work, they want to create a better life for their families. All we are saying is, do it properly.’\n\nWhether businesses that rely on imported labour will see it in such simple terms remains to be seen, as does the strength of protest from the blue half of America that voted Democrat. \n\nWhat is more certain is that the success or otherwise of Trump’s plan to deport some 20 million people will determine the fate of his second term.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Sheridan","summary":"When Donald Trump is inaugurated as America&#8217;s 47th president on January 20,&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/unveiling-trumps-1-trillion-plan-for-deporting-20-million-individuals/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-So-how-WILL-Trump-deport-20-million-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:21:37","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.271},{"id":265276132,"title":"Jake Paul's cornerman goes viral over Donald Trump-inspired hat","text":"Jake Paul's cornerman goes viral over Donald Trump-inspired hat\n\nREAD MORE: Jake Paul's win over Mike Tyson is seen by 65 million households \n\nREAD MORE: Netflix fans 'cringe' over Kate Abdo's 'awful' American accent \n\nFollow DailyMail.com's presidential election live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy ALEX RASKIN\n\nPublished: 00:14 GMT, 17 November 2024 | Updated: 00:17 GMT, 17 November 2024\n\nDonald Trump did not make an appearance at Friday's Jake Paul-Mike Tyson fight, although his slogan for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F.

Scott Wiener, one of the legislature’s loudest YIMBY voices, said in an interview.\n\nTrump has offered few specific housing policy proposals and when CalMatters reached out to his campaign, it didn’t get a response. \n\nThat’s left housing experts, elected officials and observers reading the tea leaves of his public statements, moves made by his first administration and the ideas put forward by his former housing secretary, Ben Carson, in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint.\n\nIf those are any indication, a Trump presidency will likely make it harder for immigrants, including mixed-status households, and other low-income Californians to access subsidized housing. It could also complicate efforts to build affordable housing.\n\nAt the same time, experts said, Trump could help ease regulations for housing construction across the board, something sought by pro-housing officials in both parties. And some said Trump’s mentions of housing on the campaign trail, however vague, signal bipartisan agreement on the need to do something about affordability, at least when it comes to single-family homes. \n\nMany of the most important housing policy decisions take place at the state and local level, placing some constraints on Trump’s influence. Here are a few ways an incoming Trump administration could affect housing in California.\n\nMass deportations\n\nAs with most other issues affecting the country, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance blame immigrants for the housing crisis, arguing that deporting them will help free up homes for U.S. citizens. \n\nHe’s also promised to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants, who make up a tiny portion of the market, accounting for about 5,000 of the more than 4 million mortgages originated in 2023, the Urban Institute estimates.\n\nBesides the human cost to families in California, a state where nearly half of all children have at least one immigrant parent, mass deportations would mean fewer workers to build new homes, said Ben Metcalf, managing director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley.\n\n“If he’s going to go full bore on deporting everyone who’s not a citizen or green card holder, that is going to gut a construction workforce that is already aging and dwindling,” he said. \n\nPerspectives on the state’s construction worker shortage vary; Chris Hannan, president of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, said that a slowdown in office construction means there are plenty of skilled tradespeople available to build new housing. \n\nBut California’s construction industry employs more than 200,000 undocumented workers, about a quarter of the workforce, according to the Migration Policy Institute, meaning their absence would significantly disrupt the industry.\n\nIn addition, tariffs on construction materials would likely depress housing construction as companies are forced to pay extra taxes on imported products, experts said.\n\nHannan pointed to supply chain problems during the COVID-19 pandemic that drove up prices. “The costs went through the roof,” he said. “There were (residential) projects that were delayed and projects that did not move forward.”\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, the California Building Industry Association told the Sacramento Bee that tariffs enacted during the president’s first two years in office drove up the cost of the average new home by $20,000 to $30,000.\n\nTrump this year suggested he might impose 20% tariffs on imports across the board, and 60% on those from China.\n\nBusiness leaders said Trump’s unpredictability makes it difficult to plan for future tariffs. “If Trump did nothing and let the (Federal Reserve) continue lowering interest rates and didn’t enact wild tariffs, things would improve for housing construction,” said Elaina Houser, vice president of policy for the Los Angeles Business Council. But a more interventionist President Trump could lead to more instability in the housing market, she said.\n\nAssemblymember Joe Patterson says he hopes a Trump administration will keep the promise in the Republican Party’s 2024 platform to “cut unnecessary regulations that raise housing costs.” \n\nTrump could use the power of the federal purse to reward states that speed up approval of new developments, he said. \n\nRegulatory outlook\n\nA Trump administration could work with Congress to loosen HUD rules governing manufacturing of mobile homes, making more cheaper, entry-level housing available, said Alex Horowitz, housing policy initiative director for the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nIf past is prologue, low-income Californians who rely on federal housing assistance will be at risk under a second Trump administration.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, his administration floated a ban on federal housing assistance to families with any undocumented members — including those with U.S. citizen children. The rule was never implemented.\n\nProject 2025, the conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration, also envisions a thorough overhaul of the Department of Housing and Urban Development that would add time limits and increase work requirements for housing benefits, sell off land owned by public housing authorities and transfer some responsibilities to state and local governments.\n\nReducing the number of Californians eligible for federal housing vouchers could compromise new affordable housing projects because some developers rely on income from voucher-holders to make projects pencil out, said Chione Flegal, executive director of Housing California, an affordable housing advocacy group.\n\nState leaders could choose to make up some of the funding for housing vouchers, she said, or finance affordable housing projects that wouldn’t be bound by the federal rules.\n\nTrump has railed that Democrats want to “abolish the suburbs,” co-authoring a 2020 Wall Street Journal op-ed with Carson that criticized elected officials in several states, including California, for promoting higher-density housing in residential neighborhoods.\n\n“People fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home,” he said in a speech that year. “There will be no more low-income housing forced into the suburbs.”\n\nCalifornia lawmakers in recent years have taken the opposite tack, making it easier for homeowners to build ADUs in their backyards and split their lots into two. \n\nIt’s unclear, however, whether Trump would have much ability to influence zoning in California, beyond dangling federal grants as incentives. “The federal government has a limited impact on regulating housing requirements in California or any other state,” said Morgan Morales, a spokesperson for the California Building Industry Association. \n\nHelp for home buyers\n\nThe Republican platform promises ​​to “promote homeownership through tax incentives and support for first-time buyers,” help that could theoretically make a difference for California, where the median home price topped $900,000 this year.\n\nTrump has not offered any specifics. His representatives didn’t respond to requests for details.\n\nThe president-elect has said he would lower mortgage rates, something presidents don’t directly control. Mortgage rates, in fact, rose after the election on the expectation that Trump’s economic policies will fuel inflation. \n\nSome of the changes contemplated in Project 2025, such as increasing mortgage insurance premiums and decreasing lengths of federal loans, would likely make buying more expensive for first-time homebuyers. \n\nThe fact that both parties highlighted homeownership in their campaigns could provide some opportunity for collaboration on the issue at the federal level, said Adam Briones. He’s the CEO of California Community Builders, which promotes homeownership for middle-income Californians and those from historically marginalized communities. Briones said that the federal government lacks a large-scale program to build income-restricted affordable housing for homebuyers.\n\n“The one thing that still seems to unite Americans is most folks want to buy a home,” he said. “What can we do to use this general desire for American homeownership to potentially bring people together?”\n\nTrump has said he’ll open some federal land to housing construction, an idea with broad appeal that both candidates pushed on the campaign trail.\n\nHe’s suggested he would hold a contest to design and build new “Freedom Cities” on federal territory. “Trump Freedom Cities and Homes will sell like hot cakes and everyone will want to live in one!” effused Bill Pulte, a private equity CEO and real estate heir rumored to be under consideration for Trump’s Housing Secretary, this week on X.\n\nMuch of the federal land in California is inhospitable to development, housing researchers said. But a recent Terner Center report found that the U.S. Postal Service owns more than 50 sites in California that could be suitable for housing construction due to their locations in residential areas.\n\n“I would think this would be an easy win for Trump if he wants to do something visible,” said Metcalf, the center’s director. “He likes to build things, he likes building walls. So maybe he can take some federal land and build some housing.”\n\nCalMatters is a public interest journalism venture committed to explaining how California’s state Capitol works and why it matters.","summary":"Housing experts, elected officials and observers are trying to parse Donald Trump's statements to determine what is next in the housing market.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2024/11/16/californias-housing-crisis-will-trumps-presidency-make-a-difference/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Rescue.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:16:21","author":"Felicia Mello • CalMatters","authors":["Felicia Mello • CalMatters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":265275878,"title":"America election:  The audacity of being real","text":"The New York Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, won her re-election effortlessly. But there was something about the election that unsettled her. She discovered that some of the citizens who voted her, voted for Donald Trump, instead of Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, whom she endorsed for President. She has great contempt for Donald Trump because they are ideologically worlds apart. She decided to inquire from the voters why they took their decisions in that manner. The answer she got marvelled her. One of the responders quipped, “I feel Trump and you are both real.”\n\nGod himself has declared that you should either be hot or cold, and warned that if you are lukewarm, He will spue you out. American 2024 presidential election has shown that consistency matters and the adage which states that the devil you know is better than the angel you don’t know is potent. Trump said the unthinkable and did the unthinkable during his first term and during the campaign for the second term, yet Americans voted for him. \n\nDuring his first term, he refused to commit himself to the American tradition that he will concede defeat to the winner if he loses the election. Fortunately for him he won. In his campaign for re-election, he refused to commit himself to the American tradition that he will concede defeat to his opponent if he loses. He lost, and refused to concede to his opponent, Joe Biden. Instead, he alleged that the election was rigged. He wanted to rig the election himself by calling the Secretary of State of the state of Georgia to influence the election for him by changing the victory of Joe Biden to become his. He failed to achieve it and was booted out of the White House, but that was after he instigated an insurrection against the Capitol when he wanted to remain in power by force. January 6, 2024 will remain indelible in the annals of American history. It was a day when a sitting President of America decided to overthrow the democratic rule in America and thwart the peaceful transfer of power from one leader to another. Again, Trump contested for the post of the President for a third time and yet again refused to commit himself to concede defeat to his opponent in the circumstance he lost the election. Luckily for him, he won. Whatever you may say about him there appears to be some kind of consistency. \n\nLet us be very honest, Donald Trump is not an honest individual. The greatest proof of his dishonesty can easily be seen in his attitudes regarding the three elections he ran. How can a President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, who has the command over every tool of coercion in the most powerful nation on earth, be crying that an election that was conducted by his regime, under his watch, was rigged? The states in which he complained about the rigging, like Georgia, had Republican Governors running them. The Secretary of State of Georgia that he was soliciting for assistance to enable him rig the election, is a Republican, yet he was accusing the Democrats of rigging the election. It doesn’t just add up. He rejected the election he lost as rigged, but the two elections, organised under two Democratic Presidents, Barack Obama, and Joseph Biden, which he won, he accepted as free and fair. In Trump’s world, whenever he wins, it’s fair, even if it was organised by his worst enemy, but whenever he lost, it’s rigged, even if it’s organised by Trump himself. This is a classical display of insincerity. But here is the catch, Trump has this philosophy that as long as he is consistent in denying something, people will start agreeing with him on his line of lies. Many Americans today believe that Trump was rigged out in 2020 presidential election simply because Trump was consistent in describing the election as rigged. Trump has gained the respect of people all over the world for being consistently dishonest and it’s now counted for him for strength because he was being himself. \n\nLet us compare Trump with his democratic opponents. When Joe Biden was campaigning in 2020, he hinted that his sole aim was to stop Trump from winning a second term and pass the torch to a younger generation. He reneged on this promise and decided to run again in 2024 despite his declining mental acuity. He was booted out after his worst debate performance in his political history, by which time, Donald Trump had eaten the hearts of most Americans. It’s the belief of most Democrats that had Biden honoured his pledge to pass the torch to a younger generation on time, the outcome would have been different. Inconsistency is hardly a good strategy to win election. \n\nIn the dealings with Israel, Trump was unapologetically pro Israel. In his first term, he denied the Palestinians the aid that came from the United States of America. He recognised the entire Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He supported the annexation of the Golan heights, originally owned by Syria, but occupied by Israel, after the Israeli-Arab wars to become part of Israel. He surprisingly still made peace between Israel and about three Arab countries which exchanged Ambassadors with Israel. Throughout his four years in power, Israel did not engage in war with any of its Arab neighbours. \n\nJoe Biden came into power with the promise to guarantee the security of Israel and friendship with the Palestinians. At the edge of his breakthrough to normalise Israeli relationship with more Arab neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, Hamas struck on October 7, 2024 and killed more than 1,200 Israelis in Israel. This act automatically severed the proposed Israeli restoration of diplomatic relations with their Arab neighbours, and resulted in a bitter war between Hamas and Israel. \n\nEvery advice Joe Biden gave to Israel on how to prosecute the war to ensure reduction in casualties was largely ignored by Israel. Biden advised against Israel entering Rafah in Gaza because of the densely populated nature of the place. He believed any assault in Rafah will result in too many casualties against civilians. Biden threatened sanctions against Israel in the event of any disobedience to this advice. This advice was largely ignored by Israel and Rafah was stormed resulting in large casualties, which even led to the death of Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas, Biden didn’t do anything to stop Israel. When Israel decimated Gaza to a certain level, it faced Hezbollah squarely in Lebanon and even killed Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. Biden did nothing to stop Israel. Rather, when Iran threatened to strike Israel to revenge the death of Nasrallah, Biden speedily sent iron domes defence system to shield Israel. \n\nAmerica under Biden has been touting cease fire between Hamas and Israel from October 7 when the war started till today without any meaningful progress. It was even ridiculous that Vice President Kamala Harris used the issue of getting a cease fire between Israel and Hamas as a campaign strategy. This was the same Kamala Harris that confessed that she wouldn’t do anything different from Biden if elected to replace Biden. The question Americans asked her was, if you and Biden couldn’t do anything for more than one year to achieve cease fire, what other magic wand do you have? She embarked on different adverts to different audience. When campaigning to the Jews she will maintain that America’s support for Israel is ironclad. She is even married to a Jew. When facing the Arabs she will affirm her support to them, repudiating the number of casualties among the Palestinians as unacceptable and promising to bring about a cease fire immediately after being elected. Both sides lost faith in the Democrats and Trump performed better in both the Jewish and the Arab populated areas. The Arabs knew their fate in Trump but preferred that he enters and stops the war by any means rather than being ambivalent as the Democrats. Inconsistency results in lack of trust by all parties. Democrats were not real in their dealings with both Israel and the Palestinians and couldn’t eat their cakes and have them. Trump chose a side and supported Israel completely and reaped the respect and honour that followed being authentic and real.\n\nTrump clearly stated that he doesn’t believe in climate change and will support drilling of more crude oil from America. Joe Biden promised to end it with the support of Harris. When the price of fuel (gas) climbed in America, they changed their mind and decided to start drilling oil again. Harris joined the list of later day drillers of oil. Both sides rejected them because they belonged to everybody and belonged to nobody at the same time. \n\nBiden and Harris couldn’t solve the immigration problem because they wanted to be good to the immigrants and be good to the citizens. They reversed most Trump policies on immigration on assumption of office, only to come back to accept all of Trump’s policies as election was getting closer. They even made a bill to approve all Trump’s policies and Trump asked his members in the Congress to kill it and they did. Eventually the Democrats lost the presidential election on the premise of the economy, and immigration, but principally on the premise of not being real in their dealings with America. It pays to take a firm stand on any issue and be consistent with your position, even if your position is not perfect. Sitting on the fence makes you to lose both sides. If you have the right not to commit yourself to any side of the fence, then both sides have a duty to disown you as not their own.","summary":"The New York Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, won her re-election effortlessly.

He is expected to support Trump’s plan to maximise the production of oil and gas and to seek ways to boost the generation of electricity, demand for which is rising for the first time in decades.\n\nHe is also likely to share Trump’s opposition to global cooperation in fighting climate change. Wright has called climate change activists alarmist and has likened efforts by Democrats to combat global warming to Soviet-style communism.\n\n“There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either,” Wright said in a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year.\n\nWright, who does not have any political experience, has written extensively on the need for more fossil fuel production to lift people out of poverty.\n\nHe has stood out among oil and gas executives for his freewheeling style and describes himself as a tech nerd.\n\nWright made a media splash in 2019 when he drank fracking fluid on camera to demonstrate it was not dangerous.\n\nUS oil output hit the highest level any country has ever produced under President Joe Biden, and it is uncertain how

Energy handles US energy diplomacy, administers the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – which Trump has said he wants to replenish – and runs grant and loan programs to advance energy technologies, such as the Loan Programs Office.\n\nThe Secretary also oversees the aging US nuclear weapons complex, nuclear energy waste disposal, and 17 national labs.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Wright will replace

in permitting electricity transmission and the expansion of nuclear power, an energy source that is popular with both Republicans and Democrats but which is expensive and complicated to permit.\n\nPower demand in the US is surging for the first time in two decades amid growth in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and cryptocurrencies.","summary":"Washington, Nov 17 (IANS) US

Fetterman Chief of Staff","text":"A former Democratic Senate staffer urged his party to change its approach to politics and adopt \"supermajority thinking\" to make a comeback against Republicans in upcoming elections.President-elect Donald Trump will start his second administration with the added support of Republican control in the House and Senate, even as the House majority remains at a thin majority.Adam Jentleson, who served as Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman's chief of staff and Nevada Senator Harry Reid's deputy chief of staff argued in a New York Times op-ed that the Democrats need to change their thinking if they hope to take the right lessons from the 2024 election.For Jentleson, Trump achieved \"an electoral realignment\" that resulted from his overperformance with Black, Hispanic and working-class voters relative to what polling and past performances had indicated would happen.Newsweek reached out to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) by email on Saturday evening for comment.\"Supermajority thinking is urgently needed at this moment,\" Jentleson wrote. \"We have been conditioned to think of our era of polarization as a stable arrangement of rough parity between the parties that will last indefinitely, but history teaches us that such periods usually give way to electoral realignments.\"\"Last week, Mr. Trump showed us what a conservative realignment can look like,\" he continued. \"Unless Democrats want to be consigned to minority status and be locked out of the Senate for the foreseeable future, they need to counter by building a supermajority of their own.\"Jentleson chided critics for scoffing at Trump's campaigning throughout New York, including rallies in the Bronx and Long Island as well as the now-famous Madison Square Garden rally.\"As a strategic matter, asking the question 'What would it take for a Republican to win New York?' leads to the answer, 'It would take overperforming with Black, Hispanic and working-class voters',\" even as it remained clear that Trump would not win New York State.Jentleson suggested the Democrats look at a similarly ambitious goal, such as winning back the 365 electoral votes President Barack Obama won in 2008, and figuring out what it would take actually achieve it.Part of that, according to him, would mean abandoning the \"fetish for putting coalition management over a real desire for power.\"\"Whereas Mr. Trump has crafted an image as a different kind of Republican by routinely making claims that break with the party line ... Democrats remain stuck trying to please all of their interest groups while watching voters of all races desert them over the very stances that these groups impose on the party,\" he wrote.Jentleson also took a shot at the \"liberal and progressive interest groups that prevent Democrats from thinking clearly about how to win,\" arguing that it leads to the intellectualization of politics gives rise to the sense of a college-educated elite and places \"a hard ceiling on Democrats' appeal ... fatally wounding them in the places they need to win.\"This would mean ignoring a Left-Wing \"purity test,\" which has remained a significant topic of discussion between centrist and more far-left Democrats. The \"purity test\" requires a candidate to comply with almost all of a voter's desired positions or get no support.Republicans similarly argued about the \"purity test\" for their candidates, even toying with the idea of imposing an actual purity test on potential candidates after Obama's landslide victory: \"Comply with eight of the party's 10 \"Reaganite\" principles, the thinking went, and you're worthy of funding. Fall short, and you might as well be Leon Trotsky,\" Newsweek wrote in 2016.The same thinking applied to Democrats led to many voting for Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein or refusing to vote at all if it meant voting for Vice President Kamala Harris, potentially handing Trump victory in several areas that led to his win.Democrats need to start prioritizing winning over appeasing, according to Jentleson, which he understands \"will make the groups mad, and that's OK – in fact, it will be good for them.\"\"The 2026 midterms will offer an opportunity for Democrats to make major gains in the House and the Senate,\" Jentlson argued. \"Mr. Trump is likely to be an unpopular president, and congressional Republicans consistently undermine their own advantages in pursuit of tax cuts for the wealthy.\"\"One way to do this is for Democrats to stop filling out interest group questionnaires and using their websites to placate them by listing positions on every issue under the sun,\" he wrote later in his piece. \"This is where opponents go to mine for oppo, as they did for Ms. Harris.\"\"Democrats should seek out issues that demonstrate their willingness to fight for their constituents and break with progressive orthodoxy,\" he said. \"The emerging concept known as supply-side progressivism offers a good guide, embracing limited deregulation that advances liberal policy goals.\"\"Those who would rather lose elections so that they can feel better about themselves leave the real suffering to the people they claim to fight for,\" he concluded. \"No one wins when we lose. It is time to start winning again.\"","summary":"A former Democratic Senate staffer has blasted the way the party has operated and argued for the best path forward after Donald Trump's victory.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-need-supermajority-mentality-1986968","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2522791/nancy-pelosi-hakeem-jefferies-trump.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:10:37","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":265275588,"title":"Trump picks Liberty Energy CEO and Oklo board member Chris Wright as Energy secretary","text":"President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday selected Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright to serve as the next energy secretary of the United States.\n\nLiberty Energy is an oilfield services company headquartered in Denver with a $2.7 billion market capitalization.

Mr. Biden was expected to urge Xi to dissuade North Korea from further deepening its support for Russia’s war on Ukraine. It marked their first in-person meeting since they met in Northern California last November. \n\nWithout mentioning Trump’s name, Xi appeared to signal his concern that the incoming president’s protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail could send the U.S.-China relationship into another valley.\n\n“China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said through an interpreter.\n\nMr. Biden, meanwhile, spoke in broader brushstrokes about where the relationship has gone and reflected not just on the past four years, but on their long relationship.\n\n“Over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have experienced ups and downs, but with the two of us at the helm, we have also engaged in fruitful dialogues and cooperation, and generally achieved stability,” he said.\n\nMr. Biden and Xi, with top aides surrounding them, gathered around a long rectangle of tables in an expansive conference room at Lima’s Defines Hotel and Conference Center.\n\nThere’s much uncertainty about what lies ahead in the U.S.-China relationship under Trump, who campaigned promising to levy 60% tariffs on Chinese imports. \n\nBobby Djavaheri, president of Los Angeles-based Yedi Houseware Appliances — which manufactures its products in China — told CBS News in an interview this week that such tariffs “would decimate our business, but not only our business. It would decimate all small businesses that rely on importing.”\n\nTrump has also proposed revoking China’s Most Favored Nation trade status, phasing out all imports of essential goods from China and banning China from buying U.S. farmland.\n\nAlready, many American companies, including Nike and eyewear retailer Warby Parker, have been diversifying their sourcing away from China. Shoe brand Steve Madden says it plans to cut imports from China by as much as 45% next year.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden administration officials will advise the Trump team that managing the intense competition with Beijing will likely be the most significant foreign policy challenge they will face.\n\nIt’s a big moment for Mr. Biden as he wraps up more than 50 years in politics. He saw his relationship with Xi as among the most consequential on the international stage and put much effort into cultivating that relationship.\n\nMr. Biden and Xi first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both have said left a lasting impression.\n\n“For over a decade, you and I have spent many hours together, both here and in China and in between. And I think we’ve spent a long time dealing with these issues,” Mr. Biden said Saturday.\n\nBut the last four years have presented a steady stream of difficult moments.\n\nThe FBI this week offered new details of a federal investigation into Chinese government efforts to hack into U.S. telecommunications networks. The initial findings have revealed a “broad and significant” cyberespionage campaign aimed at stealing information from Americans who work in government and politics.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials also have assessed China has surged sales to Russia of machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that Moscow is using to produce missiles, tanks, aircraft and other weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine.\n\nAnd tensions flared last year after Mr. Biden ordered the shooting down of a Chinese spy balloon that traversed the United States.","summary":"In their final meeting, China&#8217;s leader Xi Jinping told President Biden that his nation was &#8220;ready to work with a new administration,&#8221; as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take over.

True, bereft of funding, Ukraine could lose ground completely,” Kuleba wrote in an op-ed published in the Economist newspaper on Wednesday.\n\nHe argued that Ukraine could plunge into a civil conflict if the US forces it to sign a bad peace deal.\n\n“If the Trump administration then imposed unpalatable peace terms on Ukraine, and if Mr Zelensky agreed (an unlikely scenario), part of Ukrainian society would resist.

The clip, originally aired during a 2010 episode of Larry King Live, captures a candid moment with Donald, Melania Trump, and four-year-old Barron. In the video, the former president lays out expectations for Barron as he prepares to leave for preschool.\n\n“I want all A’s,” Donald said. “And when you get older, no drugs. No alcohol. No cigarettes. And, you know what else? No tattoos. I don’t ever want to see tattoos on you.” Barron then interacts with his mother Melania, who told him he would have lunch before heading to school. He sees his father again, carrying a small briefcase, as Donald remarks that he’s off to learn “reading, writing, and arithmetic.”\n\nThe clip also drew attention because of Barron’s heavy Slovenian accent— a reflection of what he adopted from his mother. Melania, originally from Slovenia, emigrated to the United States in 1996. Many commended the First Lady for choosing to care for Barron herself rather than relying on a nanny, a common choice among wealthy parents, according to Your Tango.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Donald's strict message to a young Barron aligns with his long-standing stance on abstaining from alcohol, a decision shaped by the tragic loss of his brother, Fred Trump Jr. Donald has often spoken openly about Fred Jr.'s death, expressing regret over pressuring his brother during their younger years for choosing to leave the family real estate business. Donald admitted he was 'too young' at the time and now wishes he had said, \"You've got to do what you love.\"\n\n\"I've known so many people that were so strong and so powerful (yet) they were unable to stop drinking,\" he said. In 2018, Donald reiterated that he had never done drugs, adding to his claim that he had \"never had a beer\" either in his youth or adulthood. When asked by a reporter about Brett Kavanaugh's heavy underage drinking, Donald said, \"I don’t drink. I’ve never had a drink. I don’t drink beer. I’ve never had a beer. And I’m not saying good or bad, some people like it. I just chose not to do that for a lot of reasons.\"\n\nNow 18 years old, Barron attends NYU Stern School of Business. Recent reports have highlighted his influence on his father’s political activities. Barron is said to have encouraged his father to participate in podcasts hosted by Joe Rogan and Adin Ross to engage younger voters. He is also credited with influencing Donald's decision to launch a cryptocurrency initiative. During the 2024 presidential election, Melania shared an image of Barron casting his first vote. The photo showed him at a polling booth, which she captioned, “Voted for the first time – for his dad.”","summary":"A resurfaced video from 2010 featuring young Barron with his father shows his firm expectations from his son.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/resurfaced-clip-of-donald-giving-4-year-old-barron-a-firm-warning-reveals-his-parenting-style","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/724797/uploads/cf764950-a41c-11ef-adae-3b828ccdec71_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-17 00:00:19","author":"INQUISITR,Prachi Mallick","authors":["INQUISITR","Prachi Mallick"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.327},{"id":265275268,"title":"Donald Trump to return to MSG weeks after controversial rally for UFC 309 – reports","text":"Donald Trump will reportedly return to Madison Square Garden on Saturday, attending UFC 309 with Dana White – president of the mixed martial arts promotion.\n\nTrump has attended numerous UFC events with White, who spoke at the president-elect’s victory celebration earlier this month in Mar-a-Lago.

Steve Leigh, of the professional services company Aon, estimates that a small firm with ten employees each earning £35,000 a year will face a £9,200 rise in its NI bill, though other calculations are lower.\n\nAccording to tax advice firm Blick Rothenberg, the total annual NI bill for employing such a worker will rise by 25 per cent.\n\nAamer Younis, manager of Henry Taylor Tools in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, is one of many toolmakers who will have to pay extra NI contributions.\n\nHenry Taylor Tools has been making handcrafted woodworking pieces using local Sheffield steel – everything from chisels to wood turning gouges – since 1834. But now, Mr Younis, who manages a 13-strong team of craftsmen, is deeply worried about how such a proud heritage might count for nothing in the fight to survive.\n\nHe says: ‘If the Prime Minister’s father was a toolmaker, why is he not supporting us? We consider ourselves the Rolls-Royce of woodturning and wood carving tools, but this Government seems hell-bent on forcing extra tax burdens on our industry – while allowing foreign competitors to escape this unnecessary tax cash grab.’\n\nMeanwhile, the NI threshold for employers has fallen from £9,100 to £5,000 a year – meaning that employers start paying NI on an employee’s salary at a lower level. However, the Government says it will support smaller firms who have an NI bill of under £100,000 by raising their employment allowance from £5,000 to £10,500. Around 865,000 employers are set to benefit – but Henry Taylor Tools is not one of them.\n\nRobert Salter, a tax expert at Blick Rothenberg, says that despite only employing 13 staff, the Sheffield firm’s increased NI bill from April will cost at least an extra £2,000 a year.\n\nMr Younis says: ‘We are being squeezed by taxes every which way we turn – and this latest National Insurance contribution hike for businesses is only going to make it even more of a struggle to stay alive.\n\n‘We cannot compete on price with cheap inferior tools made in China – and this hike will simply force prices up and make life harder for everyone.’\n\nHe adds: ‘We want the Government to support our call to buy British – not open the door to poor quality copies by foreign manufacturers that can fall apart in a couple of years rather than last a lifetime. We have two furnaces manned by three forgers with 30 years each of experience and skill.\n\n‘It breaks my heart that industries like ours could be forced out of business with increased taxes and no support.\n\n‘Why does Starmer not realise that knowledge passed down over many generations is priceless? Once firms such as ours are gone, the skills will be lost forever.\n\n‘Starmer lives in an elite Westminster bubble far removed from the grimy reality of doing real work making tools. Did he learn nothing from his dad about our proud industry?’\n\nAmanda Coffman, commercial manager of the Thor Hammer Company in Shirley, West Midlands, worries that the NI increase will hamper her firm’s ability to invest in new machinery and its workforce.\n\n‘The increase harms prospects not just for ourselves, but the firms we work with, and also the whole British economy,’ she says.\n\nHer 101-year-old, family-owned business relies on exports for about half of its trade – with the US its biggest market.\n\nIt employs three dozen staff to handmake top quality hammers, mallets and mauls for more than 50 countries. She says: ‘Foreign firms appreciate the quality of our tools but we need the Government to fight our corner because lower labour costs abroad mean we fight on an uneven playing field.\n\n‘Our relationship with America will be especially important and Labour does us no favours with its recent criticism of Donald Trump and sending its staff members to campaign against him.\n\n‘The Labour Government does not realise trade agreements are vital for business. If it lets us down, we face a desperately uncertain future.’\n\nMs Coffman adds that a typical toolmaker earns about £28,000 a year. Tax expert Salter says that based on this figure, Thor Hammer will be £14,869 a year out of pocket due to Reeves’ NI contribution rise.\n\nThe secret of the company’s success goes back to the Second World War when the RAF and Army used its tools to make and repair aircraft and tanks. This gave it an international reputation.\n\nKatie Ellis is a director of the family toolmaking business Thomas Flinn & Co of Sheffield in South Yorkshire. She says: ‘We have heard an awful lot from Keir Starmer bragging about how he comes from working class stock – with his father a toolmaker and mother a nurse. But the way our industry is so badly treated, I get the feeling he has never got his hands dirty making tools.\n\n‘Rather than taxing us out of existence, we want the Government to recognise toolmaking as people did when we began a century ago – the backbone of the manufacturing industry.\n\n‘I am part of a third-generation, family-run business and we need people to be encouraged to roll up their sleeves and enjoy the reward of an honest day’s work.\n\n‘It is a big challenge attracting younger people to learn our fabulous trade. We found our last apprentice a year ago on Instagram where he was showing how he was making guitars.\n\n‘Why can’t the Government invest in apprenticeship schemes to get more people like him to realise toolmaking is such a rewarding trade? Instead, it clobbers us with an NI bill that is a disincentive to grow into a bigger company.’\n\nTax expert Salter says that, despite being a small company, Thomas Flinn’s extra NI bill will be £1,300.\n\nMs Ellis adds: ‘There is nothing old-fashioned about the toolmaking industry but it needs Government backing – not just more taxes to fund the public sector.\n\n‘If we are to keep going and succeed in the future, we desperately need Government support. Starmer, as the son of a toolmaker, seems to have forgotten us.’","summary":"Although Rodney Starmer died in 2018, toolmakers like him remain part of the backbone of this country's engineering industry and are furious about the way their livelihoods are now threatened by tax rises.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14091673/Keir-Starmer-dad-toolmaker-tax-Craftsmen-Labour-Budget.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/16/23/92153743-0-image-a-98_1731800128238.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-16 23:52:31","author":"Editor,Toby Walne","authors":["Editor","Toby Walne"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":265278680,"title":"US-China ties ‘unchanged” following Trump’s election, says Xi in meet with Biden in Peru","text":"Lima, Nov 17 (IANS) Chinese President Xi Jinping told his American counterpart President Joe Biden that the US-China relationship would remain “unchanged” following the election of Donald Trump.\n\n“China’s goal of a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged,” Xi told Biden during the opening remarks of their final meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru.\n\n“China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation, and manage differences, to strive for a steady transition of the China-US relationship for the benefit of the two peoples,” Xi said.\n\nWhen it was Biden’s turn to speak, he hailed the long partnership with Xi and acknowledged they hadn’t always agreed. But he said they were frank and candid in their communications, which he called “vital”. He said open communication prevented miscommunication and prevented the countries from veering into conflict.\n\nWhat happens between the US and China will impact everyone in the world, Biden said, making it their responsibility to get along.\n\nBiden told Xi that the two leaders haven’t always agreed but their discussions have been “frank” and “candid”.\n\nThe talks come two months before Trump assumes office. He has vowed to adopt blanket 60 per cent tariffs on US imports of Chinese goods as part of a package of “America First” trade measures. Beijing opposes those steps. The US President-elect also plans to hire several hawkish voices on China in senior roles, including US Senator Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Representative Mike Waltz as national security adviser.\n\nBiden has aimed to lower tensions with China, but Washington is incensed by a recent China-linked hack of the telephone communications of the US government and presidential campaign officials, and it is anxious about increasing pressure by Beijing on Taiwan and Chinese support for Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan’s former Economy Minister Lin Hsin-i met Biden at the summit on Friday and invited him to visit Taiwan in the near future.\n\nChina views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. The US is Taiwan’s most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic recognition.\n\nBiden also wants China’s help with North Korea, whose deepening ties with Russia and deployment of troops in the war with Ukraine has worried Washington.\n\nAt the same time, Beijing’s economy is taking a stiff hit from Biden’s steps on trade, including a plan to restrict US investment in Chinese artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and semiconductors and export restrictions on high-end computer chips. All of those topics are expected to figure into the talks, US officials said.\n\nChina routinely denies US hacking allegations, regards Taiwan as an internal matter, and has protested American statements on China-Russia trade. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington declined to comment.\n\n“When the two countries treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, our relationship would make considerable progress,” Xi said as he met with Biden.\n\n“But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan described the transition as “a time when competitors and adversaries can see possibly opportunity”.\n\nBiden is stressing with Xi the “need to maintain stability, clarity, predictability through this transition between the US and China”.\n\nPacific Rim leaders gathered at the APEC summit are assessing the implications of Trump’s return to power as US President on January 20. The South American summit offers new signs of the challenges to the United States’ power in its own backyard, where China is on a charm offensive.\n\nXi, who arrived in Lima on Thursday, plans a week-long diplomatic blitz in Latin America that includes a refurbished free-trade agreement with Peru, inaugurating the massive Chancay deep-water port there and being welcomed in Brazil’s capital next week for a state visit.
