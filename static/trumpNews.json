He responded with a sincere defense of her. “Laura has been a supporter of mine. Just like a lot of people are supporters, and she’s been a supporter of mine,” shared Trump in comments to the press. “She speaks very positively of the campaign. I’m not sure why you asked that question.” However, the former president also noted that he wasn’t in control of her. “I don’t control Laura. Laura — she’s a, she’s a free spirit. Well, I don’t know. I mean, look, I can’t tell Laura what to do,” he added. Loomer, whose feed on X, formerly known as Twitter, is full of pro-Trump tweets, returned that favor on September 15 by supporting Trump’s takedown of Taylor Swift, who recently endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Taking to Truth Social, Trump wrote, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” in all caps, proving that he’s been triggered by her latest snub (Trump seemed desperate to keep Swifties on his side before). On X, Loomer reposted a screenshot of Trump’s tweet, alerting of followers of his dig. “President Trump just posted, ‘I hate Taylor Swift,'” she wrote, garnering thousands of likes.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Mario Tama/Getty Images Laura Loomer, a far-right activist known for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Increasingly Strange Connection Between Donald Trump and Laura Loomer first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/the-increasingly-strange-connection-between-donald-trump-and-laura-loomer/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/donald-trumps-relationship-with-laura-loomer-just-keeps-getting-weirder/intro-1726431437.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-16 00:13:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":256484030,"title":"Reckless rhetoric from Dems and media to blame for second Trump assassination attempt","text":"Donald Trump was targeted Sunday in a second apparent assassination attempt in as many months. An eagle-eyed Secret Service agent reportedly spotted the barrel of a gun in bushes a few hundred yards from where the former president was playing golf and shot at the would-be assassin, who was later arrested. It’s a frightening development that highlights the recklessness of the hateful rhetoric constantly aimed at Trump by his political opponents, even after he was shot at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Last week Kamala Harris falsely accused Trump of calling Nazis “fine people”, promising a “bloodbath,” and being responsible for “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.” She and Biden and surrogates constantly exaggerate the J6 Capitol riot and use it to frame Trump as a “threat to democracy.” Joe Biden has labeled Trump and “MAGA Republicans” as “semi-fascists” and domestic terrorists. Tim Walz called Trump a “fascist” and “threat to Democracy” who will “put people’s lives in danger.” On Saturday Democratic Senator Chris Murphy described Trump as “a candidate explicitly running on the promise of political violence.” In Orwellian fashion they accuse Trump and his supporters of stoking violence, when the evidence is almost all the other way. Conveniently, whenever Democrats are feeling the heat on a damaging issue, there are always bomb threats or phony-looking racist leaflets to distract the media and get maximum publicity. In Springfield, Ohio, where Trump’s “They’re eating the pets” riff and a thousand memes focused attention on the plight of locals overwhelmed by a sudden 30 percent increase in their population due to thousands of Haitian migrants ushered in by “Border Tsar” Harris and Biden. Having ignored the border crisis for three years, the media is now demonizing long-suffering Springfield citizens and portraying anyone who highlights their plight as a violent bigot. CNN host Dana Bash even accused Trump’s running mate JD Vance on Sunday of “causing the hospitals, the schools, the government buildings to be evacuated because of bomb threats” in Springfield. What will it take for these demented partisans to lower the temperature?","summary":"The assassination plot on Donald Trump is a frightening development that highlights the recklessness of the hateful rhetoric constantly aimed at Trump by his political opponents, even after he was shot in July.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/opinion/reckless-rhetoric-from-dems-and-media-to-blame-for-second-trump-assassination-attempt/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-atllu5dja-1726444178375.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726429862&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yVC96c51-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-16 00:08:58","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.512},{"id":256483774,"title":"Trump safe after &quot;attempted assassination&quot; on Florida golf course","text":"Former U.S. President Donald Trump is safe after an apparent assassination attempt in Florida on Sunday, reports said, with the incident coming two months after the Republican presidential nominee was lightly injured in a shooting at a campaign rally. Trump's campaign office said gunshots were fired near Trump when he was playing golf. The Secret Service said agents opened fire on a person who was on the perimeter of the premises before 2 p.m. The Associated Press said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation believes Trump was the subject of another \"attempted assassination\" and that the agents fired at a man who was pointing a rifle with a scope as Trump was on the course. Authorities detained \"a person of interest\" in connection with the incident and seized a rifle, according to the reports. Trump said in a message to his supporters, \"I am safe and well, and no one was hurt.\" Local investigators in Florida said the suspect was some 370 to 460 meters from Trump when agents fired. The White House said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival in the presidential election, are relieved to hear Trump is safe. On July 13, Trump was injured in the right ear in a shooting incident during the campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

The suspect fled the scene in an SUV that was later stopped on Interstate 95 in Martin County, where the suspect was arrested, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said. Trump was whisked away from the golf course and was not injured. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said it was notified of shots fired at about 1:30 p.m. Deputies located a witness who took a photograph of the suspect’s vehicle and license plate, and the Martin County Sheriff’s Office spotted the vehicle on Interstate 95. Investigators found an AK-style rifle with a scope, two backpacks containing ceramic tile, and a GoPro camera hanging from a fence at Trump’s golf club. Bradshaw said a Secret Service agent walking the course about a hole ahead of the ex-president spotted the rifle sticking out of the fence and immediately opened fire with four to six rounds. The suspect was several hundred yards from the ex-president. Palm Beach County State’s Attorney Dave Aronberg said his office was working on warrants for the suspect’s arrest and that federal charges were also likely. Investigators did not speculate on a motive for the potential gunman and did not know if the suspect got off a shot before he fled. The FBI said that it appeared to be a possible assassination attempt, according to The Associated Press. Several news outlets named the suspect as 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, a Secret Service agent in the US fired shots&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Secret Service Prevents Alleged Assassination Attempt on Former President Trump at His Florida Golf Course first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/secret-service-prevents-alleged-assassination-attempt-on-former-president-trump-at-his-florida-golf-course/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Secret-Service-Foils-‘Apparent-Assassination-Attempt-on-Ex-President-Trump-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:56:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.7},{"id":256483656,"title":"Scooter Braun Fires Back At Donald Trump After Taylor Swift Diss","text":"Scooter Braun came to Taylor Swift's defense by responding to former president Donald Trump's recent comments about the pop star.After Trump declared on his social media platform Truth Social that he \"HATES TAYLOR SWIFT!\" on Sunday, September 15, Braun took to his Instagram Stories to post a screenshot of Trump's message, adding his own counterpoint: \"Shake it off Donald.\"The 43-year-old music producer, known for his controversial acquisition of Swift's masters, also expressed his political preference by endorsing Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential election with the message \"Kamala 2024.\"Trump's comments came in response to Swift, 34, publicly supporting Harris after the 2024 presidential debate on Tuesday, September 10. The 14-time Grammy winner had praised Harris' running mate, Tim Waltz, for his long standing advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and women's reproductive rights in her public endorsement on Instagram. Swift also addressed concerns about misinformation, criticizing a fake AI-generated image that falsely showed her endorsing Trump earlier in the month.In his response to Swift's support for Harris, Trump dismissed her influence, saying he prefers Brittany Mahomes, whom he described as \"beautiful\" and a \"big Trump fan,\" over the pop star. Trump had previously praised Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, for her defense of him on an interview on Fox & Friends, saying, \"Well, I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth.

Routh, 58 is in custody after the terrifying incident at Trump International Club almost exactly two months after a separate assassination attempt against Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The suspect was found unarmed, as a backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 style rifle that a gunman left behind when fleeing the scene have already been located. Martin County Sherriff William D. Snyder said Routh ‘was not displaying a lot of emotions’ when police arrested him. Snyder added that the suspected shooter was ‘relatively calm’ and ‘never asked’ why he was being detained. The car Routh was found in will be taken into FBI custody for further investigation, according to authorities. ‘I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they’re looking for in Palm Beach County,’ Snyder said. Officials said U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of the bushes two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing on Sunday, prompting the agents to fire at the suspect. The individual ran into his vehicle from the trees, but was spotted by a witness who snapped a picture of his vehicle – a black Nissan – which included the license plate. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference hours after the incident that the witness was able to share the plate and later identify the suspect as the person he saw fleeing the scene. Trump confirmed in a statement about an hour after the shots were reported that he is ‘safe and well’ and didn’t want rumors to ‘start spiraling out of control.’ The suspect was able to get within 400-500 yards of Trump. The 2024 Republican nominee’s bulked up Secret Service advance team, however, spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. Special Agent Rafael Barros explained at the press conference on Sunday that Secret Service moves with Trump and is usually surveying one or two holes ahead of him when he goes for a round of golf. Asked if the security has changed around Trump since the first attempt on his life earlier this summer, Barros said: ‘Yes, the threat was high.’ ‘We have increased the amount of assets that we’ve supported,’ he continued. ‘We are living in dangerous times.’ Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump’s golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The FBI released a statement two hours after the incident claiming the attack ‘appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.’ The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which is confirmed to be a more ‘vulnerable’ area of the course because it is closest to the road. Sheriff Bradshaw detailed that the suspected assassin was wielding an ‘AK-47 style weapon with a scope’, which was recovered at the scene. So was a backpack and GoPro camera, which Sheriff Bradshaw revealed in images of where the suspect was set-up in the bushes along the fencing of Trump’s golf club. The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee. Undergrowth is cut back in this area every summer and is one of the parts of the course closest to the road. The incident comes as Trump’s security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt and said Sunday that the latest proves the attack in Butler was not an ‘isolated incident.’ ‘As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,’ Waltz wrote on X. He added: ‘As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week.’ Trump’s golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect’s backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. ‘Nothing will slow me down,’ Trump wrote in a statement. ‘I will NEVER SURRENDER!’ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and ‘relieved’ he is not harmed. ‘The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,’ according to the White House. ‘They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.’ Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: ‘Violence has no place in America.’ ‘I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,’ she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: ‘The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.’ ‘The former president is safe,’ he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. ‘He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,’ the senator wrote on X. ‘He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.’ It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday’s shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent’s home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRyan Wesley Routh, the man named as the suspect in a possible&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Suspect Arrested for Attempted Assassination at Trump Golf Course in Florida Identified as Ryan Wesley Routh first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/suspect-arrested-for-attempted-assassination-at-trump-golf-course-in-florida-identified-as-ryan-wesley-routh/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1726444328_rewrite-this-title-Trump-golf-course-shooter-named-as-Ryan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:53:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.432},{"id":256483726,"title":"Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Chiefs Pull Off a Win Against Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals","text":"The Kansas City Chiefs are on a roll to start the new NFL season. It was another nail biter, but the Chiefs pulled off the win behind Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce — and a clutch field goal from Harrison Butker — defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 26-25 on Sunday, Sept. 15 in their second game since their Super Bowl LVIII victory in February. The teams traded off field goals in the first quarter, before the Bengals, led by quarterback Joe Burrow, were able to go into halftime with a 16-10 lead. A long drive from the Chiefs to start the second half gave them a touchdown and their first lead of the game, but the Bengals quickly responded with one of their own. Both quarterbacks had tough outings at times — Mahomes threw two interceptions, and a fumble from Burrow at the start of the fourth quarter put the Chiefs up 23-22 late. The Bengals had one last field goal to take the lead back, but a 51-yard field goal from Butker saved the game for the Chiefs, giving them the win and handing Cincinnati their second loss of the season. Cheering for the home team was Kelce's girlfriend Taylor Swift, who sat with friends Danielle and Este Haim, plus her brother Austin Swift and mom Andrea Swift in the tight end's friends and family suite at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Swift, 34, was also joined by Chariah Gordan, the fiancée of Kelce's teammate Mecole Hardman Jr., later in the game. The two were spotted jumping up and down and screaming after Butker sealed the win. Patrick's wife Brittany Mahomes supported the squad on Sunday as well. The 28-year-old Kansas City Current owner — who recently made headlines for appearing to support Donald Trump — was on the sidelines before kickoff with the couple's children: Sterling Skye, 3, Patrick \"Bronze\" Lavon Mahomes III, 1. The couple are currently expecting their third child. Swift was all smiles as she cheered for her beau just days after thanking him on stage at the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City. Swift referred to Kelce as her \"boyfriend\" while accepting her award with Post Malone for best collaboration on their \"Fortnight\" music video and shared that Kelce was on set \"cheering\" for the pair after every take.

Fans pointed out that Swift's speech marked the first time she's publicly spoken his name and referred to him as her boyfriend. The VMA's 2024 artist of the year said, \"Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic. So, I want to thank him for adding that to our shoot because I’ll always remember that,\" of Kelce during the award show in New York City on Sept. 11. Kelce appeared to enjoy the televised shout-out from his girlfriend when he liked a clip of Swift's speech shared on MTV's Instagram. Next, the Chiefs will travel to Atlanta to take on the Falcons on Sunday, Sept. 22.","summary":"A 51-yard field goal from Harrison Butker sealed the win for the Chiefs, who go up 2-0 on the season","url":"https://people.com/patrick-mahomes-travis-kelce-chiefs-defeat-joe-burrow-bengals-8711645","image":"https://people.com/thmb/NalX6gXMX72xrKlyhOvCzsOmFUw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x387:706x389)/travis-kelce-baltimore-ravens-kansas-city-chiefs-game-091124-1-123f311cb3b445bf952d893e4240c71c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:51:50","author":"Julie Mazziotta,Natasha Dye","authors":["Julie Mazziotta","Natasha Dye"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.352},{"id":256484164,"title":"Florida Man Arrested for Attempted Assassination at Trump Golf Course","text":"Ryan Wesley Routh, the man named as the suspect in a possible assassination attempt near Donald Trump’s Florida golf club, was calm and emotionless when he was arrested Sunday.

The former President was safe after the incident at his golf course in Florida, and a suspect is in custody. This is what we know. How it unfolded The incident played out at about 1:30pm Sunday, local time. Trump was playing golf at his course in Florida's West Palm Beach when a US Secret Service agent spotted a man with a firearm hiding in the shrubbery surrounding the property, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw. The agents had been clearing the holes ahead of Trump when they saw a rifle barrel poking through the bushes. The gunman was about one or two holes away — approximately 400 metres — from where Trump was playing. Police have said that was \"not a long distance\" for an AK-47-style rifle fitted with a scope, which was retrieved from the scene. When the agents saw the muzzle of the rifle, one of them opened fire at the gunman. He fired at least four rounds, but the man managed to escape, fleeing the scene in a black Nissan car. He left behind the rifle, a GoPro, and two backpacks at the scene. Investigators have not confirmed whether the gunman was able to shoot before fleeing. Suspect seen fleeing the scene A witness saw the suspect drive off and was able to take a photo of the car and share it with law enforcement officials. The suspect was later stopped driving northbound on Interstate 95 after crossing into Martin County, about a 72-kilometre drive north of Trump's golf course. He did not identify the suspect or give details on a possible motive. The Martin County Sheriff's Office said the man taken into custody was \"relatively calm\" when detained. The FBI said it was investigating \"what appears to be an attempted assassination\". Trump was returned safely after the incident to his private Mar-a-Lago club, where he resides in neighbouring Palm Beach, according to a person familiar with the matter. In an email to supporters, Trump said: \"There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!\" \"Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!\" The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris had been briefed about the incident and were relieved to know that he was safe. \"Violence has no place in America,\" Ms Harris said in an X social media post. What security measures were in place? Trump's campaign confirmed he was safe after the incident but gave no further details. The former president was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13, raising questions about protection for candidates just months ahead of the November US presidential election. His right ear was grazed and one rally-goer was killed in the gunfire. The gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper. The shooting in July forced Kimberly Cheatle to resign as Secret Service director under bipartisan congressional pressure. The Secret Service's new acting director said in August that he was \"ashamed\" by the security lapse that led to the assassination attempt. Trump's team have stepped up security since the assassination attempt in July. When he is at Trump Tower in New York, parked garbage trucks form a wall outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. The Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump's game, but there are several areas around the perimeter of the property where golfers are visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents and officers in golf carts and on all-terrain vehicles generally secure the area several holes ahead of and behind Trump when he plays. Agents also usually bring an armoured vehicle onto the course to quickly shelter Trump should a threat arise. Police have defended the security presence at the course. \"He's not the sitting president, if he was, we'd have the entire golf course surrounded. Because he's not, security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.\" The spokesperson added more officers might be deployed the next time Trump was at the golf course, but said the Secret Service did \"exactly what they should have done\".

We are thankful that the former President was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said he spent some time with Trump following the scary ordeal. “No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient. He is unstoppable,” Johnson wrote on X. The suspect, identified by sources as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, fled the golf course after the Secret Service agent opened fire. He was arrested inn his car on I-95 a short time later. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw later told reporters that because Trump is not the sitting president, the level of security he received was “limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.” Bradshaw noted that if Trump were in office, “we would have had this entire golf course surrounded.” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise blasted that revelation. “Thank God President Trump is safe. I can’t believe I’m having to say this once again this election cycle: there is absolutely no place for violence in politics. Grateful for all law enforcement involved who stopped what could’ve been a catastrophe,” Scalise (R-La.) posted on X. “Authorities just acknowledged if President Trump was president, they’d do more to protect him. This must change. There have been TWO attempts on Trump’s life. Secret Service must up their level of protection of him to their FULL capabilities—including expanding the perimeter.” House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik (R-NY) lauded the law enforcement that kept Trump safe but questioned how the suspect was able to get so close. “I am grateful to hear that President Trump is safe following today’s reported assassination attempt in Florida. I join in thanks for our hardworking law enforcement officers working to keep President Trump, his family, and his team safe,” she said in a statement. “However, we must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again? There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.” Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) echoed Scalise. “I’m relieved President Trump and his family are safe, but concerned this is the second attempt on his life in the last few months,” Graves said. “There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. There’s no excuse for President Trump to have anything less than a FULL security detail now.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) chimed in, “Now, it is imperative that we move Secret Service out from under the Department of Homeland Security and back to the Treasury Department, where they had more focus. Also, it is time to increase resources.” Leading Democrats, meanwhile, also weighed in. “Political violence has no place in a democratic society,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) wrote on X. Trump’s November rival, Vice President Kamala Harris was among the first to react to the security incident. “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America,” Harris wrote on X. “Gwen and I are glad to hear that Donald Trump is safe. Violence has no place in our country. It’s not who we are as a nation,” her running mate Tim Walz (D) later stressed. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) added, “I was just briefed by the Acting Director of the Secret Service. I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety. There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service, FBI and Beach County Sheriff’s Office are investigating the situation. The assassination attempt on Trump on July 13 also remains under investigation. The shooter in the attack was killed by the Secret Service. Trump confirmed he was fine following the terrifying ordeal. “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down,” Trump said in a statement. “I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me.”","summary":"\"We are thankful that the former President was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms,\" said a bipartisan task force.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/15/us-news/gop-dems-react-to-would-be-trump-assassination-grateful-but-concerned/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-6bndpxp1h-1726440049890.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726425675&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:50:44","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":256483724,"title":"Trump assassination task force member: 'No way in hell' Palm Beach suspect should have been that close","text":"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., blasted the Secret Service and other authorities for not securing the area around former President Trump before another attempted assassination attempt against him on Sunday. Burchett spoke to Eric Shawn on \"Fox News Live\" about ongoing details regarding the assassination attempt outside Trump International Golf Club where Trump was playing golf at the time. Authorities have said the suspect, later identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, was 300 to 500 yards before Secret Service opened fire against him. The congressman wants answers on how the suspect was able to get that close to the former president and revealed that other lawmakers are already demanding more security measures. \"They are already calling now. And you got to ask yourself, why was there not a drone flying over wherever the president is? This is ridiculous,\" Burchett said. DONALD TRUMP SAFE AFTER SHOTS FIRED OUTSIDE PALM BEACH GOLF CLUB While he had harsh criticism for the Secret Service, the Tennessee lawmaker complimented the agents who were able to spot and open fire on the suspect. \"The problem is you've got a Secret Service, at least in my opinion, and in the public's eye, that is compromised and that it lacks in leadership. And you've got great agents on the ground, obviously, one who took that shot. But why in the world would anybody be anywhere near the perimeter of this? This line of sight that we talk about is just beyond me. So we've got to get some answers. I don't think we're going to get them during this administration, but hopefully, under the Trump administration, we’ll clean this rat's nest out,\" Burchett said. He added, \"There is no way in hell that somebody should have been that close to President Trump with an AK Steel or AK-47 or whatever it was with a scope.\" Burchett also dismissed Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw stating how security surrounding Trump is at a lower level due to him not being the sitting president. \"Everybody sort of knows his pattern. And I know he likes to play golf, and they know when he's in Florida, he's going to play golf. Dadgummit, they should have closed it off. They have the power to do that. They ought to do that. They're going to come to us for more money. I think they need to quit with the DEI hires and start putting qualified people out there in decision-making positions instead of what they’re doing right now,\" Burchett said.

The Constitution states, among other things, that the leadership should harness the nation’s resources and promote national prosperity and an efficient, dynamic, and self-reliant economy. That is what those who put the constitution or manufactured it desire for the country and what we deserve, but it is not what we are getting. Each time a new president is elected and he resumes, he forgets that he had sworn to uphold the constitution in all ramifications. He behaves as if he was elected to take up the punishment from where his predecessor stopped. Ola Rotimi exclaimed, “The gods are not to blame”. William Shakespeare explained that the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves …. while Chinua Achebe told us that the problem with Nigeria is leadership. I cannot agree more with these scholars. Jokingly, we ask ourselves, “Whom did we offend?”. Offend ke? Whom did America offend when they elected Donald Trump? When they were playing the xenophobic politics, they imposed him on themselves. But they quickly retraced their steps and voted him out. When we stop playing the politics of naira and kobo, or ethnicity and religious bigotry, we will deliver ourselves from bad governance. In every election, we seem to impose on ourselves odaju leaders who are selfish to the bone marrow. They harness our resources to promote personal aggrandizement and prosperity. When this government assumed office, majority seemed to be on the same page that the Tinubu administration inherited a dead economy from Muhammadu Buhari, and the suffering of the citizens was much. Poverty was oozing out of the land, and many young people were voting with their feet or japa. Hope was however rekindled that a democrat who had performed fairly well at the sub-national level had taken over and a turn-around was invariably expected. The economy has since gone awry, not because the resources have run dry or are not available but because of profligacy, mismanagement, and misapplication. Reports show that Nigeria’s crude oil export revenue in 2023 was N29 trillion or about 60 billion US dollars, a 37 percent increase compared to N21.1 trillion in 2022. The foreign trade in the third quarter of 2023 rose by 53.16 percent year-on-year to N18.80 trillion. The petroleum industry accounts for about 5.5 percent of Nigeria’s GDP and around 92 percent of the value of all exports. According to nairametrics.com and statements by the President himself, the country’s revenue was over N9.1 trillion in the first half of 2024. The GDP grew by 2.98% year-on-year in real terms in the first quarter of 2024. Even the country surpassed Quarter one of the 2024 Non-Oil Revenue target by 30% and exited the ways and means trap. So, there has been improved revenue and an economic turnaround, which the government also talked about with pride. Yet the policy of hardship continues to deprive the citizens of the joy of living in Nigeria. Another round of inflation is envisaged with the recent increase in fuel and an unfriendly attitude towards domestic oil production and distribution. There is a need for policies that promote macroeconomic stability such that planning by the private sector can be enhanced. The prices of imports are part of the restrictions to domestic production, and the reserves must be preserved and strengthened to promote appreciation of the naira. Such appreciation is important not only to bring down the cost of imports and promote domestic production but also to promote foreign investments. Foreign investors compute how much their take-home profits will be based on the exchange rate. It is clear that the current flooding in the North presently will result in food shortage very soon as large hectares of farmlands have been washed away. We cannot afford to wait until we get to the bridge to cross. Preparation must be on now to care for the impending shortage and food insecurity. The economic hardship arising from the economic policies of removal of fuel subsidies and market-determined exchange rate have killed many small and medium-term enterprises. The need to assist the existing SMEs to expand with deliberate policies is imperative. Recently, I was in Abuja waiting by the roadside for transport to a conference centre and a taxi just stopped, and the driver urged me to enter. On entering, he introduced himself as my former student at the university. We engaged in conversation, and he told me how he lost his job in a medium-scale business due to current economic policies, which made him convert his car to UBER (as they generally refer to themselves these days). Those who did not have cars or what can be converted to money-making facilities are somewhere licking their wounds and cursing whoever has put them in such a condition. So the need to facilitate the recovery of the SME sub-sector is as urgent as promoting the large-scale industrial sector. The industrial sector has the virtue of forward and backward linkages in production and employment generation with accompanying technological advancement and innovation. Whatever taxes generated from the sector should be expended largely in promoting the growth of the sector to reap greater returns. There is a need to chart a new course in our spending. The idea of spending in anticipation of income generation has led the country into greater debt and debt servicing. The economic policy of distributing palliatives needs to stop and be substituted with the policy of subsiding production in the SMEs in particular. Activities in the mineral sector require monitoring, transparency, and accountability. Contributions of the non-oil sector should not be placed on tax or revenue collection alone but also on production. So, agricultural production, mining, information technology, et cetera need to be properly encouraged through direct policy initiatives and implementation, including support with financial and non-financial grants. It is believed that the government has secured a moratorium on some of the debts owed and can safely use new income or revenue coming in to assist in waking up dying businesses and promoting new ones so that the contributions to the GDP from the real sub-sector of the non-oil sector can increase and improve. Such a situation has greater multiplier effects than rent-seeking activities. An evaluation of the travels to attract foreign investment ought to have been carried out by now to determine the next line of action and save money. The President and the policymakers should now be preoccupied with how to reduce inflation, how to generate revenue from improved production and new employment rather than from taxation, and how to reduce the number of out-of-school children in Nigeria. It should be engrossed with how to improve the quality of education and health services to improve labour productivity; how to make food available and affordable; and how to relieve the economic burden on the citizens so that they can prevent and even bury any protests on bad governance. The concept of Afenifere becomes relevant here. Afenifere means someone who also wishes other people well. A good example is found in Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who was aware of the benefit of education as a turnaround instrument for poverty-stricken households. He could afford to send his children to quality schools, even using public funds, and derive the benefits, but he chose to do the same for many other households who could not afford such ventures through the introduction and execution of Free Education. Today, many of us so liberated are still celebrating him and will do so forever. His great-grandchildren will continue to reap the fruit of his labour. Today, Awolowo’s name still rings a bell beyond Nigeria. What you plant today is what you reap tomorrow. The Nigerian economic dream is enshrined in the Constitution. The government should be guided by that dream.","summary":"The Nigerian economy envisaged by the Nigerian Constitution is a prosperous one.

Every terror outfit in the world would be happy to take Trump down.

As it happens, the man ID’d in this attempt is one Ryan Routh, 58, who championed left-wing causes on social media.

Sir Edward Davey, party leader, invited the cameras to snap him playing beach volleyball. The ball boinged off his bald head and Sir Ed fell to the sand like Norman Wisdom in an Ealing comedy. His deputy Daisy Cooper – teeth like a Colgate racehorse – held a rival photo opportunity. She was playing crazy golf. They are not the first senior Liberals of recent history to have been drawn to balls. Quick-change artiste Sir Edward can switch costume as fast as he alters low-fat socialist policy positions. He wriggled out of a business suit into some beach gear; later he leapt into a green jumper and brown trousers for questions in the conference hall. As he took to the stage, we were given the theme tune to TV's Ski Sunday.The questions were put by former BBC radio journalist Carolyn Quinn who was presumably hired – now that she can put aside that celebrated BBC impartiality – as a tame presence. Actually, she did not give him an entirely easy time. She was sceptical about Lib Dem budget sums and pointed out that Sir Ed was in the coalition government during Andrew Lansley's hapless reorganisation of the NHS. When Sir Ed tried to support both Nimbyism and greater house building, Quinn said, 'You can't have it both ways, can you?' Having it both ways has always been a Lib speciality. Look at old Thorpe. Sir Edward was on tremendously self-congratulatory form, hugging himself as he stood by the lectern and talking about 'that stunning general election win' (er, they came third, or arguably fourth). He mentioned the US presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate by their first names only, as if they were close friends. Quinn noted that the Reform party won 14 per cent of the national vote but returned five MPs, whereas the Lib Dems scored 12 per cent and bagged 72 MPs. 'Where's the fairness in that?' Sir Edward did some coughing and insisted he was not interested in working with Nigel Farage to campaign for electoral reform. At the mention of Mr Farage, as with Donald Trump, the hall warbled a few boos and hisses. Why were they so down on Farage? If he hadn't split the Right-wing vote, the Lib Dems would have had a miserable result. The activists' age profile has dropped a little. There are quite a few 40-somethings in trimmed, pomaded beards. During a debate on the economy, the moderator, a mild-mannered, Viyella shirt type called Jeremy, referred to part of the hall as 'the beards sector'. Several of these beardies were wearing tight chinos and blindingly white gym shoes. An unexpected development: activists have become hot for defence. 'I'm not calling for war,' mewed a yellow T-shirt from Chichester, but it did sound as if he was calling precisely for that. The biggest hear, hear came for returning to the EU's single market –Quinn forced a show of hands on this and it won about half the arms in the hall – but there was also a distinct appetite for Kremlin-bashing. The excitement was too much for one poor Herbert who went down with a nosebleed. First aid medics waddled to the scene. The economic policy working group discussion featured floor contributions, several with nasal, trainspotterish voices. The Lib Dems have always had their share of windy obsessives. One man, during a not under-long contribution, used the expression 'very interestingly'. Another suggested empty seats in the Commons to represent people who do not vote. At least three female-looking speakers had jolly deep voices and hands like spades. There were calls for compulsory recycling and more regulation (subject unspecified – just more rules).'Wonderful,' said Viyella Jeremy, hoping to stop one of these interminable bores.It only encouraged the bloke to continue longer. 'Very useful points,' said Jeremy, his eyes as glazed as a dead pollock.","summary":"QUENTIN LETTS: The Lib Dems ' conference opened with the intellectual rigour that has established the party so firmly in the politico-philosophical firmament.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13853679/QUENTIN-LETTS-Sir-Ed-fell-sand-like-Norman-Wisdom.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/15/23/89706697-0-image-m-125_1726439912431.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:41:22","author":"Editor,Quentin Letts","authors":["Editor","Quentin Letts"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":256483314,"title":"Harris Representative Struggles to Respond to ABC News Question about Kamala’s Debate Statement on US Military","text":"Five days on from the presidential debate between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, it continues to take up oxygen in the room–and not in a good way for the vice president.

Sept. 15, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla., after gunshots were reported in the vicinity of Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, his campaign and the Secret Service said. (Stephanie Matat/The Associated Press) WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Donald Trump was the target Sunday of ''what appears to be an attempted assassination'' at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the FBI said, just nine weeks after the Republican presidential nominee survived another attempt on his life. The former president said he was safe and well, and authorities held a man in custody. U.S. Secret Service agents posted a few holes up from where Trump was playing noticed the muzzle of an AK-style rifle sticking through the shrubbery that lines the course, roughly 400 yards away. An agent fired and the gunman dropped the rifle and fled in an SUV, leaving the firearm behind along with two backpacks, a scope used for aiming and a GoPro camera, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said. The man was later taken into custody in a neighboring county. It was the latest jarring moment in a campaign year marked by unprecedented upheaval. On July 13, Trump was shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. Eight days later, Democratic President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, giving way for Vice President Kamala Harris to become the party's nominee. And it was sure to add to the questions about Secret Service protective operations after the agency's admitted failures in preventing the attempted assassination of Trump this summer. In an email to supporters, Trump said: ''There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!'' He wrote: ''Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!'' He returned to Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach where he lives, according to a person familiar with Trump's movements who was not authorized to discuss them publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear whether the incident would affect his campaign schedule. He was set to speak from Florida about cryptocurrency live on Monday night on the social media site X for the launch of his sons' crypto platform. He planned a town hall Tuesday in Flint, Michigan, with his former press secretary, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, followed by a rally Wednesday on New York's Long Island. An email to Trump campaign staffers obtained by AP said, ''This is not a matter that we take lightly. Your safety is always our top priority. We ask that you remain vigilant in your daily comings and goings.'' ''As we enter the last 50 days of President Trump's campaign, we must remember that we will only be able save America from those who seek to destroy it by working together as one team.'' Biden and Harris were briefed and would be kept updated on the investigation. The White House said they were ''relieved'' to know Trump is safe. Harris, in a statement, also said ''violence has no place in America.'' In the aftermath, Trump checked in with allies, including running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and several Fox News hosts. Fox News host Sean Hannity recounted on air his conversation with Trump and the former president's golf partner, Steve Witkoff. They told Hannity they had been on the fifth hole and about to go up to putt when they heard a ''pop pop, pop pop.'' Within seconds, he said Witkoff recounted, Secret Service agents ''pounced on'' Trump and ''covered him'' to protect him. Trump had returned to Florida this weekend from a West Coast swing that included a Friday night rally in Las Vegas and a Utah fundraiser. His campaign had not advised about any public plans for Trump on Sunday. He often spends the morning playing golf, before having lunch at the club, one of three he owns in the state. He has had a stepped-up security footprint since the assassination attempt in July. When he has been at Trump Tower in New York, parked dump trucks have formed a wall outside the building. At outdoor rallies, he now speaks from behind an enclosure of bulletproof glass. The Florida golf course was partially shut down for Trump as he played, but there are several areas around the perimeter of the property where golfers are visible from the fence line. Secret Service agents and officers in golf carts and on ATVs generally secure the area several holes ahead and behind Trump when he plays. Agents also usually bring an armored vehicle onto the course to shelter Trump quickly should a threat arise. The Palm Beach County sheriff said the entire golf course would have been lined with law enforcement if Trump were the president, but because he is not, ''security is limited to the areas that the Secret Service deems possible.'' ''I would imagine that the next time he comes to the golf course, there will probably be a little more people around the perimeter,\" Bradshaw said. ''But the Secret Service did exactly what they should have done, they provided exactly what the protection should have been and their agent did a fantastic job.'' Former presidents and their spouses have Secret Service protection for life, but the security around former presidents varies according to threat levels and exposure, with the toughest typically being in the immediate aftermath of their leaving office. Trump's protective detail has been higher than some other former presidents because of his high visibility and his campaign to seek the White House again. The man in custody was Ryan Routh, three law enforcement officials told the AP. The officials who identified the suspect spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. The FBI was leading the investigation and was working to determine any motive. Attorney General Merrick Garland was receiving regular updates. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were helping investigate. ''The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,'' the bureau said. News reporters were not with Trump on Sunday. Bucking tradition, Trump's campaign has not arranged to have a protective pool of reporters travel with him, as is standard for major party nominees and for the president. Harris does not have a protective pool at all times, but does allow reporters to travel with her for public events. Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said the suspect was apprehended within minutes of the FBI, Secret Service and Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office putting out a ''very urgent BOLO'' — or ''be on the lookout'' alert detailing the specific vehicle sought, license plate number and description of the occupant. Snyder said his deputies ''immediately flooded'' northbound I-95, deploying to every exit between the Palm Beach County line to the south and St. Lucie County line to the north. ''One of my road patrol units saw the vehicle, matched the tag and we set up on the vehicle,'' Snyder said, ''We pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped and got the driver in custody.'' Snyder told WPTV that the suspect \"was not armed when we took him out of the car.'' The man had a calm, flat demeanor and showed little emotion when he was stopped by police, Snyder said, saying the suspect did not question why he was being pulled over. ''He never asked, ‘what is this about?' Obviously, law enforcement with long rifles, blue lights, a lot going on. He never questioned it,'' Snyder said. ___ Richer, Long, Tucker and Miller reported from Washington.

Collecting parts from a protected marine animal that still has “soft tissues” on the carcass is against federal law. In August, the political arm of the Center for Biological Diversity, a left-leaning environmental organization, asked federal authorities to look into Kick Kennedy’s decade-old story, accusing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. “There are good reasons why it is illegal for any person to collect or keep parts of any endangered species,” Brett Hartl, the national political director of the organization, wrote in a letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Most importantly, vital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists. This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study.” Hartl also alleged that Kennedy may have violated the Lacey Act, a 1900 law that outlaws the transportation of illegally gathered wildlife, dead or alive, across state lines. During the Saturday rally, the former presidential candidate did not deny the rumored whale incident and instead suggested the statute of limitations governing the legal codes had passed before dismissing a federal probe into him as “gossipy nonsense.”","summary":"Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersRobert F.

A Secret Service agent opened fire on the suspect after spotting a rifle barrel through the perimeter fence of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The suspect fled but is now in custody and has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Trump immediately began fundraising off the latest alleged assassination attempt with an email to supporters, reading, “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL! Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER! I will always love you for supporting me.” The investigation remains fluid, according to law enforcement, and details at the moment are sparse. But here’s what we know so far: One agent from Trump’s Secret Service detail was a few holes ahead of where the former president was playing, securing the area, when they spotted a man at the perimeter of the property, armed with a rifle, agency brass said. The suspect allegedly pushed the muzzle of the rifle through the chainlink fence — and Secret Service fired at him. Trump was just 300-500 yards away, between the sixth and seventh holes. “The rifle was pointed out, we engaged,” a Secret Service official said at Sunday’s press conference. It is unknown if the man fired any rounds. He was reportedly not hit by Secret Service gunfire. Police responded to the scene shortly after 1:30 pm local time. An AK-47 assault-style rifle fitted with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera were recovered near the scene, law enforcement officials said at a press conference following the incident. A witness told officers he saw a person emerge from the bushes nearby and run into a black Nissan, providing cops with a photo of the vehicle and license plate, officials said. An automated license plate reader flagged the vehicle as it drove along I-95, where the suspect was arrested. The golf course had been partially closed while Trump played, for security reasons, officials said. Trump was The suspect, who has been identified by law enforcement sources as Ryan Wesley Routh of Hawaii, was apprehended minutes after fleeing the scene. Armed with the suspect’s general location thanks to the license plate reader, deputies “flooded” I-95 in setting up a dragnet, posting up by each exit, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. Snyder said Sunday that a patrol unit soon spotted the black Nissan and “we set up on the vehicle.” “We pinched in on the car, got it safely stopped and got the driver in custody,” he said. Snyder told reporters that the suspect was not armed when officers caught up with him, and that he had maintained a “calm, flat affect” throughout. “He was not displaying a lot of emotions,” Snyder said. “Never asked, ‘What is this about?” This is the second time in two months that Trump has been targeted by a potential assassin. A small portion of the corner of Trump’s right ear was bloodied in mid-July as the former president spoke to a rally crowd in Butler, Pennsylvania. Several shots from an AR-15 rang out about 15 minutes after Trump took the stage at a local farm show ground. Trump dropped to the ground before popping back up and pumping his fist to the audience as agents hustled him away. He was quickly discharged from a local hospital and flew to his New Jersey country club. Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old gunman, was shot dead by a police sniper after firing multiple rounds at Trump, killing 50-year-old retired fire chief Corey Comperatore. Investigators later found three loaded magazines with 100 rounds in each, a bulletproof vest, and a remote control for explosive devices later found in Crooks’ car. The Secret Service is responsible for protecting sitting and former presidents; the security bubble around Trump has been reinforced in recent weeks. The FBI has jurisdiction over investigations into presidential assassination attempts. “The threat level is high,” a law enforcement official said at Sunday’s press conference. “We have increased the amount of assets that we are supporting. We live in dangerous times.” In a separate statement, Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival for the Oval Office, said, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.”","summary":"An AK-47 assault-style rifle fitted with a scope, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera were recovered near the scene, law enforcement officials said","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-golf-club-shooting-west-palm-beach-b2613327.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/15/22/2171581774.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:38:18","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.624},{"id":256483258,"title":"Trump golf course shooter named as Ryan Wesley Routh as suspect is arrested for assassination attempt in Florida","text":"BREAKING NEWSTrump golf course shooter named as Ryan Wesley Routh as suspect is arrested for assassination attempt in Florida READ MORE: Trump assassination attempt live updates By Stephen M.

'I have a clear understanding from investigators that we actually do have the suspect that they're looking for in Palm Beach County,' Snyder said. Officials said U.S. Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel sticking out of the bushes two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing on Sunday, prompting the agents to fire at the suspect. The individual ran into his vehicle from the trees, but was spotted by a witness who snapped a picture of his vehicle – a black Nissan – which included the license plate. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters at a press conference hours after the incident that the witness was able to share the plate and later identify the suspect as the person he saw fleeing the scene.

The suspect was able to get within 400-500 yards of Trump. The 2024 Republican nominee's bulked up Secret Service advance team, however, spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. Special Agent Rafael Barros explained at the press conference on Sunday that Secret Service moves with Trump and is usually surveying one or two holes ahead of him when he goes for a round of golf. Asked if the security has changed around Trump since the first attempt on his life earlier this summer, Barros said: 'Yes, the threat was high.' 'We have increased the amount of assets that we've supported,' he continued. 'We are living in dangerous times.' Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump's golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The FBI released a statement two hours after the incident claiming the attack 'appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.' The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which is confirmed to be a more 'vulnerable' area of the course because it is closest to the road. Sheriff Bradshaw detailed that the suspected assassin was wielding an 'AK-47 style weapon with a scope', which was recovered at the scene. So was a backpack and GoPro camera, which Sheriff Bradshaw revealed in images of where the suspect was set-up in the bushes along the fencing of Trump's golf club. Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters a member of Donald Trump's Secret Service detail spotted the barrel sticking out from bushes two holes from where the former president was golfing on Sunday Multiple shots were fired near Trump's golf club in West Pam Beach, Florida on Sunday When not campaigning, Trump is often found golfing at his West Palm Beach club.

The incident comes as Trump's security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt and said Sunday that the latest proves the attack in Butler was not an 'isolated incident.' 'As I've said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,' Waltz wrote on X. He added: 'As a member of the Assassination Task Force, I expect the Secret Service to brief us this week.' Trump's golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. The Palm Beach Sheriff's Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect's backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. 'Nothing will slow me down,' Trump wrote in a statement. 'I will NEVER SURRENDER!'

'The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,' according to the White House. 'They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.' Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: 'Violence has no place in America.' 'I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,' she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Trump speaks with DailyMail.com during an interview at his Mar-a-Lago club – just five miles down the road from his golf club where shots were fired on Sunday United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: 'The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.' 'The former president is safe,' he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. 'He is one of the strongest people I've ever known,' the senator wrote on X. 'He's in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.' It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday's shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. A bullet struck Donald Trump's right ear during an assassination attempt on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service agents after he was able to climb onto a roof with an AR-15 just 400 feet from where Trump was speaking and take multiple shots that killed one rally goer, critically injured two others and struck the former president Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent's home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle.

Back in June Shakira said she's not quite ready for a 'formal relationship' but suggested she may be open to a fling — two years after her split from longtime partner Gerard Pique. The Colombian hitmaker and the Spanish football star, 37, were together for 11 years and welcomed two children — sons Milan, 11, and Sasha, nine — before separating in 2022. It was rumored that Gerard had cheated on Shakira with his now-girlfriend and former employee Clara Chia, 26. 'I'm not thinking about that. What space do I have for a man right now?' she told Rolling Stone this week when asked about her dating life. The singer, 47, was showing off her signature dance moves onstage at LIV Miami as she danced onstage to new single, Soltera when she appeared to spot revelers filming up her skirt The star was seen stopping dancing as she held onto her skirt with both hands and shook her head at the fans - while gesturing that she had seen what they were doing - before leaving the stage She continued: 'What can I tell you, I like men. That's the problem. I shouldn't like them with everything that's happened to me, but imagine how much I like men that I still like them.' Since parting ways with Gerard, Shakira has been romantically linked to the likes of A-list actor Tom Cruise and racing champ Lewis Hamilton. Most recently, Shakira has been spotted with Emily In Paris hunk Lucien Laviscount, 32, who starred in the sexy music video for her song Puntería in March. A source told DailyMail.com in April that she and Lucien 'are seeing each other but are not heavily involved yet.' But Shakira insisted to Rolling Stone that she isn't interested in a relationship at the moment as the well-being of her children is her primary focus. 'I think my kids would have to be very prepared for that, and their emotional and psychological well-being is the priority,' the She Wolf hitmaker admitted. But she appeared to hint that she isn't opposed to a future fling. 'Hey, I'm not opposed to having friends,' the mother-of-two told the outlet. The Colombian hitmaker and the football star Gerard Pique, 37, were together for 11 years and welcomed two children — sons Milan, 11, and Sasha, nine — before separating in 2022; seen in 2015 Shakira also declared that she's got her 'sexy back.' 'More swag. I got my swag back. And I got my sexy back,' she said. It's a remarkably positive turnaround from the pain Shakira endured two years ago, when she split from Gerard and was embroiled in a tax evasion legal battle in Spain. Her father, who was 90 years old at the time, had also suffered a terrible fall. He is now on the mend following six surgeries. Speaking of that time, she said: 'The suffering I felt was probably the greatest I had ever experienced in my entire life, and it kept me from functioning at times.' 'It felt like someone had stabbed a hole in my chest. And the sensation was so real, almost physical. I physically felt like I had a hole in my chest and that people could see through me,' she added. The music icon then vulnerably described the sacrifices she made during her relationship with Gerard and how she has begun to find herself again since their split. Shakira said she's not quite ready for a 'formal relationship' but suggested she may be open to a fling — two years after her split from longtime partner Pique; seen in May 'When you leave a relationship of many years, there are things about yourself that seem to have been lost along the way,' she told the publication. 'There's things about yourself that you change for the other person or give up. When that relationship breaks down, you feel like you're left with nothing and you have to heal, search for yourself, and travel back toward the center of yourself.' Shakira made Gerard and their children her top priority during their relationship and even moved to Barcelona for him, as he played soccer for FC Barcelona.

We need an American president to put Iran back in a box before they get a nuclear weapon. We need an American president to secure our border and go back to rational immigration policy. We need an American president that will stand up to radical Islam and make us strong. If we do not change course, Iran’s going to have a nuclear weapon, there’s going to be a 9/11 attack on our country, and if we don’t watch it, Putin’s going to keep marching through Europe.” Graham also cautioned about the threat Iran poses to Israel and the U.S., claiming that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is “on the verge” of obtaining a nuclear weapon. He added that he is concerned Khamenei, “a religious Nazi,” could “break out” before the 2024 election. The South Carolina senator concluded his interview by wishing “good luck” to anyone finding out Harris’s plans for foreign policy, likely in reference to how Harris has only done two interviews as a presidential candidate in the last two months.

He has also said the billions of dollars in aid going to Ukraine has not been very effective. In her debate against Trump, Harris claimed she had traveled the world as vice president, and that Trump is unfit to serve because world leaders are “laughing” at him.

Hughes believes that the 2020 election was stolen. He drove 2,000 miles to Washington, D.C. Hughes was not accused of violence, but kicked out a door during the 2021 riot, enabling others to enter the Capitol. \"No matter how I look at it, I share some of the responsibility for everything that happened that day, letting people in, being a part of that mob,\" he said. Hughes' obstruction charge was later struck down by the Supreme Court in another related case. But if Hughes appeals, he would face other charges that the prosecution had dropped in his case. So after 20 months in custody, including prison, Hughes has decided to wrap up his last days of home detention. Looking back on Jan. 6Hughes is one of more than 1,000 defendants who've been convicted so far in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. About 350 trials are still pending and the FBI is still searching for suspects. Evidence from the trials in the years since the insurrection shows organized militias came with a plan to stop the electoral vote count in Congress that would declare Joe Biden the winner. On January 6, President Donald Trump enflamed a multitude of people with false claims of a stolen election. Hughes, a 39-year-old construction worker from Montana, supported President Trump. \"The way this country's headed, my paycheck — you know, my wife's disabled, and it's been hell for us to try to, you know, try to make it with the tens of thousands of dollars of medical bills,\" he said. \"And a lot of us see Donald Trump, the outsider, coming in and trying to — and trying to help us out, trying to help the little guy out against the big government.\"While Hughes helped kick out a door, others did much worse. Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, who spoke with 60 Minutes in his \"personal capacity and not on behalf of my employer or the city,\" was pinned, punched and beaten during the Jan. 6 attack. Hodges said he feels pardoning Capitol rioters would be the wrong move. \"If these defendants are pardoned, then so much of what they believe or believed on that day will be justified in their heads,\" Hodges said. \"That they, if they do it again, that they'll be protected. And it would be just incredibly destructive for the fabric of the country.\"Defending democracy or being duped?Hughes said he felt his actions on Jan. 6 were patriotic. He'd followed Fox News reports, read information online and listened to Trump saying the election had been stolen. Fox eventually paid $787 million to settle a suit that claimed the network repeatedly and knowingly promoted lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Trump himself is a Jan. 6 defendant in a separate prosecution led by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Trump was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly conspiring to overturn the election with lies he knew were false — the same myths that stoked rage in Hughes.A group of prominent conservatives, including retired federal Judge Thomas Griffith, spent a year investigating claims the 2020 election was stolen. Griffith was appointed by former President George W. Bush to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He retired in 2020 after spending years working with most of the 29 judges who've heard Jan. 6 cases. In the report he co-authored, \"Lost, Not Stolen,\" Griffith and other prominent conservatives said they found no evidence that fraud had changed the election's outcome anywhere in the country. \"And all of the evidence — not the speculation, not the conspiracy theories — all the evidence points in one direction,\" Griffith said. \"And that is that President Biden won, and President Trump lost.\"Jan. 6 protesters, Griffith said, were duped. But Hughes still believes the 2020 election was stolen. \"If I come to find out that I was dead wrong on this, that the election was actually legit and Joe Biden got the most votes in presidential history, I would be extremely embarrassed. I would hold my hand up and say, 'I was wrong, and I was an idiot.' I don't believe that though,\" Hughes said. \"And whether I was right or wrong, I believe what we did was patriotic, because we truly believed that the election was stolen, for a number of reasons. We really believed that.\"","summary":"Jerod Hughes, a convicted Jan. 6 rioter who helped kick open a door to the Capitol, still believes the 2020 election was stolen.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jerod-hughes-jan-6-capitol-riot-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/d3be5d29-0d82-43dd-bc82-6282bb494d8d/thumbnail/1200x630/cad88dfb0a7c859d4246196c548f4321/interview-jerod-hughes-sitdown.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/15/2372241987550/3195585_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:33:46","author":"Aliza Chasan,Scott Pelley","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Scott Pelley"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":256483176,"title":"Top prosecutor says Jan. 6 likely has \"most recorded crimes in all of our history\"","text":"As the 2024 election nears, Matthew Graves, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, remains focused on cases tied to the last time former President Donald Trump was on the ballot. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol that disrupted the counting of the electoral votes triggered the largest prosecution in U.S. history. Trump has called the rioters \"hostages\" who've been treated unfairly and has said he's \"inclined to pardon many of them.\" Top prosecutor Matthew Graves said the process has been \"the picture of due process.\"\"No one is being prosecuted for their views. They're being prosecuted for their acts,\" Graves said. January 6 convictions More than 1,000 Americans have been convicted in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, with about 350 trials still pending and the FBI still searching for suspects. Just two people have been acquitted of all charges. Graves explained the process of prosecuting the Jan. 6 rioters began the very next day under the Trump Justice Department. It set the standards for the prosecutions. Decisions were made by \"career\" prosecutors, who work at Justice for years regardless of who the president might be.\"The career prosecutors quickly realized that you needed guidelines in place, determinations about who was gonna be charged, who wasn't gonna be charged, and what they would be charged with,\" Graves said. \"That process started in January 7th, 2021, during the prior administration. To this day, we continue to use guidelines that the career prosecutors put in place during the prior administration.\"Those guidelines have prosecutors focusing on people who entered the Capitol, people who engaged in violent or destructive behavior, people who illegally carried firearms or other weapons on Capitol grounds and people who helped others to get into the Capitol building, Graves said. The Justice Department is not charging everyone who was there that day. \"We have turned down hundreds of cases where the FBI is saying, 'There is evidence here, it's your determination, prosecutors, whether you think this should be prosecuted,'\" Graves said. Graves explained that some of the cases have been turned down because they don't fit within the guidelines career prosecutors have been using. In some cases, prosecutors don't feel there's sufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The best evidence prosecutors haveThousands of hours of video and thousands of photos show the events unfolding. \"The crimes that occurred that day are probably the most recorded crimes in all of our history,\" Graves said.Video from that day captured the attack on Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges, who spoke with 60 Minutes in his \"personal capacity and not on behalf of my employer or the city.\"\"Someone was pinning me with a police shield, and another member of the crowd grabbed my gas mask by the filter in front and just started essentially punching me in the face while holding onto it, and then eventually ripped it off my head,\" Hodges said. \"And then he stole my riot baton out of my hands and beat me in the head with it.\"Many of the defendants have also admitted what they've done. More than 900 rioters — 80% of those convicted — have pleaded guilty. Charges range from trespassing to the most serious charge, seditious conspiracy, of which 14 people have been convicted. One, a militia leader, was sentenced to 22 years in prison — the longest Capitol riot sentence thus far.\"We've seen defendants in the January 6th [cases] take full advantage of all the protections afforded under the constitution,\" Graves said. \"To me, that's the picture of due process.\"Fighting claims of biasAll of the trials have taken place in open court in Washington, D.C., before judges or juries; the defendants choose which. Retired federal Judge Thomas Griffith, a conservative who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, worked with most of the 29 judges who've heard Jan. 6 cases. \"None of these judges is politically biased,\" Griffith said. \"These defendants had every chance in the world to defend themselves against these charges. And they didn't succeed.\"Some have claimed that the Biden administration is guiding prosecutors' work in the trials, but Graves disputes those claims. He noted that the Jan. 6 cases have been handled by career prosecutors and career supervisors across two administrations.\"I've never met President Biden,\" he said. \"Which is normal, I would add, because there are walls for very good reasons between the Department of Justice and the White House so that prosecution can focus on what it should be focused on, whether there are violations of law, and whether those violations of law consistent with the rules that we follow should be federally prosecuted.\"","summary":"The crimes of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot are some of the most recorded in history, top prosecutor Matthew Graves says.

About 350 trials are still pending and the FBI continues its dragnet for suspects. The attack that stopped the count of the presidential vote triggered the largest prosecution in U.S. history. But now, history is being challenged. Former President Donald Trump calls the convicted, \"patriots\" worthy of pardons. What is the evidence? We begin with the prosecutor in charge. U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves told us what drives the prosecution of January 6th.Matthew Graves: The crime was severe. It was an attack on our democracy. Once you replace votes and deliberation with violence and intimidation, you've lost the democratic process. You've lost the rule of law. But it's also about the victims, the officer victims who were injured that day, and making sure we hold people accountable for the harm that they inflicted on the 140 officers who reported physical injury.Matthew Graves has worked in the Bush and Biden Justice Departments. Now, as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, he's won more than 1,000 January 6th convictions and lost only two of the cases at trial.Scott Pelley: What is the best evidence that you've had?Matthew Graves: The crimes that occurred that day are probably the most recorded crimes in all of our history. You also have the words of the defendants explaining what they were going to do or what they had done.Evidence from the trials show many in the mob were determined to stop the count of the electoral vote that would certify Joe Biden's victory. They were enraged by President Trump's false claims of a stolen election. Scott Pelley: You must've felt strongly to drive 2,000 miles to Washington.Jerod Hughes: Yes, sir. I still feel very strongly.Jerod Hughes came from Montana. He's a married, 39-year-old construction worker with a daughter and a grievance. Jerod Hughes: The way this country's headed, my paycheck-- you know, my wife's disabled, and it's been hell for us to try to, you know, try to make it with the tens of thousands of dollars of medical bills, you know? And a lot of us see Donald Trump, the outsider, comin' in and tryin' to-- and tryin' to help us out, tryin' to help the little guy out against the big government. That's Jerod Hughes at lower right in the khaki cap, among the first inside the Capitol. That's Hughes, inside, at the door, kicking it out so the mob can rush in.Jerod Hughes: You guys don't want this. You don't f***ing want this! And we are f***ing mad! We are mad!Jerod Hughes: No matter how I look at it, I share some of the responsibility for everything that happened that day, letting people in, being a part of that mob. I didn't personally fight any cops or engage with any officers, but I have a lot of family that are police officers. I have a tremendous amount of respect for police, and I did not like seeing them being assaulted.Scott Pelley: We didn't see a lot of respect for police in that video.Jerod Hughes: Well, no. Absolutely. I mean, I'll hold my hand up and say I was wrong. I should not have been screaming at those cops. It's not somethin' I'm proud of.Others did much worse. Daniel Hodges: I became trapped. They pinned me against the door frame, and with my arms at my side I couldn't mount any kind of defense. Officer Daniel Hodges of D.C.'s Metropolitan Police defended an entrance known as the West Front Tunnel. Daniel Hodges: Someone was pinning me with a police shield, and another member of the crowd grabbed my gas mask by the filter in front and just started essentially punching me in the face while holding onto it, and then eventually ripped it off my head-And then he stole my riot baton out of my hands and beat me in the head with it.Scott Pelley: What were you defending?Daniel Hodges: Democracy.Democracy stopped for about six hours. The vote was counted at 3:44 a.m. With two weeks until inauguration day, it was the Trump Justice Department that set the standards for the prosecutions. Decisions were made by \"career\" prosecutors who work at Justice for years regardless of who the president might be.Matthew Graves: The career prosecutors quickly realized that you needed guidelines in place, determinations about who was gonna be charged, who wasn't gonna be charged, and what they would be charged with. That process started in January 7th, 2021, during the prior administration. To this day, we continue to use guidelines that the career prosecutors put in place during the prior administration.Scott Pelley: And how do they guide you?Matthew Graves: what we're generally focusing on, of the thousands of people who you could potentially charge that day, are people who actually entered into the Capitol, people who engaged in violent or destructive behavior, people who illegally carried firearms or other weapons on Capitol grounds, and people who helped others to get into the Capitol building.Scott Pelley: You're not charging everyone who was there that day?Matthew Graves: That is correct. We have turned down hundreds of cases where the FBI is saying, there is evidence here, it's your determination, prosecutors, whether you think this should be prosecuted.Scott Pelley: And why would you turn them down?Matthew Graves: Because they don't fit within the guidelines that the career prosecutors had been using, or we don't think that there's sufficient evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves told us that January 6th charges range from, essentially, trespassing, to the most serious, seditious conspiracy.Matthew Graves: So seditious conspiracy is a Civil-War era statute that deals with basically using force against the government to interfere with the operations of the government.Fourteen have been convicted of seditious conspiracy. One, a militia leader, got 22 years, the longest sentence of all. All of the trials have been in open court in Washington before judges or juries, the defendant's choice. but more than 900 — 80% — have pleaded guilty.Matthew Graves: And we've seen defendants in January 6th take full advantage of all the protections afforded under the constitution. To me, that's the picture of due process.But \"due process\" is not the picture painted at Trump rallies, including this last March. Announcer: \"Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6th hostages.\" \"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light…\" \"At the twilight's last gleaming…\"That's a recording of defendants in jail. Mr. Trump has said that he's \"inclined to pardon many of them.\"Former President Donald Trump (during March 2024 rally): Well, thank you very much and you see the spirit from the hostages and that's what they are, is hostages, they've been treated terribly and very unfairly, and you know that and everybody knows that and we are going to be working on that, soon as, the first day we get into office, we're going to save our country we are going to work with the people to treat those unbelievable patriots and they were unbelievable patriots and are… The former president has also revised the history of those who died.One of his supporters was killed by an officer defending the House chamber. Three other Trump supporters died that day—one drug overdose—two from cardiovascular disease. And a police officer died of a stroke the next day. In the debate, Mr. Trump acknowledged one death, but he said this in August.Former President Donald Trump (during August news conference:) When you compare them to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed. Nobody was killed on January 6th.Former President Trump is, himself, a January 6th defendant in a separate prosecution led by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Trump was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly conspiring to overturn the election with lies he knew were false -the same myths that stoked rage in Jerod Hughes.Scott Pelley: Where were you getting all of this information?Jerod Hughes: Well, a lot of Fox News, a lot of stuff that I read on the internet. Obviously, Trump himself, you know, saying that the election was stolen.Fox News paid $787 million to settle a suit that claimed that Fox repeatedly lied about the election and knew it. Scott Pelley: Were the January 6th protesters duped?Thomas Griffith: Yes. Thomas Griffith is a conservative, retired, federal judge who co-authored, \"Lost, Not Stolen,\" a year-long investigation by conservatives into the 2020 election.Thomas Griffith: The conclusion of the report was that there's no evidence that fraud changed the outcome of an election in any precinct in the United States of America.Scott Pelley: In any precinct?Thomas Griffith: And all of the evidence, not the speculation, not the conspiracy theories, all the evidence points in one direction. And that is that President Biden won, and President Trump lost.Judge Griffith was appointed by George W. Bush to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He retired in 2020 after working for years with most of the 29 judges who have heard January 6th cases.Thomas Griffith: None of these judges is politically biased. These defendants had every chance in the world to defend themselves against these charges. And they didn't succeed.Scott Pelley: You seem to be saying that justice was done.Thomas Griffith: Absolutely, justice was done.Justice for Jerod Hughes meant turning himself in and pleading guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding. The Supreme Court struck down that charge in another case. But if Hughes appeals, he'll face other charges that prosecutors dropped. So, after 20 months in custody, including prison, he's decided to just wrap up his last days of home detention.Jerod Hughes: If I come to find out that I was dead wrong on this, that the election was actually legit and Joe Biden got the most votes in presidential history, I would be extremely embarrassed. I would hold my hand up and say, \"I was wrong, and I was an idiot.\" I don't believe that though. And whether I was right or wrong, I-- I believe what we did was patriotic, because we truly believed that the election was stolen, for a number of reasons. We really believed that.Though the vote count was delayed, the transfer of power was on time with a new president emerging from that same West Front Tunnel defended by Officer Daniel Hodges.Daniel Hodges: If these defendants are pardoned, then so much of what they believe or believed on that day will be justified in their heads that if they do it again that they'll be protected. And it would be just incredibly destructive for the fabric of the country.Now, the trials, themselves, will be judged by voters who will decide whether the defendants were prosecuted as criminals or choir boys.Scott Pelley: The allegation is made that the White House is guiding your work.Matthew Graves: I've never met President Biden let alone talked to him which is normal I would add because there are walls for very good reasons between the Department of Justice and the White House so that prosecution can focus on what it should be focused on, whether there are violations of law, and whether those violations of law consistent with the rules that we follow should be federally prosecuted.Scott Pelley: There are people, maybe millions of people in this country, who are skeptical about what you just said. Matthew Graves: No one is being prosecuted for their views. They're being prosecuted for their acts.Editor's Note: D.C. Metropolitan police officer Daniel Hodges spoke in his personal capacity and not on behalf of his employer or the District of Columbia.Produced by Aaron Weisz. Associate producer, Ian Flickinger.

The 62-year-old actress shared details about how she met the Top Gun star, also 62, and the date they went on when they were both in the early stages of their acting careers. During a panel at 90s Con Florida on Saturday, she explained that they crossed paths at an audition sometime in the '80s, according to PEOPLE. They went out dancing at Club Lingerie, and Locklear — who admitted in 2013 that she was turned off by his dance moves — recalled that he was 'very nice' on their date. However, the self-proclaimed 'rock and roll girl' felt that their styles did not fit well together.

Jokingly, the Melrose Place alum added: 'He's even worse!' 'So, at that time, he was just like this little baby boy that I feel like I was a little bit older, and he ended up coming over to my house with Sean Penn,' she continued. 'And they were just nice, but he was very \"yes ma'am\" to me, and I was like, \"Okay, sir\",' she added. The Dynasty star, who previously said that they went out together because they were both new in Los Angeles at the time, said with a laugh: 'He didn't quite cut it.' She then shared more details about their first date. 'We went out dancing to Club Lingerie at that time, and I've said this before, I mean, he was really cute.' She also pointed out that she got to witness Cruise's dance moves and was one of the first people to see what ended up being his famous scene when he slides on his knees in his 1983 film Risky Business.

About the audition where they met, she noted: 'Neither of us got that part by the way.' The 'rock and roll girl' went on to have whirlwind romances with two rock stars. She married Mötley Crüe founder and drummer Tommy Lee in 1986. They divorced in 1993, and she married Bon Jovi lead guitarist Richie Sambora the following year until their separation in 2007.

Shortly after initial reports of shots being fired outside Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, the \"Alex Witt Reports\" host asked whether Trump’s campaign would begin calls for his supporters to begin \"toning down the violence.\" \"Do you expect there to be calls from within the Trump campaign to do that?\" Witt asked at the time. \"Because he will reach out to his supporters and say let’s take this down. We do not know the source of any gunshots or gunshots. We do not know who is responsible for this. The whole thing has yet to be 100% confirmed from start to finish how this all played out.\" She continued, \"But do you expect to hear anything from the Trump campaign about toning down the rhetoric? Toning down the violence? Or would that be atypical of the former president?\" DONALD TRUMP SAFE AFTER SHOTS FIRED OUTSIDE PALM BEACH GOLF CLUB MSNBC political analyst Elise Jordan remarked, \"Well, remember back to the assassination attempt from President Trump’s life and how there was talk of a new tone and the Republican convention was, by Trumpian standards, muted, and it did seem like he was trying to take it down a few notches. But then by the end of the convention speech, we were back to where we started.\" She continued, \"I don’t know how long this moment of unity for the country where we come together and say ‘I don’t want any political opposition to be under threat of violence. We don’t want that.’ I would love for us to have a unity-type moment, but I think it is probably going to be fleeting, as we have seen in the past.\" Jordan also wondered whether people on \"both sides of the aisle\" would work to \"take the temperature down.\" \"How have we gotten to this point when the demonization of the other side…it is no longer politics. It has gotten bigger than that, the calls for violence, the violent rhetoric and look at what happens. This heated rhetoric can only go so far before, unfortunately, it has led to violence on both sides of the aisle. So I think it is something that Democrats and Republicans have to be very cognizant about. What can we all do to take the temperature down?\" Jordan said. Fox News Digital reached out to MSNBC for a comment.

Ryan Wesley Routh has been identified as a suspect in the second assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump, law enforcement sources confirmed to Fox News. According to the news outlet, he was able to push the muzzle of his gun through the chainlink fence outside the golf club. The suspect was about 270-450 meters away from Trump. Earlier, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it was conducting an investigation into the shooting in the vicinity of Trump, viewing it as an assassination attempt. According to the FBI, its agents have arrived in West Palm Beach, Florida, and are \"investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination\" of Trump. The US Secret Service confirmed that its agent had opened fire on an armed suspect near the former US president’s golf course. The New York Post reported, citing sources, that the Secret Service had spotted a suspicious individual in the vicinity of Trump’s golf course \"and opened fire when agents saw what appeared to be the barrel of a gun.\" Later, the suspect was apprehended by the local police. Previously, an assassination attempt on Trump took place on July 13 at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed the ex-president’s ear. As a result of the shooting, one of his supporters was killed. The attacker, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by Secret Service officers. The US presidential election is slated for November 5. Incumbent US President Joe Biden was supposed to represent the Democrats at the election but he decided to drop out of the race after his poor performance in June in the debate with his predecessor Trump who later became the Republican presidential nominee. In July, Biden announced a decision to end his re-election bid and endorse Harris to replace him. The Democratic Party officially nominated Harris in early August.","url":"https://tass.com/emergencies/1843545","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:27:01","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.735},{"id":256483264,"title":"Trump assassination attempt live updates: Shooter named as Ryan Wesley Routh after golf course attack","text":"FBI shares pictures of rifle, backpack and GoPro 'assassin' had hidden in the bushes while lying in wait for Trump on his Florida golf course FBI says it's probing 'attempted assassination' on Trump after gunman 'armed with assault rifle' was shot at by Secret Service on his golf course J.D.

The FBI has confirmed the former president has been the target of “what appears to be an attempted assassination” at his golf club in Florida on Sept. 15. It’s the second alleged attempt on the life of the former president after a bullet grazed his ear at a Pennsylvania rally two months ago. O'Neil said the incident was “absolutely awful” and could potentially impact local politics. “It worries me because America is such an important and powerful democracy, and it does affect us here in Australia,” she said. “We’re very lucky here, and I never want Australians to lose sight of that.” She said Australia’s strict gun laws and a political culture where differences are resolved at the ballot box, rather than with violence contributed to the country’s stability. “This is not the case in many countries in the world, and it’s something precious, and it’s something we’ve got to value,” O'Neil said. “It’s a little bit fragile at times, and we need to support it and protect it.” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese noted, “The details of [the incident] are still coming out. So it’s not quite clear all of those details, but what is clear is that President Trump is safe. That is a good thing.” Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was relieved Mr Trump was not injured. “This is another dreadful demonstration of potential political violence,” she said, adding that it has no place in any society—[it] certainly has no place in a democracy.” A man was spotted pointing an AK-style rifle with a scope at Trump from roughly 400 metres away on the golf course, according to Florida authorities. U.S. Secret Service agents fired at least four rounds at him. It’s believed he was able to flee the scene, but was later taken into custody by deputies on nearby Interstate 95, and the former president was confirmed to be safe and well.","summary":"Clare O'Neil says Australians need to reflect on the fact that they're 'very lucky' to live in a country where political differences are resolved peacably.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/second-trump-assassination-attempt-could-have-impact-in-australia-minister-5724691","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/15/id5724693-bag-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:24:15","author":"Rex Widerstrom","authors":["Rex Widerstrom"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":256482536,"title":"Harris Expresses Relief that Trump is Safe Amid Gunshots, Condemns Violence in America","text":"(NEXSTAR) — Vice President Kamala Harris says she has been briefed after gunshots were reportedly fired near a Florida golf club where former President Donald Trump had been golfing on Sunday. In a statement posted to X, Harris wrote, “I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe. Violence has no place in America.” President Joe Biden has also reportedly been briefed on the incident. Trump’s campaign said Sunday afternoon that the former president was safe “following gunshots in his vicinity.” His communications director, Steven Cheung, did not provide any additional details at the time. U.S. Secret Service agents opened fire after seeing a person with a firearm near Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while the Republican presidential candidate was golfing Sunday, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. No injuries were reported. The person fled in an SUV and was later apprehended in nearby Martin County by local law enforcement, the officials said. In a Facebook post, the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said it has stopped a vehicle on northbound Interstate 95 and taken a suspect into custody who is believed to be connected to the shooting. The sheriff’s office said it made the stop after authorities in neighboring Palm Beach County put out a “be on the lookout” alert. Photos included in the post showed an SUV stopped behind multiple law enforcement vehicles. The post by the Martin County Sheriff’s Office indicated the suspect was apprehended near Palm City, Florida, about a 45-mile drive north of Trump’s golf course. Northbound lanes of I-95 were shut down, the sheriff’s office said. Two law enforcement officials also told The Associated Press that an AK-style firearm was recovered near the golf course. Sources told CNN that Trump is believed to have been the target. No additional details were immediately available. In an email to supporters, Trump said: “There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!” “Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” the former president said. Roughly two months ago, Trump was shot during an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, and a bullet grazed his ear. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NEXSTAR) &#8212; Vice President Kamala Harris says she has been briefed after&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris Expresses Relief that Trump is Safe Amid Gunshots, Condemns Violence in America first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/harris-expresses-relief-that-trump-is-safe-amid-gunshots-condemns-violence-in-america/","image":"https://www.cbs42.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/09/AP24256758566413-e1726441905350.jpg?w=800","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 23:13:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.628},{"id":256482380,"title":"Alleged would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh donated exclusively to Democrats since 2019","text":"Ryan Routh, who was arrested after allegedly pointing an assault rifle at former President Trump at his Florida golf resort, donated exclusively to Democratic candidates and causes since 2019.

The Mexican rock band shared a statement on social media following Nicky’s appearance at a Trump rally in Las Vegas. “Maná doesn’t work with racists,” read an image posted on the band’s Instagram page. A statement in Spanish on the caption read, “For the past 30 years, Maná has supported and defended the rights of Latinos around the world. There is no business or promotion that is worth more than the dignity of our people. That is why today Maná decided to remove its collaboration with Nicky Jam on ‘Pies a Cabeza’ from all digital platforms.” RELATED: Taylor Swift’s Kamala Harris Endorsement Triggers Megyn Kelly Into Meltdown: “Taylor & Her Boyfriend Travis Kelce Are The Epitomes Of Elite Snobs” Following Maná’s statement, many Latin celebrities commented to share their support. Alicia Machado, who won Miss Universe in 1996 when Trump owned the organization, replied, “Consistency in your actions is the balm of those who defend an ideal!

Standing in a room drenched in red and blue lighting, Jordan Coleman, the 29-year-old son of Eric Adams who released his debut rap album last year under the moniker, Jayoo, commemorated the day by recording music inside Gracie Mansion. Coleman’s music features drill rap, a hip-hop subgenre that Adams has publicly denounced for its association with street violence, as its lyrics often center around gangs. “Real Session,” Coleman captioned the picture of himself with an emoticon of the Statue of Liberty followed by “9/11.” The mayor’s son later attended rapper Jeezy’s concert with the radio host “Ogee Money,” according to an Instagram post by the The Push Effect on Taste Radio 1 host. The radio personality described the night as an “All Access” show he took Coleman along to after “the 9/11 sessions at Gracie.” In one video in the post, Coleman can be seen arriving at the Jeezy concert in a black vehicle with tinted windows. While Coleman recorded music, his father — who had COVID-19 — himself did not attend the annual ceremony that marks the worst terror attacks in US history. Adams instead hung a wreath outside Gracie Mansion that day in honor of lives lost. His absence was among several conspicuous no-shows from people within his administration who have recently been named in federal investigations. The meager showing by New York City officials drew disbelief among political insiders sources told The Post at the time. President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were all in attendance and — in a remarkable tableau — stood together at Ground Zero just hours after Trump and Harris faced off in their first-ever debate. Trump and Biden shook hands while former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared to facilitate a handshake between Harris and Trump. The campaign rivals then stood only a few feet apart, with Biden and Bloomberg between them.

JD Vance (R-OH) said former President Donald Trump is in “good spirits” after what the FBI reports to be a second assassination attempt on the former president in just two months. Vance took to X Sunday afternoon to share he spoke with Trump before the news of the gunshots at Trump International Golf Course in Palm Beach Sunday afternoon became public. “I’m glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” Vance wrote in a post on X. “Still much we don’t know, but I’ll be hugging my kids extra tight tonight and saying a prayer of gratitude,” he added. As Breitbart News reported, citing authorities, a U.S. Secret Service agent engaged a man who was stationed a hole ahead of Trump on the course: A U.S. Secret Service agent, per the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s office, engaged a man who had an AK-47-style rifle with a scope and backpacks and a Go-Pro. The agent apparently shot at the man, who then fled into a black Nissan and took off. A witness, per the sheriff’s office, saw the man fleeing and the vehicle and took pictures of it and the vehicle’s tag. Law enforcement were able to encounter the man and take him into custody on I-95 in Martin County, Florida. Apparently, the agents from the Secret Service travel a hole or two ahead of Trump when he’s golfing to secure the area, and that’s how the U.S. Secret Service was able to encounter the man before he was able to get shots off against Trump. While taking questions at a press conference alongside the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said that the suspect was approximately 300-500 yards away from Trump. “But with a rifle and a scope like that, that’s not a long distance,” Bradshaw said. The FBI confirmed in a statement that it is investigating what it believes to be an attempt on Trump’s life, as Breitbart News noted. “The FBI has responded to West Palm Beach Florida and is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump,” the agency said in a statement on Sunday. The ordeal comes two months after Trump was shot in the ear and nearly assassinated at a rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. After being shot, he emerged pumping his fist while shouting, “Fight!” as the Secret Service rushed him to safety.

The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Former President Barack Obama retweeted Harris’s post, and later posted about a golf tournament in Virginia, a move that drew some controversy online. Trump himself posted a statement saying “nothing will slow me down.” “There were gunshots in my vicinity but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL. Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER!” he wrote in an email sent from the campaign. The suspect has been identified as Ryan Wesley Routh, according to Fox News.

The former president was rushed to safety on Sunday after multiple shots were fired in his vicinity while he was playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach. A suspected gunman is in custody after the terrifying incident at Trump International Club almost exactly two months after a gunman tried to take out Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Multiple reports names the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh. Trump confirmed in a statement about an hour after the incident that he is ‘safe and well’ and didn’t want rumors to ‘start spiraling out of control.’ The 2024 Republican nominee’s bulked up Secret Service advance team spotted the shooter in the tree lines just two holes from where Trump was golfing. The FBI now says two hours after the incident that the attack ‘appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump.’ The armed suspect was posted up outside the club around the 5th and 6th hole, which a source familiar with the incident told DailyMail.com is a ‘vulnerable’ area of the course. Multiple police sources have confirmed to media that a ‘high powered rifle’ was recovered at the scene and that he was pointing the weapon towards the golf course on Sunday afternoon before shots were fired at 2:00 p.m. The suspect’s car is also in police possession. The area where the suspect was first spotted by his security detail was two holes ahead of where Trump was golfing at the time of gunshots, causing the individual to flee. Undergrowth is cut back in this area every summer and is one of the parts of the course closest to the road. The incident comes as Trump’s security detail has been ramped up in the two months after the former president was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13. Trump’s golf club is just five miles from his residence at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach and is where the former president is often spotted golfing when he is not on the campaign trail. Real estate investor and New York City landlord Steve Witkoff was Trump’s golfing buddy on Sunday, sources told DailyMail.com. The Palm Beach Sheriff’s Department held a press conference Sunday afternoon to provide updates on the shooting and revealed images of the suspect’s backpack, GoPro camera and AK-47 rifle left at the scene. ‘Nothing will slow me down,’ Trump wrote in a statement. ‘I will NEVER SURRENDER!’ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are aware of the shooting and ‘relieved’ he is not harmed. ‘The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,’ according to the White House. ‘They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.’ Harris, who just met Trump for the first time in person at their debate on Tuesday, responded to the shooting with a statement sharing the platitude: ‘Violence has no place in America.’ ‘I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former President Trump and his property in Florida, and I am glad he is safe,’ she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. United States Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a post on X: ‘The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m.’ ‘The former president is safe,’ he assured, adding that the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office will follow up with more details about the incident. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said he spoke with Trump moments after news broke. ‘He is one of the strongest people I’ve ever known,’ the senator wrote on X. ‘He’s in good spirits and he is more resolved than ever to save our country.’ It is still unclear how many people were involved in Sunday’s shooting and whether they were targeting the former president. It is also still not known if the suspect ever fired his gun or if the gunshots came from the agents who took aim at the alleged threat. But just the report of shots near Trump raises eyebrows as multiple investigations are ongoing into the shooting in Pennsylvania earlier this summer that left two dead, including the shooter, and two critically injured. Trump walked away from the assassination attempt with just a bloody ear that could have been a fatal shot had it been a few millimeters different and struck his head. But would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Service before he was able to get in another shot at the former president. Initial canvassing led to authorities discovering his car near the rally site in Butler with explosives and his parent’s home with even more bombs. Congressional and other local and federal investigations are ongoing to discover what led to the failures that allowed a shooter to get just a few hundred feet away from Trump with an AR-15 rifle. Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) is on the House Task Force on the assassination attempt. He said on Sunday that this proves the attack was not an ‘isolated incident’ and demanded the Secret Service brief the task force this week. ‘As I’ve said before, the July 13th assassination attempt was not an isolated incident that we can take our time investigating as domestic and foreign threats are ongoing,’ Waltz wrote on X.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe FBI is investigating a second assassination attempt against Donald Trump in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FBI Investigating &#8216;Attempted Assassination&#8217; on Trump at Golf Course\tpooling on Title: FBI Investigating &#8216;Attempted Assassination&#8217; Incident at Trump&#8217;s Golf Course first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/fbi-investigating-attempted-assassination-on-trump-at-golf-coursepooling-on-title-fbi-investigating-attempted-assassination-incident-at-trumps-golf-course/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-FBI-says-it039s-probing-039attempted-assassination039-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:50:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.442},{"id":256481660,"title":"Kamala Harris showcases a new unusual accent at the black caucus dinner","text":"Kamala Harris left listeners baffled as her notoriously changeable accent went through another transition in front of an audience of black politicians in DC on Saturday night. The Democrat nominee seemed keen to ingratiate herself as she addressed the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation at the Phoenix Awards Dinner. ‘Hello to all of my Divine Nine brothers and sisters!’ she hollered to the diners. ‘And to all my HBCU brothers and sisters.’ ‘Kamala Harris is whatever you want her to be, depending on which audience she is talking to,’ wrote one observer on X. ‘But I give her credit for being able to change her accent for so many audiences!’ The VP who spent her childhood in San Francisco and Montreal has long been accused of adapting her accent to whatever audience she is addressing. She raised eyebrows on the campaign trail in 2020 when she adopted a languorous southern drawl to excite one Florida rally with the words ‘We will tell them we were hangin’ out in a parking lot this particular Saturday afternoon with Kamala.’ She unleashed her Dixie accent again in July at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia, when she told her audience ‘You all helped us win in 2020 and we gonna do it again in 2024’. In 2021 she was even accused of slipping into a cod French accent as she spoke to scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. And her latest switch came just days after teachers in Michigan were left scratching their heads at her attempt at a Detroit demotic. ‘You may not be a union member but you better thank a union member for the five-day work week,’ Harris told them. ‘I’m from California. We all talk like this,’ an X user sarcastically wrote alongside a phonetic spelling of how Harris spoke in her remarks: ‘I’m gonna make sure to thanka union memba today.’ The VP has both Jamaica and Indian heritage and her vocal dexterity has been leapt on by Donald Trump after her GOP rival accused her of using her blackness to her advantage when it suits her. ‘I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,’ he said during the annual convention. ‘So, I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?’ The VP’s latest accent sparked similar derision from right-wing commentators after it she tried it out with her mainly black audience on Saturday. ‘Kamala Harris is speaking in front of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation so of course she’s suddenly developed a mysterious accent,’ tweeted conservative pundit Benny Johnson. ‘New? Or is it her old fake black accent?’ demanded Paul A. Szypula. ‘Either way, it’s incredibly insulting to black people. Shame on Kamala.’ ‘Kamala Harris revealed a new accent at the Black Caucus Dinner,’ added Steve Guest. ‘Despite a childhood in Berkley, California and Montreal, Canada, Kamala uses what she thinks is a Detroit accent, a southern accent, a French accent, and more…’ he added. The White House refused to comment when challenged over Harris’s mercurial enunciation earlier this month. ‘I have no idea what you’re talking about,’ spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. ‘She was talking about unions in Detroit using one tone of voice,’ Peter Doocy of Fox News pointed out. ‘She used the same line in Pittsburgh, and it sounded like she at least had some kind of a southern drawl.’ ‘Do you think Americans seriously think that this is an important question?’ Jean-Pierre demanded. ‘They care – you know what they care about? They care about the economy. They care about lowering costs. They care about healthcare. That’s what Americans care about. ‘I’m not even going to entertain some question about — hearing it sounds so ridiculous. ‘It’s insane,’ she added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris left listeners baffled as her notoriously changeable accent went through&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris showcases a new unusual accent at the black caucus dinner first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-showcases-a-new-unusual-accent-at-the-black-caucus-dinner/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-debuts-ANOTHER-bizarre-accent-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:48:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.048},{"id":256482274,"title":"JD Vance says he's glad Trump is safe after shots fired at Florida golf club, suspect in custody","text":"JD Vance says he's glad Trump is safe after shots fired at Florida golf club, suspect in custody Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance, released a statement on social media after the Secret Service engaged with a gunman who was seen pointing a high-powered rifle at the Florida golf course where the former president was golfing on Sunday.

The man was identified by three law enforcement officials who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to speak openly about the incident. He was allegedly armed with a powerful AK-47 assault rifle and aimed it through the bushes at Trump National Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, when the former president was playing a round of golf on Sunday. He was around 300 to 500 yards away from Trump at the time. West Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said in a press conference that, at around 1.30pm, Secret Service agents had spotted the butt of the gun through the fence and fired shots toward the suspect. It is not clear if the accused gunman opened fire. The suspect fled the scene, with a witness noting taking a photo and the license plate of his black Nissan SUV, authorities said. Officers from the Martin County Sheriff’s office in Florida, based near Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, tracked down the vehicle on the I-95 and captured the suspect. He has been taken into custody and is being held at the local county jail. The identity of the suspect has not yet been released. The motive for the alleged attack also remains unclear but the FBI is treating it as an “attempted assassination,” the bureau said in a statement. When he fled, the alleged gunman left several items behind at the golf club fence: an AK-47 with a scope, two backpacks with ceramic tile inside and a GoPro video camera which he allegedly aimed to use to film the incident. The incident comes just two months after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, back on July 13. Back then, gunman Thomas Crooks opened fire on the former president with an AR-style rifle from a rooftop of a nearby building. A bullet struck Trump in the ear while one rallygoer was killed before Crooks was shot dead by Secret Service snipers. Since that shooting, the Secret Service has faced pointed questions about the extent and competency of security details protecting the former president and other political figures.","summary":"Ryan Wesley Routh has been identified as the suspect captured in a black Nissan SUV on the I-95 after Secret Service agents foiled what appears to be a second assassination attempt on Donald Trump in two months","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-shooting-suspect-florida-assassination-attempt-b2613312.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/15/22/2171581774.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9EOsWNxd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-15 22:38:59","author":"Tom Watling","authors":["Tom Watling"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.727},{"id":256481440,"title":"Lawmakers, family react after learning Trump safe following second assassination attempt","text":"News that former President Trump was safe after gunshots rang out nearby as he played at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach had lawmakers, family and others reacting to the news.
