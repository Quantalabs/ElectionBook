About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 1 in 10 voters don’t trust either candidate, and a similar share has equal faith in them. The finding is a warning sign for Trump, who has tried to link Harris to President Joe Biden’s economic track record. The new poll suggests that Harris may be escaping some of the president’s baggage on the issue, undercutting what was previously one of Trump’s major advantages. The economy has long been a weak issue for Biden: A separate AP-NORC poll conducted in late June, before Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump, found that about 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy. Earlier this year, Americans were much more likely to say that Trump’s presidency helped the country on cost of living and job creation, compared to Biden’s. The new poll found that the economy is one of the most important issues for about 8 in 10 voters as they consider which candidate to support, dwarfing other top issues like health care and crime. The aftermath of inflation’s spike in 2022 to a four-decade high has pervaded this year’s presidential contest. Shoppers are upset over their grocery bills. Higher interest rates are financially squeezing the buyers of homes and motor vehicles. All that has appeared to matter more to the public than the low 4.2% unemployment rate and stock market gains. According to the AP-NORC poll, only about one-third of voters say the state of the national economy is somewhat or very good, although they’re more optimistic about their own situation, with about 6 in 10 voters saying their household’s finances are somewhat or very good. Both of those numbers have remained steady over the course of the year, despite falling inflation. The candidates have clashing ideas about how best to straighten out the economy, giving voters a stark choice that might hint at how partisan identity increasingly informs views of the economy and policy. But neither campaign has fully explained how its plans would be implemented. Harris insists her plans would be fully funded and not add to the deficit, while Trump’s team assumes — in defiance of most economic models — that growth will be high enough to offset the cost. Mark Carlough, 33, who works on medical records in Philadelphia, plans to vote for Harris and says he believes that the taxes on imports proposed by Trump would hurt most consumers. “The tariffs would be horrible for the economy,” he said. Richard Tunnell, 32, of Huntsville, Texas, plans to vote for Trump, just as he did in 2020. He’s not sure if the Republican has an advantage over Harris on the economy, but he noted that Trump has been a great businessman who remains one of the “richest men on the planet” even after filing for bankruptcy multiple times. “I believe this country needs someone to reach their hand in it and work it like a game of Monopoly and that person is Donald Trump,” said Tunnell, a military veteran on disability. Chantelle Breaux, 38, a stay-at-home parent from Lafayette, Louisiana, feels neither candidate has much to offer on the economy. She doesn’t plan to vote — unless a candidate more to her liking enters the race. “Kamala wants to put a Band-Aid where major surgery needs to be done on this economy,” said Breaux. “Trump wants to run the country as if it’s a business, but it isn’t a business that is going to support all of the people.” Former President Trump suggests growth would come from tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy leading to more investment, while a universal tariff of as much as 20% would direct that investment to building U.S. factories. Harris has campaigned on more benefits for the middle class to be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, saying that would help to contain costs and deliver growth. Her team has warned that Trump’s tariffs would lead to higher prices and worsen underlying inflation challenges. The economy is one of many issues shaping public sentiment as the campaigns seek to turn out their voters. More than half of voters said health care was a top concern, while roughly half said that about crime, immigration, abortion policy and gun policy. Only about one-third called climate change one of the most important issues for their vote, and about one-quarter said that about the war between Israel and Hamas. Trump and Harris are evenly matched in the poll on who would better handle crime and the war in Gaza. But the issues soon splinter in ways that reflect the distinct priorities of Republicans and Democrats. Trump has an advantage over Harris on whom voters trust to better handle immigration. This issue was a problem for Biden, as well: Illegal immigration and crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico have been a challenge during much of his administration. Republicans are more likely to care about immigration, the issue where Trump has a clear upper hand. Harris fares better than Trump when it comes to issues that Democrats care more about, including gun policy, health care, abortion policy and climate change. Rosamaria Nunez, a 68-year-old retiree in San Antonio, Texas, identified gun violence as the most important issue facing the country, saying it became personal when her grandson called her last year to be picked up because of a school lockdown. Nunez said she plans to vote for Harris, saying: “First of all, she’s a gun owner, so she can relate to the safety issue. She seems like she’s more in tune with a real person than Trump is.” Overall, voters see high stakes for the presidential election’s impact on the country’s future, the economy, and the future of democracy in the U.S., but they’re less likely to think the election will have an impact on them personally. About 8 in 10 voters say the election will have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of impact on the country’s future. About three-quarters say the election will have a similar impact on the nation’s economy and the future of democracy in the U.S. By contrast, half of voters say the election will have at least “quite a bit” of impact on them personally. --- The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted September 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.","summary":"About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/09/voters-split-on-whether-harris-or-trump-would-do-a-better-job-on-the-economy-ap-norc-poll.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/QE7AK44UUVEPJEGQK4CILHBCWU.jpg?auth=006739e47a5c6dc9d2cf9a360ed44813bc85e5dc181055a1f90c21802f5c8cc7&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:40:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":256867220,"title":"The Racism Is Elon Musk’s Fault","text":"To paraphrase former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, you wage mimetic warfare with the unsubstantiated smear you’ve got, not the one you want. It just so happens that the one most recently deployed by Donald Trump is the kind that proliferates these days on X. When Trump declared, seemingly out of nowhere, during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants living legally in Springfield, Ohio, were “eating the dogs … eating the cats … eating the pets of the people that live there,” he drew incomprehension, followed by widespread ridicule, from mainstream audiences. What came next was a furious and revealing national conversation on important questions of immigration, race, assimilation, work ethic, diet, traffic violations, duty (to struggling native-born constituencies and to newcomers alike), the limits of tolerance, the inevitability of its opposite, the nature of truth, and much else besides. But on the social-media platform that had provided him with the paranoid talking point in the first place, the discussion and reproduction of Trump’s outburst immediately gave way to the naked and sustained expressions of racism that have become emblematic of the website over the past two years. When Elon Musk acquired Twitter and changed its name to X, he promptly went about stripping its capacity for content moderation, reinstating extremist accounts, and boosting the reach and visibility of the worst trolls. I have heard many blithe rationalizations of the pragmatic and even salutary benefits of “knowing what people really think.” But the pervasiveness and normalization of what was, until very recently, niche and stigmatized bigotry has been astonishing to witness. Although there was plenty of racism on the internet during Trump’s first and second campaigns, it wasn’t this ubiquitous on mainstream networks such as Twitter. On Musk’s X, the racism has now become so relentless and self-confident that it amounts to a genuine qualitative difference. “If I had to summarize the intent of X’s algorithm at this point, it would be twofold,” Sam Harris remarked this week on his Making Sense podcast. “The first is to make Elon even more famous than he is. And the second is to make every white user of the platform more racist. If you could pipe the X algorithm into your brain through Neuralink, I think you’d probably jump off the table and go out and buy a Cybertruck and then join a white-supremacist militia. That’s the vibe I get when I spend a few minutes scrolling the homepage.” Consider a story shared, in the aftermath of Trump’s tirade, by a woman named Rebecca Christophi posting under the handle @rquietlyreading. She generated 1 million views and 11,000 likes for an anecdotal screed about her undergraduate experience sharing a dorm room with an older Haitian student. The roommate had a boyfriend back in Haiti whom she talked with on the room’s landline until very late at night: “It was torture. I could not sleep, I was barely able to stay awake in classes, but I was afraid to say anything to her.” When she finally confronted her roommate, asking her to take the phone out the door to talk, the young Haitian woman “started to cry—how she was affecting me seemed to never have occurred to her. The complete lack of consideration and her shock when I addressed it was hard to wrap my head around. It’s just not how most Americans function.” The post continues: “This is the issue, isn’t it? If you are bringing in thousands of ppl from other countries whose values/ideals differ drastically from yours, you are inevitably going to change your homeland.” At the end, she adds a “side-note” accusing the roommate of stealing clothes from her, and saying she “also cried when I asked her about it.” When one user pushed back—“I am sorry that your parents did not prepare you to tell your roommate when you wanted to go to bed. They failed you. You are projecting this failure onto the American value system in a way that is quite unfair”—that response led to a round of even more vehement and explicit racial hatred. “You’re so smug when you know the problem is that blacks are loud, obnoxious, and inconsiderate. They also struggle with impulse control. You wouldn’t tell a black that was loudly and rudely blasting music on the subway to cut that shit out because he’ll probably try to kill you,” someone wrote. “Nigs are gonna nig,” wrote another account that was verified through a paid subscription. I reached out to Christophi to ask if she’d intended her post to be read as invective against Haitians, and she replied in an email that no, it was just “a story,” its telling triggered by “the recent happenings in Springfield”; she “certainly did not expect so many people to see it or to respond with the hatred and vitriol that they did.” She said that people have since threatened her life and livelihood—which of course is egregious. And yet, in her message to me, she also doubled down on what she said were “accurate details about the effect of mass immigration.” If, she wrote, “the details coming out of Springfield are conveyed accurately, they only support my statements, for example, the mayor and city council appear to be receiving financial kickbacks for replacing a third of the population of their town with immigrants.” This is a perfect example of the “Great Replacement” theory in action—the idea that immigrants are being welcomed as part of a plot to steal control of the country away from white voters—and it is not true. There is no evidence that the residents of the town are being in any sense replaced. The choice of a quote from G. K. Chesterton that she shared at the end of the email dampened the sympathy her message might have otherwise elicited: “The definition of the true savage is that he laughs when he hurts you; and howls when you hurt him.” I am far from a hypersensitive snowflake on constant lookout for racial grievance, nor am I someone who could plausibly be accused of a lack of concern over creeping censoriousness particularly on the previous iteration of Twitter. On the contrary, I believe that maximal tolerance of free expression is crucial to American democracy, and I am deeply skeptical of both formal and informal censorship. I believe that it is vital for all of us—not just college students—to be put in contact with views we passionately disagree with. But through his revealed beliefs and example, Musk has debased the argument about the value of free speech and reduced the terms of this debate to its crudest possible units. With his nearly 200 million followers—a sizable portion of whom amount to cultists—he is responsible for tuning X’s digital culture into a gratuitously repulsive frequency. Astonishingly active and available on the platform that he so bombastically controls, he not only enables bad actors; he also personally praises and promotes them. Just a week before the presidential debate, Musk wrote, “Very interesting. Worth watching,” about a conversation between Tucker Carlson and the amateur historian and Nazi sympathizer Darryl Cooper. In that talk, Cooper claimed that Hitler had killed millions of Jews unintentionally, and that Winston Churchill was the real villain of the Second World War. Musk has since deleted the post, but such an endorsement from X’s apex user makes the spread of anti-Semitism not just likely but inevitable. One noxious meme that has been circulating lately depicts a smirking, hook-nosed figure wearing a kippah and rubbing his hands together. Behind him is a wall of cardboard boxes labeled Open Borders, Feminism, Cultural Decay, Globalism, “The Holocaust,” Hate Crime Laws, Climate Change, Gender Bending, Usury, Porno, and so on. “It’s all Jewish. Literally all of it,” a verified account claimed. This image, too, is a reference to the Great Replacement theory, and the idea that Jews are behind it. These sorts of grotesque posts predate Musk. But under his stewardship, they have absolutely lost their taboo. How could they not? As my colleague Yair Rosenberg has reported, Musk has endorsed that conspiracy theory himself. Last year, a Jewish user responded to anti-Semitic content on X by posting, “To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting ‘Hitler was right’: You got something you want to say? Why don’t you say it to our faces.” A small-time white-nationalist account wrote back to attribute anti-Semitism to minorities, and blaming it on the Jews: Rosenberg pointed out that “his exchange would have languished in obscurity had Musk not replied to this bigoted bromide with six words: ‘You have said the actual truth.’” Here’s something else that Musk, Trump’s wealthiest and most prominent backer, lamented not long ago: “Racism against white people is the only kind of discrimination that’s allowed.” As the depressing discussions of Haitians—and Jews and Black people in general—have made so inescapably plain, from the top of the Republican ticket down to the most obscure account on X, that is anything but true.","summary":"He’s not just enabling trolls; he’s personally endorsing their posts.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/twitter-x-racism-elon-musk/679928/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/NiqJFbtB8EHGuJxmP3_HUNQU_Cg=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/09/twitter_racism_final_horizontal2/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:33:00","author":"Thomas Chatterton Williams","authors":["Thomas Chatterton Williams"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":256865820,"title":"Trump left his mark on the federal bench. Can Biden match his number of judicial nominations?","text":"Washington — As President Biden prepares to close out his four years in the White House, he is on track to match or even surpass the former President Donald Trump’s total number of judicial confirmations. Appointments to the federal bench have taken on added importance in recent years as courts have played a greater role in American life as the adjudicators of disputes over hot-button issues like abortion, immigration and the environment. Trump closed out his single term with 234 appointments to Article III courts, which include the Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. His impact on the federal bench has been quickly realized, with Trump-appointed judges overseeing closely watched cases involving the abortion pill, the Biden administration’s immigration policies, student loan forgiveness programs and LGBTQ rights. Now Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is closing in on his predecessor’s 234 judicial appointments, as the Senate continues to churn through confirmations in the weeks leading up the November election. “The American people and senators and members of Congress and presidents all realize how important the courts are, especially recently,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who focuses on federal judicial selection. “They’ve given courts a lot of salience, and so I think they’re more and more taken into account as the third branch of government and an important branch, and you need more than just Congress and the president to do things.” Presidents and the Senate, he said, are “quantitatively and qualitatively wanting to get the most and the best judges.” Biden’s judicial nominations With four months left in his presidency, 212 of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominations have won approval by the Senate, a figure that includes Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic confirmation to the Supreme Court. Among those 212 judges are 44 that joined the appeals courts and 165 on the district courts. And with 29 nominees pending in the Senate, Mr. Biden could close out his presidency with 241 overall judicial appointments if they all are confirmed. Another 28 seats are currently open without nominees from the White House, according to the Judicial Conference, and many are from states with two Republican senators. The White House typically consults with home-state senators on nominations, though they can block a nominee to a district court. “Every judicial confirmation makes an enormous difference to the courts to which these judges will join,” a White House official told CBS News. The official said while there is a “real possibility” of Mr. Biden having more of his judicial nominees approved by the Senate than Trump, the number is “less important than what it signifies, which is confirmations of the most demographically and professionally diverse nominees who understand the power of the courts and their role within the system of justice.” While Mr. Biden is poised to top Trump in total judges named to the federal bench, he’s unlikely to match his predecessor’s appointments to the 13 courts of appeals before leaving office. The former president had 54 of his nominees to those courts approved by the Senate, compared to Mr. Biden’s 44. And with just five nominations pending, the president will likely fall short of Trump’s total. Trump, though, had the upper hand for making a mark on the federal appeals courts when he came into office, inheriting 17 vacancies after confirmations in the Republican-led Senate ground to a halt in the final two years of President Barack Obama’s term. When Mr. Biden assumed the presidency, there were just two open appeals court seats. Both presidents, though, put an emphasis on filling those vacancies first. “The decisions of district judges are binding on no other judges, while the decisions of the courts of appeals are theoretically precedents for all the district judges in the circuit,” said Russell Wheeler, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks nominations. “When District Judge Jones makes a decision, it’s binding on the parties, but doesn’t bind Judge Smith. But when Circuit Judge Jones makes a decision along with two others on the panel, that’s the law of the circuit.” Plus, the appeals courts are the “last stop in the process” for most parties, he said, especially since the Supreme Court agrees to review so few lower court decisions. The Republican-led Senate also continued to hold votes on 14 of Trump’s judicial picks after he lost the 2020 election to Mr. Biden, the first time a defeated president had a judge confirmed during a lame-duck session since 1980, according to Wheeler. Democrats lambasted the confirmations at the time as a violation of a “long and established tradition” of halting consideration of judicial nominees after Election Day, but the GOP’s willingness to break with that practice four years ago could benefit Mr. Biden during the upcoming lame-duck session. “The precedent is there, the nominees are there, the will is there, so I would anticipate that, taking a page from the McConnell playbook, that confirmations will continue in the lame-duck,” the White House official said, referring to former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Republican senator played a crucial role in the confirmations of Trump’s judicial picks. Beyond the total number of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominations, the president has aimed to diversify the federal bench. He has repeatedly emphasized his goal of ensuring the judiciary reflects the diversity of the American people, and has worked to name judges of varying personal and professional backgrounds. Mr. Biden set a record for the largest number of nominees to the appeals courts who worked as public defenders. More than 40% of those with lifetime appointments served as public defenders or civil rights lawyers, or worked to protect civil and human rights, according to a May memo from the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights highlighting the president’s 200th judge. Mr. Biden also notched another milestone when the Senate confirmed Mary Kathleen Costello to the federal bench this week. She became the 12th openly LGBTQ judge confirmed during his administration, surpassing Obama’s record of 11. He named the first Black woman to the nation’s highest court with his selection of Jackson, and has named more Black judges than any of his predecessors in one term. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Democrats in a letter earlier this month that confirming more of Mr. Biden’s judicial nominees is a priority for the coming weeks. But the upper chamber’s slim margins could complicate their efforts. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has cast tie-breaking votes for at least three candidates to the federal judiciary, is on the campaign trail working to defeat Trump in November, and five Democratic senators are in tight races to hold onto their seats. Democrats and four independents who typically vote with the party hold 51 seats to Republicans’ 49, though one of those GOP senators, JD Vance, has been absent from the Senate campaigning for the vice presidency. “On paper, Biden should be able to overall in lower court judges meet Trump,” Wheeler said. “Whether the closeness in the Senate makes that difficult is going to be the $64 question.”","summary":"Washington — As President Biden prepares to close out his four years in the White House, he is on track to match or even surpass the former President Donald Trump&#8217;s total number of judicial confirmations.

The £15 shirts are being sold at the merchandise stand at the National Exhibition Centre (NEC) in Birmimgham. Around 4,000 delegates are expected at the event, which will see leader Nigel Farage give a speech this afternoon. The Mirror spotted black and white t-shirts, which also have the Reform UK logo on them, on sale at the event. Both have labels saying 'made in Bangladesh'. They are among an array of merchandise on sale that also include caps, mugs and bags. It will come as an embarrassment for Mr Farage, who has previously spoken about the need to protect British businesses. Disappointingly for fans of the divisive former UKIP boss, his face doesn't feature on any of it. The Mirror has contacted Reform UK for comment. It comes as party bosses try to push through a new constitution which they claim will make it more democratic. But former deputy leader Ben Habib, who was ousted when the former UKIP boss returned as leader, has branded it an \"awful\" document and said it won't end Mr Farage's iron grip on the party. Mr Habib said: “This is not democracy. This is not the ability of the membership to remove the leader. This is the technical ability of the membership to ask the board to please consider removing the leader.” Elsewhere deputy leader Richard Tice claimed his boss was \"far from\" distracted by his trips to the US. Mr Farage has visited the US three times since being elected as the MP for Clacton, including attending the Republican national convention in Milwaukee two weeks after the election. He said at the time he was supporting his \"friend\" former president Trump in the wake of an assassination attempt. Mr Tice said: \"But as a leader of a party that is now becoming mainstream, international affairs, our relationship with our most important, strategic international partner - the US - is very important and the world will be a safer place if Donald Trump wins the presidential election. \"Nigel's strong relationship with Donald Trump is actually to the benefit of this country and it's quite right that he cements and strengthens that.\"","summary":"T-shirts on sale at the Reform UK conference in Birmingham carry the words 'Let's Save Britain' - but closer inspection reveals that they were manufactured in Bangladesh","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/reform-uk-flogging-save-britain-33713329","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33713387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EXCLUSIVE-MAIN-Recovered.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:23:35","author":"Dave Burke","authors":["Dave Burke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":256866638,"title":"Biden's Presidency Will Haunt Us for Years","text":"The latest New York Times/Siena College poll has some cautionary data for Kamala Harris and the KHive.

That drive represented a superb entry point into modern storage devices because, with read/write speeds of 6,800MB/s and 5,000MB/s respectively, it offered gamers a chance to reap the benefits of NVME PCIe Gen 4 technology without breaking the bank. The P5 Plus has sadly been discontinued now, and has had to be removed from our best SSD for PS5 list as the best budget option. The T500 looks to replace it, but after testing it out, it doesn’t fill that same gap in the market. Instead, this is taking aim at the biggest guns of the Gen 4 M.2 arena. Available in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB sizes, both with and without an integrated heatsink, it feels geared at PS5 players most of all. SSD MSRPs are about as trustworthy as Donald Trump’s Springfield pet-eating theories, but regardless, the 1TB T500 will set you back around $79.99 / £79.99 at the time of writing if you don’t opt for an integrated heatsink. Go for the PS5 no-faff option, and you’ll need to spend $89.99 / £89.99 on average. I tested the 2TB heatsink model for this review. Design For folks like me who were big fans of the Crucial P5 Plus, the design of the T500 made me think it was just a rebranding to begin with. All Crucial SSDs look identical these days, but the T500 looks almost exactly like the P5 Plus. All black and sporting a blocky, rectangular heatsink, the T500 is about as basic as these drives get in terms of aesthetics. That is, besides a breathing space in the middle of its heatsink that’s supposed to give it some additional airflow, but I’m not totally convinced this particular design actually does. Some of the best SSDs for gaming have spaces in between their heatsink panels, but in testing, this one didn’t have the same effect as the Corsair MP600 Elite, for example, which stayed incredibly cool under pressure. In practical terms, the T500 slots into an M.2 port with no bother at all, and sports the same 2280 form factor most of its competitors do. There’s some minor white branding on the top and bottom of the drive that labels what it is, but I don’t think these Crucial by Micron liveries are ever offensive. The white text here pops off the surface and gives it some character which otherwise feels absent compared to other manufacturers who give their heatsinks a bit more pizazz. Looks don’t tend to matter too much with SSDs anyway, since if you’re going to use them in the PS5 you won’t see them. If you’re slotting this into one of the best gaming PCs, you’re not going to be adding to your collection of RGB parts, but it does sort of look like something that would fit onto Christian Bale’s Dark Knight utility belt. Features The Crucial T500 features advertised read and write speeds of 7,400MB/s and 7,000MB/s respectively, which are fairly hefty claims considering the likes of the Seagate Firecuda 530 and even the Samsung 990 Pro are pretty much the only options known to hit those marks consistently. This is a drive that wants to tap out its NVMe PCIe Gen 4 interface, but based on its Gen 5 cousin, the Crucial T700 Pro, I didn’t think that was outside the realms of possibility. Each purchase of this drive comes with a five-year limited warranty, which is a nice touch. The endurance of this drive goes all the way up to 1,200TB though, so I doubt you’ll need to make use of that warranty for wearing out its lifespan. According to Crucial, the T500 should be able to load games like Call of Duty, Forspoken, and Valorant 16% faster than the P5 Plus and other Gen 4 SSDs can while outputting a 40% higher performance-to-power ratio. Granted, Crucial gives all the necessary caveats to say that your actual performance may vary, but I was intrigued to put these claims to the test. Performance Reviewing an SSD like this can be tough, because all of the promises a brand makes in their advertising and packaging should always be thought of more as ceilings of what their device is capable of, rather than a guaranteed benchmark of what they’ll achieve. So, when I tell you I’m a bit disappointed that all of Crucial’s performance claims haven’t been met by my testing process, it’s all relative because the Crucial T500 is still a pretty great SSD. Slotting this drive into one of our testing PCs brought about some intriguing results. Three CrystalDiskMark benchmarking tests produced an average sequential read speed of 7,102MB/s and a sequential write of 6,860MB/s. As the observant among you will realize, this is a fair few MB/s off the advertised ceilings on the box - moreso than the top three Gen 4 Drives we’ve tested thus far, the MP600 Elite, FireCuda 530, and Samsung 990 Pro. In fairness, the T500 surpassed the Nextorage NEM-PA Series, which failed to get over the 7,000MB/s read mark. Interestingly, the T500 didn’t blaze past the SK Hynix Platinum P41, even if it was tested in a different system. The P41 got a trailblazing 7,206MB/s read speed but was let down by its write speeds, which were down at 6,178MB/s. Overall, the T500’s CrystalDiskMark scores show it as a solid mid-ranger, but one that gives a nice balance between read and write speeds, where other drives either focus on one or the other or fail to bring both up to this kind of standard. The biggest issue I found while testing this drive, however, was its temperature control. After doing my benchmarking in a PS5, which I’ll come onto momentarily, I did think the drive felt a bit warmer to the touch than others with integrated heatsinks I’ve reviewed. Our testing rig only confirmed this though, because an ambient temperature of 29 degrees Celsius on a motherboard increased to 57 degrees after two CrystalDiskMark tests. This certainly explained why the drive’s third set of test results was its lowest, as temperature was clearly preventing efficiency. Inside the PS5, I found similarly mixed results. The console’s formatting benchmark test came back to me with a sequential read speed of only 5,571MB/s. Don’t get me wrong, the PS5 always undercuts the true power of Gen 4 SSDs like this, mainly because its motherboard can’t divert power to its secondary M.2 bay like a gaming PC can. Still, this seemed like a really low score for a drive that boasts advertised speeds of 7,000MB/s+ on its box. Luckily, general use tests found it was still capable in Sony’s console. It wasn’t quite as fast as the MP600 Elite in this regard, but it performed my God of War transfer test adequately. 48GB of Sony Santa Monica’s 2018 classic shifted from the console’s internal drive to the Crucial T500 in just 18 seconds, then back to the console in three minutes and eight seconds. For those who just want a broad idea of how all these performance figures scale up to load times in actual video games, I did our patented loading time stopwatch tests. Now, keep in mind that these tests aren’t perfect, and don’t account for human error (even if I’m pretty confident in my reaction time). These tests look at how a drive like this can serve you when you’re gaming with a PS5, and give a broad outline of how they can load up a large-scale multiplayer game, a slower game from last generation, and one that loads quickly anyway. As you’ll likely agree, these are respectable loading times, especially inside the PS5. Still, it’s important to note that you can pay a similar amount for Corsair’s MP600 Elite and get better loading times. That drive managed to boot up GTA Online in 48 seconds, and the Outer Wilds in 5.5. In fairness, will you really notice those extra few seconds? Arguably not, but if you can pay a similar amount of money for better results, you may want to. Should you buy the Crucial T500? Overall, the Crucial T500 is a solid mid-ranger in the current Gen 4 SSD market. In some ways, it feels like the brand shooting itself in the foot, though. The P5 Plus was an amazing budget option, but at the highest end of the market, this doesn't stand out in the same way. It especially doesn’t inspire the same confidence in me when used in the PS5, even if its general use tests weren’t that far off the best I’ve tested this year. Still, the T500 is more than capable of extending the internal storage of the PS5, or indeed the PS5 Pro. As our testing shows, the real benefits of this device come out when used in a gaming PC, but I’d issue a word of warning about the temperature control here. If you go for the model with an integrated heatsink, you’re going to be stuck with the sort of temperatures I came across, most likely. If you do want to bag yourself Crucial’s T500, maybe think about getting the version without a heatsink, and either using your motherboard’s included heatsink options or buying a heatsink separately to slap on top of it. One of the reasons I would recommend this drive is because I frequently get contacted by Crucial’s PR, who tells me about solid bundles and free games that come with a purchase of one of the brand’s storage devices. Beyond price cuts, which Crucial can be generous with most of the time, these are a welcome bonus, especially when the performance disparity between this drive and its rivals is fairly minimal. A free game along with this drive would certainly ease my sadness about the Crucial P5 Plus being discontinued. How I tested the Crucial T500 I put the Crucial T500 through the wringer in one of our testing PCs, as well as my PS5. I used CrystalDiskMark to take three benchmark scores of its sequential read and write speed, as well as the PS5’s internal formatting test. I kept an eye on temperatures through Windows 11, after a quick handling test to see how warm the drive was becoming under strain. I then used the PS5 to transfer data back and forth from the drive to the console, keeping note of the time it took. Then, I loaded up three separate games, three times each, and took note of the loading times with a stopwatch. I then took an average of all the times before presenting the results in this review.

Governor DeWine said “I hope [Trump] does” stop making baseless claims that Haitian immigrants in the city are illegal and eating cats, dogs and geese. Mayor Rue said a Trump visit would only further stress overstrained city and state safety services. Governor DeWine had brought in the Ohio Highway Patrol and Bureau of Alcohol and Firearms to augment Springfield safety services responding to multiple bomb threats to Springfield schools, stores and events. “As a visit from the former president will undoubtedly place additional demands on our safety infrastructure, should he chose to change his plans, it would convey a significant message of peace to the city of Springfield,” said Mayor Rue. Instead, Trump conveyed an ominous fear mongerIng message of his Springfield visit. “In the next two weeks I’m going to Springfield and I’m going to Aurora. You may never see me again but that’s OK. I’ve gotta do what I gotta do.” Trump said during a campaign speech in New York, where he was convicted on 34 felony counts for fraud. Trump’s falsely claiming that Aurora, Colorado has been taken over by a criminal gang from Venezuela. No mention of them eating cats and dogs too. Running mate Sen. JD Vance recently said he had “created” the fake story of Haitian migrants grabbing and eating pets to grab the media’s attention. Vance has never once visited Springfield. Not since he started his slanderous sewage spill engulfing Springfield or during his Senate campaign, despite his having grown up in suburban middle class Middletown, just south of Springfield. Trump-Vance endorsed U.S. Senate candidate Bernie Moreno visited Springfield Saturday and called for the legal Haitian immigrants to be deported. Bernie, the ‘Benz dealer, is a Bogota, Columbia legal immigrant himself. “What happened is that Sherrod Brown and Kamala Harris have waved the magic wand, corrupted our immigration system and shielded them through Temporary Protected Status and asylum - two loopholes in our immigration system that were corrupted by corrupt politicians,” Moreno extolled. Moreno’s opponent, Sen. Sherrod Brown is not a member of the Biden-Harris administration or in the Department of Homeland Security that granted the Haitian migrants TPS status. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said all those granted TPS status “Undergo and clear robust security vetting.”","summary":"In a joint press conference with Governor Mike DeWine, Republican Springfield Mayor Rob Rue discouraged a visit to the city by Donald Trump, who along with running mate Sen.

This strategy is designed to show that despite Russia’s advantage in missiles and manpower, Ukraine can, if properly equipped and fully supported, force Russian President Vladimir Putin to give up most of his revanchist goals to hold on to 20% of Ukraine’s territory. “Our Plan for Victory is fully prepared,” Zelensky said in a video address Wednesday. “All points, all key emphases, the necessary appendices with details to the plan have been identified. Everything has been worked out. The most important thing now is the determination to implement it.” “The president of Ukraine will address the U.N. General Assembly, meet with representatives of American defense and energy companies, and the Ukrainian community,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement. “The head of state will hold bilateral negotiations with leaders of countries and international organizations on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.” BIDEN, HARRIS, AND TRUMP TO BE BRIEFED: Zelensky intends to personally brief the decision-makers who hold the fate of his country in their hands, including members of Congress, President Joe Biden, and presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump. “Next Thursday, President [Joe] Biden and Vice President [Kamala] Harris will separately meet with President Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at yesterday’s briefing. “They will discuss U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression and Ukraine’s strategic planning.” “I’m looking forward to hosting my friend President Zelensky of Ukraine next week at the White House,” Biden posted on the social media platform X. “During his visit, I’ll reaffirm America’s commitment to supporting Ukraine as it defends its freedom and independence.” What Biden didn’t say was whether he would relax his restrictions on using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons, which Zelensky noted was an essential element of his plan to turn the tide of battle. Zelensky’s office also expects to meet with former President Donald Trump, who has been cheered in Moscow for promising, if elected, to bring the war in Ukraine to a quick conclusion even before he takes office. “I had a phone call with Donald Trump, and he said that he’s very supportive, and we had a good conversation,” Zelensky told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria this past Sunday, referring to a conversation from two months ago. “He understands how it’s difficult to survive during the war, and he will do everything to strengthen Ukraine. So I don’t know. I mean, that’s great that it sounds this way, but that’s why I wanted to share this plan to hear his reaction.” Asked specifically about Trump’s pledge to end the war as soon as he’s elected, Zelensky said, “Election messages are election messages. Sometimes they are not very real.” UKRAINE’S FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE: Zelensky’s victory plan tour comes as Ukraine is reeling from the unrelenting onslaught of Russian glide bombs and missiles, such as the one that hit a geriatric nursing home this week and destroyed Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital in July. “All our energy infrastructure, they destroyed 80 percent by these guided bombs, 80 percent,” Zelensky told CNN. “Right now, ahead of the winter season and during this particularly significant autumn, we have many issues that critically affect Ukraine and the lives of our people,” Zelensky said in a video address Thursday. “Of course, energy is an urgent priority.” But Ukraine has also had some notable recent successes that Zelensky hopes will demonstrate that his military is capable of seizing the initiative and deliver demoralizing blows to Russia, including a devastating drone strike that destroyed one of Russia’s largest ammunition depots, and its offensive in the Kursk region of Russia, in which thousands of Russia troops have been surrounded, and hundreds captured. Zelensky claims the Kursk operation has achieved its main goal of taking some of the pressure off its eastern front, where he says “heavy fighting daily in the Kurakhove and Pokrovsk” area is “extremely challenging.” “The Ukrainian Defense Forces have now managed to reduce the assault capabilities of the occupiers in the Donetsk region,” Zelesnky said, because Russia has been forced to redeploy some of its best troops to try to retake Kursk. “We have already managed to divert around 40,000 Russian troops to this area.” “Our active operations continue. The ‘exchange fund’ is also being replenished for us, for Ukraine. All these are important factors influencing the overall situation in the war,” he said.

HAPPENING TODAY: This morning, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. will host a National POW/MIA Recognition Day ceremony on the Pentagon’s River Terrace Parade Field. In addition to speeches, the ceremony will feature a flyover of UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters in missing man formation. The National POW/MIA Recognition Day honors Americans who were prisoners of war and those who served and never returned home. In a proclamation, President Joe Biden called on all Americans “to reflect on today and let us not forget those heroes who never returned home from the battlefields around the world or their families who are still waiting for answers.” “Today, more than 81,000 of these brave men and women remain missing and unaccounted for around the world. They will never be forgotten, and their courage, service, and sacrifice will always be cherished by our grateful nation,” Biden said. The Pentagon ceremony will be livestreamed on Defense.gov at 10 a.m. ISRAEL BOMBS HEZBOLLAH AFTER ‘GRIM BEEPER’ ATTACKS: Israel warplanes hit Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, including about 100 rocket launchers, overnight in one of the heaviest bombardments this year. The Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes were a preemptive action conducted in self-defense. “Hezbollah was preparing to launch an extensive rocket and missile attack against central and northern Israel, with thousands of rocket launcher barrels in over 40 launch areas aimed at the Israeli home front,” the IDF said in a statement. “In an act of self-defense to remove these threats, the IDF struck terrorist targets in Lebanon, from which Hezbollah was planning to launch their attacks.” “During the strike, about 230 launches and 20 aerial targets were identified crossing into Israeli territory,” the statement said. “Ninety percent of the launchers were from the heart of a civilian area, near civilian facilities such as mosques, schools, U.N. sites, etc.” The attack came as Hezbollah vowed a “just retribution and a bitter reckoning” for the mass explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies that have killed at least 37 Hezbollah members and maimed thousands more over the past few days, and as Israel’s defense minister has declared the start of a “new phase” of the war. “We will return the residents of the north securely to their homes,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday. TALKING TO TRUMP?: As Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) regroups after his failed first effort to get a temporary funding measure through the House, he has reportedly spoken to Trump about his call to let the government shut down at the end of the month if the stopgap measure known as a CR, or continuing resolution, doesn’t include a Republican provision that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. “Johnson told House Republican leadership colleagues that he’s talking to former President Donald Trump about his call to shut down the federal government and what options GOP lawmakers have right now as the funding deadline approaches,” Punchbowl News reported, citing “multiple sources familiar with the meeting.” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor yesterday to lambaste the speaker and offer an alternative approach to avert a shutdown in just ten days. “To the surprise of virtually no one, Speaker Johnson’s deeply flawed and highly partisan CR failed by a vote of 202-220,” Schumer said. “The ‘no’ votes included Democrats, Republicans, fiscal hawks, conservative ideologues, and people in between.

ProPublica reported this week that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. Harris, who will be in the Atlanta area on Friday to address the issue, on Thursday night heard from the mother and sisters of one of the women who died. During a livestreamed campaign event hosted by Oprah Winfrey and attended by Harris, Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Thurman, tearfully told viewers that “people around the world need to know that this was preventable.” Williams said she initially did not want to go public about her daughter’s 2022 death but ultimately decided it was important for people to understand her daughter “was not a statistic. She was loved.” Harris told the family, “I’m just so sorry. The courage you all have shown is extraordinary.” The vice president added: “This story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place.” Dozens of pregnant patients have faced delayed care or been turned away from hospitals amid medical emergencies over the last two years, a violation of federal law, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Violations occurred in states with and without abortion bans. But an AP analysis earlier this year found an immediate spike in some states with abortion bans, including Texas, following the ruling. Harris was the administration’s chief spokesperson on abortion rights when President Joe Biden was running for reelection, headlining rallies across the nation, and she is the highest-ranking U.S. official to make a public visit to an abortion clinic. Since becoming the nominee, though, she’s broadened her focus to a wider range of issues. Harris’ campaign is hoping that reproductive rights will be a strong motivator for Democrats in the November election. Republican nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, continues to take credit for appointing three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe. About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their vote – but it’s more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About 6 in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about 4 in 10 male voters. The gender gap doesn’t stop there. About 6 in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about 2 in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters, by contrast, trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris. Democrats point to a series of electoral wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, and advocates believe Harris is a strong messenger. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate she gave a forceful answer on how the bans have affected even women who never intended to end pregnancies. Harris has a long history of fighting for reproductive health issues, especially Black maternal health. Since taking over the top of the ticket, others have toured the nation talking about reproductive rights, including her husband, Doug Emhoff. In Georgia, Thurman had waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills, even as she developed sepsis. Family members told ProPublica that the other woman who died was afraid to seek help for the pain she was experiencing after taking abortion pills. She also had a lethal combination of painkillers in her system. Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN in Georgia, said the six-week ban has caused a “massive environment of fear and confusion and uncertainty” for the medical community. “Medicine is a gray area,” she said. Laws, though “are a blunt instrument.” She said Republican legislators who are now blaming hospitals and doctors are seeing the ramifications of the laws playing out in real time. “The law is preventing us from being able to provide evidence-based care without having to think about the risk of criminal prosecution,” she said. Harris lays the blame on Trump, saying in a statement that, “This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.” During the presidential debate earlier this month, Trump leaned heavily on his catchall response to questions on abortion rights, saying the issue should be left up to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban. But he has also repeatedly declined to say whether he would veto such a ban if he were elected again. Harris was making a campaign stop later Friday in Wisconsin following her visit to Georgia. Trump had no public events scheduled for Friday. ___ AP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux contributed to this report.

He drove to the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the socially conservative Family Research Council, planning to shoot it up. Corkins, who later cited the Southern Poverty Law Center for the proposition that the FRC is an \"anti-gay\" organization, was also carrying 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches, which he hoped to stuff in his dead victims' mouths. Corkins, who served as a volunteer at a local LGBT community center, was stopped by an unarmed security guard. In June 2017, a left-wing MSNBC afficionado named James Hodgkinson armed himself with a rifle and handgun. He drove to Alexandria, Virginia, in hopes of assassinating the Republican team practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game. He severely wounded then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who thankfully survived after receiving multiple blood transfusions and surgeries. Five others were also injured. Hodgkinson was a 2016 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign volunteer who, in a Facebook post three weeks before the shooting, wrote: \"Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.\" In June 2022, a young Californian named Nicholas Roske flew to the nation's capital. Roske attained a handgun, zip ties, a tactical knife, a hammer, a screwdriver, a crowbar, duct tape and other burglary tools. At 1:38 a.m. local time, about a half hour after a taxi dropped him off in front of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Chevy Chase, Maryland, home, Roske had second thoughts and called 911. After his arrest, Roske told police he was angered by the leaked draft opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization abortion case. Roske had written in a private chat: \"Im gonna stop roe v wade from being overturned.\" In March 2023, Audrey \"Aiden\" Hale, a transgender individual, slaughtered three children and three adults at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. A former pupil at the Christian school, Hale took precious time during the rampage to divert and unload seven rounds into a stained-glass depiction of the biblical character Adam in a church next door. As this column asked last year: Why, exactly, would a transgender former student of a Christian school return to that school to murder innocent Christian children and shoot up a stained-glass representation of no less symbolic a biblical figure than Adam? We don't necessarily need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out. Leaked excerpts of the murderer's manifesto corroborate Hale's sinister, anti-Christian motive. This Sunday, former President Donald Trump survived an attempted assassination for the second time in a span of roughly two months. The first would-be assassin, the mysterious Thomas Crooks, donated $15 to ActBlue, the well-known Democratic fundraising platform. The second would-be assassin, the considerably less mysterious Ryan Routh, has a prolific public record. Routh, a convicted felon and supporter of Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, had an over-the-top, creepy obsession with Ukraine -- one of the defining causes of the contemporary Left. Routh's social media accounts were rife with de rigueur left-wing platitudes about the alleged unprecedented threat posed by Trump to America's democracy and constitutional order. Murderous political violence in the United States today is not an all-of-the-above phenomenon. Yes, such violence must be condemned by all responsible political and civic actors, as we inch ever closer to an irrecoverable national abyss. But MSNBC's daily on-air histrionics to the contrary notwithstanding, all sides are not equally culpable for the terrible situation America finds itself in today. Trump may not always be the most circumspect rhetorician, but he has never actively called for his supporters to physically assault their political opponents -- including on Jan. 6, when he called for his throng of supporters gathered at the Ellipse to \"peacefully and patriotically\" demonstrate at the Capitol. The same cannot be said for Trump's opposition, such as when Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said earlier this year on MSNBC that Trump is \"unfit,\" \"destructive to our democracy,\" and \"has to be eliminated.\" According to a poll released on Wednesday, a whopping 28% of Democrats said America would be better off if Trump were assassinated -- and another 24% of Democrats confessed uncertainty. This is unconscionable. The Left has had a violent streak going back at least as far as Karl Marx's calls for a global revolution of the proletariat -- and the French Revolution even before that. And in today's post-truth world, an expedient narrative often trumps cold facts. But Trump is not a \"fascist\" or \"dictator.\" On the contrary, Trump's first term was, if anything, marred by excessive deference and an unwillingness to fire insubordinate bureaucrats. If MSNBC talking heads and their left-wing confreres fail to tone down the rhetoric, reasonable observers will conclude they agree with the 28% of Democrats who want Trump dead.

One to go.Wednesday's interest-rate cut might have marked the end of the Fed's fight with inflation, but it also signaled the start of another battle with an equally formidable foe: the job market.The central bank's jumbo cut shows the concern isn't prices continuing to go up, but the number of available jobs going down.Fixing the labor market is a tricky thing. It's not as if millions of people are out of work. The unemployment rate sits at 4.2%, which is pretty good. (Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was close to what you'd call \"maximum employment,\" and sees it inching up to just 4.4% by the end of this year.)But finding a gig is proving particularly difficult for those without jobs or unhappy in their current ones.Lower rates mean cheaper borrowing costs, which could lead companies to start hiring again. But there's a snag here, too. The key lending benchmark for everything from mortgages to corporate debt, the 10-year US Treasury yield, actually increased yesterday.That's because the market is forward-looking and had already started pricing in the rate cut before the announcement.It's also not necessarily a bad thing. The 10-year US Treasury yield going slightly up is a sign investors aren't expecting a recession, as that would require the Fed to quickly drop rates, but it also means borrowers might not get much relief soon.Still confused? Here's a full explainer on the dynamic between the Fed and the 10-year US Treasury yield.Meanwhile, the stock market is loving this post-rate-cut environment.Investors' favorite trade over the past year-plus — artificial intelligence — was booming on Thursday. Shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and ASML all surged. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index finished the day up 2.51%.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed at all-time highs.The good times could keep rolling if past Fed policy is an indication of future returns. The central bank's strategy looks awfully similar to its approach to avoiding a recession in 1995, according to one economist.Back then, the Fed eased rates from 6% to around 4.75% over three years. Along the way it sparked an economic boom and sent the S&P 500 soaring 125%.Meanwhile, the cut poses unique challenges for both presidential candidates.Former President Donald Trump downplayed the cut as either a sign of how bad the economy is or an example of the central bank \"playing politics.\"While Vice President Kamala Harris would normally celebrate the move as evidence of the economy's turnaround, doing so risks backing Trump's claim that it was a partisan move.The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

The former president claims Harris ‘spied’ on his campaign because Iranian hackers stole information and gave it to the Democrats in an effort to interfere with the 2024 presidential election, according to the FBI. He is also demanding the vice president resign in the wake of these allegations. ‘WHEN DOES KAMALA AND HER CAMPAIGN GO BEFORE A GRAND JURY ON IRAN, IRAN, IRAN?’ Trump questioned in an all caps post on Truth Social on Thursday. ‘MY CAMPAIGN WHEN THROUGH HELL ON THE RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA HOAX. THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE IRAN/KAMALA CAMPAIGN CORRUPTION CASE IS REAL!’ he concluded. It comes after Iranian hackers offered information it stole from Trump’s campaign to President Joe Biden when he was still the 2024 candidate up against the former president. Microsoft revealed in August that hackers tied to the Iranian government have for months been trying to influence the presidential election. And on Wednesday, the FBI claimed the cyber-terrorists sent unsolicited emails containing stolen information from the Trump campaign to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, is now questioning why the Biden or Harris campaign did not turn over this information or report it to authorities. ‘What did they do with Iran’s espionage?’ he questioned on X. ‘Did they contact law enforcement?’ ‘Is the Biden-Harris Administration colluding with Iran?’ In an all caps Truth Social post, Trump concluded the new report proves that Harris was spying on his campaign and demanded that his rival resign – but said she would only be replaced by a ‘communist’ candidate. ‘WOW, JUST OUT!’ Trump wrote on his social media site on Wednesday. ‘THE FBI CAUGHT IRAN SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN, AND GIVING ALL OF THE INFORMATION TO THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN.’ ‘THEREFORE SHE AND HER CAMPAIGN WERE ILLEGALLY SPYING ON ME.’ ‘WILL KAMALA RESIGN IN DISGRACE FROM POLITICS?’ he questioned. The new evidence claims Iranians sought to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into sensitive information from Trump and offering the material to Biden’s campaign. But in late July, Harris took over her boss’s reelection campaign and is now the Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November. A spokesperson for the Harriz-Walz campaign said they were ‘not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign.’ ‘A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.’ The spokesperson went on to say they’ve ‘cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities’ since they were informed of the foreign operation. Trump also spoke out about the hack attempt at his rally in Long Island, New York on Wednesday. ‘Biden is working with Iran and Iran doesn’t exactly like me because they were ready to make a deal, except we had an election that was rigged and stolen.’ There’s no evidence that any of the recipients of the hacked information responded, officials said, and instead prevented it from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election. The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Biden’s campaign before he dropped out on July 21 and endorsed his vice president to take his spot. The emails ‘contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,’ according to a statement from the FBI and other federal agencies. It represents the latest effort by U.S. officials to call out Iran’s brazen, ongoing work to interfere in the 2024 election, including a hack-and-leak campaign that the FBI and other federal agencies linked last month to Tehran. Additionally, the FBI uncovered a plot by Iranian-linked individuals to assassination Trump and other U.S. politicians and officials – like President Biden and former 2024 Republican primary candidate Nikki Haley. The Justice Department has been preparing charges in the latest breach.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump says a federal case needs to be brought against Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump inquires about Kamala Harris appearing before a grand jury following his accusations of spying on Iran. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-inquires-about-kamala-harris-appearing-before-a-grand-jury-following-his-accusations-of-spying-on-iran/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump-asks-Kamala-Harris-when-she-will.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:08:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":256866082,"title":"Former NFL kicker reveals why he's backing Trump and how he's trying to help turn a key swing state red","text":"Former NFL kicker and \"NFL on CBS\" broadcaster Jay Feely has endorsed former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election.

Feely believes that people in his state have a chance to flip Arizona back to voting Republican in the upcoming presidential election after Trump lost the state in 2020 to President Biden. However, he has a message to fellow Republicans in the state ahead of November. \"There's over 200,000 registered Republicans in Arizona that didn't vote in the last presidential election … If half of those people vote … just half the registered Republicans in Arizona, [Trump] wins the state of Arizona!

As reported by Raw Story, he stated, \"Finally everyone is agreeing that I won the debate with Kamala.

Zero self-awareness and no willingness to do the work.\" On Fox & Friends when Trump was asked if he would agree to a second debate, he said, “The first thing they did is ask for a debate because when a fighter loses, he says ‘I want a rematch.'\" He added, “I’d be less inclined to because we had a great night, we won the debate [although] we had a terrible network.” Harris’ campaign was quick to call for a second debate, and Fox News agreed to host it with Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier as moderators. As reported by Politico, MacCallum said, “Seems like the American people would love another opportunity to see these candidates. It’s been such a short window and they deserve as many opportunities as possible. We certainly hope they will take us up on that.” A spokesperson for Harris confirmed that she's open to a debate in October.

Historians generally trace the term to the year 1144 in Norwich, England, when the corpse of a 12-year-old child was found. As part of a campaign to establish the dead boy as a martyr and the church where he was buried as a (profitable) pilgrimage site, an enterprising monk wrote a series of tracts blaming local Jews for his murder. Supposedly, Jews needed the blood of innocent Christian children to leaven their Passover matzohs. Corrupt government authorities bribed by Jewish money were alleged to have covered up the crime. And so it has gone for centuries: a totally imaginary slander kept alive by bigots and crackpots from Russia to Southern California. “You are not forgotten, Simon of Trent,” wrote a gunman who shot up a synagogue near San Diego in 2019, referencing a slain toddler allegedly martyred in 1475. “The horror that you and countless children have endured at the hands of the Jews will never be forgiven.” Events in Ohio, however, demonstrate that antisemitism is far from the only form of racist scapegoating in America today. The Trump Cult has gone downright medieval on undocumented immigrants. Donald Trump himself calls them “vermin” who are “poisoning the blood” of (white) Americans. During his catastrophically bad debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, the former president charged Haitian immigrants in Springfield with unspeakable crimes. “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” Trump said as the split screen broadcast showed Harris looking on incredulously. “They’re eating the cats,” Trump continued, repeating an internet conspiracy theory that local police call totally unsubstantiated. They attribute the rumors to a Facebook post citing its source as a “neighbor’s daughter’s friend.” The author has herself admitted that she has no idea if it’s true, and regrets posting it online. Challenged by debate moderator David Muir, Trump doubled down. “But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there.” Would it shock you to learn that no such firsthand accounts exist? Not even on Fox News, presumably because nobody in Ohio can be found who’s willing to endorse so crazy a story even for the sake of the orange messiah. It would turn their lives upside down. For most Americans, kidnapping and cooking a family pet would be a more shocking crime than, well, pretty much anything I can imagine. That’s what makes it a blood libel: a false accusation that seeks to render its targets subhuman. Beneath contempt. It follows that anybody who would endorse it deserves nothing but scorn. For all the predictable whining of his supporters about how terribly unfair it was of ABC moderators to correct this grotesque lie, the simple truth is that Trump hurt himself. “You stupid mf’ers just got Trump to repeat your lie about the pets,” right-wing talk radio host Erick Erickson wrote on X. “Congrats on setting the news stories tomorrow by lying so Trump picks it up.” Yeah, well, nobody made him do it. The combination of Trump’s own ignorance, credulousness and bigotry caused him serious political harm. So, it’s only fitting that the worst vice-presidential candidate in recent American history not only doubled down on the libel, but went on national TV and bragged about it. Seriously, what is wrong with JD Vance? The reason he endorsed the anti-Haitian scare stories, he said, wasn’t that they are true, he admitted to CNN’s Dana Bash, but to correct news media bias. “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people,” Vance said, “then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast.” The normally unflappable Bash emphasized that Vance had just admitted the whole pet-eating business was a made-up story. The candidate didn’t deny it. “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,” he insisted. Meanwhile, the kinds of MAGA cranks who appear to see Trump as semi-divine and incapable of error sprang into action. The small city of Springfield was besieged by bomb threats and warnings of impending violence that led to school, hospital and university closings. Predictions of mayhem caused panic among the Haitian community. They are legal immigrants actively recruited to the community to fill factory jobs that had gone begging, as local authorities, business leaders and Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine emphasized. It’s all nonsense, a classic blood libel blaming the Haitians for the panic some benighted Ohioans feel at their Black faces and Creole-accented voices. To Trumpers, poor deluded fools, that makes them frightening and evil.

Memo: Celebrating a tradition that marks the change in power","text":"WASHINGTON — Hammering began this week on an inaugural platform outside the west side of the U.S. Capitol, a reminder of the transfer of power that will take place Jan. 20. The completed platform will be large enough to hold 1,600 inaugural guests, including members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, Supreme Court justices, former presidents and the new president and vice president, who could be Gov. Tim Walz. So, it could be fitting that in a ceremony this week celebrating the construction of the 60th inaugural platform, the first nail used to build the structure was made from iron ore mined and processed on Minnesota’s Iron Range by U.S. Steel at its facilities in Keewatin and Mountain Iron. And the hammer used was made by Malco Tools of Annandale. However, it was not Walz but rather Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the one who drove in that first nail, who made the decision to use iron mined from the Iron Range in the ceremony. “The Presidential Inauguration is a powerful symbol of American democracy and our country’s commitment to the peaceful transfer of power. Today’s ceremony marks the beginning of this cherished tradition,” Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. Meanwhile, inside the U.S. Capitol, another tradition was taking place — brinkmanship over the federal budget. An attempt to pass a short-term “continuing resolution,” or CR, that would fund the federal government past the end of the federal fiscal year, Sept. 30, failed Wednesday. The reason? The legislation would fund the government at current levels for six months, which Democrats say is too long without adjustments to the budgets of federal agencies called “anomalies.” It also had unrelated legislation attached — a bill called the SAVE Act that would overhaul voting laws to require people to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote. Democrats oppose the SAVE Act because they say many low-income citizens, especially minorities, don’t have passports, birth certificates or other documents the law would require and there is no proof that non-citizens are voting in U.S. elections, something that is already illegal. “I voted in favor of this legislation because it includes the SAVE Act, a bill that prevents non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, from voting in our elections,” Rep. Brad Finstad, R-1st District, said in a statement. Meanwhile, 14 Republicans, none from Minnesota, voted against the CR, mainly because they oppose short-term funding mechanisms that “kick the can down the road” when it comes to passing a new federal budget. So the legislation failed and there is a little more than a week before the federal government will shut down because of a lack of funding. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-4th District, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, took to the House floor to decry the effort to pass a six-month CR that contained the Save Act. She said Republican leaders in the House “wasted months writing bills loaded with extreme social polity that is rejected by a majority of Americans.” She also said locking in the current level of government spending for six months “would be irresponsible, and the Department of Defense has identified the consequences for our national security and negative impacts on our military personnel and their families.” “We should reject this legislation — pass a short-term CR — and roll up our sleeves and get to work,” McCollum said. So, House Speaker Mike Johnson has a tough choice to make. Will he try to cut a deal with Democrats and President Joe Biden on a three-month stopgap funding bill with some anomalies? Or will he stick to his failed plan and risk a shutdown of the federal government, something Donald Trump is urging him to do? Smith, AOC push big affordable housing plan Sen. Tina Smith. D-Minn., teamed up with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on a longshot proposal aimed at providing billions of dollars in federal funding to provide affordable homes across the United States. The legislation proposes a public alternative to private developers to meet the immense need for affordable housing, especially for low-income households. Under the legislation, a new social housing authority would function as both a bank and developer for resident-owned coops, community land trusts, public housing and other market alternatives. If it were to pass, the Homes Act of 2024 would enable the federal government to acquire real estate that would be turned into affordable housing, build new subsidized homes and apartments and finance other projects for rent or purchase. The bill faces long odds and has a steep price tag — about $30 billion a year. But Smith and Ocasio-Cortez say the time has come for social housing, which is used in Europe and a few communities in the United States. “Instead of treating real estate as a commodity, we can underwrite the construction of millions of homes and apartments that, by law, must remain affordable,” the lawmakers said in a joint op-ed published this week by the New York Times. “Some would be rental units; others would offer Americans the opportunity to build equity. These models of rent caps and homeownership are already working around the world, such as in Vienna and in some parts of the United States.” Noah Hobbs, of One Roof Community Housing in Duluth, was among those who helped the lawmakers introduce their bill at a press conference just outside the U.S. Capitol. He said “The Homes Act” is the first meaningful housing legislation in 30 years “besides those that responded to crises like the pandemic.” One Roof Community Housing builds affordable multi-family housing and has a community land trust that refurbishes existing houses and builds new ones for lower-income buyers. “We’ve seen that de-commodifying the real estate market increases affordability for those earning 80% of an area’s median income,” Hobbs said. Walz watch The governor was deployed by the Harris-Walz campaign to the South this week, where he traveled to Georgia (and where one heckler shouted, “You can take your hot dish and shove it!”) and North Carolina — both swing states. At a rally in Asheville, N.C., Walz initiated a week-long effort to mobilize young Americans to register to vote and go to the polls in November. But perhaps his most important job is preparing for the Oct. 1 debate with Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate. The New York Times said Walz is intensifying his debate prep and that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is serving as a stand-in for Vance. Meet you at the MinnPost Festival I will be attending the MinnPost festival Sept. 28 and am eager to meet some of our readers — and of course crash the VIP reception in the evening. I’m also eager to learn from some of the panelists the festival will feature and from readers who can tell me what kinds of stories interest them most. I’d love to hear what kinds of stories interest you most. This is my first MinnPost Festival, so I could use some tips from veterans. The festival runs all day Saturday, Sept. 28, and will feature CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Pulitzer Prize winning author David Rohde, Timberwolves Chief Executive Ethan Casson, Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous and many more really interesting people. Hope to see you there! ICYMI It’s the time of the election cycle that kicks off polling season, and MinnPost is not immune. In a joint effort with Embold Research, MinnPost is releasing a number of polls that reveal the political mood in Minnesota. Some ran this week. –One story showed Kamala Harris with a slim lead over Donald Trump in the state. -Another showed Walz’s popularity has been boosted by his new role as Harris’ running mate. -Still another looked at what Minnesotans — in the Twin Cities as well as Greater Minnesota — shared with pollsters as their top concerns. Your questions and comments A reader was concerned about a story on a poll that showed Sen. Amy Klobuchar leading GOP Royce White by 52% to 41%. “That two out of five support White, who is totally unqualified for the job, is disturbing,” the reader said. Another reader said he is disappointed that the Minnesota Republican Party does not recruit better candidates to run against Democrats like Klobuchar. “Non-DFL folks in this state limp along wondering when local GOP people will step off their death-march campaigns and enter the fray with serious players, serious tactics, and dedication to winning battles — and wars,” the reader said.

Responding to a question about food costs, Trump told the Michigan audience that his plan would entail both energy deregulation and protectionist restrictions on food imports, which, he claims, would help American farmers. Leaving aside that U.S. grocery inflation has been dead in its tracks since last year—prices are up just about 1 percent compared with summer 2023—Trump is in some sense correct: Reducing fuel costs could reduce food prices a bit if the energy-intensive American agriculture industry passed on the savings to U.S. consumers. And yes, restricting imports of certain farm goods, presumably via Trump’s favorite tool, tariffs, could boost the incomes of American farmers by shielding them from foreign competition. As a plan to lower grocery prices, however, Trump’s protectionism is ludicrous. If implemented, it could even return us to the bad old days of American grocery scarcity. Imports are essential to the U.S. grocery market today, and to its steadily increasing abundance. In 1980, the typical supermarket carried only about 100 different produce items. Selection was limited by North American growing seasons—good luck finding a strawberry in winter—and few Americans had even heard of, let alone tasted, products such as lychee or jackfruit. Today, the variety of produce items has more than doubled, and a stroll through those same aisles reveals an incredible variety. This is thanks to global trade. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 55 percent of fresh fruits and 32 percent of fresh vegetables in the United States are sourced from abroad. Much of this boom in international food trade is owed to agreements struck in the 1990s that allowed more products to enter the United States duty-free. The North American Free Trade Agreement, which took effect in 1994, improved Americans’ access to warm-weather produce from Mexico and specialty foods from Canada. Since the late ’90s, fresh-vegetable imports—mainly from these two countries—have nearly tripled. A standout example is avocados, about 90 percent of which are imported today, almost all from Mexico. Our southern neighbor also supplied more than half of all U.S. berry imports in 2023. Globally, the 1995 World Trade Organization agreements, especially the Agreement on Agriculture, significantly reduced worldwide food-related trade barriers. Since then, agricultural trade has more than doubled, giving the U.S. access to foods that would otherwise be unavailable or prohibitively expensive—not just produce but also meats, cheeses, and innumerable foreign specialty items. Bringing back food tariffs, as Trump proposes, would stymie this incredible progress, especially for foods that can’t be easily grown here, such as pineapples. With less available supply and new import taxes, prices would almost certainly rise. In fact, the U.S. already imposes tariffs and other barriers on a wide range of imported foods, including beef, seafood, sugar, and tomatoes. Studies consistently show that these trade restrictions inflate consumer prices. (Sugar, for example, costs twice as much in the United States as it does globally.) In theory, foreign exporters could lower their prices to offset new tariffs, as Trump is fond of claiming. In practice, however, this rarely happens. Evidence from the Trump presidency shows, for example, that American companies and consumers absorbed nearly all the tariffs’ costs, either through additional import taxes or higher prices for both foreign and domestic goods. Given that U.S. grocers already operate on thin margins (historically about 2 percent), the chances of these companies simply absorbing new tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to you and me, are minimal. Of course, if foreign food exporters did somehow pay new tariffs without raising prices, then the tariffs wouldn’t protect American farmers, as Trump says they would. The whole point of a protective tariff is to push consumers toward domestic goods by raising the prices we pay for imports. If prices didn’t change, then neither would the purchasing decisions of American shoppers. In short, if American farmers are earning more because of Trump’s tariffs, then we’re all paying more for the food they make. And if we’re not paying more, then “our farmers” aren’t earning more. Trump can’t have it both ways. As anyone over the age of 40 can attest, American grocery stores weren’t always the global fantasylands they are today. They were smaller, less diverse, and relatively more expensive. Trump’s plan to restrict food imports could drag us back to that era. So although we’re generally not fans of Kamala Harris’s “We are not going back” slogan, we’re with her in this particular case. We don’t want to go back to a time when, say, blueberries were the occasional luxury, and neither should you.","summary":"If you wish grocery stores were more expensive and offered less variety, then you’ll love his tariff proposal.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/09/trump-tariffs-grocery-prices/679942/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TlLkQdvktS4xddD0OOiZzUly-Sk=/0x61:2876x1559/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/09/trump_food_tax/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 11:00:00","author":"Scott Lincicome,Sophia Bagley","authors":["Scott Lincicome","Sophia Bagley"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.18},{"id":256864966,"title":"Biden-Harris swap could open up weakness in ‘blue wall’ voting blocs","text":"The Teamsters Union caused a stir Wednesday by releasing internal polling that found former President Donald Trump leading Harris nearly two-to-one among its members. The union subsequently declined to issue an endorsement, the first time it had not backed the Democratic presidential ticket since 1996. “Rank-and-file union workers like the Teamsters relate to Trump, a builder who has worked with many unions, to a person who has never created working-class jobs,” Dan Bowling, who teaches labor courses at Georgia State University, told the Washington Examiner. What may be even more worrying for Democrats is the shift in the support after Biden left the race. Rank-and-file Teamsters backed Biden over Trump 44.3% to 36.3%, according to the union’s own polling, but two polls taken after Biden dropped out found Trump taking nearly 60% of the vote, with Harris polling in the low 30s. Among the wider electorate, Harris’s numbers are vastly superior to Biden’s. She has pulled ahead in national polling averages after he trailed badly for most of the year. But blue-collar, noncollege-educated workers make up a notable voting bloc of the midwestern blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which will be crucial in deciding the election. Trump’s campaign says it is a strong signal for the former president. “Workers know Kamala Harris — and her support for a fracking ban, electric vehicle mandate, and other Radical Left lunacy — would be devastating,” Trump’s campaign said in a Wednesday statement. “President Trump has always had the backs of American workers — and always will.” The Teamsters union represents a largely male workforce of truckers, rail workers, and UPS drivers and has a historic independent streak. The group endorsed Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush before turning toward Democrats in the 1990s, and it is the only major non-law enforcement union that has not backed Harris this year. Still, the news represents a blow to Harris and possibly a turning point in the identity of both major political parties. Trump has heavily courted union voters this cycle, promising that fracking bans and electric vehicle mandates would gut energy jobs in Pennsylvania and wreck the auto industry in Michigan. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), walked a picket line with the United Auto Workers last year. According to a new Trump campaign ad, Harris wants to “end all gas-powered cars.” #Election2024: \"Kamala Harris wants to end all gas powered cars…Michigan auto workers are paying the price. Massive layoffs already started. You could be next.\"The Trump campaign is up with this new ad in #MIPol.

However, Trump led by 13 points with men, and by 27 points with white, noncollege voters. Harris’s support had also slipped relative to Biden among Black and Hispanic voters. Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner that the Teamsters are an exception to the rule and that most union voters continue to back Harris. Even so, he said blue-collar workers are especially concerned about inflation and need to hear more from her on that topic. “The No. 1 issue in all of those [swing] states is inflation,” Bannon said. “I would advise the vice president to be very aggressive talking about inflation.” And even if Harris costs Democrats with some union voters, Rep. Dan Kildee (D-MI) says she is the only person who can win the White House for his party. “If we have a shot to win this election, it’s with Kamala Harris,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Fair or not, we were not in a position with President Biden leading the ticket to be able to compete the way we are now.” Kildee stressed that union voters are not monolithic but said the Democratic Party has done more to support them over the years. “Despite the fact that many of the members of that union [the Teamsters] don’t vote for Democrats, Democrats didn’t say, ‘We’re going to let your pension implode,'” Kildee said. “We feel like the pension is a promise. When Donald Trump was president, he had four years to fix the problems in those pension systems. He didn’t do a thing.” Biden directed $36 billion to a Teamsters pension fund in 2022, the largest private pension bailout in American history.

Watch a video version here and subscribe to the show on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. It was the spring of 2014, and Chuck Sonntag just had his left leg amputated. The rare bone disease he’d been struggling with all of his life forced him to get the surgery, just like it had taken his left arm. Now he was in a rehab center, trying to recover, when he got a call from an old friend, the political operative Michael Caputo. Growing up, Caputo, Sonntag, and a few more buddies had a crew they called the Big Tree Boys, a reference to their neighborhood of Orchard Park, New York, right next to the Buffalo Bills’ stadium. They worked out a scam where Sonntag would use his disability to help the other Boys sneak into games. “I was in a wheelchair, and I would go around the gate and see what security guy would let me in for five bucks,” Sonntag tells me. “And then when he opened up the gate, all my brothers and my friends [would] jump on the other side.” The break-ins continued, even during the off-season. Sometimes they’d let themselves in to see the Grateful Dead. At others, they’d do a bit of shopping. “They had a lot of equipment over there. And so the first thing we hoisted was some bolt cutters,” Sonntag says. “And then we emptied out their tool supply, you know, the nice electric drills. We filled up the garage and sold them. So yeah, we did pretty good.” Caputo had already come by the rehab facility once to check on his friend and reminisce about old capers. But on this day, Caputo wasn’t calling with more well wishes. He was on a mission for his client, Donald J. Trump. It seemed Trump wanted to buy the Boys’ beloved Bills. Even more than that, he wanted to block one of his main rivals for the Bills from becoming their new owner, and possibly moving the team to Canada. That rival: the superstar hair-rocker Jon Bon Jovi. It was a battle Trump needed some local muscle to help fight, so he enlisted Caputo, who knew just the superfan to call. “Mike comes to me,” Sonntag recalls, “he said, ‘Listen, you got to do something. Trump’s gonna buy the Buffalo Bills. And he wants to know if the Bills fans still want them here.’ And I told Mike, I said, ‘Mike, I just got my leg cut off two days ago. What do you want me to do?’” What happened next in the spring of 2014 was weird and silly and short-lived. But it provided something of a preview of the decade to come, and how Trump would operate in it: the petty obsessions, the celebrity fights, the flex-in-the-endzone machismo, the run-ins with the law. When Trump tried to acquire the Bills, he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars, part of his ham-handed effort to prove to the NFL that he was rich enough to join the owners’ club. That was one of many, many times he attempted to land a deal by overstating his financial wherewithal, and it was one of the many, many examples the New York attorney general’s office used to prove earlier this year that the Trump Organization had repeatedly, serially engaged in fraud. Trump’s lawyers are appealing, but he’s right now on the hook for $450 million — that’s in addition to the roughly $90 million he owes E. Jean Carroll, and all the other court cases still in front of him, especially if he loses November’s election. Had Trump’s play for the Bills actually worked out, he might never have been in this position. In fact, he might not have run for president in the first place. “If he was doing that [owning and operating the Bills] and running that kind of a business, that would have been relatively new for him,” one former Trump associate tells me. “I think it would have been hard for him to then put all his energy into running for president.” Trump himself said as much in February of 2016, right after a debate with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush and all the rest, amid the campaign that’s upended our politics ever since: “If I bought that team, I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing.” THESE DAYS, TRUMP is more associated with sports like MMA and pro wrestling. But he’s been infatuated with football, at the idea of owning a football team, for far longer — more than 40 years. It’s easy to see the appeal, if you get inside Trump’s head: the glamor, the violence, the cheerleaders, the publicity, the power. Becoming an NFL owner meant “joining one of the most exclusive clubs,” the Trump associate says. “It’s like being a U.S. senator, being an NFL owner. There’s a very small number of people in those clubs. And obviously as a business, it couldn’t be more lucrative, right?” Trump showed in his early football dealings the same relationship to the truth that would become a hallmark of his political career, and the same kind of business acumen that led to his six bankruptcies. In 1981, Trump was part of a group that tried to acquire the Baltimore Colts; when the offer was rebuffed, he denied ever making it. Not long afterward, he passed on buying the Dallas Cowboys for $50 million. “In my opinion, only a loser can buy the Dallas Cowboys,” he said. (Today, the Cowboys are worth over $10 billion, perhaps because they had owners other than Donald Trump.) Instead, Trump paid an estimated $9 million for the New Jersey Generals, a club in the United States Football League, a fledgling alternative to the NFL, in 1983. Afterward, Trump quickly announced that he was on the verge of luring legendary Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula to the new, B-league team. “One of the little obstacles is he’d like an apartment in a building I have on Fifth Avenue called Trump Tower,” Trump claimed to sportscaster Brent Musburger. The next day, Shula said he was “not interested in the United States Football League and the New Jersey Generals in particular.” Trump did manage to recruit former NFL Most Valuable Player Brian Sipe to play alongside Generals running back (and future MAGA candidate for U.S. Senate) Herschel Walker. Trump also tried to woo New York Giants star Lawrence Taylor, promising to keep the negotiations and a $1 million signing bonus secret. According to the USFL history Football for a Buck, Trump “immediately” called “the various New York newspapers,” pretending to be his publicist, “John Barron.” Taylor never played for Trump (though he later backed him as a political candidate). Meanwhile, Trump was engineering a far bigger — and far more damaging — con. The USFL had early success by playing in the spring, when the NFL season was done and football fans were starved for action. Trump pushed the USFL owners to move to the fall and have their new league take on the powerhouse of pro sports head to head. Trump was clear in his intentions; he wanted the leagues to merge so he could get a big-boy franchise out of it. (“I have the money to get into the NFL,” he told his fellow owners, “and that’s where I plan on being.”) This was the business equivalent of the Charge of the Light Brigade, of Jonestown, of Sid and Nancy at the Chelsea Hotel. Somehow, Trump managed to convince those owners to go along. It was an instant disaster. The TV networks already had their Sundays filled. The stadiums were already booked for fall football, so the league champion USFL Philadelphia Stars had to play in College Park, Maryland, 127 miles away. In response, Trump and his lawyer Roy Cohn deployed a favorite tactic: They took the National Football League to court, filing an antitrust suit. “Is this action akin to a drowning man grabbing at razor-sharp knives to stay afloat?” a CNN reporter wondered at the time. Well, yes, even though the USFL actually wound up winning. The NFL teams really did collude to keep out competition (they literally had a playbook for doing so, written by a famed Harvard Business School professor, you can read it right here). But the jury also thought the USFL’s Trump-led strategy to play in the fall and directly challenge the National Football League was so insane, they awarded the USFL a whopping one dollar in damages. The USFL had hoped to win as much as $1.69 billion through the suit; they were counting on it, because the shift to the fall had so severely damaged their economic viability. Without that money, the league closed shop. Trump’s scheme to win an NFL team on the cheap had crushed not only his own dream but 13 other franchises. Trump looked at buying the New England Patriots a few years later in 1988, “but his people told him between the team and the stadium there was $104 million in debt, and that was too much for him to handle,” a source told The Boston Globe at the time. (Trump allegedly had a net worth of $1 billion by then.) Over the years that followed, Trump became close with many an NFL owner, especially the packaging-and-paper magnate Bob Kraft, who eventually bought the Patriots. Kraft’s star player Tom Brady was an even more intense object of fascination. Both in private and in public, Trump would float the idea of the comically-handsome quarterback dating Ivanka Trump. (“Tom Brady would make any father-in-law proud,” he told Playboy.) This kind of talk continued long after Ivanka linked up with Jared Kushner — so much so, it became a running joke in Trump Tower, according to former aide Sam Nunberg: “If Brady came up [in conversation] and Ivanka was in the office, she would talk about, ‘I told you he wouldn’t be a good husband’ or ‘I told you he wouldn’t be loyal.’” But Trump’s thirst for an NFL connection couldn’t be slaked through chit chat and a little light innuendo. So when the Bills’ longtime owner died on March 25, 2014 — the same week Chuck Sonntag had his leg amputated — Trump made his move. TRUMP FACED TWO hurdles. One was convincing NFL executives that he actually had the money to buy the team. Here, he employed another favorite tactic, the same one he had used to get a nine-figure loan on the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago — which according to court documents he’d told tax authorities was worthless — and to obtain the lease for what became the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C.: A judge found that he inflated the value of his holdings and got a major financial institution to sign off on the higher number. Trump’s underlings drew up documents in the early summer of 2014 stating that Trump was worth $5.1 billion and had $310 million in cash on hand. Deutsche Bank certified the figures, without taking “any independent procedures to verify the accuracy” of them, a prosecutor later noted. “Our understanding is that Mr. Donald J. Trump has made, or intends to make, a bid for the Buffalo Bills in the amount of $1 billion in the aggregate,” a Deutsche Bank managing director wrote. “It is our assessment that Mr. Donald J. Trump would have the financial wherewithal to fund his bid.” Trump upped the ante in a follow-up note to the Bills’ bankers at Morgan Stanley: “I have a net worth in excess of Eight Billion Dollars (financial statements to be provided upon request), comprised of substantial cash balances, highly liquid assets (including Class A real estate) and very little debt.” That August, Trump met with the Morgan Stanley executives in Detroit. The statements were not, in fact, provided upon request, as one of the bankers recounted at the civil fraud trial that this past February resulted in a $450 million judgment against the Trump Organization. “Do you recall whether Mr. Trump provided any documents to you at the presentation?” a prosecutor asked. The banker answered, “He gave us handouts of the Forbes list of the top-paid entertainers.” Trump’s second big obstacle was that another group of bidders had a major head start on the negotiations — and a famous face. Jon Bon Jovi had linked up with the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays to make a run at the Bills, too. Unlike their Manhattan-based rival, the Canada-Jersey crew seemed to have the balance sheet for a credible bid. Fans were worried about any new owners relocating the team, though, and the Bills had already played a number of games north of the border. That gave Trump an opening, and he knew who to call to crack it wide. A FEW DAYS after Chuck Sonntag’s leg operation, he got the call from Caputo, who had just heard from Trump. “He was going to make Michael Caputo the general manager of the Bills,” Sonntag recalls. (Caputo, for his part, tells me that’s just a Big Tree rumor. Otherwise, he wouldn’t comment for this story.) The operative showed up to Sonntag’s rehab days later with a couple of old members of the Big Tree Boys: a cop named Charles Pellien and a T-shirt maker named Paul Rudolph, who brought his buddy Anthony Lynch. All of them were civic-minded Buffalonians, raising money for local charities. (Pellien secured Kid Rock’s help for one benefit, and Lynch told me a story about a charity event that somehow involved a TV matchmaker and getting stuffed into an Elmo suit.) All of them were Bills fanatics. And all of them loved a good dust-up. “I mean literally, Big Tree Boys were a street gang. We would get in fights with other gangs in the street. It was like West Side Story without tunes,” one Boy tells me. They decided to start a group, 12th Man Thunder, which would push for the team to stay in their home city — and, more importantly, would publicly pound Bon Jovi and his associates for allegedly trying to take the Bills away. “Trump knew he couldn’t outbid the Canadians,” Caputo told GQ in 2017. But, with a little help, he could make them completely unpalatable to Buffalo. So the Big Tree Boys and 12th Man Thunder did. “We went to every restaurant and bar and told them they couldn’t play Bon Jovi,” Sonntag recalls. It worked. One radio station, then another, agreed to take the band out of their rotation. Jack FM 92.9 even re-recorded “Living on a Prayer” with new anti-Jovi lyrics. Businesses all over town hung up signs declaring Buffalo a “Bon Jovi Free Zone.” Pellian claimed local cover band playing Bon Jovi at a bar were booed and pelted with anti-Bon Jovi posters. Jon Bon Jovi wrote an open letter to the city, assuring fans he’d never move the Bills. The Big Tree Boys weren’t having it. “This is just like a politician saying what he needs to say to get elected,” Pellien told reporters, somewhat ironically in retrospect. “He’s saying what he needs to say to get his hands on our team.” Trump had to distance himself from the whole thing, because NFL rules said he couldn’t be part of any PR efforts surrounding the sale. But he seemed to keep tabs on the campaign. Once, Sonntag says, Caputo was driving him to a radio interview to promote their efforts when Trump called. “[Caputo] said, ‘I’m taking my friend to AM Buffalo about banning Bon Jovi,’” Sonntag recalls. “And Trump said, ‘Hey, how’s your friend doing?’ …That was pretty cool.” In the end, neither Bon Jovi nor Trump got the Bills. The Pegula family, who own the Buffalo Sabres hockey franchise, purchased the team. What would’ve happened if Trump had somehow won this fight in 2014? Would he still have run for president the next year? Nunberg, the former aide, says yes. “The reality TV boardroom helped propel him to the presidency. Can you imagine [the effect of] being an NFL owner?” he asks. Many others disagree. “Donald Trump called yours truly, that would be me. And he said that he wanted to purchase the Buffalo Bills,” ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith told his audience eight years later. “And I’ll never forget what he said to me. He said, ‘If they screw me over, I’m gonna show them. I’m gonna get them all back. I’m going to run for President of the United States.’ That’s what he said to me back in 2014.” https://youtu.be/jXflPQZAODY THE AFFAIR HAD all kinds of after-effects. Jon Bon Jovi said it “took years of therapy” to deal with the boycott campaign. He wouldn’t comment for this story, but he made it clear to GQ that he’s still not fully over what happened: “I won’t ever go back to the city of Buffalo. You will never see my face in Buffalo ever. I have knocked it off the map.” Texas A&M threatened to sue Sonntag and Caputo and friends for violating the school’s “12th Man” copyright. Trump hired a lawyer for the Big Tree crew, Sonntag remembers, while Caputo launched a PR counteroffensive and quickly turned the tables on A&M, portraying them as bullies picking on the double amputee. (Keith Olbermann declared the university president the “Worst Person in the Sports World.”) “A week goes by. The lawyer calls me, and he says, ‘Hey, Chuck, what do you want?’” Sonntag says. “I said, ‘What do you mean?’ They were suing me. ‘They want to pay you. Just call off the dogs.’ And so I said, quickly, ‘How about twenty-five grand?’” The group renamed itself Bills Fan Thunder, and uses the money to this day to buy underprivileged kids tickets to home games. Sonntag and the old Big Tree Boys still go to Dead & Company shows together. Pellien continues to help run the fan group, but his opponents have moved well beyond hair rockers. He participated in anti-lockdown protests during the pandemic, and started a “patriot” organization that some outside observers have likened to a far-right militia — a charge the group denies. At least one of the group’s demonstrations devolved into a brawl with antifascist counter-protesters. “My flashlight was dented,” Pellien wrote on Facebook, according to The Washington Post. “Not sure if it was from head #1 or head #2.” (Pellien wouldn’t comment for this story.) Caputo worked on Trump’s first presidential campaign for a while. In 2017, he was swept up in the various Russia investigations; he had previously been a PR man for Moscow’s state-run energy company Gazprom. In April 2020, he was appointed to be an assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services. Emails showed him trying to browbeat Centers for Disease Control scientists whom he accused of exaggerating the lethality of Covid-19. He apologized to department staffers for a deeply unhinged Facebook video, and resigned from the department after receiving a cancer diagnosis. Today, he’s a policy adviser on Trump’s 2024 campaign. About that. We all know what happened to Trump in the ensuing years. But it can be easy to forget the strangely central role that professional football has played in his political life. “What used to be considered a great tackle, a violent head-on… now they tackle. ‘Oh, head-on-head collision, 15 yards,’” he complained at a January 2016 rally. “Football has become soft like our country has become soft.” A few months later, then-Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan introduced the candidate at a rally in western New York, where Trump praised the team’s new owners before jeering at a protester, “Go home to mommy.” NFL owners and their businesses wound up contributing $7.7 million to Trump’s inaugural. That didn’t stop him from repeatedly going after the league when more and more players began taking a knee during the national anthem. “I have so many friends that are owners. They’re in a box,” he told Fox News. “I think they’re afraid of their players, you want to know the truth, and I think it’s disgraceful.” In a subsequent interview, he said of player-protesters, “Shouldn’t be playing, shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.” The controversy — and Trump’s attitude toward football — came up again in a 2019 interview with CBS. He was asked whether he’d let his son Barron play the game. “I would have a hard time with it,” Trump answered. “I mean, it’s a dangerous sport.”","summary":"For more than 30 years, he was desperate to own a team.

Here’s a rundown of who has endorsed whom: Harris’s endorsements Politicians Harris is endorsed by most elected members of the Democratic Party. President Joe Biden, who exited the presidential race in July, immediately endorsed her after his withdrawal, and the party generally coalesced around her candidacy quickly. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter have all endorsed her candidacy. She is also endorsed by several former vice presidents, including Republican Dick Cheney as well as Democrat Al Gore. Dan Quayle and Mike Pence have not made endorsements. Harris has the support of all 23 Democratic governors currently in office. There are three elected Democrats who are in reelection battles and have not endorsed Harris. Those include Reps. Jared Golden (D-ME), Mary Peltola (D-AK), and Josh Harder (D-CA). Three Democrats who are challenging Republicans in their House districts also have not endorsed Harris. Those include Lanon Baccam, who is running against Rep. Zach Nunn in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District; Adam Frisch, who is running for an open seat in Colorado’s 3rd District, and Janelle Stelson, who is running against Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) in Pennsylvania’s 10th District. Harris, however, is endorsed by hundreds of staffers, such as those of prominent Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush, and former Arizona Sen. John McCain. She also has the endorsement of McCain’s son, Jimmy. Some former Republican members of Congress have also endorsed Harris, including former Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Joe Walsh of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming. More than 100 former Republican officials also wrote a letter endorsing Harris, calling Trump unfit for office. “We expect to disagree with Kamala Harris on many domestic and foreign policy issues, but we believe that she possesses the essential qualities to serve as President and Donald Trump does not. We therefore support her election to be President,” the letter said. Organizations and business leaders Harris is endorsed by multiple prominent labor unions, including the United Auto Workers, Service Employees International Union, American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, and United Steelworkers. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate after releasing internal polling that showed a majority of its members supported Trump over Harris. It’s the first time since 1996 they haven’t endorsed the Democratic ticket. Multiple local chapters of the Teamsters, however, have endorsed Harris, including the Teamsters Joint Council 43 in Michigan, Teamsters Joint Council 39 in Wisconsin, and Teamsters Joint Council 7 and Joint Council 42, which represents 300,000 members across California, Hawaii, Guam, and Nevada. The Teamsters Black Caucus also endorsed the vice president. More than 90 prominent business leaders recently penned a letter highlighting their support of Harris. Those signatories included billionaire Mark Cuban, Earvin “Magic” Johnson, and former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, along with the former heads of American Express, Merck, Starbucks, and Yahoo. She is also endorsed by many civil rights organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign. She also has the support of groups that support stronger gun control like Everytown for Gun Safety. Celebrities and athletes Harris touts many celebrity endorsements, perhaps none more crucial than that of Taylor Swift, who has a wide and loyal following. She endorsed Harris immediately following the presidential debate and more than 300,000 people registered to vote from the link Swift posted. Harris is endorsed by dozens of other musical artists, including Billie Eilish and her brother and producer Finneas O’Connell, Cher, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Usher. She is also endorsed by dozens of Hollywood celebrities, including Matt Damon, Aubrey Plaza, and George Clooney. Harris is also endorsed by NBA superstar Steph Curry, Golden State Warriors and Team USA men’s basketball coach Steve Kerr, who spoke at the DNC, and NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul Jabbar. She is also endorsed by tennis star Coco Gauff. NBA superstar LeBron James, who sometimes dabbles in politics, has not yet made an endorsement, but he has endorsed Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Biden-Harris ticket in previous elections. He has expressed a distaste for Trump and was a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump’s endorsements Politicians Trump is endorsed by most elected Republicans, but some prominent ones have refused to back or comment on the former president. Trump’s third presidential bid has the support of Republican leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and rank-and-file members of Congress. Some Republicans who ran against Trump in the 2024 primaries have now backed him, including his strongest competition, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, as well as Govs. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) and Doug Burgum (R-ND), Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. Former GOP Govs. Asa Hutchinson and Chris Christie, who also ran in this year’s primaries, have not endorsed the former president and have been vocal critics of him. Trump has the support of many current and former governors, including Govs. Brian Kemp (R-GA), Greg Abbott (R-TX), Jim Pillen (R-NE), and Chris Sununu (R-NH) and former Govs. Doug Ducey, Scott Walker, and Bob McDonnell. Of the living former Republican presidential candidates and vice presidential candidates, just Sarah Palin has explicitly said she is voting for him. McCain, who ran alongside Palin, died in 2018, but Trump frequently criticized the Arizona senator. Quayle has not voiced his support of Trump either, and Dick Cheney is voting for Harris. The 2012 Republican ticket, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, are vocal critics of Trump and have not endorsed him. Pence, whose relationship with Trump turned sour after Pence refused to work to overturn the results of the 2020 election, said he is not voting for Trump, but he has said he could “never” vote for Harris either. George W. Bush said he will not be making a presidential endorsement this year. Every national Republican lawmaker running a race this year has endorsed Trump for president, save for three: former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is running for Senate, and Reps. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) and David Valadao (R-CA). None have voiced their support for Trump. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump in August. The former president also has the support of former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2020. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was pardoned by Trump in 2020, is also supporting Trump’s third bid for the presidency. Organizations and business leaders Trump is endorsed by various organizations, including the Fraternal Order of the Police, which is the country’s largest police organization, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the Associated Builders and Contractors. Billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, and venture capitalist David Sacks are all supporting Trump. He is also endorsed by X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is the only Fortune 500 CEO backing the former president in 2024. Celebrities and athletes Trump is endorsed by dozens of musical artists, including Jason Aldean, Kodak Black, Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Kanye West. Brittany Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’s wife, has shown support for Trump, and the former president recently praised her for “defending him.” Patrick Mahomes, who is a three-time Super Bowl champion, said he is not endorsing a political candidate this election. Brittany Mahomes, however, is reportedly rethinking her support for Trump after Trump criticized Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, for endorsing Harris. Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown and former NFL player and Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker have endorsed Trump. The former president is also endorsed by boxer Jake Paul and U.S. Olympian Caitlyn Jenner.","summary":"Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are raking in endorsements and vying for others from those with influence this election season.

Hundreds of attendees gathered for the town hall at Bushnell Events Center, with some even getting turned away due to a lack of available space. “My goal isn’t to preach to the community, my goal is to share my perspective as honestly as I can,” Ramaswamy said. “Where’d they come from? How’d they get there? How’d they come to this town that isn’t asking for all this extra help?” Mark Irwin, an Ohio resident, said. People like Irwin said they don’t blame the immigrants who came to the U.S. for a better life, but more answers are needed as far as the problem this community now faces. “I don’t actually blame any of the 70,000 people in Springfield for the mess in Springfield. Most of the Haitians who are here, at least our own government told them that they’re actually allowed to be here. I blame the government for that, but that’s a separate issue of legal immigration,” Ramaswamy said. Irwin added, in order to have these conversations, people need to be honest about the reality of these circumstances. “That’s the thing you hear people say, they’re taking our jobs – well did you want the job? They’re coming in and doing a lot of jobs we don’t want to do, and we have to be honest about that,” Irwin said. Ramaswamy said growing up in Ohio an hour from Springfield, he decided to hold the event because he wants to get involved whenever something in his backyard is getting national attention. Immigration seemed to be the main focus of Ramaswamy’s speech. “If you’re going to depend on government services or the welfare state when you enter this country, then you should not be permitted to enter the country,” Ramaswamy said. Ramaswamy said his goal for the event was to achieve unity in a sense of solidarity with the community. He hopes bringing some of the community members together Thursday can help inspire a positive and constructive path forward. “All of us are American regardless of our race or creed and that’s what made this country great the first time around and that’s how we’re going to make this country great again,” Ramaswamy said. Ramaswamy’s visit came less than two weeks after the city was thrust into the national spotlight after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed Haitian immigrants in Springfield were eating resident’s cats and dogs. City officials debunked those claims, but Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, continued to spread false information about Haitian migrants. Officials acknowledge growing pains from the influx of some 15,000 Haitian immigrants but say there’s no evidence to support the claim they are consuming anyone’s pets. More than 30 bomb threats have been made against schools, government buildings and city officials’ homes since last week, forcing evacuations and closures. Springfield also canceled its annual celebration of diversity, arts and culture in response to the threats, and on Tuesday, state police were deployed to city schools. On Tuesday, city officials said that misinformation and falsehoods about Haitian immigrants have sowed fear and division, disrupted learning and cost taxpayer dollars. In a statement, they begged public figures, community members and the media to “move beyond divisive rhetoric and instead work toward fostering unity, understanding and respect.” The statement did not mention Trump or Vance by name. Springfield Mayor Rob Rue has said the immigrant influx is straining police, hospitals and schools. He has also criticized the federal government, saying the city asked for help months ago. But he called on national leaders Tuesday to “temper their words and speak truth.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n“My goal isn’t to preach to the community, my goal is to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A large crowd gathers for a town hall event with Vivek Ramaswamy in Springfield first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/a-large-crowd-gathers-for-a-town-hall-event-with-vivek-ramaswamy-in-springfield/","image":"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WBNS/images/fe0e497b-0953-4fe9-ba3b-8c1c4dac7ff3/fe0e497b-0953-4fe9-ba3b-8c1c4dac7ff3_750x422.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:59:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":256864630,"title":"Harris Allies Continue Calling Trump 'Threat to Democracy'","text":"Two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump have not clarified the Democratic position on whether that Republican represents an existential threat to democracy. The White House still calls him a threat. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has mostly discarded that talking point. Trump wants it to stop either way. At least, when directed towards him. It is time to stop the lies, stop the hoaxes, stop the smears, stop the lawfare or the fake lawsuits against me, and stop claiming your opponents will turn America into a dictatorship. Give me a break, the Republican nominee said at a Wednesday rally in New York. Because the fact is that I'm not a threat to democracy, he continued, before turning around and using the rhetoric he just condemned against his opponents. They are. The problem for Trump: Harris has moved on from that rhetoric after the first assassination attempt. She did not use any of the democracy boilerplate during her debut rally in Milwaukee in July, and when she accepted the nomination in Chicago last month, she spoke in broad terms about freedom. This was a sudden change, as Harris was in the habit of denouncing Trump as a threat to our democracy. She used that exact phrase numerous times while Biden was still on the ticket, most recently on July 13, which was coincidentally the day of the first assassination attempt. It took Gov. Tim Walz a little longer. While he won national headlines for branding Republicans weird, the Minnesota Democrat also called Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, fascists. Are they a threat to democracy? Yes. Are they going to take our rights away? Yes. Are they going to put people's lives in danger? Yes. Are they going to endanger the planet by not dealing with climate change? Yes, Walz said at a press conference two weeks after the first attack on Trump. All the same, the change has been complete. And since joining the ticket, Walz has followed the lead of Harris. During the ABC News debate, for instance, she pointed to the Jan. 6 riot, and she took Trump s bloodbath comment out of context. The vice president did not, however, repeat claims that Biden first popularized by saying that democracy itself would end under a second Trump term. The problem for Harris: The Democrats working the hardest to put her in the Oval Office still argue that Trump could end democracy itself. Biden explained at the Democratic National Convention that he was leaving the ticket because that threat is still very much alive. He loved the job, the outgoing president said on stage, before adding, I love my country more, and we need to preserve our democracy. Sitting in the crowd, Harris beamed. The remarks came little more than one month after the first attempt on Trump s life. The second assassination attempt, this one in Florida last week and thwarted by the Secret Service before the shooter could open fire, did not change White House rhetoric. When pressed on whether it was appropriate to still describe Trump as a threat, an exasperated Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was not just saying that to say it. Instead, the Biden spokeswoman replied, they were using examples, namely the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol which she referenced more than a dozen times Tuesday. Insinuating that Biden had fanned the flames with his rhetoric, an assertion held by Trump and nearly every elected Republican, she said was dangerous. The press secretary repeatedly pointed out that the president and the vice president have always forcefully condemned violence in all forms, including political violence. And the condemnation of violence has indeed been universal. The switch from the old threat to democracy framework, however, has not. While Harris has turned the page on calling Trump a threat, Democratic allies are following Biden s lead, not hers. During a Thursday interview on MSNBC s Morning Joe, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returned easily and quickly to existential rhetoric. At the end of the day, this is a contest between freedom and oppression, between democracy and autocracy, between bringing people together and further dividing us, said Clinton, who hit similar themes at the Democratic convention. That exact message one Harris has shied away from delivering Clinton continued, has to be communicated every single day between now and the election.","summary":"","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/09/20/harris_allies_continue_calling_trump_threat_to_democracy_151652.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:56:42","author":"Philip Wegmann,RCP","authors":["Philip Wegmann","RCP"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":256864106,"title":"Memes and celebrity endorsements: Kamala Harris’ upbeat presidential campaign","text":"The U.S. presidential election has always been an event at the epicentre of media coverage and the public eye. No other election in the world is scrutinised and analysed as much as the one that decides who will be the POTUS. The reason behind the popularity of the U.S. presidential election–besides U.S.’ influence across the globe–is perhaps the fact that there are two parties and two declared candidates involved. As a result, the campaigning phase in the elections is an elaborate and lengthy affair with the candidates visiting, canvassing, and campaigning across states. In recent memory, the Obama campaign of 2008, referred to by many as the greatest presidential campaign, saw Barack Obama pull one of the greatest upsets in U.S. election history. It was one of the first campaigns in history that utilised the internet and social media to sway voters and make policies known to record a remarkable victory. The 2024 U.S. presidential election has been a chaotic and tumultuous affair, to say the least–some have called it a circus, and justifiably so. While initially slated to be a fight between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the race to White House took dramatic turns as people grasped the new sequence of events unfolding everyday. The timely, untimely nomination Kamala Harris, the incumbent Vice President, announced her campaign for the 2024 U.S. presidential election on July 21, 2024, after President Joe Biden withdrew his bid for re-election and endorsed her. While initially seeming reluctant to withdraw, Biden’s move came as a surprise for many given the limited time before the polling would be underway. Despite the limited time at her disposal, Kamala Harris has endeavoured to put on a formidable campaign. On July 22, 2024, Harris secured enough delegate endorsements to become the presumptive Democratic nominee, officially confirmed through a roll call vote in early August. When Harris took the reins of the Democratic party in her hands, many lauded the move as a welcome change for the party, drawing parallels to a Hollywood glow up. Donations started pouring in as soon as Harris’ candidature received the official seal. Harris' campaign raised $81 million in small-dollar donations in the first 24 hours, breaking fundraising records. By August 1, the campaign had raised $310 million. The viral appeal ‘Join the call’ circulated almost daily since Harris launched her presidential campaign in the weeks that followed. Zoom webinar links and organising calls appeared across social media feeds and email listservs, targeting a wide variety of demographic groups including White Dudes for Harris, South Asian Women for Harris, Latinas for Harris, Native Women + Two Spirit for Harris, Women for Harris, Caribbean-Americans for Harris, Filipino Americans for Harris, Disabled Voters for Harris, Win With Black Women, Win With Black Men, and White Women that could play a key role in Harris' coalition. Over $15 million had been raised through virtual grassroots events in the past week, according to a CBS News analysis. Harris announced on August 6 that she had chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the election. “As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his,\" Harris wrote in a statement. \"We are going to build a great partnership.\" Harris' team ensured that no move of hers stays undocumented with videos of every major milestine being captured and shared across her socials. View this post on Instagram In the 24 hours after announcing Tim Walz as Harris' running mate, the campaign raised $36 million. Compared to Biden’s campaign, Harris relies on a broader and more diverse team of advisors. Full-throttle campaign mode Harris adopted Beyoncé's song ‘Freedom’ as the official anthem for her campaign, with permission secured from Parkwood Entertainment on the day of her first rally. In the same month, after Trump played Foo Fighters' ‘My Hero’ at a rally without permission, the band declared that any royalties generated from its use would be donated to Harris' campaign, indicating growing support for Harris. Further, a digital ad featuring ‘Freedom’ was launched on July 25. On August 8, Harris' team released an ad called ‘Determination’ in both English and Spanish, targeting Latino voters in key states. The next day, another ad titled ‘Tougher’ highlighted Harris’ background as a ‘border-state prosecutor’. View this post on Instagram Harris’s first rally took place on July 23, 2024, at West Allis Central High School in Wisconsin, where turnout reportedly surpassed that of any Biden campaign event, with spokesperson Kevin Muñoz estimating attendance at 3,000. A week later, on July 30, Harris held an event at Georgia State University’s convocation centre in Atlanta, drawing 8,000 attendees. There, she directly challenged Trump to face her on the debate stage. Megan Thee Stallion performed and discussed reproductive rights, while Quavo spoke about gun violence prevention. Harris’s official campaign website also lists merchandise for supporters to shop including t-shirts, yard signs, and stickers. A noteworthy incident that happened at a rally dubbed \"I'm speaking\" incident, became a burning topic of conversations across the internet. At a rally at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on August 7, Kamala Harris was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters who chanted, \"Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won't vote for genocide!\" In response, Harris said, \"I'm here because we believe in democracy. Everyone's voice matters, but I am speaking now. I am speaking now.\" When the disruptions continued, she added, \"If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking,\" followed by a sharp look at the protesters. Her supporters soon drowned out the protesters with cheers, as they were escorted out of the venue. .@KamalaHarris to protesters at her Detroit rally: \"You know what, if you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.\" pic.twitter.com/iUYhOJnAQr — CSPAN (@cspan) August 8, 2024 Harris' campaign has been framed as \"a choice between freedom and chaos,\" centred around the themes of \"freedom\" and \"the future.\" Her team has emphasised her background as an attorney general and prosecutor to build a case against Trump, particularly highlighting his 34 felony charges. Running as a moderate Democrat, Harris has shifted some of her policy positions since her 2019 campaign, aligning more closely with Biden on domestic issues, especially focusing on reproductive healthcare, criminal justice, and civil rights. Her campaign has also been noted for its optimistic and upbeat tone. In July, a key messaging shift involved calling Republicans, including Trump and his running mate JD Vance, \"weird,\" a label also used by Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, and others in the Democratic Party. Harris has been rather vocal with her comments on Trump. At a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Harris commented on Trump's attacks, saying, \"You may have noticed, Donald Trump has been resorting to wild lies about my record. And some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it's just plain weird.\" This focus on \"freedom\" marks a shift from Biden's emphasis on democracy. The Harris-Walz campaign has launched multiple ads focusing on the issues they are fighting and attacking Donald Trump and his policies. Among the issues that Harris supports and that have been highlighted in her campaign are national abortion protections, LGBTQ+ rights, gun control, and legislation to address climate change. She also supports federal cannabis legalisation, strengthening voting rights, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, and the federal funding of housing. On the basis of these, her team has tried to position her as a progressive leader who is inclusive and a leader that America needs to The hip Veep Kamala Harris’s campaign has been marked for its extensive usage of social media to tap into the young voter base. Harris’s popularity has risen significantly after her nomination announcement. The Vice President has a social media presence across platforms including X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook. Harris also has a bilingual WhatsApp channel to target Latino voters. Harris’s social media accounts have been fairly active since the time of her nomination and have consistently updated followers about her campaign updates. View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram Harris’ social media updates seem to have a personalised touch to them, in an attempt to make people feel more connected to her as a person and stay in touch with her routine. View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram View this post on Instagram Given Kamala Harris’ popularity among the younger generation, as soon as she entered the presidential race, a sea of memes and reels started pooping on social media. Suddenly, a generation that seemingly couldn’t connect with the earlier nominees namely Biden and Trump given their age, was involved in political discussions and emotionally invested in a candidate they could relate to or perhaps look up to. A-list backing Perhaps the biggest highlight of the Harris-Walz campaign has been the support it has been able to muster from celebrities. Besides being endorsed by four out of the six living U.S. presidents as well as other top U.S. officials, Harris has received public endorsement from some of the most popular faces in America. Among these, perhaps the most influential or most-talked about has been the support of Taylor Swift. Recently, Trump posted AI-generated images falsely depicting the pop star endorsing him. After the debate between Trump and Harris, Swift responded, saying, “I recently found out that AI images of ‘me’ endorsing Trump were shared on his site. It really heightened my concerns about AI and the risks of misinformation. This made me realise the importance of being clear about my actual voting intentions. The best way to fight misinformation is through the truth.” She then confirmed, “I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I support Kamala because she stands up for causes I believe need a strong advocate.” Swift ended the post signing it as a \"childless cat lady,\" referring to remarks made by Trump’s running mate, Senator JD Vance, and shared a photo of herself with her cat, Benjamin Button. View this post on Instagram In a similar fashion, singer-songwriter Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas took to Instagram to officially proclaim their support for Harris. In a video, Eilish urged her 119 million followers to \"vote like your life depends on it.\" Her brother Finneas, also a producer and singer, added: \"We can’t let extremists dictate our lives, freedoms, or future. The only way to stop them and the dangerous Project 2025 agenda is by electing Kamala Harris.\" Harris’s campaign responded on Instagram, acknowledging the support with a comment referencing Eilish’s song, writing \"Birds of a feather,\" followed by a heart emoji. View this post on Instagram Another monumental trend that spread like wildfire was Charli XCX memes. In June, Charli XCX released her song ‘Brat,’ sparking a trend dubbed ‘Brat summer,’ which celebrates a carefree, messy persona. As calls grew for President Biden to step down, Harris supporters embraced the ‘Brat’ aesthetic, using coconut emojis and sharing green-tinted edits of Harris set to Charli XCX's music. After Biden endorsed Harris and Charli XCX tweeted “kamala IS brat,” Harris’ campaign adopted the ‘Brat’ style, with neon-green visuals and Charli XCX's song ‘360’ featured in campaign TikToks. At the Democratic National Convention, the ‘Brat’ meme appeared prominently, with notable figures including Mindy Kaling referencing it in their attire and speeches. kamala IS brat — Charli (@charli_xcx) July 22, 2024 The Biden campaign’s official account, Biden-Harris HQ, has officially rebranded to Kamala HQ with a ‘brat’ theme. pic.twitter.com/xy4FhdE5h7 — Pop Base (@PopBase) July 22, 2024 Other celebrities who have endorsed Harris include Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, George Clooney, Megan Thee Stallion, Ariana Grande, Jamie Lee Curtis, Katy Perry, Cardi B, Cynthia Nixon, Pink, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Aaron Sorkin, Lil Jon, Oprah Winfrey, Common, Mindy Kaling, Kerry Washington, Eva Longoria, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Foo Fighters, Joe Rogan, and Beyonce among others. As the race to the White House unfolds, the Harris-Walz ticket represents a stark contrast to the Trump-led opposition, framing the election as a choice between progress and upheaval. With momentum on her side, Kamala Harris’ candidacy is a defining moment in U.S. political history, one that could reshape the future of American leadership. Given the limited time she had to campaign before the polling goes underway, Kamala Harris has turned a lot of stones with her efforts. Harris’ campaign team has tried to position the candidate as the progressive leader America needs, with significant marketing efforts being put across mediums to tap into the diverse set of demographics that the Veep has the potential to attract. Add to it, the dash of A-list celebrity endorsements and Kamala HQ's efforts to ride the relevancy wave with Gen Z, the Harris-Walz campaign is giving the Trump-Vance campaign–if not outperforming–a run for its money.","summary":"The U.S. presidential election has always been an event at the epicentre of media coverage and the public eye.

I was a career prosecutor.” But her ownership came to the attention of many in the US - including Winfrey, by her admission - during last week's presidential head-to-head with Republican rival Donald Trump. It marked the first time the issue had come up in a 2024 debate. Harris denied a Trump claim that she would \"confiscate everybody's gun\" if elected to the White House, pointing out that both she and her running-mate Tim Walz, a hunting enthusiast, had firearms of their own. Trump, too, has also owned three guns, though he had to surrender two of them and face restrictions on the third after facing criminal charges in New York. Harris's opponents have increasingly seized on the gun issue as indicative of her shifting policy positions as her November showdown with Trump approaches. Last week's ABC News debate moderator noted that Harris no longer supported a \"buyback\" programme that would force gun owners to hand over their AR-15s and other assault-style weapons to the government. But Harris reiterated to Winfrey on Thursday that she wanted tighter laws. The Democrat also outlined her stance at a recent rally in North Carolina, saying: \"We who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red-flag laws.\" So-called red-flag laws allow people to apply to a judge to confiscate another person's gun if they are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others.","summary":"The Democratic presidential nominee has discussed her gun ownership in a jokey exchange with Oprah Winfrey.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4yxe2xxzdo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a7a1/live/c7a3c050-773e-11ef-b282-4535eb84fe4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:55:21","author":"James Fitzgerald","authors":["James Fitzgerald"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.321},{"id":256861890,"title":"Singapore seeks to fight deepfakes in elections, with new laws ahead of 2025 polls","text":"In a bid to shore up trust in public institutions, Singapore is considering making legislative changes that will enable candidates to flag deepfake videos of themselves during elections, Senior Minister of State for Digital Development and Information Janil Puthucheary says. The city state joins other jurisdictions looking to clamp down on manipulated media, with its next general election to be held no later than November 2025. Puthucheary, who was among panel speakers on Friday at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy’s Festival of Ideas, said the proposed safeguards would enable election candidates to report digitally manipulated content that realistically depicts them saying or doing something that he or she did not in fact say or do. The proposed Elections (Integrity of Online Advertising) (Amendment) Bill grants the Returning Officer, who supervises elections, the power to issue corrective directions to publishers or service providers. Misrepresented candidates can also declare the truthfulness of their claims. Failure to comply could result in fines, imprisonment, or both. Candidates who submit false or misleading information risk a fine or losing their seats. During a panel on AI governance and disinformation, Puthucheary warned that how voters absorb information is an area “rife for manipulation for AI-driven tools”. He added that the bill, which would be debated in parliament at the next available sitting, was intended to avoid situations in other countries where public trust had been eroded by deep fakes. “It is, in terms of its operations, focused around the candidate … But it has, as its intent, the shoring up of public trust in information discourse platforms, the media, and that sense of institutions having a responsibility above and beyond their own narrow interests,” the minister said. In recent years, Singapore has implemented legislation to tackle fake news and online misinformation. This includes controversial laws such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma) and Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, which allow authorities to take action against perceived falsehoods or foreign interference in local politics. Puthucheary, who is also the Senior Minister of State for Health, addressed the difference between Pofma and the bill on Friday, saying that with Pofma, there was a “test around public interest and a requirement for an establishment of fact by an authoritative third party”. He explained, for example, how someone might have a very different opinion of vaccines, but ultimately, an academic informing the Health Ministry could advise them that this was against the public interest. Puthucheary said this was a very different process from an election, where the only people who could provide verification that something did not happen were the candidates themselves. “The government is in no position to do so, a third party, an academic, a professor, research institution, is in no position to do so,” he said. He noted that other organisations might have technological views about the material, but whether an act happened was something a candidate had “an interest in expressing, and then a responsibility to address in terms of providing the electorate the correct information”. Puthucheary noted that high trust in institutions such as the government and the media was a “necessary precondition” for discussions on the electoral process, acknowledging that Singapore was privileged to have this trust. Singapore will not be the first country to use legislation to combat AI-generated fakes during elections. South Korea’s National Assembly passed revisions to election laws last December that bar the use of deep fakes in political campaigns. The election administration agency reported busting 129 deep fakes violating laws between January 29 and February 16.

Germanotta also thanked Elon Musk amid the billionaire being investigated over assassination tweets about Kamala Harris. The pop star, who famously champions LGBTQ rights, which the Trump campaign is firmly against, has stayed silent and not yet publicly endorsed any candidates. The singer and actress sang the national anthem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. In an interview with right wing broadcaster Fox News on September 19, Germanotta called Trump and Harris “two vastly different people”, saying: “One of them is pure, and he’s a patriot. “And the other is just going to say whatever she needs to say to get elected. That’s basically what I hear... “If you stack them up side by side, I don't know what the hell she's talking about.\" Germanotta said his business, Upper West Side restaurant Joanne Trattoria, was thriving during the Trump administration from 2017 to 2021, and that business in New York City has taken a turn for the worse since the Covid-19 pandemic. “Six years ago, I was going to have the best year we ever had at Joanne before Covid,” he said. “And when I say [the] best year, it was 25 per cent more than any other year. “My clientele, my customers, the ones that used to come once a week, now they come once every three weeks,” he claimed. “They're not coming to New York City. The tourist business is still fairly strong ... They're still popping into New York. “You can’t get worse than it is now.” Germanotta also said he liked Trump’s policies, including his economic plan, which includes putting major tariffs on overseas investors who want to trade with the US - something many financial experts say will come at a steep price to taxpayers who will ultimately foot the bill when foreign investors are forced to raise prices on their goods to pay the tariff penalties. Gaga's dad also added that he's a fan of most of Trump's other plans, one of which could see a \"Muslim ban\", which the former president has vowed to reinstate and the erasure of LGBTQ+ rights. Germanotta continued: “I mean, look, Donald, yeah, he’s abrasive, okay, but, you know, he’s a patriot, and his policies are there. All right, they’re on target for me anyway. “I’m into low fuel and food prices – low interest rates,” he added. “Good economy, pro-police. Let the police do their job, law and order… Don’t let these protesters burn down our cities and the small businesses. Keep the jobs here in the United States.” Germanotta, who comes from a family of Italian immigrants, also praised Trump’s divisive views on immigration. “It’s been an invasion, as far as I see it. We don’t have secure borders anymore. There’s no more legal immigration. “I endorse Donald Trump. I endorse his policies. Freedom of speech. Thank you Elon Musk. That’s all I’ve got to say,” he concluded. The Standard has contacted Gaga's team for comment.","summary":"Gaga is a staunch supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and sang the national anthem at President Joe Biden’s inauguration ","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/lady-gaga-dad-endorses-donald-trump-elon-musk-kamala-harris-b1183132.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/05/08/ef509f57050d15852c01d47f2eb364b4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NjU3NDE3-2.65833414.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:39:04","author":"Dominique Hines","authors":["Dominique Hines"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.117},{"id":256861254,"title":"Laura Loomer Accuses Kamala Harris of 'Hypocrisy' Over Gun Remarks","text":"Laura Loomer has accused Kamala Harris of being a hypocrite, after the Democratic presidential nominee spoke about her personal gun ownership while campaigning on gun control.The former congressional candidate posted a clip of Harris speaking to Oprah Winfrey in which Harris says that she and her running mate Tim Walz are both gun owners, and states: \"If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot.\"Oprah has endorsed Harris and hosted a two-hour Unite for America streaming session in Michigan featuring an in-depth interview with Harris and questions from the audience Thursday. The question of gun ownership occurred during a section of the livestream that was addressing school shootings.Loomer, who campaigns for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, reposted what Harris said to her X account, however she edited Harris' words from \"they're getting shot\" to \"they gon' get shot.\" Whether intentionally or not, Loomer quoted Harris as using African American Vernacular English (AAVE).Loomer accused Harris of hypocrisy, claiming that Harris wants to \"take away people's guns,\" but wants to keep her own.Several people in Loomer's comments section agreed with her accusation of hypocrisy, and expressed doubt that Harris is a gun owner at all.Loomer has become known for attacking Harris. On September 8, Loomer wrote about the vice president on X, saying: \"If Kamala Harris wins, the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center and the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call that nobody will understand.\"Harris and Walz have both been open about being gun owners. At the Presidential debate Harris said: \"This business about taking everyone's guns away—Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away, so stop with the continuous lying about this stuff.\"Harris previously spoke about being a gun owner in 2019, while on the campaign trail for the Democratic Primary.Minnesota Governor Walz is also known for sinking from an \"A\" approval rating to an \"F\" from the NRA after enforcing stricter gun controls following the Parkland shooting in 2018.The Harris campaign has not expressed a desire to \"take away\" all guns, a point she made clear in the interview with Oprah. However, she is campaigning on banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. She is also running on requiring universal background checks.The Harris campaign has been contacted via email for comment.Harris currently oversees the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, where she launched the nation's first National Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) Resource Center, which is built to assist law enforcement in \"optimizing the use of red-flag laws.\"Many of the gun control measures that Harris is running on, such as background checks, and enforcing red flag laws, are highly popular among the electorate. According to recent Pew polling, six in ten Americans believe it is too easy for people to obtain a firearm, and favor stricter gun laws.Banning assault weapons is also largely popular, although more divided along partisan lines, where 42 percent of Republicans, and 85 percent of Democrats support a ban.Additionally, half of Americans see gun violence as a problem in the country, and see an increase in the number of guns as bad for society.","summary":"Former Congressional candidate, Laura Loomer, has accused Kamala Harris of being a hypocrite, after she spoke about her gun ownership on Oprah.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/laura-loomer-accuses-kamala-harrris-hypocricy-1956760","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476543/laura-loomer-tampa-2023.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:36:15","author":"Sophie Clark","authors":["Sophie Clark"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":256861246,"title":"LIVE UPDATES: Mark Robinson Scandal Puts Swing State North Carolina in Spotlight","text":"It's Friday, but if you were hoping for a quiet end to a busy week in election land...think again!

Eager little dancers are fine-tuning their steps to be at their coordinated best when they perform for him on September 22 at the Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. Thirteen-year-old Mahita Pendota is one of over 80 performers who will showcase their talent in traditional and popular pan-India performing arts. Beats of ‘Dhol baje' will reverberate across the venue as her group from East Coast's Shivaay Dance Academy will present ‘traditional garba in a Bollywood twist style' to a soundtrack custom-produced in India. Rohan Virdi, the co-founder of the academy, describes the enthusiasm among Indian American families thus: “They are willing to do anything possible to be a part of this show. Even if the parents will not get to attend, they don't want their kids to miss seeing Modiji.” The enthusiasm among Indian American youngsters springs from the cultural milieu they are being raised in. For instance, Sandeep Shetty, a former Bollywood choreographer who runs New Jersey-based Rudra Dance Academy, not only focuses on technical skills but also ‘teaches culture'. “We educate them about cultural, current and historical things from India like festivals. Students know a lot about Modi. When they got to know the Prime Minister was coming to New York, they were so excited to participate!” he says. Shetty's group will also be presenting a Bollywood-style performance. US-raised graduate Agrima Agnihotri finds herself fortunate to be one of the volunteers. She and many young second-generation immigrant peers who “speak highly of Modi” will be attending the event. “We finally get to see him!” she exclaims. Like her Indian immigrant parents, Agnihotri is convinced that PM Modi thinks “futuristically” and has “put India in a good light”. “Modiji is not only an inspiration in India. I like to think that he inspires us across the oceans. He is my role model personally. My parents are huge supporters, and I've learned to be a supporter as well,” she says. Calling him a \"guiding light\" for youth, she says Modi even makes Indian American youth feel cool about their identity and background socially. “After he became the PM, India is much more respected than earlier which makes us feel confident and validated when we talk to our non-Indian peers. The narrative has switched in our favour.” Indian Americans Are A Diverse Lot The largest Asian immigrant community in the US, Indian Americans are a diverse lot, representing various Indian cultures and political leanings. Their population has more than doubled in the last two decades. The ideological leanings of recent immigrants reflect home country politics, evident in their affinity for Indian political leaders. It is well-known that Modi is very popular among a large chunk of Hindu Americans. Temple University's Dr Sanjoy Chakravorty, co-author of The Other One Percent: Indians in America, is sceptical of generalising for most Indian Americans but recognises that the affinity for PM Modi among those from Gujarat is strong. “By and large, the second-generation children have very little political knowledge of India. In Gujarati families, there's a worship of Modi and you know how Gujaratis are well-represented in certain parts of the US, particularly in New Jersey, New York and Chicago.” At the same time, for those growing up in the US, the dominant culture for a majority of Indian American youth remains American. “The American political horse race is kind of fascinating and it's constantly in your face. They constantly talk about it as it's always on TV, always in the news, and they get caught up in it. India is a distant thing and a good chunk of them have rarely been to India,” Dr Chakravorty explains. And thus, while some second-generation immigrants reject their parents' politics, there are others who follow it, he adds. \"A Bubble\" “You're seeing a particular bubble which I don't think is representative. It really doesn't strike me in any shape or fashion as something that's representative of the second-generation Indians in the US,” Chakravorty points out. Even so, within the bubble that's enthusiastic about Modi's visit, culture and politics seem to transcend continents and generations. The sign-ups for the event, dubbed as ‘Modi and US, Progress Together', crossed 29,700 according to a lead organiser. It was not open to the public and only well-recognised cultural and philanthropic US-based organisations could apply. The 600 selected, including sponsors, had to trim their member lists to be accommodated into the 13,500-capacity at the Nassau Coliseum. Wanting to be seen and recognised, this is a grand stage for aspirational Indian diaspora members. “It's networking at the highest level. Being at a Prime Minister event is high visibility. Getting a picture taken with the Prime Minister is something they'll hang on the walls, show everywhere, put on their websites. It's not just Indians, everybody does it,” says Dr Chakravorty. A group of US-based ‘Welcome Partner Organizations' have come together as the ‘Indo American Community of USA' to steer the effort. Participants will be taking long flights and drives from over 42 states to Long Island on the US East Coast. One of those attending from the West Coast is California-based Vijaya Aasuri, President of the Association of Indo-Americans, a conglomeration of 48 Indian cultural and charity organisations. She has been part of Modi's past meetings at The White House and diaspora events, including the 2014 Madison Square Garden summit and the 2019 Howdy Modi rally in Texas. Aasuri says she is looking forward to his latest address. “Every day, every minute you see growth in India. Getting those updates from the media is one thing but hearing about the progress directly from our honourable Prime Minister is very reassuring.” Hindu Indian-Americans Biggest Supporters In line with the religious demographics of the Indian American community, the rally will largely consist of Hindu Indian-Americans but will also have a smattering of other religions. Nikunj Trivedi, president of the Coalition of Hindus of North America, says, “I do know that there are Sikh groups, there's an Indian Christian group and a Muslim group. Ismaili Bohra Muslims from Gujarat maintain a strong affinity to the state. I know that as I am from Gujarat.” Meanwhile, two large Sikh-American groups as well as the Indian American Muslim Council say they will not be participating in the rally. According to a lead organiser, the rally is being funded by participating groups and sponsors. One of the gold sponsors, Indiaspora, is an influential organisation whose mission is to “build bridges among diaspora leaders in several countries and professions with leaders residing in India”. They have close ties with US and Indian administrations and corporate leaders and are an example of the role the Indian diaspora plays in enhancing synergy between the two countries. Their Executive Director, Sanjeev Joshipura, says Indiaspora, a “secular and non-partisan organisation”, has been part of the Indian Prime Minister's earlier US visits too. “It makes sense for an organisation to work with the sitting Prime Minister of India regardless of political party. A lot of Indiaspora network and members are going to be part of the VIP seating and backstage opportunities with Foreign Minister Jaishankar, and a possible meet-and-greet with the PM.” No Political Leanings A clear directive being followed by the organisers is not to lean towards any one US political party. A few prominent Indian American politicians “might be” in attendance, but organisers say they will be at the event in their “personal capacity”. This would be unlike the 2019 ‘Howdy Modi' event, which saw addresses by both PM Modi and then US President Donald Trump. San Francisco Bay Area-based Democrat Ajay Bhutoria, member of ‘National Finance Committee 2024, Harris for President', is one of the attendants at the rally. He says, “During the planning stages, organisers had thought to extend invitations to both Trump and Harris, but they were unsure, just in case one accepts and the other doesn't for some reason. To avoid that, they decided against it, and are not inviting any members of Congress or elected officials.” As preparations for the Long Island rally continue in full swing, Joshipura points out that though it is only natural that a mass rally would generate conversation and grab headlines, Modi's US visit will also be defined by several other non-public aspects. “There is the UNGA assembly going on, climate week is also at the same time, there is a QUAD meeting that will occur just before Modi's big speech in Nassau County and meetings with corporate leaders. In addition to what one sees on TV, there is a lot of substance to this visit, sometimes bilateral, in some cases even multilateral,” he says.

The military says its warplanes struck more than 100 rocket launchers, as well as a weapons depot. This comes as Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant says \"we are at the start of a new phase of the war.” The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has vowed to inflict retribution after explosions of communication devices used by the group killed more than 30 people and injured thousands. The White House has said it is concerned about a potential escalation in the Middle East. The UN Security Council will discuss the crisis later on Friday - BBC The United Nations urged de-escalation on Friday after the Israeli military struck roughly 100 sites across southern Lebanon overnight, the latest signal that the slow-boiling, 11-month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into full-scale war. The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said on Friday morning that there had been “a heavy intensification in exchanges of fire” across the Israel-Lebanon border over the previous 12 hours and that it was in touch with Hezbollah and the Israel military to urge calm. - NYT Russia’s military command had anticipated Ukraine’s incursion into its Kursk region and had been making plans to prevent it for several months, according to a cache of documents that the Ukrainian army said it had seized from abandoned Russian positions in the region. The disclosure makes the disarray among Russian forces after Ukraine’s attack in early August all the more embarrassing. The documents, shared with the Guardian, also reveal Russian concerns about morale in the ranks in Kursk, which intensified after the suicide of a soldier at the front who had reportedly been in a “prolonged state of depression due to his service in the Russian army”. Unit commanders are given instructions to ensure soldiers consume Russian state media daily to maintain their “psychological condition”. - Guardian The sum of 160 million euros from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets would be allocated by the EU to meet Ukraine’s urgent humanitarian needs for this winter, Reuters reported. Russia has knocked out about 9 gigawatts (GW) of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, which was the “power equivalent of the three Baltic states”. The EU aimed to restore 2.5 GW of power generating capacity and would increase exports to supply 2 GW of electricity to Ukraine.

Trump. Mr. Trump’s campaign has named Mr. Kennedy to his transition team should he win the election in November. New York Magazine said it had reviewed Ms. Nuzzi’s work and found “no inaccuracies nor evidence of bias.” - NYT Barron Trump, Donald Trump’s youngest son and a freshman at New York University, has become an unwitting TikTok star with the rise of a new genre of videos—shakily filmed clips of him moving around campus. The videos are largely taken from surreptitious angles by the 18-year-old’s NYU classmates and set to songs like Chamillionaire’s \"Ridin,\" according to WIRED, which described the sightings as Sasquatch-esque. Some have scooped up hundreds of thousands of views, but none so far has shed much light on Barron’s character or personality, much less whether he is majoring in aquatic biology. “I feel like Barron could’ve gone to any school, but the fact that he chose one of the most liberal schools in the country speaks volumes,” Grace Rowley, one NYU student who posted about the former first son on TikTok, told WIRED. “I was shocked and super intrigued that he would choose NYU.

By Kyle Khan-Mullins, Forbes Staff George Washington expanded grain production at his plantation, where more than 300 people were enslaved when he died in 1799. John Quincy Adams and William Howard Taft both landed new jobs in government as a congressman and a Supreme Court chief justice, respectively. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia, while Teddy Roosevelt launched a 15,000-mile expedition into the Amazon rainforest. These are just some of the ways former presidents have spent their time after leaving arguably the most important job on the planet. While it looks different for every commander-in-chief, life after the Oval Office has proven quite lucrative lately, as these former leaders have capitalized on their stature and fanbase to land high-paying speaking gigs, book contracts and other deals. Now, Donald Trump takes it to a new level, becoming the first person to make a billion dollars off of politics less than four years after losing reelection and as he makes his third run for the White House. Here’s a breakdown of post-presidential wealth for all the living former heads of state. Except for Trump’s, net worth estimates represent minimums. All book sale data is from BookScan. Donald Trump Net Worth: $3.8 Billion tk The richest president in U.S. history finished his first term in dire financial straits, with his entire real estate empire—commercial property, hotels, licensing deals—suffering under the combined weights of a global pandemic and an owner on the outs with the American public. Yet Trump, who had previously survived four bankruptcies, two impeachment trials and almost constant scandals, wriggled his way out of a jam once again: Since leaving office, his fortune has soared, at its peak tripling. The tycoon reworked or paid off billions of dollars in debt and watched his golf and resort business boom as his followers flocked to his properties. But the biggest boost to Trump’s bank account, at least on paper, has come from Truth Social—his Twitter knockoff that, despite making just $3.4 million in the 12 months through June and recording a net loss of $380 million, has seemingly become a way for MAGA retail traders to personally invest in their favorite president and his prospects. As of Thursday, it’s valued by the market at around $3 billion. Trump’s shares are worth almost $1.7 billion, helping earn him a spot back on the Forbes 400 after missing the cut twice in the past three years. Barack Obama Net Worth: $70+ Million tk Obama made about $20 million during his 12 years in Washington D.C. as a senator and President, and had an estimated net worth of $6 million in 2012. That figure skyrocketed once he left office. He and his wife, Michelle, sold their memoir rights to Penguin Random House for $65 million in 2017, per the Financial Times. A year later, they founded Higher Ground Productions and signed a four-year deal with Netflix; Obama has since won two Emmys, and the firm, which produced hits such as the post-apocalyptic Leave the World Behind (starring Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali), re-upped with Netflix in June. The pair was also reportedly paid hundreds of thousands to speak at events. Per real estate agents, they own homes in Chicago, Hawaii, D.C. and Martha’s Vineyard worth a combined $35.5 million (assessed value). George W. Bush tk Net Worth: $40+ Million An earlier stint in the oil industry and a successful investment in the Texas Rangers made him a bundle. Already a multimillionaire when elected president, Bush’s fortune apparently shrank while in office, according to his financial disclosures. He vowed to one journalist that he would “replenish the ol’ coffers” after leaving power. The 2009 book deal for his memoir, Decision Points, which sold over 2 million copies, reportedly earned him $7 million. He also delivered more than 200 paid speeches. Today, he and his wife, Laura, own two Dallas properties assessed at $4 million and $2.8 million, plus the $10 million family ranch outside Waco. The Texan has also published two books of his paintings and a biography of his father, the 41st president. Bill Clinton Net Worth: $45+ Million tk The 42nd president and his wife left office in 2001 “not only dead broke, but in debt”—Hillary’s words—thanks to his legal troubles. Fortunately, his earning power kicked in just days later with a $125,000 speech at Morgan Stanley. They bought a D.C. house for $2.9 million later that year that has since doubled in value. They also still own a home in Chappaqua, New York, worth at least $2.2 million. By the time Hillary ran for president in 2016, the couple had earned over $240 million and were worth an estimated $45 million. In the eight years since, the Clintons have released seven more books—including a couple of thrillers by Bill and James Patterson (The President Is Missing, The President’s Daughter) that have sold more than 1.2 million copies combined. Jimmy Carter Net Worth: N/A tk The 99-year-old single-termer didn’t bother making high-paying speeches, telling the Washington Post in 2018 that “it just never had been my ambition to be rich.” After leaving the White House in 1981, he and his wife, Rosalynn (d. 2023), sold their debt-burdened peanut farm and, in 1994, donated their rural Georgia home, with an assessed value of less than $170,000, to the U.S. government. While they continued to live a modest life by all accounts, the Carters likely made a pretty penny writing 34 books, including memoirs, a poetry collection, a children’s book and reflections on aging. His Palestine Peace Not Apartheid (2006), about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, sold more than 300,000 copies.

In August, he pledged to make IVF free to all Americans by requiring insurance companies or the federal government to cover it. Trump’s debate statement puts him at odds with most of his party on IVF. Only two Republicans—Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski—voted in favor of the Right to IVF Act, which came before the Senate for the second time this week and included provisions similar to Trump’s promise, requiring employer-sponsored insurance and certain public plans to cover the treatment. The former president’s emphatic interest in IVF also marks a striking pivot for a campaign that has remained mostly muted on reproductive health care, including on the issue of abortion rights. And his focus offers a window into his political calculus as he attempts to retake the presidency. If his party won’t budge on abortion, IVF allows him to signal to swing voters—particularly women—that his populist instincts are still in play. Infertility is an issue that resonates with a large and growing number of American families, and the treatment has high and consistent support across partisan and demographic groups. One out of every 40 babies born in the U.S. in 2022 was conceived through IVF, compared with about one out of 65 a decade earlier. As awareness and use of fertility treatments rise, demand has begun to far outstrip supply. Roughly one out of every eight Americans experiences some form of infertility, and many LGBTQ couples and single people also turn to IVF to become pregnant. Yet few poor and rural areas in the U.S. have fertility clinics; in fact, 80 percent are in New York City. Even in areas where treatment is available, it can be prohibitively expensive. IVF costs an estimated $15,000 to more than $30,000 per cycle, and the average patient needs 2.5 cycles to become pregnant. Trump’s campaign has provided few specifics on his IVF plan; his vice-presidential candidate, J. D. Vance, told NPR that “details get worked out in the legislative process.” But legislators in their own party don’t seem keen to make it happen: Several prominent Republican lawmakers expressed opposition to (or at least confusion about) Trump’s proposal, and even some of Trump’s most loyal congressional allies have stopped short of endorsing government-mandated coverage for the procedure. However half-baked Trump’s free-IVF plan may be, his embrace of fertility rights stands in contrast with his more distant approach to abortion. Since 2022, when the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling paved the way for tighter abortion restrictions in 22 states and counting, Trump has faced intense backlash from women’s-rights advocates and health-care groups. In response, he has wavered on supporting a national abortion ban. In March, he voiced support for federal restrictions on the procedure, but during the recent presidential debate, he argued that abortion access should be left to the states. At the same time, he deflected questions about whether he would veto a ban if it came across his desk. But voters haven’t forgotten that “his fingerprints are stuck all over the Roe v. Wade reversal,” Susan Crockin, an adjunct professor specializing in reproductive-technology law at Georgetown Law, told me. Abortion will likely remain a losing issue for his campaign, she said: This spring, about two years after Dobbs, nearly two-thirds of Americans polled by Pew said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. With IVF, unlike abortion, Trump is taking a clear stance that contradicts core conservative principles. Leaving abortion to the states at least aligns with the traditional Republican position to limit the federal government’s involvement in health care: Senator Mitt Romney similarly highlighted the importance of states’ rights in abortion during his 2012 campaign for the presidency. Trump’s free-IVF pitch flouts those principles, as well as the push among some conservatives to restrict IVF on moral grounds. To many anti-abortion and abortion-rights advocates alike, Trump’s proposal most resembles the Affordable Care Act mandate for employers to cover birth control and emergency contraception, a policy that Trump’s 2016 campaign derided. “This IVF plan is pure populism. It shows he’s not someone with a conservative worldview,” says Cole Muzio, the president of Frontline Policy Action, a conservative Christian group that has lobbied for anti-abortion measures in Georgia. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) Whereas Trump’s evasiveness on abortion comes across as an attempt to please moderates and conservatives alike, his IVF stance strongly suggests which voters he’s most desperate to court. This year, the Trump campaign has been pointedly targeting white and suburban women, a crucial voting bloc in his previous presidential bids. College-educated white women, in particular, exhibit strong support for Kamala Harris, and they are also more likely to use fertility services than Black and Hispanic women or those without a bachelor’s degree. Although Trump’s promises are unlikely to sway staunch supporters of abortion rights, they might win back some swing-state voters who feel lukewarm about abortion and firmly support fertility care. Some early signs suggest that this strategy could pay off: In a September poll in Michigan, the battleground state where Trump announced his free-IVF plan, 29 percent of independent voters said they were more likely to support his 2024 campaign because of it. This advantage might come at the expense of a different, but still key, Trump voting bloc: strong opponents of abortion. Although IVF access has broad support from Christian and self-identified pro-life voters, the former president’s recent statements have angered some anti-abortion advocates, who argue that life begins at conception and that discarding embryos during IVF is therefore akin to murder. His promises could dampen enthusiasm somewhat among white evangelicals, from whom Trump is projected to need overwhelming support in order to win the election. But Trump seems to have decided that he can afford to offend these Americans without losing their votes. As Peter Wehner argued in The Atlantic last month, many anti-abortion voters will likely continue to support Trump, even if begrudgingly. Muzio agreed. “This will be the difference between quietly going into the ballot box and casting your vote for him versus going to Sunday-school class and encouraging your friends to do the same thing,” he told me. Although Harris has linked IVF and abortion access as part of a unified reproductive-rights platform, Trump has attempted to separate the two. He frames his free-IVF plan as its own pro-family issue, even tying it to a proposal for child tax credits. What remains unclear is whether this distinction is meaningful to voters. Last December, less than 1 percent of registered voters ranked abortion as the most pressing problem facing the country. But in an August poll of voters in three key swing states, a plurality of women said it was the single most important issue determining their vote for the presidency. In September, 14 percent of all voters said abortion was their No. 1 issue. Sidestepping it in favor of IVF is a gamble—one whose payout could well determine who moves into the White House next year.","summary":"The former president is signaling to swing voters—particularly women—that his populist instincts are still in play.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/09/trump-ivf-abortion-swing-voters/679963/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/PrxSv_EuzYccH3FCcStudge0T_Y=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/09/trump_ivf_final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:30:00","author":"Lucy Tu","authors":["Lucy Tu"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":256861334,"title":"India not a tariff abuser as alleged by Trump: GTRI","text":"India cannot be called a tariff abuser, as done by former US President Donald Trump recently, as its average tariff rate is comparable to other major economies like South Korea and China, and such an accusation is unfair, according to research body Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI). Moreover, it is not just India that has particularly high tariffs for some items such as alcohol and automobiles. Several other countries have the same, including the US, which has peak tariffs in items like dairy, fruits and vegetables clothing, beverages and tobacco, a paper compiled by GTRI pointed out. “India has already removed tariffs on most imports from its FTA (free trade agreement) partners like the ASEAN, Japan, and South Korea, showing its openness to free trade. However, despite India’s willingness, the US has been reluctant to reduce tariffs through FTAs. This hesitation is clear in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, where no tariff cuts were included, reflecting the US’s cautious approach,” according to Ajay Srivastava, trade expert and GTRI founder. The highest tariffs of Japan is 457 per cent , Korea is 887 per cent, the US is 350 per cent, while that in India is 150 per cent. “So India is not alone,” it said. IMPORT TARIFFS Earlier this week, Trump called India an abuser of import tariffs while campaigning in Michigan for the upcoming US Presidential elections. The Republican Presidential candidate had criticised India for its high tariffs several times during his Presidency. In October 2020, he made a statement labelling India the “tariff king.” The US’ peak tariffs include those on dairy products (188 per cent), fruits and vegetables (132 per cent), coffee, tea, cocoa and spices (53 per cent), cereals and food preparations (193 per cent), oilseeds, fats and oils (164 per cent), beverages and tobacco (150 per cent), fish and fish products (35 per cent), minerals and metals (187 per cent), chemicals (56 per cent), textiles (25 per cent), clothing (135 per cent), rubber, leather and footwear (60 per cent), and transport equipment (50 per cent), the report pointed out. While India’s average tariff rate of 17 per cent is higher than the US’s 3.3 per cent, it is comparable to other major economies like South Korea (13.4 per cent) and China (7.5 per cent). For industrial products, which make up the majority of India’s imports, the average tariff is lower at 13.5 per cent, with the trade-weighted average being just 9 per cent, it added.","summary":"Highest tariff in the US, Japan, Korea are 350% per cent , 457% per cent , 887 per cent % respectively, the research body pointed out","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/india-not-a-tariff-abuser-as-alleged-by-trump-gtri/article68663329.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hq43ur/article68663570.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2173244571.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:27:13","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.166},{"id":256860692,"title":"The bigger the liar, the more the believers","text":"In Adolf Hitler’s 99-year-old Mein Kampf, he claimed that a lie, if told convincingly and repeatedly, can be accepted as truth. The man who would later orchestrate the murder of six million Jews and wage war against 1.6 billion people believed that effective propaganda must be simple, emotional, and repetitive to manipulate public perception and achieve political goals. The Big Lie was born. Hitler wrote: “In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility… the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily… in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they more readily fall victim to the big lie than the small lie.” In short, the bigger the lie, the likelier it is to be believed. Donald Trump invoked this same tactic in a baseless claim during his presidential debate with Kamala Harris, when he accused Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, of consuming dogs, cats, and geese. This outrageous fabrication is emblematic of the deep-seated racism that continues to plague American society. Trump’s running mate JD Vance compounded this lie by claiming Haitians are a source of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. This slur, eerily similar to the racist lies spread 40 years ago blaming Haitians for AIDS, mirrors Nazi-driven hatred. Some German physicians falsely blamed Jews for the spread of typhus, illustrating the dangerous consequences of using fear to stigmatise entire communities. Despite these inflammatory statements, local health officials have reported that communicable diseases in the county are at their lowest rate since 2016, even though Springfield’s Haitian population has grown by about 20 000. The lies spread by Trump and Vance go beyond ignorance; they are part of a broader strategy to perpetuate harmful stereotypes about historically marginalised communities of colour, particularly those from the Caribbean. This is not the first time we’ve seen such rhetoric. Trump previously described Haiti and other Black and brown nations as “s***hole countries.” The source of this latest poison is not a misguided conservative ideologue but a neo-Nazi group called Blood Tribe, with support from far-right Trump associate and failed congressional candidate Laura Loomer. Trump’s lies are more than hateful rhetoric targeting lawful residents seeking refuge from violence and chaos under the US government’s temporary protected status. The Haitian population in Springfield did not descend on the town unbidden; they were invited to fill labour shortages. The Haitian community has proven to be industrious, thrifty, and orderly, displaying virtues common to immigrant groups of all races. However, after a fatal accident involving a Haitian driver and a school bus, the incident was exploited to amplify racist attacks against the entire community. By all accounts, the Haitians of Springfield are decent, hardworking people, yet they are now subjected to a rising tide of racism. The hate spread by Trump and his associates has had serious consequences. Springfield has seen death threats, bomb scares, and the temporary closure of schools and City Hall. Haitian residents describe an atmosphere of fear and hostility, with their safety endangered by baseless lies. This unjust vilification not only affects the Haitian community but casts a shadow over all Caribbean-Americans, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and deepening social divisions. Indeed, the Haitian residents of Springfield have already been confronted by curious Americans asking whether they eat pets. Such questions reflect the ignorance many West Indians have encountered in the US, such as being asked how long it takes to drive from Jamaica to Barbados, or if people live in coconut trees. This is the soft bigotry of profound cultural and geographical ignorance. There is a broader pattern of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States, deeply rooted in anti-Black racism. The notion that immigrants pose a threat to society is a recurring theme, historically manifesting in policies and attitudes that dehumanise people based on nationality or skin colour. The portrayal of Haitian immigrants as “the other” fuels a narrative of alienation and isolation, overlooking their positive contributions to American society and the economy. As Mark Twain observed, history rhymes. The mythology of the United States as a beacon of liberty has long stood in contrast to its exclusionary practices based on race and nationality. Immigrant groups have consistently faced prejudice. From 1882 to 1917, laws excluded Chinese immigrants. One hundred years ago, national origin quotas were established to restrict immigration from non-Western European regions. Trump’s presidential travel ban on individuals from Muslim-majority countries further entrenched patterns of discrimination. We fear the long-term impact of racialised stereotypes against the people of Haiti, a fellow CARICOM member. These portrayals undermine the rich cultural heritage and resilience of Haitians, who continue to contribute meaningfully to their communities despite immense challenges. These harmful stereotypes are not isolated incidents but are part of a broader system of oppression aimed at marginalising people of colour and undermining their dignity. These facts should not go unnoticed by the approximately 4.4 million Caribbean immigrants living in the United States, nearly two-thirds of whom are naturalised citizens. With a naturalisation rate higher than the general foreign-born population, at about 49 per cent, Caribbean-Americans hold significant political power. Confronting racism and xenophobia in daily life, at the ballot box, in the workplace, and in communities, is essential. It is also significant that Kamala Harris, the woman seeking to lead all Americans, is herself the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother. Since entering the presidential race, she has been the target of racist attacks. Her opponent’s reluctance to condemn such hatred is a clear attempt to appeal to white supremacists in an era marked by extremism and disinformation. This strategy not only seeks to rally white voters but also aims to stoke unrest should he lose. The dangers of the Big Lie cannot be overstated. The impact of such tactics, exacerbated by voter apathy, is unpredictable and potentially devastating. The fight against racism and the manipulation of truth is one we cannot afford to ignore.","summary":"In Adolf Hitler’s 99-year-old Mein Kampf, he claimed that a lie, if told convincingly and repeatedly, can be accepted as truth.

I think they understand that he's so transactional and so devoid of core values that anything that they want they can manipulate him to get,\" Cuban said of Silicon Valley backers of Trump.During his interview with Cohen, Cuban added that he thinks Trump is \"the \"most unethical\" and \"dishonest\" person he's ever worked with or done business with. It's unclear what business Cuban is referring to.Cuban added that he believes a president needs to have character and empathy, and who is \"ethical when it comes to making difficult decisions.\"\"I can't even imagine why people consider Donald Trump because of his lack of character and ethics,\" Cuban said.Tesla chief Elon Musk, who Cuban often spars with on X, is now one of Trump's biggest supporters. Musk endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt and has expressed interest in serving on a possible government efficiency commission should Trump win the election.Cuban also has a theory on why Musk wants to get on the Trump train.\"If you're the wealthiest person in the world and you have control, effective control — you're the puppet master of the president, the most powerful person in the world?\" Cuban said. \"Oh my god, that's about as intoxicating — that is the definition of power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\"I mean, I would — if I had the same goal, I wouldn't care about my EV sales, right? I wouldn't care about my Starlink sales,\" Cuban added.To be sure, this isn't the first time Cuban has speculated on his Silicon Valley peers' motivations for backing Trump.In August, Cuban said he thought the tech bros who supported Trump were out for world domination.\"Watching what's happening in Silicon Valley is insane. It's not so much a support thing. It's more like a takeover thing, trying to put themselves in a position to have as much control as possible,\" Cuban said in an interview with the \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart.\"They've gotten to the point now where they feel like they should control the world right and that there should be a CEO in charge of everything because they are rich as fuck,\" Cuban added during his interview with Stewart.Cuban has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming election and has been increasingly vocal about his distaste for Trump in recent months.The businessman has repeatedly railed against many of Trump's plans. That includes Trump's proposed tariffs, which Cuban has said would be disastrous for businesses.Cuban's also dislike for Trump goes beyond business. In the Monday video, Cuban accused Trump of bigotry, specifically citing the former president's promotion of baseless claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are eating pets.\"That's the Roy Cohn school of management,\" Cuban said, referring to Trump's former mentor, the infamous McCarthy-era lawyer. \"You demonize, demonize, demonize.\"But Cuban didn't always feel this way. In an August interview with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Cuban said he actually started out supporting Trump, thinking the businessman could shake up politics. But after digging into Trump's business records, Cuban said he changed his mind.\"The bigger point is Trump University. Trump SoHo. Stole $4 million from a friend of mine that had to sue to get it back. Mike Pence,\" Cuban listed off, referring to the former president's troubled real-estate training program, luxury hotel, and broken relationship with his vice president.Earlier in March, Cuban also told Axios that he would rather vote for President Joe Biden than a \"snake oil salesperson.\"\"One will tell you his snake oil will cure everything that ails you. The other will show you the details of his policies through charts, graphs, and statements,\" he said.Still, Cuban denied \"hating\" Trump earlier this month, responding to a user on X.\"I just think he was and would be a lousy president,\" Cuban wrote.Cuban told Cohen that whoever holds the presidency needs to have good character to handle whatever problems will inevitably arise.\"You want somebody who is ethical when it comes to making difficult decisions,\" Cuban said. \"I can't even imagine why people consider Donald Trump because of his lack of character and ethics.\"Cuban, Musk, and representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.","summary":"Billionaire Mark Cuban accused former President Donald Trump of lacking character, continuing his recent criticism of the 2024 GOP candidate.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-says-trump-most-unethical-person-ever-business-2024-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/66de902d5444ffafa7638b4d?width=1024&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:26:01","author":"Aditi Bharade,Cheryl Teh,Erin Snodgrass","authors":["Aditi Bharade","Cheryl Teh","Erin Snodgrass"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":256865480,"title":"Harris campaign highlights Trump’s past praise for Mark Robinson as CNN report roils battleground North Carolina","text":"(CNN) — Donald Trump’s campaign declined to say Thursday whether North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, whom the former president once described as “Martin Luther King on steroids,” should drop out of the battleground state’s race for governor. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, meanwhile, highlighted Trump’s history of praise for Robinson, in the wake of a CNN report Thursday about Robinson’s history of disturbing comments on a pornographic website’s message board. Robinson, a Trump ally who won the Republican nomination for governor in March, faces mounting pressure to exit the race following the revelations that he’d made comments more than a decade ago in which he referred to himself as a “black NAZI!” and expressed support for reinstating slavery. Robinson denied having made those comments. The report immediately rippled through the 2024 presidential race, where North Carolina is a target for both Trump and Harris. The deadline under state law for a candidate to drop out was Thursday, with the state’s first absentee ballots set to be mailed out Friday. Harris’ campaign responded to the report by sharing photos on social media of Trump and Robinson together, including one of them posing with a thumbs-up. In another social media post, the Harris campaign shared video of Trump praising Robinson, calling him “one of the great leaders in our country” and labeling him “better than Martin Luther King.” The campaign superimposed the CNN report’s headline in the video. In a statement Thursday afternoon, the Trump campaign did not directly address the reporting, or whether the former president wants Robinson to drop out of the governor’s race. “President Trump’s campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country. North Carolina is an vital part of that plan. We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tarheel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN. Trump has a long history of praising Robinson. At a campaign rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, in March, Trump said he was listening to Robinson speak while he was on his plane and called him “Martin Luther King on steroids.” “I said, ‘I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two,’” Trump said at the time. Some people in Trump’s orbit heard rumblings this week that a potentially damaging story on Robinson was in the works, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Even before the CNN report was published, the Trump campaign had not invited Robinson to the former president’s upcoming Saturday rally in the state, with sources saying that the decision was likely to hold. Robinson has been to most, if not all, of Trump’s recent North Carolina events. Last month, he spoke at Trump’s economy-themed rally in Asheville, and the former president brought him onstage in Asheboro. Many people close to Trump have long held concerns about Robinson and his gubernatorial candidacy, given his previous inflammatory comments, including disparaging the civil rights movement and mocking the victims of a school shooting. Privately, some on Trump’s team had hoped Robinson would drop out as more of his contentious past comments were revealed. However, that didn’t stop Trump from giving the lieutenant governor his endorsement at a rally earlier this year. Despite efforts to distance the former president from Robinson, three senior Trump campaign advisers told CNN that there have been no efforts to pressure Robinson to withdraw from the governor’s race, and there were no plans at this time to call for him drop out. The NAACP called on Robinson to exit the race, writing on social media Thursday that the organization is “nonpartisan, but we’re not blind. And we speak out against what is wrong. Mark Robinson: drop out.” North Carolina Democrats seize on report Robinson is currently in a competitive race against Democrat Josh Stein to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. “Donald Trump and NC GOP leaders embraced Mark Robinson for years knowing who he was and what he stood for including disrespect for women and inciting violence. They reap what they sow,” Cooper said on social media Thursday. Stein, the state attorney general, has been leading Robinson in recent polling. His campaign said in a statement Thursday: “North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be Governor. Josh remains focused on winning this campaign so that together we can build a safer, stronger North Carolina for everyone.” The Democratic Governors Association also pounced on the CNN report, with spokeswoman Izzi Levy calling it “just the latest proof that Mark Robinson is unhinged, dangerous, and completely unfit to be governor.” “Now, as many Republicans warn against the damage Robinson would do as governor, it’s clear that the stakes have never been higher and we must keep our foot on the gas to defeat him in November,” Levy said. The Republican Governors Association did not respond to a request for comment on the report and whether Robinson should drop out of the race. North Carolina Rep. Jeff Jackson, the Democratic nominee to succeed Stein as attorney general, said it made him “sick” to read the CNN report about Robinson. He added that the lieutenant governor “has no business serving in any elected capacity whatsoever. And I’d like to hear from all the Republicans in North Carolina, where they stand on this, because it really should not be a difficult question.” Republicans react on Capitol Hill North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said the CNN report marked a “tough day,” but he urged fellow Republicans in the state to “stay focused on the races we can win,” pointing to the presidential election and other down-ballot contests. But he notably excluded the race for governor. “We have to make sure President Trump wins NC and support the outstanding GOP candidates running for key [North Carolina General Assembly] and judicial races. If Harris takes NC, she takes the White House. We can’t let that happen,” Tillis said on social media. Earlier Thursday, North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the House Republican campaign arm, told reporters that “the allegations were very concerning.” But Hudson stopped short of calling Robinson to step aside. “My hope is that the lieutenant governor can reassure the people of North Carolina that the allegations aren’t true,” he said. Another North Carolina Republican, Rep. Greg Murphy, who’s a member of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, also called the allegations “very concerning” but raised doubt about their authenticity. “What I read was very concerning, but given the degree of electronic manipulation that can happen these days with AI, with everything else, who the hell knows what’s true and what’s not,” he said. South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, also a Freedom Caucus member, told CNN the report was “pretty sad.” “To go this far along, and then to the people who supported him, all the money that he’s raised, and I think he needs to drop out today, so they get another candidate,” he said. Norman also said Robinson should have known that past message board comments would become public. “I think he’s a different man now – evidently, a lot of this happened in the past – but in politics, they’re going to find out everything, as rightfully they should,” Norman said. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she wanted to read the allegations, but “if that all turns out to be true, that would be certainly something that I definitely couldn’t support.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The goal was to rally local networks to host events and spread the campaign's message. This strategic move is aimed at mobilizing Polish American voters who could be crucial in tight races.Though Polish Americans are not the largest demographic, many live in key \"blue wall\" states. There are approximately 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania, and 481,000 in Wisconsin. Harris is visiting these states this week. Her campaign sees these voters as essential in the tight races that will determine the election outcome.Tom Malinowski, a Polish-born former Democratic congressman from New Jersey, noted, \"We're talking about an election where a swing of a few thousand voters in any of those states could make all the difference.\"Filip Jotevski, who is responsible for engaging with diaspora and ethnic communities, said on Wednesday's Harris organizing call that if Trump returns to power, \"he'll sell out Ukraine\" after years of \"cozying up to Vladimir Putin.\"Trump had planned to visit a Polish American shrine in Pennsylvania on Sunday to unveil a monument to the Solidarity movement but canceled the visit, according to a source familiar with the Republican candidate's plans.During the Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia, Trump twice refused to clarify whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war against Russia. He suggested, \"Negotiate a deal,\" which Harris countered by saying if Trump had been president during the invasion, \"Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe.\"Gosia Dodi, a Polish American resident in Michigan, expressed her agreement with Harris, saying, \"I absolutely agree\" that Russia could target Poland if Ukraine falls. She criticized Trump's approach as \"dangerous for Poland,\" adding, \"I want the war over, but not the way he's saying.\"Trump's past suggestions to withdraw from NATO and his demands for increased defense spending have raised concerns. Pete Alibali, an immigrant from Soviet-controlled Poland, views Putin as a \"predator\" and worries about the security of smaller Baltic nations if Ukraine is defeated.Tom Kolano, a Republican from Pittsburgh, remains optimistic about Trump's stance, believing that Poland will influence U.S. policy on Ukraine. John Laka, from Wisconsin, expressed skepticism about Harris, stating, \"She's just really lacking.\"The outcome in these crucial battleground states will hinge on which candidate can secure the support of Polish American voters. The ongoing debate over Ukraine's fate will likely continue to play a central role in shaping their decision.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press","summary":"There are an estimated 784,000 in Michigan, 758,000 in Pennsylvania and 481,000 in Wisconsin, three places that Kamala Harris is visiting this week","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/polish-american-voters-harris-trump-election-1956468","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476192/former-president-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:22:32","author":"Amir Daftari","authors":["Amir Daftari"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.076},{"id":256861058,"title":"Haniyeh rejected billions and a Palestinian state, son reveals","text":"Ismail Haniyeh, the late Hamas leader, turned down a deal offering billions of dollars and the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza, according to his son, Abd Al-Salam Haniyeh. The offer, part of the \"Deal of the Century\" brokered by former Trump adviser Jared Kushner, was refused due to demands to disarm Hamas, according to Haniyeh’s son, who also reflected on the transformation and development of Gaza in recent years. In an interview posted on YouTube in August and translated by Memri TV, the son of the former head of Hamas’s political bureau said his father had been offered a deal by Kushner, then senior adviser to President Donald Trump. “He said that Kushner (told) a mediator that he wanted to come over and reach an agreement about the Deal of the Century and the establishment of a (Palestinian) state in Gaza, and then billions would be spent on Gaza, and they would hand over the weapons of the resistance”. Haniyeh recollected that his father “famously said ‘may our hands be paralysed if we sign an agreement that will separate Gaza from Palestine’.” In the interview with SamaQuds network on YouTube, Haniyeh’s son talked about how much Gaza had improved in recent years, with the opening up of more aid channels and global attention on the Strip. “After the 2008-2009 (war) the world opened up (to Gaza). For the first time, a huge thing happened. Although “There were 1,200 martyrs and there was destruction,” Haniyeh remarked that the attention of “The world, Al-Jazeera TV, the media,” improved things for the territory. “There was an Arab summit, and people were sympathising. “The convoys started. The tunnels began to be active, and whatever,” he went on, referring to the mass expansion of Hamas’s tunnel network and the increasing aid convoys into Gaza. “Then there was the Arab Spring and then, in 2013... it was a time of progress, and (in 2012), the Emir of Qatar came, and laid the cornerstone for the reconstruction. All this has turned into Gaza.” “People who came to Gaza in 2020-2021 could not believe this was Gaza because it was so beautiful. With buildings, the Doha Promenade, the Egypt Promenade, restaurants, and so on and so forth. “Who would have thought that this was besieged Gaza which had been through wars? The kind of beauty that was there could not be found in many Arab countries,” Haniyeh went on. Haniyeh added: “If (my father) really cared about himself, he could have signed an agreement and a red carpet would have been rolled out for him.” Asked by the interviewer if his father was “offered such a thing”, he responded: “He was offered many things.” “He talked about what was offered to him as part of the Deal of the Century.”","summary":"In 2021 Gaza had more beauty than many Arab countries, Abd Al-Salam Haniyeh also says in interview","url":"https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/haniyeh-rejected-billions-and-a-palestinian-state-son-reveals-uxpgunbb","image":"https://api.thejc.atexcloud.io/image-service/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1e1vsnm869sp4ulneon/0/screenshot2024-09-20at11-04-49-png.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:22:05","author":"Jane Prinsley","authors":["Jane Prinsley"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.443},{"id":256860182,"title":"New survey reveals Trump and Kamala tied in crucial state that may impact election outcome","text":"A second poll in 24 hours shows Donald Trump tied with Kamala Harris in one of the critical midwestern swing states that could turn the election. A Marist College poll released just after midnight Thursday shows Harris ahead of Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan and the rivals statistically tied in Pennsylvania. Trump won all three so-called ‘blue wall’ states over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, delivering him an Electoral College victory. In 2020, President Joe Biden flipped the three states back to the Democratic column. The poll shows Harris leading Trump by five points in Michigan, 52 percent to 47 percent, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Harris has a small lead in Michigan with independents and larger leads with black voters and female voters. Trump leads in the state with white voters and men. In Wisconsin, where Trump and Harris were tied in Wednesday’s key poll, Harris has a one-point advantage at 50 percent to 49 percent but well within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. Harris did have a larger lead among Wisconsin independents (51 percent to 47 percent) than she does in Michigan (49 to 47) and even leads Trump among white and male voters. In Pennsylvania, however, the two can not be separated, with a 49-49 tie and the margin of error of plus-minus 2.9 percentage points. Trump leads Harris 49 percent to 45 percent among independent voters, while claiming men and white voters, while Harris leads among female and nonwhite voters. A Quinnipiac University poll released earlier Wednesday shows Harris ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania and Michigan while they are tied in Wisconsin. Harris now has a six-point lead in Pennsylvania in that poll – 51 percent to 45 percent – with Green Party hopeful Jill Stein and Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver garnering 1 percent each. The margin of error in Pennsylvania is plus or minus 2.7 percent. In Michigan, Harris leads Trump by five points – 50 percent to 45 percent – with Stein receiving 2 percent of the vote. Her lead is narrowly outside the plus or minus 3.3 percent margin of error. In Wisconsin, Harris leads by 1 point – 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent – with Stein recieving 1 percent of the vote. That poll had a plus or minus 3 percent margin of error. By narrow margins, voters in the three states say Trump is the better leader on the economy and immigration but Harris is the far-and-away leader on the issue of abortion. In Pennsylvania, 57 percent say Harris would do a better job handling the issue of abortion, compared to 38 percent who said Trump. In Michigan it’s 53 percent for Harris and 42 percent for Trump and in Wisconsin 53 percent also said Harris, while 40 percent said Trump. Harris had an edge when asked which candidate was better for ‘preserving democracy.’ She had a tiny lead when Americans in the three states were asked which candidate would better handle a crisis. In Pennsylvania, 49 percent said Harris and 47 percent said Trump. In Michigan, 51 percent said Harris, 47 percent said Trump and in Wisconsin – where Harris has the smallest lead – 49 percent said Harris and 48 percent said Trump. The three midwestern states are among the seven considered to be crucial to the race, alongside, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. Biden won six of the seven in 2020 en route to the White House. If Harris were to lose either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, she would need to hang on to Arizona, Georgia and Nevada or flip North Carolina to retain the White House for the Democrats. Harris will return to Wisconsin to campaign on Friday, while Trump will head to Pennsylvania for a rally Monday night.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA second poll in 24 hours shows Donald Trump tied with Kamala&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New survey reveals Trump and Kamala tied in crucial state that may impact election outcome first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/new-survey-reveals-trump-and-kamala-tied-in-crucial-state-that-may-impact-election-outcome/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-New-poll-shows-Trump-and-Kamala-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-20 10:20:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":256860310,"title":"How Oct. 7 changed the Middle East forever","text":"On the eve of the United Kingdom’s entry into World War I, the British Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey told a friend: “The lamps are going out across Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.” Grey’s warning has become famous, presciently foretelling the near century of horrors that followed in the Great War’s wake: communism, fascism, and the rise of totalitarianism. Similarly, the Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of Israel by Hamas and other Iranian-backed proxies is an epoch-defining moment for the Middle East and American power. The assault heralds a new Middle East, one that is even more unstable and one in which American deterrence has utterly collapsed and the Islamic Republic of Iran is surgent. A year after the Oct. 7 attacks, the United States and its allies must have an honest reckoning with their meaning. Iran’s power has risen, while America’s has diminished. Indeed, the breadth and scope of the invasion was astonishing. “The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7,” the journalist Seth Frantzman recently observed, “was unprecedented in its size and mass killing.” The assault was the largest invasion and organized mass killing by an Islamist terrorist group against a democracy in modern history. Adjusted for population, the massacre was roughly the equivalent of more than 30,000 Americans murdered in one day — more than 10 times the number killed by al Qaeda on 9/11. Some 1,200 people were murdered, and around 240 others were taken hostage and brought into Gaza. An estimated 3,800 terrorists from Hamas and other Gaza terrorist groups took part, along with more than 2,000 Gaza civilians who joined in the rampage, according to the Israel Defense Forces’s Gaza Division. The border dividing Israel and Gaza was breached in 119 places. According to the IDF, 1,000 terrorists in Gaza fired rockets as part of the coordinated attack. A total of 5,000 rockets were fired at Israel in a 24-hour span — 3,000 of them in the first four hours. Terrorists used drones to disable Israeli observation posts and high-tech surveillance equipment. Terrorists on paragliders flew into the Jewish state, including the Nova music festival, where peaceful concertgoers were slaughtered and raped en masse over the course of hours. Terrorists did dry runs with motorcycles to practice taking hostages and seizing infrastructure. The IDF would later conclude that Hamas and its minions had intended to take and hold land inside of Israel itself. Instruction manuals found on captured and killed terrorists indicate they intentionally targeted specific communities. The manuals, Israeli President Isaac Herzog noted, specified how terrorists should treat their victims: “exactly how to torture them, how to abduct them, how to kidnap them.” Those taken were to be used “as human shields” and “electric shocks” should be administered to force compliance. The German publication Bild recently reported that a document found on Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar’s computer called for using the hostages to “exert psychological pressure on the families of the prisoners, both now and during the first phase [of a ceasefire deal] so that public pressure on the enemy government increases.” Some reports indicate that Hamas began planning the operation as early as 2014. It couldn’t have done so without Tehran’s support. According to the Wall Street Journal, 500 operatives from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad “received specialized combat training in Iran” in the weeks leading up to the assault. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force conducted the training with top Iranian and Palestinian leaders in attendance. The IRGC, which has trained and equipped other terrorist groups, including Hezbollah and al Qaeda offshoots, was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by then-President Donald Trump in 2019. In the days and months leading up to the assault, Hamas conducted a sophisticated disinformation campaign meant to deceive Israeli officials into thinking Gaza was quiet and that should an attack occur, it would likely come from Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border. Regrettably, this lie was swallowed, hook, line, and sinker. For years, the Israeli security establishment bought the idea, an idea pushed by many, including the Qataris and some in the U.S. State Department, that it could buy peace from Hamas with copious amounts of aid. Oct. 7 revealed this to be an illusion. As foreign affairs analysts Shoshana and Stephen Bryen observed a few days after the massacre, the Hamas-led invasion showed that “terrorist groups can’t be managed.” An offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood that has operated in the area since the 1930s, Hamas was created in the 1980s and began receiving extensive support from Iran in 1989. Like its paymasters in Tehran, Hamas explicitly calls for Israel’s destruction and the genocide of its Jews. Put simply: It is the closest modern-day ideological heir to Nazi Germany. History is clear: There can be no negotiating with genocidal entities. It will not moderate its “final solution.” Oct. 7 illustrated that Hamas and Iran mean what they say — their rhetoric is not, as some press and policymakers would have it, meant purely for domestic consumption. The Hamas Covenant of 1988, the group’s foundational document, says that “there is no solution to the Palestinian question except through Jihad” and “initiatives, proposals and international conferences are a waste of time and vain endeavors.” Hamas must be taken at its word. This must be the chief lesson from that grim day. The Oct. 7 massacre was the largest slaughter of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust — an ill-omen for the non-Jewish world, as well. It is often said that the Jewish people are a “canary in the coal mine.” Throughout history, time and again, escalating violence against Jews has presaged something larger, something darker for the rest of the world. “Wherever antisemitism took hold,” the late historian Paul Johnson once observed, “social and political decline almost inevitably followed.” Indeed, the last time that Jews were massacred in the numbers seen last fall, the world itself was at war in the most destructive conflict that the Western world has ever seen. The Jewish people, Winston Churchill remarked in November 1941, “bore the brunt of the Nazis’ first onslaught upon the citadels of freedom and human dignity.” Much of the globe was apathetic to the persecution of European Jewry in the 1930s — a persecution that presaged the barbarism yet to come. Regrettably, Oct. 7 illustrated that many continue to be apathetic when totalitarian movements seek to perpetrate another genocide of Jewry. The Nazis had their apologists, and so does Hamas. But that much of the “international community” was once again OK with, or even complicit in, another mass murder of Jews doesn’t bode well for the fate of the civilized world. The skyrocketing antisemitism in the West, including at many universities where students and faculty openly celebrated the attacks, is ominous. Clouds are gathering. Iran has largely managed to evade responsibility for its role. In many respects, Oct. 7 was the Iranian regime announcing that it would no longer be restrained, no longer encumbered, in its chief objective: mastery of the Middle East. At its core, Iran is an imperialist power that seeks to dominate the region and spread its perverse ideology. Antisemitism is a key component, yes, but the regime’s ambitions go beyond re-creating the Holocaust. As the historian Ray Takeyh has noted, the mullahs see themselves as launching a new “Islamic epoch” with themselves at the epicenter. Regime founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for a “revolution without borders,” exhorting: “We don’t recognize Iran as ours, as all Muslim countries are part of us.” This has been Iran’s animating feature since its founding in 1979. But in many respects, Oct. 7 was its coming-out party. Iran’s goals are clear enough for those willing to listen to the regime’s words. But Tehran has a strategy, as well. The regime seeks to envelop Israel in a “Ring of Fire,” using its proxies to surround the Jewish state on all sides and then overwhelm it in a war of attrition that will wear down its missile defense systems, military personnel, and public. The Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis first warned about this strategy in a March 2018 Washington Examiner op-ed titled “Israel may be facing a five-front war.” Indeed, Tehran has spent the last two decades building up its capabilities in the region: from Hezbollah in Lebanon on Israel’s northern border to the Houthis in the Red Sea and Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria. Iran has been making inroads in the so-called West Bank (Judea and Samaria), which is nominally ruled by the Palestinian Authority. Iranian proxies have even been found operating in Israel itself and running weapons to Israeli Arab communities while seeking to incite internecine violence. More recently, the regime has been increasing its operations to topple the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan, no doubt hoping to open yet another front in its war against Israel. In some respects, Oct. 7 and the subsequent attacks by other Iranian proxies should be viewed as a “dry run.” Iran is testing Israel, probing for soft points. By destroying the Jewish state, Iran will have accomplished a feat that eluded ruling Arab monarchies of the 1940s, Arab nationalists in the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s, and generations of terrorists from Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization to al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Tehran will then be the unquestioned dominant power of the Islamist world and will usher in a new age. This, clearly enough, is its ambition. Oct. 7 showed that the Iranian regime has more than the motive. It increasingly believes it has the means, as well. For years, Iran has used its proxies to wage war. Iran, while comparatively lacking conventional military capabilities, has relied on asymmetrical warfare. Iran’s support for terrorist groups has provided the regime with plausible deniability, enabling it to mask its hand for a West that is often too willing to look the other way. But after Oct. 7, the mask is off. In mid-May, Iran launched a barrage of hundreds of rockets, missiles, and drones at the Jewish state. Tehran’s assault marked a significant escalation. Previously, the regime used its proxies to carry out such attacks. However, this was the first time that Iran chose to launch an attack of this scale directly from its soil. Clearly, Iran no longer feels the need to keep up pretenses. If Oct. 7 didn’t show that Iran is emboldened, the attack in mid-May, coinciding with attacks on both Israel and U.S. forces in the region, shows that the regime remains undeterred. If Iran’s calculus has changed, it stands to reason that Israel’s should, too. The Jewish state has experienced the largest loss of civilian life since its founding. The barbarians are no longer at the gates — they’ve broken through, into Israeli homes, proudly filming the horrors that they inflicted on children, families, and the elderly. Israel’s subsequent incursion into Gaza, and its largely successful military campaign against Hamas, illustrates that, at some level, the Jewish state knows that the previous policy of “managing terrorists” will no longer suffice. But problems abound. Hezbollah, a far more dangerous foe than Hamas, sits to Israel’s north, with more armaments and precision-guided missiles than most European nations. And like Hamas, Hezbollah uses human shields, hiding its weapons and operatives in densely populated civilian communities, hospitals, and schools. A war with Hezbollah would be of a type unseen in the Middle East for generations. Israel has made it clear that in the event of a broader conflict, the head of the snake wouldn’t go untouched. Yet Jerusalem might not be able to wait. Oct. 7 likely changed Israeli thinking regarding Iran’s nuclear weapons program. While most Israelis, like most Americans, oppose Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, some have argued that Iran can be discouraged from using nukes should it acquire them. After Oct. 7, such optimism is a luxury that Israel can no longer afford. Iran remains steadfast in its ambition to become a nuclear state. Organizations such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and the Institute for Science and International Security have chronicled the gains that Iran has been making in this regard. Tehran has refused to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Association and is stockpiling enriched uranium while installing hundreds of new centrifuges. Citing a recently published U.S. intelligence report that indicates the regime has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device,” FDD’s Andrea Stricker warned that “as Iran inches across the nuclear threshold, America is wasting precious time.” Israel may have to act to prevent the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism from going nuclear. Oct. 7 showed Israel the consequences of being reactive and indulging in wishful thinking. But it also illustrated that the press and the so-called international community will likely condemn Israel no matter what steps the Jewish state takes to protect itself and prevent another massacre. Many Western media outlets have parroted Hamas-supplied casualty figures, effectively doing the terrorist group’s PR. The United Nations, too, has been feckless. If Israel rightly feels that it can’t get a fair shake, let alone redress, it is only further incentivized to take the steps it feels compelled to take. And why not? Bad headlines from biased newspapers are a small price to pay to avoid another Oct. 7. Another factor makes both escalation and a broader war more likely: the United States. The war launched by Iranian proxies against Israel is as much the result of Iranian ambitions as American foolishness. U.S. deterrence has utterly collapsed, and the U.S. only has itself to blame. U.S. withdrawal from the region isn’t so much the problem as the way that withdrawal has been carried out. Instead of thwarting Iranian ambitions, too often Washington has placated and enabled them. Tehran has received sanctions relief and the delisting of its terrorist proxies, such as the Houthis, in exchange for ceding nothing of consequence and uttering transparently false promises. During the war against ISIS, the U.S. even effectively acted as air support for Iranian militias. The U.S. continues to give aid and arms to the Lebanese Armed Forces, under whose auspices Hezbollah has grown. America could have withdrawn from the Middle East and propped up key regional pillars such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. Instead, too often, it has chosen to undermine them while accommodating Iran, a sworn enemy. Such impudence seldom goes unpunished, and American power has taken a hit post-Oct. 7. An attack on a key American ally, arguably the key American ally in the region, has not gone unnoticed by others, both in the region and far from its shores. After Oct. 7, the security guarantee offered, implicitly and otherwise, by being friends with the U.S. isn’t what it once was. In a regional contest for influence between the U.S. and its foremost opponent, China, more nations are likely to hedge their bets. Hamas may be losing, but Iran, Beijing’s chief foil, is on the march. “Great battles, won or lost, change the entire course of events,” Churchill once intoned. They “create new standards of values, new moods, new atmospheres, in armies and in nations, to which all must conform.” Oct. 7 can’t be accurately described as a “battle,” although many defenders fought bravely and pushed Hamas-led invaders back. Rather, it was a massacre of innocents. But it seems certain that the entire course of events has changed. An honest observer is left with one conclusion: More war awaits.

A Republican nominee faces tendentious questioning! So far, so normal; most political journalists now think it’s their job to stop Trump being reelected. NABJ interviewers, as you’d expect, questioned Harris in the most neutral way possible. “Polling shows some black men are considering voting for Donald Trump and they see him as better for the economy. What’s your message to young black male voters who feel left out of this economy…?” This points to two key matters. First, black men, especially young ones, understand Trump’s appeal easily enough. His tax cuts disproportionately helped those low on the income scale, and he delivered record-low black unemployment. So even if Trump’s NABJ interviewers can’t see why a black person might vote for him, those interviewing Harris grasped his appeal perfectly well. The other key point was in Harris’s answer. “It is very important,” she said, “to not operate from the assumption that black men are in anybody’s pocket. Black men are like any other voting group. You’ve got to earn their vote, so I’m working to earn their vote, not assuming I’m going to have it because I’m black.” She might have added, “or because I’m a Democrat.” The question was perfectly pitched, perhaps intentionally, to cue up a statement from Harris that tackles the fact that Democrats have taken black voters for granted for decades while giving them handouts rather than allowing them to live with self-reliant dignity. This could cost her the White House. One in every 4 black men under 50 supports Trump. Unless Harris can bring some back into the Democratic camp, she’ll be responsible for a sixth successive election cycle in which black support for the blue party erodes. It could put Trump back in the Oval Office. This should be unsurprising, much though it perplexes the lumpen left-liberal, legacy media. Black and other racial minorities are disproportionately in the working class, and Democratic economic policies and cultural radicalism repel them. They aren’t interested in the false virtues of woke militancy. They care about the economy and other issues central to their well-being. The Trump campaign suggested Harris’s answer admitted his policies are better for black men than hers. Not quite. But either way, Harris is smart to take on the matter directly. For all her vacuity and deliberate vagueness — her refusal to do press conferences — she is strategically campaigning to repair the most dangerous cracks in the Democratic coalition. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Trump is less diligent and focused. He should be amplifying Harris’s weakness on the economy, the very issue that addresses all voters’ top concern and could win crucial black votes. Instead, as election guru Karl Rove notes, the former president is campaigning as though he has time to waste. He doesn’t and he’d better snap out of it. His opponent is not wasting her time.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris’s interview with the National Association of Black Journalists was starkly different from former President Donald Trump’s with the same organization.

The prominent author is seen as the conscience of the Albanian left. Lubonja is the son of a Hoxha confident who later fell afoul of the dictator. He spent 17 years in prison, most of it in labor camps like the notorious Spaç mine. Only in 1991, as one of the last political prisoners, was he released. \"I saw myself in young Edi Rama,” says Lubonja. \"Both of us wanted to step out from the shadow of our pro-regime fathers.” Rama, though, became mayor of Tirana in 2000 and he has been prime minister since 2013. The many years in power, says Lubonja, have changed him. \"He has become a spiteful narcissist, a clever guy without convictions, Dr. Jekyll during the day and Mr. Hyde at night, a person who needs power like oxygen to breathe.” Lubonja also complains that the West, especially Europe’s center-left political parties, ignore Albania’s gloomy reality. \"What crude oil is for other countries are the drug dealers and their money in Rama’s Albania,” says the former dissident. The last time the two spoke, he says, he called the prime minister a \"fraud,” though, as Lubonja says, he probably didn’t care. \"Because he is a crocodile – a large mouth and no ears.” From Cannabis to Cocaine Next year, Rama will be running for a fourth term. And his chances of re-election are good. \"Ninety percent of the municipalities are now in his hands, it’s almost like Russia,” says the investigative journalist Klodiana Lala. \"As long as nobody stands up and says: 'I personally handed money to Edi Rama,’ nothing is going to happen to him. The mafia’s law of silence, the law of omertà, is in effect.” Several investigators have confirmed to both Italian state broadcaster RAI and DER SPIEGEL that contacts with organized crime have taken place at the highest levels of government. The early trade in cannabis has since morphed into a business involving cocaine by the ton, they say. The Albanian syndicates, investigators believe, have established networks with the Calabrian N’drangheta and with cartels in Latin America. Italian public prosecutor Francesco Mandoi, who served temporarily as Rama’s anti-corruption commissioner, has come to a sobering conclusion: \"The drug bosses have their people everywhere in administration, in the institutions. They are now able to get the government to do their bidding.” Mandoi says that his warnings found no resonance in top levels of government. Investments from Kushner and Grenell The money from the Albanian drug mafia has also made itself visible in the form of skyscrapers, which have transformed the erstwhile dreary Tirana cityscape. Construction also continues apace on the Adriatic coast. Donald Trump’s son in law Jared Kushner and Richard Grenell, the former U.S. special envoy for peace talks between Serbia and Kosovo, are both planning large investments there with Rama’s blessing. Rama, Grenell and Trump have known and appreciated each other since the time when they pursued a plan to redraw the borders of Kosovo and Serbia under the eyes of the EU foreign policy chief.","summary":"Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama is a welcome guest in Western capitals - in part because he is helping Europe with its refugee problem.

In a new attack ad, the Trump campaign blasted Vice President Kamala Harris over her past support for government-guaranteed transgender surgeries for prison inmates and migrants held in detention facilities. “Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” a narrator began in the spot titled, “Nonsense.” “Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens.” “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.” Earlier this month, just before the debate between former President Donald Trump and Harris, CNN unearthed a past 2020 campaign-era questionnaire from the American Civil Liberties Union, in which the future VP expressed support for government-guaranteed transgender surgeries. She affirmed that as president, she would use her executive powers to “ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care — including those in prison and immigration detention” would get access to “all necessary surgical care.” “I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained,” she wrote in response. “Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment.” In an interview with the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) Action Fund during the 2020 election cycle, Harris doubled down on that stance. She claimed that when she served as attorney general of California, she “worked behind the scenes” to ensure that the state’s Department of Corrections changed its policy “so that every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care that they desire and need.” The Trump campaign spot highlights Harris’ comments in that interview with NCTE and showcases headlines from media outlets reporting on her past stance. The political ad wraps up by touting a headline from 2017 summarizing the 45th president’s agenda, which read “Trump: Lower taxes, bigger paychecks for workers.” Trump raised the transgender surgery issue during his debate against Harris, chiding that she “wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens in prison.” The 78-year-old was asked about his pronouns by Fox News host Laura Ingraham back in July. “I have no — I don’t want pronouns,” Trump shot back. The Post reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign about her past position. Since her abrupt ascension to the Democratic nomination, Harris has been haunted by some of the far-left positions she took during her unsuccessful 2020 bid for the White House. There’s a laundry list of policy items that Harris has since reversed on, including a ban on plastic straws, and a ban on fracking — a position seen as needed to win Pennsylvania. She has also softened on pushes for Medicare for all, a mandatory gun buyback program that aides reportedly suggested dropping, the decriminalization of illegal border crossings and a federal jobs guarantee. Trump has indicated that he doesn’t intend to face off against Harris again in a future debate before the election. Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance is set to go toe-to-toe against Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Oct. 1 in a debate hosted by CBS News.","summary":"They’re going at it.
