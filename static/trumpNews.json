Email eleanor.mann@mailonline.co.uk\nBy ELEANOR MANN \n Published:00:54 BST, 11 August 2025 |Updated:01:50 BST, 11 August 2025 \n\nA husband has been refused permission to build a parking space for his disabled wife outside their village home - over fears it would 'harm the character' of the heritage site where they live.\nJohn Flattery applied for planning permission to build a 2.5 metre (8 foot) driveway in the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site in Ironbridge, Shropshire, where they live. \nThe married couple's mid-terraced period cottage sits within the famous Ironbridge Gorge, where there are strict planning rules against developments of all kinds. \nJohn had hoped that the council would approve the new parking area to allow his disabled wife safe access to the property. \nBut he is now embroiled in a planning row with his local council after the plans were refused. \nTelford & Wrekin Council said the parking space would cause 'harm to the Outstanding Universal Value of the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site and Severn Gorge Conservation Area.'\nThey accepted the 'improved access would be beneficial to the applicant' as on-street parking is limited on Woodside, in Coalbrookdale.\nBut they concluded that the plans would 'disrupt the visual rhythm, cohesion, uniformity and character' of the picturesque village.\n\nA husband has been refused permission to build a parking space for his disabled wife outside their village home - over fears it would 'harm the character' of the heritage site where they live\n\nIronbridge was the birthplace of ironworks after Abraham Darby I first smelted iron ore using coke instead of charcoal in 1709\n\nThe married couple's mid-terraced period cottage sits within the famous Ironbridge Gorge, where there are strict planning rules against developments of all kinds\nSome residents have branded the decision 'harsh' and said it was depriving a disabled woman of the dignity of being able to access her own home.\nOne neighbour said: 'We know there are very strict rules here and for a good reason. But this man only wants to build a small driveway for his wife.\n'It is depriving her dignity of being able to get to her own home and I can't see how a flat bit of driveway would harm the landscape here.\n'I think it's rather harsh in this instance as he's hardly building a two-storey eyesore extension. I do hope they reconsider.'\nAnother resident, however, disagreed, saying: 'The guy who bought the house spends most of his time in Ireland and I think he is a property developer.\n'There is access up there and space for cars already so I don't think it is entirely necessary.\n\nTelford & Wrekin Council said the parking space would cause 'harm to the Outstanding Universal Value of the Ironbridge Gorge World Heritage Site and Severn Gorge Conservation Area'\n\nJohn Flattery applied for planning permission to build a 2.5 metre (8 foot) driveway in the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site in Ironbridge, Shropshire, where they live\n\nThe local council concluded that the plans would 'disrupt the visual rhythm, cohesion, uniformity and character' of the picturesque village\n\nSome residents have branded the decision 'harsh' and said it was depriving a disabled woman of the dignity of being able to access her own home\n'This area is well protected and preserved, we're proud of that and it should stay that way.'\nJohn Flattery had wanted to create a 2.5 metre-wide driveway with a paved 900 millimetre-wide pedestrian path either side for disabled access.\nHe also wanted to relay the existing paved area accessing the front of the dwelling.\nPlanning agent Kevin Twigger, of KRT Associates Ltd, had told planners that the proposal would remove 'approximately 40 per cent of the grassed area'.\nHe argued the materials were 'in keeping with the visual appearance of the surrounding cottages' and the selection of grasscrete (made from natural grass combined with reinforced concrete) for the driveway provided a 'durable, well-drained, aesthetically-pleasing option than traditional asphalt or concrete driveways'.\nHe added: 'It is intended that the existing railings will be reused and converted to a horizontal sliding gate serving the driveway and left-side pedestrian path, maintaining both security and aesthetic appearance.\n'The existing pedestrian gate will be relocated to serve the right-side pedestrian path.\n'The proposed changes are necessary to assist the applicant's disabled wife to access the dwelling safely.\n'Woodside is a narrow, one-way lane with no opportunity for safe accessible on-street car parking for disabled individuals.\n'The carefully designed proposals ensure that the visual and environment impacts are minimised whilst providing necessary adaptions to meet the disabled occupants' needs to enhance their ability to live independently in their home.'\nBut planners disagreed. They said: 'It is considered that the proposal would create the partial loss of green amenity space and the subdivision of the historic frontage, disrupting the visual rhythm, cohesion, uniformity and character of the row of terrace and would be harmful to the character and setting of the building of local interest.\n'Whilst it is acknowledged that the improved access would be beneficial to the applicant, this is not outweighed by the harm to the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the lronbridge Gorge World Heritage Site and Severn Gorge Conservation Area.'\nJohn and his wife were told that they could appeal to the Planning Inspectorate.\nIronbridge was the birthplace of ironworks after Abraham Darby I first smelted iron ore using coke instead of charcoal in 1709.\nThe process, which was far more efficient than traditional methods, triggered a mass production of cast iron.\nIn 1779 his grandson, Abraham Darby III, build the world's first Iron Bridge near to the site, connecting Coalbrookdale to the industrial town of Broseley. \nThe area continued to thrive throughout the 19th century and into the 20th until the industry went into decline as it competed with new technologies and production methods.\nThe site is classed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and still attracts thousands of visitors each year as the 'birthplace of the Industrial Revolution'.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHusband is refused permission to build parking space for his disabled wife because he lives in a world heritage site\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

There are many challenges in product liability litigation. Not only do we have to start where we are now in determining what happened, but we also have to determine whether or not there is a defect that caused this,\" Andrews explained. The investigation will examine potential design or manufacturing issues, as well as maintenance problems, to piece together the events leading up to the crash.\n\"We need to determine whether the problem stems from design or manufacturing issues, or if it's a maintenance problem. Sometimes it's a combination of the two. So the challenges initially are putting the puzzle together, finding out what happened,\" he added.\nAlso Read | Operation Sindoor: Navies of India and Pakistan To Carry Out Drills in the Arabian Sea From August 11, NOTAMs Issued.\nAndrews highlighted the intricacies of the case, stating, \"Did a defect render this product unfit for its intended purpose? Was it foreseeable that it was going to be used in this way? Did someone misuse it, and did it fail under its ordinary use?\" The investigation will also scrutinise the aircraft's complex electrical and computer systems to determine if any uncommanded or erroneous inputs contributed to the crash.\n\"So, in this case, the question is whether it is foreseeable that a plane will take off. What happened behind the scenes? This is a very complex, complicated, electrically driven, computer-operated aircraft. What other things could have gone wrong? Did the pilots make the inputs, or did the computer call for an uncommanded, uncontrolled, erroneous input that led to this?\" he added.\nThe lawyer emphasised the importance of analysing alternative designs that could have prevented or mitigated the crash. \"Once we make those determinations, we begin to look at things like alternative designs. Are there designs out there that could have prevented this from happening, could have mitigated the injuries, could have made it less likely?\" On June 12, Air India flight AI171, a Boeing 787-8 aircraft, crashed shortly after it took off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, killing 260 people, including 229 passengers, 12 crew members, and 19 people on the ground.\nThe Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) of India later released the preliminary report into the tragic crash, outlining the harrowing sequence of events that unfolded within 90 seconds of takeoff.

And, I mean, obviously, it’s a high priority to get this war to end.”\n\nAFP reported that Zelensky has held calls with 13 counterparts over three days, including “Kyiv’s main backers: Germany, Britain and France.”\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Sunday he hoped and assumed that Zelensky would attend the summit, joining a chorus of European leaders who insisted that Ukraine have a seat at the table in Alaska.\n\nWhitaker said the decision would ultimately be Trump’s to make.\n\n“If he thinks that that is the best scenario to invite Zelensky, then he will do that,” he said, adding that “no decision has been made to this point.”\n\nMeanwhile, Vance attempted to assure Trump’s “America First” base that no more US taxpayer dollars would be spent on Kyiv’s behalf.\n\n“We’re done with the funding of the Ukraine war business.

We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong,\" Mr Trump posted on the Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\nThe White House declined to explain what legal authority Mr Trump would use to evict people from Washington. The Republican president controls only federal land and buildings in the city.\n\nMr Trump planned to hold a press conference on Monday, local time, to \"stop violent crime in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nIt was unclear whether he would announce more details about his eviction plan then.\n\nMr Trump's Truth Social post included pictures of tents and DC streets with garbage on them.\n\n\"I'm going to make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Community Partnership, an organisation working to reduce homelessness in Washington DC, on any given night there are 3,782 people experiencing homelessness in the city of about 700,000 people.\n\nMost of the homeless individuals are in emergency shelters or transitional housing.

Pack hair spray.' How the Texas Democrats are living on the run - USA Today","text":"A child starting kindergarten is a milestone most American families wouldn't dare miss, but it's one John Bucy will be absent from this month when one of his daughters takes a first step in her education.\n\nThe 41-year-old Texas state legislator, whose district includes parts of northern Austin, is among the more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who've fled the Lone Star State to thwart President Donald Trump's effort to protect his razor-thin Republican majority in Congress. He packed his suitcase to be gone for 30 days – maybe longer.\n\n\"It makes me scared. It makes me sad,\" Bucy said in an interview about his self-imposed exodus from his family. \"I want to be a part of their lives every chance that I can. But what scares me more is if I'm not here, if they grow up and things are worse off in this country because we didn't stop this gerrymandering.\"\n\nBucy is staying at an undisclosed hotel in Illinois while he and his fellow Democrats continue to block their Republican colleagues from conducting official business back in Austin, such as the rare mid-decade redrawing of their state's maps that define congressional district boundaries. He said he's still in touch with his legislative staff, who are keeping up with constituents and connecting them to state agencies.\n\nTexas is a part-time legislature with a $7,200 annual salary, so like many members, Bucy also has a regular job running a statewide organization that provides athletic, academic and arts competitions for charter school students.\n\nOther Texas colleagues who aren't able to work remotely say they are juggling their personal lives, too, amid a partisan firestorm that is spilling over into other Republican and Democratic-controlled states ahead of the November 2026 midterm election campaign.\n\nTexas state Rep. Donna Howard said she had to take her grandson along when she left town. Baker, 4, has one parent in recovery and another who isn't in the picture. He's since become a \"mascot\" for the Democratic legislators at the hotel who have volunteered to help watch him when she speaks with constituents, conducts media interviews or when she needs time alone.\n\n\"It is a village and my village is stepping up to support me with my grandchild,\" said Howard, 73, whose district includes parts of southern Austin. \"I can't tell you how many people I don't even normally work with on things who have come up and said, 'Can I take him for a little bit and go throw the ball?' So he's kind of like 'King of the Hill' in a lot of ways.\"\n\nTexas Dems resist 'headache factor' but for how long?\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with more than a dozen Texas Democrats at the center of the national tug-of-war who are facing $500-per-day fines, plus sharp rebukes from Trump and his allies.\n\nThey have made arrangements to secure extended child care. They have requested longer-than-expected work absences and found new locations for aging loved ones who require 24-hour caretakers. But they also said living in close quarters has an upside: their relationships and team-building have improved with activities such as daily exercise groups.\n\n\"Pack a toothbrush. Pack hair spray because hey, this could go on for a while and you got to be ready for it,\" said Democratic state Rep. Ann Johnson, an attorney who represents parts of Houston.\n\nJohnson, 50, participated in the last Texas quorum break orchestrated by Democrats in 2021, when they fled to Washington, DC, to resist the GOP tightening the state's election rules. She said she was more prepared this time, but added that this fight is a more stressful and significant situation given the Trump administration's pressure campaign.\n\n\"They'll continue to try to break us, but I actually feel, unlike 2021, there's a really strong coalition here,\" Johnson said. \"There's a drastic difference... now the threats are so much harsher, they're so much more significant, and the risk of what we lose if we are not successful is really large.\"\n\nRepublicans are also doing their part to stymie the Democrats' political efforts, not to mention making their personal lives uncomfortable.\n\nThree-term Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott has threatened to arrest and expel the missing Democrats from the legislature. The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, filed an Aug. 8 lawsuit seeking to get 13 of them removed from office. The FBI is also helping with the search for the lawmakers, according to U.S. Sen. Jon Cornyn, a Texas Republican facing his own 2026 primary challenge from Paxton and who made the request for help.\n\n\"A lot of people are demanding they come back,\" Trump told reporters on Aug. 5. \"You can't just sit it out. You have to go back.\"\n\nIn suburban Chicago, an Aug. 6 bomb threat at the hotel where some of the Texas Democratic legislators have been staying woke them from sleep with a blaring siren echoing through the halls every 30 seconds. It forced an evacuation of the building and took about two hours before guests were allowed back inside, several lawmakers told USA TODAY.\n\nMany of the Democrats said the bomb threat marks a turning point, and made them think of officials being targeted in other states, such as in Minnesota, where an alleged gunman shot two state lawmakers and their spouses at their homes in June, killing one of the couples.\n\n\"We have people who are threatening our lives, threatening our families' lives by exposing us,\" said state Rep. Christian Manuel, 38, whose district covers an eastern portion of the state that includes Beaumont, Texas.\n\nManuel, who is Black, helps take care of his 95-year-old grandmother and remains in constant contact with family members. Living an hour outside of Jasper, Texas, where a Black man named James Byrd was dragged to death by confirmed white supremacists in 1998, he said the bomb threat at the Illinois hotel reminded him of the potential danger.\n\n\"My family is aware,\" Manuel said. \"We are all on alert.\"\n\nFor many of the absconding Democrats, these incidents have hardened their resolve to resist what progressive critics say are Trump and Abbott's attempts to change the math in their favor for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.\n\nTexas state Rep. Jolanda Jones, who represents parts of Houston, went viral this week after she slammed Abbott's attempt to have the legislators return. She was also embroiled in controversy for comparing the redistricting plan to the Holocaust in an Aug. 5 interview on \"The Don Lemon Show,\" for which she later apologized.\n\nJones said she serves as her mother's primary caregiver and that other relatives and neighbors back home have stepped up to help, but that she remains worried about her mother's well-being, given Jones' high visibility.\n\n\"My mother can't live by herself – that's the bottom line. So me deciding to quorum break was a big deal,\" Jones, 59, who is running for a Houston-based seat in Congress, told USA TODAY. \"I don't know what would happen to my mom if she opened the door and, would they barge in, what would they do? I'm absolutely concerned.\"\n\nDems hope to frame Texas battle as flood victims versus Trump's whims\n\nExperts warn the endgame of the quorum break looks bleak for Democrats, even as the national party and liberal activists say they believe the fight could be an inflection point against the Trump administration.\n\n\"They walked out to stop Republicans from hijacking our democracy,\" said Christina Harvey, executive director of Stand Up America, a left-leaning voting rights group that has been running ads on social media and TV to mobilize its members against the redistricting efforts.\n\nThe Texas special session is scheduled to end Aug. 19, and Democratic legislators say they're committed to staying away from Austin for the long haul. But Abbott can also keep convening legislators, over and over, legal and political experts say, while applying legal and law enforcement pressure until the Republican-controlled legislature gets what it wants.\n\nThe governor is adding a \"headache factor\" for lawmakers, Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University, told USA TODAY. Even if none of Abbott's efforts bear fruit, they could lead to the need for the runaway legislators to at least respond to a lawsuit and incur costs, lost time and extra effort, he said.\n\nQuorum breaks have been a tool used by the minority party in Texas since 1870. Often, the move is more of a messaging effort with little success in blocking the specific proposal, experts point out. Texas rules say the House must have two-thirds of its members, or 100 people, present to move forward. Of the 62 House Democrats, a few have remained behind in Austin, meaning only a handful need to be arm-twisted into returning to the state for a quorum to be restored and votes to proceed.\n\nJones, the Rice University professor, said the roughly 50 legislators would have to stay out of the state through the end-of-year holidays and into the spring of 2026 for their long-term strategy to prevail.\n\nAsked how long they can stay out of Texas, many of the Democratic legislators pivot in their responses to hammer the argument that Abbott is putting the two-term Republican president's desires over a needed aid package for the destructive and deadly flooding that submerged central parts of the state in July.\n\nFor now, it's unclear how the public is coming down on the Democrats' framing of the fight.\n\nA poll conducted by Texas-based Z to A Research, a Democratic-aligned firm, found that 63% of likely voters – including 41% of Republican voters – believe it's unnecessary to be redrawing the congressional district lines several years before it typically happens. An overwhelming majority of 94% said they support funding flood warning systems and relief efforts, according to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo.\n\nWherever the Texas battle lands, the Democratic legislators who have fled to Illinois – a few others have been part of press conferences and public events in California, New York, Massachusetts – said they have become a stronger caucus as a result. They described bonding in ways they couldn't during regular sessions, and they believe that sense of unity will spread to Democrats in other states as the Trump administration looks to expand its redistricting strategy.","summary":"'Pack a toothbrush.

The president was recently outraged after a young administration staffer was reportedly assaulted in an attempted carjacking. \n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced that a Monday press conference would end violent crime in Washington. On Sunday, he took to Truth Social again, this time to call on the city’s homeless to “clear out” “immediately.” The president compared his crime-battling action to his work restricting illegal immigration at the southern border. \n\nThe FBI agents from the bureau’s counterintelligence, public corruption, and other units are now set to take part in traffic stops, for which they lack the proper training, The Post noted. \n\nTrump ordered federal law enforcement agents from a number of agencies to be sent into city streets last week, and he said more juveniles should be charged in the justice system as adults. \n\nThe paper found that the diversion to local crime has caused frustration at the FBI. Most of the 120 agents authorized by the administration to battle crime alongside D.C. police come from the Washington Field Office. FBI agents usually don’t have the authority to conduct traffic stops, and people familiar with the situation told The Post that the agents could be dispatched to support other agencies. \n\nFederal land is all across the nation’s capital, and local law enforcement often works side by side with federal agents to patrol it. However, these duties usually fall to the U.S. Park Police and the Secret Service, and not the FBI. \n\nAnonymous top officials in the D.C. police department told The Post that the Trump administration hasn’t asked how to deploy these additional resources. As D.C. is not a state, federal authorities can exert more control over the city even as residents and local elected leaders protest. \n\nD.C. residents elect their own mayor and city council following the 1973 Home Rule Act. However, a federal takeover of Washington’s police department would be an unusual use of power in a city where local leaders have few ways to resist federal intrusions. \n\nOn Sunday morning, the FBI told The Post in a statement that “Agents from the FBI Washington Field Office continue to participate in the increased federal law enforcement presence in D.C., which includes assisting our law enforcement partners.”\n\nTrump took to Truth Social on Sunday afternoon to call out the city’s mayor. \n\n“The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive,” he said. \n\nAppearing on MSNBC on Sunday, Bowser said Washington was \"not experiencing a crime spike.\"\n\n\"It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023,\" she said. \"We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.\"\n\nThe capital’s police department reported that violent crime in the first seven months of this year was down by 26 percent compared with 2024.

The horrific double explosion saw at least three beachgoers killed near Zatoka beach in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa. In recent weeks, the Black Sea resort has been seeing searing temperatures of around 30C, leading locals and tourists alike to descend on the city's beaches to cool off. It comes after Putin warns of nuclear war after unleashing another night of hell on Ukraine . But their refreshing dip turned into tragedy when two of the explosives detonated under the water, creating apocalyptic scenes on the beach. In the historic city, where brave locals try to continue their daily lives despite Vladimir Putin's bombs raining down on them, the beaches had previously been closed off until restrictions were lifted recently. Local news outlet Dumskaya reports the victims were a woman and two men who were swimming when the two explosive devices exploded around 165ft from shore. Odesa regional chief Oleh Kiper confirmed: “All of them have been killed by explosive devices while swimming in areas prohibited for recreation.” The Russian army has been relying on sea mines to attack Ukrainian shipping vessels in the Black Sea after Moscow suffered heavy naval losses at the start of the conflict To defend themselves, Ukraine has deployed its own mines to prevent Russia launching amphibious assaults. The Black Sea, which lies on the coasts of both countries, is particularly dangerous for bathers - with unexploded mortars and aerial bombs found in addition to the sea mines. The mines can be dislodged by strong currents, heavy rainfall and shifting tides, with them being known to drift towards the shoreline. Rallying behind Ukraine, European allies have called for Ukraine to be included in an upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The meeting - which is due to take place next Friday - is being held for Trump and Putin to find a way to end the war, according to the US president. Ukraine's President Zelensky thanked European allies in a post on X, writing on Sunday: “The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.","summary":"The Black Sea resort of Odesa has been experiencing sweltering 30C conditions - with many locals drawn to the shores to cool off despite Vladimir Putin's bombardment of the city","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/three-tourists-dead-ukraine-beach-35707429","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35707572.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Screenshot-2025-08-10-at-140523JPG.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 23:36:33","author":"Ryan Fahey","authors":["Ryan Fahey"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":349918212,"title":"The Trump Administration has no way to make the Epstein problem disappear","text":"Roughly 35 years since becoming friends with Donald Trump, Ghislaine Maxwell’s relationship with the president is paying off. After agreeing to an interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Maxwell was moved from the low-security Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee to the minimum-security Federal Prison Camp, Bryan in Texas. \n\nThe prison in Tallahassee has a history of sexual abuse and poor conditions. FPC Bryan has puppies, although Maxwell is not allowed to touch them. According to the organization that runs the dog training program at FPC Bryan, it’s to protect the animals. Camp Bryan is supposed to be for people who can be trusted around puppies but the Administration had other ideas. \n\nAccording to ABC News sources familiar with the content of the interview, Maxwell did not disclose anything that would be incriminating or harmful to the president – you mean to tell me that she didn’t trash the one person who can get her out of prison? Trump and his team are now considering whether to release a transcript of the interview. The president has also refused to rule out a pardon for Maxwell. \n\nTo summarize, Trump needed something to quell the growing anger over his handling of the Epstein files (independent of whether he had anything to do with the Epstein abuses) and Maxwell could secure a move to a nicer prison and possibly even a presidential pardon for saying whatever was most useful to the administration.\n\nI’m certainly not accusing the administration of staging a cover-up or of a lack of transparency but it’s worthwhile to note that Maxwell has zero motivation for saying anything that would incriminate the president during the interview. \n\nIn fact, it’s very clear that all of the incentives are in favor of clearing Trump of any wrongdoing and saying whatever the administration thought would help with the crisis. Given that Maxwell was convicted of grooming and trafficking dozens of minors (some as young as 14) so that Epstein and others could rape and molest them, I wouldn’t put much stock in her integrity. No, if the Bible is right, she’s going straight to hell barring any last-minute repentance. \n\nThis is all stating the obvious and I believe that it is obvious to most people, including the Trump supporters who are troubled by his handling of this Epstein saga. It would mean that from the perspective of the Trump administration, this was all for naught – releasing the exculpatory transcripts or pardoning Maxwell would both backfire. \n\nMaking the transcripts public would again bring the Epstein files back to the forefront while MAGA supporters decide what to make of them – likely unsatisfied. Pardoning or commuting the sentence of a prolific child sex trafficker would probably not sit well with many. \n\nTreacherous podcasters like Joe Rogan, Andrew Shultz, and Tim Dillon may never get invited to the White House again once they get a chance to opine. \n\nCNN reported that an Epstein strategy meeting was supposed to take place at Vice President JD Vance’s house with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel attending although a spokesperson for Vance denied that a meeting was scheduled. \n\nReportedly, some of these Trump officials have been resisting the idea of releasing the transcripts in favor of simply letting the story die on its own. The problem with this strategy is that the administration was incredibly vocal about how much transparency they were creating by interviewing Maxwell. \n\nBy refusing to release the transcripts, they are only making the administration seem increasingly guilty of covering for pedophiles (in the minds of those who believe in the conspiracy) despite the fact that the transcripts are unlikely to contain any interesting information. \n\nThe entirety of the conundrum that the Epstein files have presented to the Trump administration was created because Trump and his subordinates continuously dangled the carrot of releasing the Epstein files and of holding elites accountable for their fiendish behavior. \n\nAfter each failure to deliver, their response was to dangle another carrot, only ensuring that they’ll have more carrot-dangling in their future – if it’s true that there is a network of elites whose pedophilic activities were facilitated by Epstein, it’s clear that the Trump administration has no interest in holding them accountable. \n\nFor those like Rogan and Dillon who wholeheartedly believe that there are elite pedophiles connected to Epstein who have not faced justice, there is nothing that the Trump administration can give them that would make the controversy disappear – either because releasing the sort of information that would satisfy believers in the conspiracy would hurt the Trump administration or because there’s simply no additional information that isn’t already public from all of the civil cases that have been previously unsealed.\n\nAll of the lies and exaggerations have resulted in the Trump administration permanently labeling themselves as the presidency that promised a populist revolt against the evil elites and then canceled it.\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.","summary":"All of the lies and exaggerations have resulted in the Trump administration permanently labeling themselves as the presidency that promised a populist revolt against the evil elites and then canceled it.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/08/10/the-trump-administration-has-no-way-to-make-the-epstein-problem-disappear/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/APTOPIX-Jeffrey-Epstein-Associate.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 23:29:04","author":"Rafael Perez","authors":["Rafael Perez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":349921478,"title":"NATO Ukraine support: Mark Rutte says alliance ensuring Kyiv has tools to stay in fight ahead of Trump-Putin summit","text":"ReutersNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte says the alliance is ensuring Ukraine has resources to continue fighting, ahead of the Aug. 15 Trump-Putin summit in Alaska\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte stated that the alliance is “making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight” ahead of the Aug. 15 meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

The signed agreement is intended to bring an end to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that has lasted for decades. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a Trump-brokered peace deal in the White House ending decades of tensions and conflict - if it holds. The deal includes the creation of a highly profitable strategic trade corridor that passes through both countries, incentivizing them to stay on course. That route, now known as the Zangezur Corridor ( previously discussed by this column multiple times), will be developed by American companies and rebranded Trump Route For International Peace and Prosperity (Tripp). It will include rail lines, communication lines, oil and gas pipelines.\n\nWhy is the route so important that age-old adversaries have potentially buried the hatchet in order to make it happen? The corridor would forge a pathway from the Stans in Central Asia down through the Caucasus to Turkey and beyond to the world, effectively revitalizing the old Silk Road. Which means it would bypass both Russia and Iran, countries which have hitherto colluded to keep Central Asia’s trade access westward bottled up except via their territory. Russia, in particular, is the loser here having dominated the terrain for over two centuries, imposing a choke hold and Moscow-centric dependency on its backyard from Turkmenistan to Kyrgyzstan. Those economies now stand to be liberated geopolitically from effective control by Russia.\n\nArmenians understand the geopolitical implications full well. It looks, at first glance, as if their historic adversaries - namely the Turkic world - are empowered and physically reconnected through this plan. So why has Armenia consented? Answer: because Armenians now distrust Moscow as security guarantor and have found a new one instead. As this column has pointed out numerous times, Moscow repeatedly failed to defend its allies in recent years (think Syria and Iran) since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Armenians were astonished that Moscow allowed the Azeris to retake Nagorno Karabakh in 2023, then cynically turned around and offered to partner versions of the Zangezur that would include Russia.\n\nBy bringing in US participation, Armenia gets a new guarantor of its security, one that can keep the pan-Turkic threat in check, and achieves payback for Moscow’s betrayal. For President Trump, the additional benefits include new leverage for his upcoming Ukraine peace talks with Putin, added leverage against Iran and - what nobody has mentioned - the replacement of China’s trade route (Belt and Road Initiative) from linking via Iran at its final critical outlet stage. In the first instance, Mr.Trump can offer to re-include Russia as a participant in the Zangezur - or not depending on Putin’s intransigence. In the second case, Iran is faced with the threat of its northern Turkic neighbor Azerbaijan getting richer and acting as a magnet to the Iranian province of Azerbaijan to break off and join its Turkic cousins. With regard to China, a new trade outlet for Central Asia makes the hitherto landlocked regional Stans less dependent on neighboring Chinese trade and economic influence.\n\nAnother factor that goes unmentioned in the global coverage about TRIPP is the fate of Tbilisi. Currently, Georgia benefits substantially from acting as a trade route, not least for the oil pipeline that goes from Baku via Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey. The Zangezur Corridor would render all that superfluous - thereby delivering a blow to Georgia’s economy. And to its regime, universally acknowledged as directed behind-the-scenes by the country’s richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili, a pro-Russian influence on the country. His main rival and former President, now in prison, the pro-American Mikheil Saakashvili has gone public pointing out the potential geopolitical and economic disaster for Georgia in contrast to the Western-aligned era of his tenure as leader. “Yes we are ending up in complete geopolitical isolation alongside Iran and Russia…This is where breaking our strategic alliance with America and Europe has brought us,” he says, while warning of “accelerated emigration and deepening poverty”for his country. In short, the destabilizing of the pro-Moscow Georgian state would be yet another blow to Russia’s strategic influence in its near-abroad.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nBut the outlook for TRIPP and the peace deal is not all smooth sailing either. Most recently, a top Iranian minister openly threatened repercussions against it saying “this corridor will not become a passage owned by Trump but rather a graveyard for Trump’s mercenaries”. Considering the amount of new infrastructure envisaged by the deal, maximal vulnerability to sabotage must also be considered. Which brings up the question of how participating US companies will defend the security of the route against the countries it geostrategically challenges. The Zangezur is essentially the equivalent of a Panama or Suez Canal both of which needed Western military support for decades during and after completion. Protecting such an endeavor would certainly require boots on the ground - which rather contradicts President Trump’s America First pledges to avoid foreign military entanglements.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"The Zangezur Corridor now named after President Trump offers the US as strategic arbiter of a region previously dominated by Russia and Iran","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2025/08/10/the-armenia-azerbaijan-peace-deal-and-the-new-trump-corridor/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6899281ecfd3a1b258c1173b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 23:23:53","author":"Andrew Harnik,Contributor,Melik Kaylan","authors":["Andrew Harnik","Contributor","Melik Kaylan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.325},{"id":349923382,"title":"Elon Musk's Tesla gears up to sell energy to UK homes as new household supplier","text":"The company's UK car sales may have hit a bump in the road.\n\nBut Elon Musk's Tesla is preparing to move beyond vehicle sales by launching a household electricity supplier.\n\nTesla Electric will likely integrate closely with the firm's electric cars and home batteries.\n\nThe company's energy subsidiary Tesla Energy Ventures applied to regulator Ofgem for an electricity supply licence last month.\n\nAnd it's possible Tesla could be supplying customers electricity before the year ends as the process can take anywhere from a matter of weeks to nine months.

Why am I so lonely? | Opinion - USA Today","text":"I’m a dude who spends his days investing in cryptocurrency and his nights throwing sex toys onto the court at WNBA games, and for the life of me, I can’t figure out why I’m so lonely.\n\nIt certainly isn’t my fault. Nothing is my fault. I’m a crypto guy who makes misogynistic jokes about things on the internet and then sometimes carries rubber sex toys into WNBA arenas and throws them onto the court, disrupting the game and risking player injury in order to draw attention to my clever meme coin group, Green Dildo Coin.\n\nWhy wouldn’t everyone want to hang out with me, like, literally all the time?\n\nMale loneliness epidemic making me throw sex toys at WNBA games\n\nIt has to be the male loneliness epidemic.\n\nI have some strong opinions on that ‒ and how it’s all the fault of women who refuse to go on dates with me so I can explain to them the hilarity of my meme coin.\n\nSometimes I’ll be around women and I’ll bring up my meme coin, and I can tell they don’t really understand what a meme coin is and don’t get how funny it is that we’re calling it Green Dildo Coin and then throwing green sex toys at WNBA games to draw attention to a thing that doesn’t technically exist.\n\nAs a crypto bro who throws sex toys at WNBA games, I know I'm funny\n\nSo I say to them, “Hey, if you don’t understand what a meme coin is, I’d be happy to spend several hours explaining it to you over a coffee date where I talk the entire time, use the word ‘actually’ a perfectly cool amount and ask you nothing about yourself. And then you can have sex with me.”\n\nBut they always either say no or walk away laughing, and that makes me want to return to my online meme coin group and talk to them about how the women who created the male loneliness epidemic have made it hard for me to connect with women.\n\nIf Donald Trump Jr. thinks my WNBA hijinks are funny, they must be\n\nI know my hobby of throwing colorful sex toys onto the court at WNBA games is edgy and cool. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., shared a meme that showed the president himself standing on the White House roof tossing a green sex toy onto a WNBA court full of players below. How can anyone call it “not funny” or “dangerous” or “sexist” if the president’s son thinks it’s hilarious and is normalizing sex-toy tossing at women’s sporting events?\n\nMaybe Donald Trump Jr. would want to hang out with me and talk about meme coins.\n\nI’m so lonely.\n\nWhy should I, a crypto bro, be held accountable for anything?\n\nI read how Minnesota Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said of the penis-shaped things people like me keep throwing onto the court: “The sexualization of women is what’s used to hold women down, and this is no different. These people that are doing this should be held accountable. We’re not the butt of the joke, they’re the problem.”\n\nCoach Reeve is clearly contributing to the male loneliness epidemic by claiming that I, a crypto bro who throws sex toys on the court at WNBA games, am “the problem” and should be “held accountable” for the thing I keep doing.\n\nSince when do men who invest in cryptocurrency and create hilarious meme coins get held accountable for their actions? That seems sexist, and I blame that attitude for my present state of loneliness, dissatisfaction and deep insecurity.\n\nNobody will date me, even though I throw sex toys at WNBA games\n\nTo date, I have asked 69 women (high-five, fellow crypto bros!) who I had previously made sexualized comments about online under an anonymous account if they would like to go on a date with me to throw sex toys at a WNBA game and learn more about my meme coin. Not a single one has been interested in getting to know how fascinating and clever I am. What am I supposed to do, reflect on whether I’m the problem, and consider treating other people with respect and showing an interest in their feelings and points of view?\n\nC’mon. I’m a crypto dude who throws sex toys at WNBA games. I don’t have time for that kind of nonsense.\n\nNo, my loneliness is definitely the fault of women who are mad I keep throwing sex toys during a women’s sporting event that I publicly claim to respect while anonymously demeaning it online.\n\nAt least I have Green Dildo Coin. I’m sure eventually everyone will see how awesome I am.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Bluesky at @rexhuppke.bsky.social and on Facebook at facebook.com/RexIsAJerk","summary":"I'm a crypto bro who throws sex toys at WNBA games.

Kathy Hochul is bizarrely slamming Rep. Mike Lawler for being unable to stand up to his own party, when that shoe fits a heck of a lot better on her foot.\n\nShe’s nominally mocking the Hudson Valley Republican’s push to ban mid-decade House redistricting and rein in gerrymandering, but weirdly also claimed he had “caved to “Trump on SALT,” and followed up by scoffing that Lawler “has no power.”\n\nWhat hogwash: Lawler in fact got the GOP to cave to him (and the rest of the state’s Republican delegation) on SALT, managing to boost the “ceiling” on the State And Local Tax deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 (for incomes under $500,000) — a huge gain for his constituents in defiance of GOP orthodoxy.\n\nAnd this, despite President Donald Trump’s warning that Lawler needed to “back off.”\n\nNote, too, that New York Democrats couldn’t get SALT addressed when their party controlled the White House and Congress in 2021-2.\n\nWhich suggests that Lawler wields plenty of power within the GOP — more than, say, Long Island Rep. Tom Suozzi (who talked SALT nonstop in those years) does among Dems.\n\nHeck, more than Sen. Chuck Schumer, too . . . unless Schumer just didn’t prioritize making good on his vows to fix SALT.\n\nFor that matter, we have trouble thinking of anything Hochul won for New York when Democrats dominated Washington.\n\nAs for Lawler’s bid to rein in gerrymandering, a response to Texas’ drive to redraw its House map this year and to the noise from Hochul and other Dems about seeking to do the same: No, he probably won’t get immediate action, but don’t bet against him in the longer term.\n\nWhereas Hochul can’t possibly deliver anytime soon on her own threats to “fight fire with fire” by gerrymandering here in New York — since it’d require amending the state Constitution, which is a two-year process.\n\nNor does she bring a shred of principle to the fight: She was all aboard state Democrats’ bid to gerrymander Republicans into oblivion in 2022, and happily played along with the district-redrawing NY Dems did pull off last year, helping them claw several seats from the GOP last November.\n\nBy the way, the one bill Hochul managed to pass during her time in the House . . . ensured that clothes abandoned at airport-security checkpoints would be donated to charity.\n\nNor has she shown much ability as gov to have her way with the state Legislature.\n\nIndeed, its progressives routinely outright bully her, including with the unprecedented 2023 rejection of Justice Hector LaSalle, her eminently qualified nominee to become the state’s chief judge.\n\nShe’s also been unable to win serious changes to the Legislature’s disastrous criminal-justice reforms, and has even gone along with some new ones.\n\nStanding up to your party? Lawler mocked MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as the “Jewish space laser lady” and successfully pushed the expulsion of disgraced Republican liar Rep. George Santos.\n\nHochul doesn’t even dare denounce Zohran Mamdani as the extremist he clearly is, and even makes excuses for him. \n\nWhich makes it all the more pathetic that she’s taking shots at Lawler, even though he has passed on his own run for governor next year.\n\nMaybe the governor is simply jealous that Mike Lawler is the principled, effective moderate she only pretends to be?","summary":"Gov.

A Fox poll recently showed that 44 percent of Americans back the president on the economy. Similarly, six out of 10 Americans blame Trump for driving up the cost of living, according to a recent poll. \n\n“I think a lot of people are seeing higher prices,” said Norman on Saturday. “Our family’s in the construction business, and we get a lot of our timber from Canada and other countries. Yes, it’s higher. Steel prices are up, but it’s for the good of the country.”\n\nThe 72-year-old recently announced a run for governor.\n\n“Should we expect high prices for a short time? Yes,” he added. “But overall, we couldn’t keep going the way we were going.”\n\n“The cancer in this country was letting other countries rule the day and tax our products, and why should we run a deficit every month?” he asked. “And that’s why this president is doing such a good job.”\n\n“And you can’t go on — poll numbers vary, they come up, they go down. But the bottom line is, he’s doing the right thing, and it couldn’t come at a better time,” Norman argued. “Things will get better here.”\n\nTrump’s widespread tariffs went into effect on Thursday after months of delays and attempts at new agreements with other countries. Most U.S. imports are now subject to tariffs of 10 percent. However, overall, the average tariff rate stands at more than 17 percent. \n\nIn the 2024 Republican presidential primary, Norman chose not to endorse the president, instead backing his state’s former governor, the former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. \n\nLate last month, Norman praised Trump as he announced his bid for governor. He said the president’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear weapons program in support of Israel “is going to put him in the annals of the greatest presidents we have ever had.”","summary":"Ralph Norman says ‘the cancer in this country was letting other countries rule the day and tax our products’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ralph-norman-prices-tariffs-trump-b2805176.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/10/22/46/GettyImages-2225843360.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YTLLuk3f-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:53:29","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":349911138,"title":"Princess Andre's childhood trauma: Katie Price's daughter says she 'saw things kids shouldn't see' as she lays bare her mother's 'problems' and how she has a counsellor","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many crimes are going unsolved in YOUR street?

I wish I could have had a happier childhood, I had so much on my plate at such a young age and had things at the back of my mind. \n'My mum and Kieran split up when I was 10 years old, we were close to him. He was in our lives for five years. \n'He did a lot of stuff and when they split everything went downhill.' \nLaying bare Katie's 'problems', Princess said she hasn't 'fully recovered' from her mum's breakdown but revealed she did apologise and they now 'talk a lot'. \nShe continued: 'Mum was heartbroken and she went through a dark time and it was things kids shouldn't see and when we needed our mum there, she wasn't there because she had her own problems. \n'Kids in school would ask me about it and I was like 11 and I would just cry about it in bed. I couldn't just go to my dad about it because I grew up with them not liking each other. \n'I'm not healed or fully recovered from it but mum has fixed herself compared to how she was back then. \n'She spoke to me about it and she apologised and I never wanted an apology but it was a lot that she acknowledged it and she realised she needed to prioritise us, we now talk a lot and she is now my best friend.'\n\nPrincess said her mum became in a 'dark' place following her split from third husband Kieran Hayler. Katie previously admitted to attempting suicide and relying on drugs and alcohol; pictured in 2017\n\nShe said: 'Mum was heartbroken and she went through a dark time and it was things kids shouldn't see and when we needed our mum there she wasn't there because she had her own problems'\n\nPrincess has now told ITV viewers how she has a counsellor to help her cope with her traumas and how she previously 'couldn't just go to my dad' Peter due to the former couple 'not liking each other'\n\nEXCLUSIVE REVEALED: Katie Price's 'rage' as she's excluded from daughter Princess's new reality TV show \nPrincess also revealed how she used to stay at Katie's Monday and Tuesday nights and dad Peter's Wednesday and Thursdays, however the weekends 'it was whoever's turn it was'. \nComparing the two households, she added: 'Mum's house was chaotic there weren't many rules, a few boundaries maybe but it was go to bed when you want and eat what you want. \nLast year, Katie reflected on the emotional time she tried to take her own life after 'reaching breaking point' following her divorce from Kiaran .\nKatie, who is now in a happy relationship with JJ Slater, at the time admitted herself into the Priory shortly after she noticed she was relying on drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism amid her suicide attempt.\nSpeaking to You Magazine, Katie opened up about the emotional and difficult time in her life, she said: 'People don’t realise what I’ve been through'.\nThey don’t know, for example, that she tried to take her own life, as she got divorced from her third husband, Hayler. \n'I just didn’t want to be here any more. I thought, \"What’s the point? No one’s here, no one’s helping, no one understands what I am feeling.\" \n'I woke up from it thinking, \"What the f***? I can’t do this to my kids.\" I was at breaking point.'\n\nLaying bare Katie's 'problems', Princess said she hasn't 'fully recovered' from her mum's breakdown but revealed she did apologise and they now 'talk a lot'\n\nKatie went to private hospital the Priory, and realised that the suicide attempt was the culmination of a long breakdown. \nShe had been taking cocaine as a means of escape, and this shocked her friends and family, because, she tells You Magazine, she isn’t an addict. \nKatie added: 'I think there’s this persona of me that I’m a drinker and a cokehead, but I never have been, ever. Yeah, when I was younger, I would go out and get p***ed. Who wouldn’t?'\n'It [cocaine] is the dirtiest thing. When you’re not in a good place, it taps you on the shoulder and says, “I’m here, I can help you.” To me, it wasn’t a drug that made me want to party. \n'It was more a way to block everything out, to suppress me completely. I was like this,’ she mimes looking down and in at herself. \"It was like I was in rigor mortis.\"\nWhile most people who take cocaine get an intense high, it shut Price down. This is typical of people who suffer from ADHD, and it was after her stay in the Priory that she had a formal diagnosis.\n\"I hate labels,\" she says, \"but it’s made me understand more. I found all my school reports and they all say exactly the same thing: “Dreamer. Gets bored. So capable but gets easily distracted and doesn’t concentrate.” It all makes sense.'\nDoes she think her life might have been different if she had received a diagnosis as a child?\n'I don’t know. And maybe I wouldn’t be where I am today. So I don’t regret any of it, but now I am older, I can understand that I need to hold back and evaluate situations more.'\nKatie and Kieran separated in March 2018 after five years of marriage but their divorce wasn't finalised until four years later.\nThe couple split after several infidelities by Kieran, with the stripper later admitting he suffered from sex addiction.\nElsewhere Princess shared with fans that she was 'very self conscious and hated' the way she looked when she was younger, specifically her lips and nose. \nThe teenager praised mum Katie for her 'confidence' while posing topless for page 3 but insisted she is 'more reserved and could never do that' as she gets 'embarrassed'.\nShe said: 'I used to hate my lips and nose. When I was younger I used to get really picked on for my nose being too big and my eyes being to big and my lips being non existent.\n'I used to be very self conscious and hated myself, so when I discovered makeup and that I could enhance my features and make my nose smaller and lips fuller. Now I feel more confident, not fully but about certain things because I hated everything before I discovered makeup.\n'You don't need to [have a nose job] at 18. I'm not against surgery at all, if you know my mum you know she's had a lot of surgery and she owns it but she was the one who told me not to get it because I'm beautiful the way I am.\n'There are so many things makeup has taught me and I've learn't to love myself without makeup.\n'People think because my mum was a page 3 model I have to be that confident too. Well done on her but I could never do that, I'm self conscious and more reserved, I'm more embarrassed,' Princess said. \nMeanwhile in the first episode of the series, horrified Peter has reacted to some of the 'disgusting' messages his 18-year-old daughter Princess has received from men online.\nThe singer remarked: 'that really made me feel sick' as the influencer shared some of the messages she is sent on social media as the family appeared in her new ITV2 documentary.\nPrincess was 17 at the time and was filmed speaking to a friend about some of the more negative sides of having a big social media presence and fame at a young age.\nPrincess says to her friend of the messages: 'Usually it's like old men, going on about my toes, sometimes they'll be like, 'let me take you on a date'.'\nIn a solo section to camera, she added: 'I can't even read this message out, it's actually disgusting.\n'I do love my job and I do love social media and I do love interacting with people but there is a dark side to social media that people don't see, and there are a lot of inappropriate messages that yeah some of them can be horrible.\n'Like I'm literally 17, that's actually not OK.'\nLater in the episode in a scene with her dad Princess mentioned to Peter some of the messages she has been getting.\nWhen he enquired as to what they are asking her, she replied 'mostly feet pictures'.\nAn alarmed Peter replied: 'Please God that's the only thing they ask for.'\nPrincess then divulged to him that some of the men also ask: 'Are you finally legal now?'\nPeter immediately covers his face with his hands and said: 'Oh my God Biss I didn't think it was going to be like that...\n'That really made me feel sick, like in the pit of my stomach. I hate it because you're still my baby.'\n\nKatie and Kieran separated in March 2018 after five years of marriage but their divorce wasn't finalised until four years later; pictured 2015\n\nThe model was famously married to Peter Andre from 2005 to 2009 after meeting on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! and welcomed Princess and son Junior\nIn 2021, Katie was awarded a 16-week suspended jail term after being sentenced for a drink-driving crash.\nThe TV personality flipped her BMW onto its side at about 6.20am on September 28, on a country road near her West Sussex home.\nFollowing the accident, she tested positive for alcohol and cocaine, and admitted drink-driving while disqualified and driving without insurance.\nKatie is currently in a loved-up relationship with former Married At First Sight star JJ Slater.\nThe model was famously married to Peter Andre from 2005 to 2009 after meeting on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! and welcomed Princess and son Junior. \nAdmitting she was on the 'rebound' Katie started dating cage fighter Alex Reid a mere eight weeks later. The pair were married from 2010 to 2012 before their acrimonious split.\nShe then wed the father of her two youngest children, Kieran, in 2013 after a whirlwind romance and their split - once again bitter - came amid allegations of new infidelities, three years after she caught him sleeping with her best friends Jane Poutney and Chrissy Thomas.\n\nThe Real Husbands of Katie Price\n\nIn the decades since she first rose to fame, Katie Price has enjoyed – and quite likely endured – a decidedly busy love life that has seen her walk down the aisle three times before heading to divorce court in equal measure. Here's a look at the trio with whom she exchanged 'I dos'... and 'I don'ts':\n\nPETER ANDRE (2005 - 2009)\n\nThe nation got to watch love blossom between the pair when they starred alongside one another on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here back in 2004. The flying sparks soon became nuptials, with blushing bride Katie and her erstwhile pop hunk beau tying the knot at Highclere Castle (the grand Berkshire estate of Downton Abbey fame) in September 2005. Katie, who was already mother to son Harvey (born in 2002 following a romance with former footballer Dwight Yorke), soon started a family with her new husband. The couple welcomed son Junior in 2005, while daughter Princess followed in 2007. Creation between the pair also came artistically, with the release of reality programmes, a failed talk show and a foray into the music world. However, after four years of securing their position as the Ken and Barbie of reality TV and glossy magazine deals, the pair announced in 2009 that they were going their separate ways.\n\nALEX REID (2010 - 2012) \n\nKatie soon switched her romantic allegiance from a onetime ab-bearing pop heartthrob to musclebound MMA fighter Alex Reid. The two met at Michelle Heaton's 30th birthday party at London's Cafe de Paris. But shortly after they got together, Katie dumped Alex on live TV, only for him to win her back and the pair go from strength to strength. Weeks after proudly cheering her man on to a win on the 2010 edition of Celebrity Big Brother (also featuring none other than her ex-boyfriend Dane Bowers), Katie jetted off to Las Vegas to tie the knot with her new partner in February 2010 after just seven months of dating – and nine months after divorcing Peter. Following their Sin City sojourn, the pair returned to their native UK, where they had a formal ceremony – which was filmed for a TV series. However, after just 11 months of marriage, the pair announced they were splitting and their divorce was finalised in March 2012. While Katie declared at the time that she married Alex 'too soon', she would later go on to reveal that a major factor in their split was his cross-dressing alter-ego Roxanne.\n\nKIERAN HAYLER (2013 - 2021)\n\nShowing herself to be a true woman of the times, Katie embarked on a romance with former stripper Kieran after the two met on the now-defunct Blackberry Messenger service in 2012. And just two months after altering the paths of their lives via those thumb-tapped fateful opening messages, the twosome would go on to exchange nuptials in the Caribbean. Kieran proposed to a thrilled Katie on Christmas Day 2012, and just three weeks later, the pair would be pronounced husband and wife in the idyllic shores of the Bahamas on January 16, 2013. They had their marriage blessed in Weston-super Mare, and in the months that followed, it appeared that Katie had finally found her happily ever after. They welcomed son Jett in August 2013, and daughter Bunny in August 2014. But Katie's world came crashing down in 2014, when she discovered that Kieran had cheated on her with her close friend of 20 years, Jane Pountney, and was enjoying a fling with another of her pals, Chrissy Thomas. After publicly lashing out at all parties involved (and naming her pet pigs after her friends-turned-foes), Katie appeared determined to make things work when she renewed her vows with Kieran in 2015. But alas, it would not turn out to be third time lucky for Katie, as the pair split in 2018 amid even more cheating allegations. Their 'amicable' divorce was finalised in early 2021.\nPrincess AndreKatie PriceITVKieran Hayler\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPrincess Andre's childhood trauma: Katie Price's daughter says she 'saw things kids shouldn't see' as she lays bare her mother's 'problems' and how she has a counsellor\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 229\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

the kids play and other commentary","text":"Parenting beat: Let the Kids Play\n\n“Today’s kids want to spend their childhood in the real world,” report Lenore Skenazy, Zach Rausch & Jonathan Haidt at The Atlantic: “Let’s give it back to them.”\n\nThinking that “smartphones and social-media platforms are addicting” the nation’s youth “misses a key part of the story.”\n\nIn a national survey, most children said “they aren’t allowed to be out in public at all without an adult.”\n\n“Fewer than half of the 8- and 9-year-olds have gone down a grocery-store aisle alone; more than a quarter aren’t allowed to play unsupervised even in their own front yard.”\n\nBut this overprotective parenting is just hysteria, and “kids will always have more spare hours than adults can supervise — a gap that devices now fill.”\n\nWake up: “Even this generation of digital natives still longs for what most of their parents had: time with friends, in person, without adults.” \n\nSchools watch: Chicago’s Ill Omens for Mamdani\n\n“To evaluate the merits” of Zohran Mamdani’s vows such as “ending mayoral control of city schools” and “hiring ‘thousands more teachers,’” just “look 800 miles west,” argue Santiago Vidal Valvo & Esme Vroom at City Journal.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “embraced a union-first approach to education.”\n\nHis school board extended a “no-closure pledge” — stopping shutdowns of underperforming schools — and hiked spending to “nearly double the national average.”\n\nThe “alarming” results: Only “one in three elementary school students can read at grade level, and barely one in five is proficient in math.”\n\nChicago’s lesson is clear: “Allowing unions to drive education policy” produces “failing schools — and thousands of children failing to reach their potential.”\n\nGaza experts: Israel Must Control Aid to End Hamas \n\n“Israel is not starving Gaza,” explain Erez Winner & Gadi Taub at Tablet, despite much “mendacious propaganda.”\n\nSince March, it has tried to counter Hamas’ strategy of “increasing its own population’s suffering” by “breaking its control of the aid entering the strip.”\n\nThis requires evacuating civilians from “discrete areas” and laying “siege” “until all combatants surrendered and gave up the hostages they held”; Israel failed to “execute this plan,” instead “sending aid to pockets” still under Hamas control, where “almost 90% of aid trucks” are looted.\n\n“To recover momentum” and “achieve its war aims” (including the “utter and total destruction” of Hamas), Israel must “gain control over the aid supply.” \n\nFed monitor: Powell’s Tariff Double Standard\n\nFederal Reserve boss Jerome Powell and his colleagues are “obsessed with the inflationary effects” of tariffs as “they never have been with any other taxes,” huffs Donald L. Luskin at The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn Powell’s pressers since President Trump’s election, “the word ‘tariff’ was mentioned 158 times.”\n\n“Never mentioned”: a Democratic prez’s tax hikes would’ve also fed inflation. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will lower taxes, which can offset the tariffs or “even cause deflation.” The “Fed has never mentioned this.”\n\nPowell thinks high interest rates can combat tariff-sparked inflation, but how would such rates keep companies from passing on tariff costs?\n\n“How does it help” to “slow economic activity” that’s possibly already “slowed and distorted by tariffs?”\n\nEye on politics: Kamala ’28 Imploding\n\nKamala Harris’ 2028 “putative presidential campaign failed so badly in getting anything right,” snarks Keith Naughton at The Hill.\n\n“Harris and her team have squandered” her advantages — high Dem approval, universal name recognition, the ability to blame Joe Biden for her ’24 loss — “in record time.”\n\nDithering over a run for California governor was “her way of preparing to announce basically nothing.”\n\nOn her book tour, she’s already “whiffed on a series of softball questions” and been “at her word salad worst.”\n\nYet the real proof she’s “not ready for prime time was her presidential campaign,” tapping Minnesota idiot Tim Walz to be her veep and failing to break with Biden.\n\nNow Team Biden has “threatened to sink her if she dares criticize them.”\n\nWow: “The Harris disaster is history in the making.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“To evaluate the merits” of Zohran Mamdani’s vows such as “ending mayoral control of city schools” and “hiring ‘thousands more teachers,’” just “look 800 miles west,” argue Santiago Vidal Valvo &amp; Esme Vroom.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/10/opinion/chicagos-ill-omens-for-mamdani-let-the-kids-play-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-xyvsegzc8-1754863259087.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754848957&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:45:32","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":349911156,"title":"Fans rip into 'sad' Conor McGregor training footage ahead of potential UFC return at the White House","text":"READ MORE: UFC fighter Angela Hill humiliated when official drops intimate item \n\nBy JAKE FENNER, US SPORTS WRITER\n\nPublished: 23:21 BST, 10 August 2025 | Updated: 23:33 BST, 10 August 2025\n\nFans and former UFC legends are ripping into training footage of ex-two-belt champion Conor McGregor ahead of a potential bout on the lawn of the White House in 2026.\n\nMcGregor, 37, hasn't entered an Octagon in four years after breaking his leg during his third bout with Dustin Poirier at UFC 264 in July of 2021. Half a year before that horrific injury, he'd suffer the first knockout of his career against the same opponent.\n\nBut now, McGregor appears to be training for another bout. While no date or card has been set, the Dublin native indicated his interest in returning for the UFC event at the White House that President Donald Trump floated for next year.\n\nMcGregor, who has cozied up to Trump and has political views aligning with the president, has returned to posting training videos on his social media.\n\nBut that footage has quickly been blasted by UFC fans on social media for the Irishman's lack of speed.\n\nAmong the most notable critics is former UFC Women's World Featherweight Champion Cris Cyborg, who left laughing emojis under a tweet showcasing the video.\n\nConor McGregor posted footage of his training online - and received plenty of mockery\n\nWhile he's not officially on a card for a fight, he was seen training to get into fighting shape\n\nBut some fans - and former UFC women's champion Cris Cyborg - mocked McGregor \n\nOther fans quickly chipped in with their critiques and opinions.\n\n'Bro looks so bad now, just stay retired,' read one caption on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAnother wrote, 'He will never come back!'\n\n'He's gonna get KO'd first round,' said a different user. \n\n'So bad and slow and just weird. Stay retired 'cause you're gonna get knocked out in round 1. Face it man, it's over,' read another comment.\n\nOther fans suggested that a potential matchup against Michael Chandler, Nate Diaz, 'Cowboy' Cerrone, or Ilia Topuria could yield positive results.\n\nIn addition to his potential comeback in the UFC, McGregor announced his intention to stand as a candidate for the 2025 Irish presidential election back in March. \n\nConor McgregorDustin Poirier\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nFans rip into 'sad' Conor McGregor training footage ahead of potential UFC return at the White House\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Fans and former UFC legends are ripping into training footage of ex-two-belt champion Conor McGregor ahead of a potential bout on the lawn of the White House in 2026.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mma/article-14988053/conor-mcgregor-training-footage-white-house-ufc.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/10/23/101090993-0-image-m-157_1754864446925.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:33:32","author":"Editor,Jake Fenner","authors":["Editor","Jake Fenner"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":349911136,"title":"Sophie Turner hits back at critic that claimed she's 'forgotten' about her two daughters","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many crimes are going unsolved in YOUR street?

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS U.S. ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:23:11 BST, 10 August 2025 |Updated:23:31 BST, 10 August 2025 \n\nSophie Turner isn't letting anyone question her parenting, especially not in her own Instagram comments.\nOn August 4, the Game of Thrones alum, 29, shared a carousel of photos from an Oasis concert.\nWhile most fans cheered her on for enjoying a night out, one user decided to mom-shame her.\n'Lmfao, I think she has forgotten that she has two kids,' the troll wrote beneath the star's latest post.\nTurner, who shares daughters Willa, 4, and Delphine, 2, with ex-husband Joe Jonas, clapped back almost instantly.\n'Ah I'm so sorry sometimes I forget some people can't think for themselves,' she replied. 'So…Get this…There's this crazy thing called shared custody. Maybe, just maybe, they were with their dad that day.'\n\nSophie Turner isn't letting anyone question her parenting , especially not in her own Instagram comments (seen in May 2025)\nShe was met with praise for speaking out as many of her fans chimed in to ask: 'Why can’t a mom of two kids do this??' \n'No one ever asks a Dad where their kids are [eye roll emoji],' a second remarked. \n\n Joe Jonas offers rare insight into raising two daughters with ex-wife Sophie Turner \n'Mom’s can have fun for the love of God,' a third insisted.\nDozens more pointed out that her ex-husband is currently on the JONAS20: Living the Dream tour and will be doing 52 concerts.\nHer sharp reply comes less than a year after she and the Jonas Brothers musician resolved their high-profile custody dispute in October 2023, agreeing to co-parent their daughters.\nAfter Jonas filed for divorce, the former couple were locked in a contentious legal battle that ultimately concluded with their divorce being finalized in September 2024. \nDespite not seeing eye-to-eye in the past, Jonas recently recently called Sophie an 'incredible mom.'\n'I have a beautiful coparenting relationship that I’m really grateful for,' Jonas told motivational speaker Jay Shetty in a TikTok video. 'Having an incredible mom, Sophie, for those girls is like a dream come true.' \n\nWhile most fans cheered her on for recently enjoying a night out, one user decided to mom-shame her\n\n'Lmfao, I think she has forgotten that she has two kids,' the troll wrote beneath the star's latest post\n\nTurner, who shares daughters Willa, 4, and Delphine, 2, with ex-husband Joe Jonas , clapped back almost instantly\nJonas added that it's important for his daughters to have strong female role models in their lives.\n'I think what values I want for them are to be open-minded and have a big heart, be able to walk into any room and feel confidence and know that they can do literally anything they want.'\n'As young girls, looking up to great women is what I want for them,' he said.\nAnd while discussing if the girls will follow in their famous parents' footsteps into show-business, Joe said, 'We might want them to wait a little while.'\nDuring an interview with British Vogue last year, Sophie opened up about the effect of having a public divorce.\n\n'So…Get this…There's this crazy thing called shared custody. Maybe, just maybe, they were with their dad that day,' the actress replied\n'I mean, those were the worst few days of my life,' the Joan actress stated. 'I remember I was on set, I was contracted to be on set for another two weeks, so I couldn't leave.\n'My kids were in the States, and I couldn't get to them because I had to finish [ITV drama] Joan. And all these articles started coming out...'\nAfter the news hit the web, rumors erupted that they had split because Sophie was partying too much - especially after snaps of her enjoying a wild night out with her costars just days before Joe filed began to circulate.\n'It hurt because I really do completely torture myself over every move I make as a mother – mom guilt is so real,' continued Sophie.\n'I just kept having to say to myself, \"None of this is true. You are a good mom and you’ve never been a partier.\"\n'It’s unfathomable the amount of people that will just make s**t up and put it up based on a picture.\n\nHer sharp reply comes less than a year after she and the Jonas Brothers musician resolved their high-profile custody dispute in October 2023 (pictured in 2022)\n'A picture might tell a thousand words, but it’s not my story. It felt like I was watching a movie of my life that I hadn’t written, hadn’t produced, or starred in. It was shocking. I’m still in shock.'\nDuring her interview with Vogue, Sophie also admitted that she previously suffered from 'depression, anxiety, and bulimia.'\n'I’m not very good at processing my emotions. I lock them away and then they’ll bubble up in years to come in some form of depression or anxiety,' she shared.\n'Being a young girl, especially one growing up in the spotlight, you really judge yourself.'\nShe revealed that while she had taken medication for her mental health issues in the past, she currently isn't using any.\n'Not since I moved back to the U.K.,' she dished. 'Which is great and also surprising, because I anticipated that I’d need to – now perhaps more than ever.\n\nAfter Jonas filed for divorce, the former couple were locked in a contentious legal battle that ultimately concluded with their divorce being finalized in September 2024\n\nDespite not seeing eye-to-eye in the past, Jonas recently recently called Sophie an 'incredible mom' (seen in July 2024)\n'There’s something about a community and a support system that I’ve never realized is so important up until now.\n'And I think the reason I was on medication for so long is because I didn’t have those people with me.\n'Now that I’m back home, I’m actually the happiest I’ve been in a really long time. I’m starting over again, rediscovering what I like to do, who I like to be with.'\nJoe and Sophie started dating in 2016, and he proposed one year later; they then eloped in Las Vegas in 2019, which was followed by a lavish wedding celebration in France that summer.\nSophie recalled struggling with being branded as a Jonas Brothers' wife following their marriage.\n'There was a lot of attention on the three brothers, and the wives. We were always called the wives, and I hated that,' she admitted.\n\nJonas pictured with Turner and his brothers Nick and Kevin Jonas, alongside their wives Danielle Jonas and Priyanka Chopra\n'It was kind of this plus-one feeling. And that’s nothing to do with him – in no way did he make me feel that – it was just that the perception of us was as the groupies in the band.'\nThings only got worse after they moved from Los Angeles to Miami in 2021, as Sophie said it felt like she was a 'bird trapped in a gilded cage' - especially since she was completely separated from her friends.\n'We were in this community full of 50-year-old men, so imagine trying to make friends on the dog walk,' she dished.\nIn the end, Sophie credited her close pals - including pop sensation Taylor Swift - with helping her to get through the rough time after her highly publicized split from Joe.\n'The support I had from the women in my life during that time was the most amazing thing to see. I felt so held and so protected,' she gushed.\n'Taylor was an absolute hero to me this year. I’ve never been more grateful to anyone than I am for her because she took my children and me, and provided us with a home and a safe space. She really has a heart of gold.'\nJonas BrothersInstagramOasisJoe Jonas\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSophie Turner hits back at critic that claimed she's 'forgotten' about her two daughters\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It was 2 p.m. and time for Vultaggio, the founder and chair of AriZona Iced Tea, to hold his daily two-hour lunch and board meeting in his Southwest-themed office in central Long Island.\n\nBehind him was a wall of dozens of bottles and cans from the company’s deep roster of products, and a security monitor showing a live feed of the robot-powered storage and retrieval operations of its largest factory, which is in New Jersey.\n\nIt has been from this perch that Vultaggio has spent the last few weeks contemplating what he’s insisted, for most of his company’s three decades of existence, he would never do: raise the 99-cent price of its canned iced teas, AriZona’s calling card since 1997.\n\nThe Trump administration’s 50% tariff on aluminum imports may leave him no choice.\n\nIf the price of a tallboy of AriZona Iced Tea had kept pace with inflation, the company would today be selling it for $1.99. Instead, the 99-cent price remains so central to the company’s identity that the numbers are displayed on the can boldly and prominently.\n\nAriZona uses more than 100 million pounds of aluminum a year for its cans, and about 20% of that comes from Canada. Vultaggio is hopeful that the tariff dispute will be resolved, but if it is not, he said, “at some point the consumer is going to have to pay the price.”\n\n“I hate even the thought of it,” Vultaggio, 73, said, adding, “It would be a hell of a shame after 30-plus years.”\n\nSouthwestern Motif, Brooklyn Roots\n\nAriZona’s affordability has its roots in Vultaggio’s childhood in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, where his father managed an A&P grocery store. Dinner conversations, he recalled, focused on retail and labor issues, theft and profit.\n\n“Know your costs and sell it for more than that,” Vultaggio said, reciting one of his father’s business principles. “Most companies to this day still don’t understand that.”\n\nAfter high school, Vultaggio got a job at a brewery in Bushwick, where he quickly became more interested in the price of the bottles and other materials than in the actual brewing process. He started his own beer distribution business instead.\n\nHe was making a delivery in lower Manhattan one cold afternoon in 1991 when he spotted a truck delivering cases of Snapple.\n\nIced tea was not supposed to sell in February, he thought.\n\n“I went home that night and told my wife, ‘We’re going into the iced tea business,’” Vultaggio said. “I didn’t know beans about iced tea.”\n\nHe had no recipe, no name, no label design, nothing to set himself apart from the Snapples, Liptons and Nestlés of the world.\n\nIlene Vultaggio had only recently finished designing the family’s pueblo-style house in Rockaway Beach, Queens, when her husband came to her with his idea for a new beverage company.\n\n“Everything in the house was Southwest to the extreme,” said Ilene Vultaggio, 72, a pastel artist. “Turquoise. Pinks. Yellows. I always loved it.”\n\nSo when her husband asked her to design a logo for the new company, she sketched what she knew: a turquoise, pink and yellow sunburst. The couple’s sons, Wesley and Spencer, helped color it in with crayons and colored pencils.\n\nThen came the name. They wanted something customers would be familiar with that would stand out in the cooler, and landed on “Arizona.” Ilene Vultaggio added flair to the lettering by capitalizing the “Z.” She would later design a label for the company’s green tea flavor with ginseng and honey that was inspired, in part, by one of her children’s coloring books.\n\nA Model Built on Basics \n\nDon Vultaggio said he has run his company according to three simple rules: Make it taste good, make it look good and price it right. In fact, starting in September, AriZona plans to lower its $1.25 plastic bottled beverages to $1.\n\nBut, pricing it right has not always been easy, he said.\n\nJust as AriZona was hitting the market, the aluminum industry and businesses that relied on the metal were alarmed as the Soviet Union, then the top supplier, suffered political and economic collapse. AriZona raised the price of its canned iced tea above $1. Sales immediately took a sharp hit, Vultaggio said.\n\nBut, as aluminum prices eased, Vultaggio returned to the lessons his father had taught him at the A&P, he said. He introduced the 99-cent tallboy in 1997. By 2000, he said, sales were up 30%.\n\nRetailers initially bristled at Vultaggio’s insistence on printing “99 cents” on the can, locking the company into that price. But the 99-cent selling point quickly became “like heroin” for customers, he said. They couldn’t get enough.\n\n“Our marketing was never built on anything other than just common sense,” Vultaggio said. “And a lot of guts. But it was guts from years of business. I’m a consumer, too. I like deals. I like sales.”\n\nAriZona, which is privately held, sells about 2 billion cans annually, roughly half of which are the signature tallboys, in addition to glass bottles and gallons of varieties of iced tea, juice, energy drinks and coffee, Vultaggio said. Gummy snacks, ice pops and promotional merchandise are also on offer. While the can prices have been frozen in time, the company said it had “adjusted prices where absolutely necessary” on its other products.\n\nAriZona’s success at keeping prices low for three decades relies on other factors, too.\n\nThe company is largely vertically integrated, meaning that it controls every step of the production process. The company ran railroad tracks from a freight line so it could bring tankers of sugar directly to AriZonaLand, its factory in Keasbey, New Jersey, several times a day.\n\nVultaggio has no shareholders to answer to, and his company has no debt, he said.\n\n“I hate the look of it, I hate the smell of it,” he said, adding, “I like to sleep at night.”\n\nThis combination gives Vultaggio “a lot of control over the operations,” said Jim Salera, a food and beverage analyst at Stephens, an investment banking firm. Inexpensive materials — water, sugar and other flavorings — have also probably helped AriZona stick to the 99-cent price, he said.\n\nOne key to the company’s success is strong brand loyalty among customers, many of whom are now old enough to have introduced AriZona Iced Tea to their children.\n\n“They’ve not only survived, they’ve prospered,” said Stephen Zagor, an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia Business School. “They became one of those companies that not only sells a product, but tries to sell their culture. And they do it cheaply.”\n\nThese days, that culture includes collaborating with brands to put AriZona’s signature colors on Generation Z-friendly clothing, and focusing the company’s story on Vultaggio. At a recent storefront pop-up event in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, 12-year-olds were asking for “Don,” whose fandom is growing on TikTok.\n\nTariffs Come for the Tea \n\nAbout 80% of the aluminum AriZona uses to make its tallboys comes from recycled material produced in the United States. The rest is imported from Canada, and subject to a 50% import duty. Vultaggio declined to comment on any steps AriZona has taken to mitigate the financial impact.\n\n“Our price has been dramatically bumped up because of this tariff talk,” Vultaggio said, adding that he expected the few domestic aluminum manufacturers to raise their prices in response to the tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has maintained that increasing tariffs on international goods would benefit the United States by boosting domestic manufacturing, addressing trade deficits and raising revenues for the U.S. government.\n\n“I hope the administration understands and deals with the fact that if you’re going to protect American manufacturers, you can’t allow them to gouge the marketplace because of that protection. If I had Donald Trump’s ear, that’s what I would tell him directly.”\n\nFor the moment, Vultaggio is clinging to cautious optimism.\n\n“What happens, happens,” he said. “We can find our way through it.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"AriZona uses more than 100 million pounds of aluminum a year for its cans, and about 20% of that comes from Canada. \n\n\nThe post Can AriZona’s 99-cent iced tea survive Trump’s tariffs? appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2025/08/10/can-arizonas-99-cent-iced-tea-survive-trumps-tariffs/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/https___nytapi.wieck_.com_feed-photos_oGTq3Xbo-68991c24a8d48-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:26:42","author":"New York Times Service","authors":["New York Times Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":349911134,"title":"Inside one of Britain's most notorious gangster families... and how even an SAS trained hitman couldn't take them out","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many crimes are going unsolved in YOUR street?

Email: chris.matthews@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM DUFFY and CHRIS MATTHEWS, SENIOR NEWS FEATURES REPORTER\n Published:22:55 BST, 10 August 2025 |Updated:23:24 BST, 10 August 2025 \n\nStephen Gee's mugshot looked similar to hundreds of others released by Merseyside Police when on the hunt for wanted men and women.\nA grimace, a prison-issue baggy grey sweatshirt, bags under the eyes and look of defiance into the camera.\nThe middle-aged suspect was wanted on recall to prison last week after serving time for a brutal robbery on an OAP.\nA horrible crime, but small fry when it comes to the Liverpool underworld.\nBut for residents of a particularly notorious estate in the city, the look of this pathetic middle-aged career crook may have sent a shiver down their spine.\nGee, 43, is from one of the city's most violent crime families.\nAlong with his brother Danny, Darren and Ian, he turned the Grizedale estate into an open air drug market - and ruled with an iron first.\nThe family - known as the Grizedale Crew - groomed schoolboys to run their drugs and left a trail of broken lives behind them.\nThey then became embroiled in a sprawling drugs war across Liverpool, a battle so explosive their rivals reportedly hired an SAS-trained hitman to finally take them out.\n\nStephen Gee was wanted on recall to prison after serving time for a brutal robbery on an OAP\n\nDarren Gee who along with brothers Danny, Stephen and Ian, ran the notorious Grizedale crew\n\nPolice forensics officers investigate a shooting on the Grizedale estate in Liverpool\nBut before they became a force in the city's drugs market they built up a network on the streets.\nLocal lads were paid cash to bunk off school and act as spotters, patrolling the warren of streets on mountain bikes.\nFamilies that were on benefits started earning hundreds of pounds a day selling crack and heroin to addicts, as the Gee brothers made around £20k a week.\nGang members wearing the latest Berghaus jackets and Rockport trainers patrolled the perimeter of the estate, moving around in stolen cars with false plates.\nAt one point in 2004 around 250 Grizedale residents were facing drug offences in court, as police raided homes to recover weapons. In one raid the force recovered a sniper rifle with a telescopic sight.\nThe Grizedale estate was built in the 1970s during an era when the city was still clearing the terraces that were deemed to be no longer suitable for habitation.\n\nDaniel Gee, 44, (pictured) grinning following his arrest in Wigan by officers from Merseyside Police\n\nMerseyside Police set up a special taskforce to tackle the Gees' iron grip on the Grizedale estate in Liverpool (pictured, officers are the scene of a shooting on the estate)\nUnfortunately by the time the Gee brothers grew up the estate was a rat run of dank alleyways and poorly lit underpasses - perfect for dealers and thugs.\nIn response to growing concerns from community leaders across north Liverpool, police set up a special taskforce to take down the Gees.\nA former officer who played a lead role in the unit told the Liverpool Echo how they were ordered to go out and do 'The Lord's work' which was a euphemism for breaking the rules.\nThe former officer, told how: 'It was a kind of code for what we were doing. So yes we were unorthodox, but for all the right reasons.\n'In short it was old fashioned, old school policing. We took the fight to the criminals and I stand by this approach because it worked.'\nThe officer explained how the Gees took over the estate by controlling the drug market and the distribution of cash.\nThe Merseyside man stressed how the majority of locals became 'outsiders' because they were not involved in the Gee dark economy.\nHe told how the Gees would often provoke officers into ugly confrontations in front of witnesses, who would provide statements claiming the police used unreasonable force.\nHowever, a second dynamic entered the equation when the Gees became embroiled in an anarchic gang war which spread across north Liverpool in 2004.\nA key event in this saga was a fall out between the Gees and William Moore, who hired a former soldier to execute one of the brothers.\n\nGee has been arrested and detained after he fled Category D open prison HMP Kirklevington Grange in North Yorkshire on May 27\nLuton man Darren Waterhouse opened fire on a car Darren Gee was travelling in, riddling it with bullets. Innocent teenager Craig Barker, just 18, died from his injuries. \nLocal gangster Mark Richardson who was in the car at the time was also seriously injured.\nWaterhouse, who trained with the SAS, had been decorated with the Military Cross for the bravery he showed serving with the Coldstream Guards in 90s Bosnia.\nHe became involved in drug culture after being discharged from the forces and met William Moore in prison, who paid him to murder Darren Gee. Waterhouse and Moore were both later jailed for life.\nIn revenge Darren organised the murder of local businessman David Regan, who was thought to have been Waterhouse's getaway driver.\nRegan was shot dead on the forecourt of the carwash he managed in the Old Swan area of the city.\nDuring this period a wiretap in a prison cell gleaned intelligence suggesting the Gees and their associates were plotting to shoot an off duty police officer.\nAs a result, officers who were targeting the Gees and their associates were advised to wear body armour when out shopping with their families at the weekend.\nAt this time associates of the Gee family were involved in a major dispute with the owners of a famous Liverpool nightclub, which resulted in a wave of car bombs across the city.\nNightclubs, homes and then police stations were all targeted. Police intelligence suggested Darren Gee helped orchestrate some of the carbombs.\nWhile Darren Gee was jailed for his role in the murder of David Regan, his brother Danny continued to head up the Grizedale Crew.\nDanny moved into an apartment on the city's plush waterfront, but continued to run drug rackets across the north of the city.\nHe was shot and nearly killed by rival gang member Jamie Starkey in 2008, which led to further acts of violence in north Liverpool.\nLiverpool Crown Court later heard how the Grizedale Crew ordered the murder of teenager Tony Bromley, who was cut down with machetes in the street.\nDenis Gilboy and Scott Walker, who carried out the murder, were acting on the orders of the gang's leaders.\nAndrew Edis QC told the jury that the Grizedale were a gang 'so powerful and fearful' they believed no-one would come to court to give evidence against them.\n\nThe Grizedale estate became notorious for crime - at one point in 2004 around 250 Grizedale residents were facing drug offences in court\n\nDaniel Gee absconded from Category D Kirklevington Prison in May 2024\nIn 2010 Daniel Gee was handed an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence after being found guilty of threatening to kill a rival and blackmail.\nThe court heard he had previously been the focus of police surveillance that recorded him making threats and trying to obtain firearms.\nDaniel fled Category D open prison HMP Kirklevington Grange in North Yorkshire on May 27 last year and disappeared, prompting a huge scale manhunt. \nHe was arrested in a pub in the Aspull area of Wigan a month later with officer bodycam footage showing him grinning as police took him into custody.\nHis brother Darren later bragged on TikTok: 'He's had a f****** scream, look at the smile on his face. Good on him'.\nDaniel has a reputation as a hardman within the prison system, sources on Merseyside have told the Mail that Gee's reputation is based on his dealings with heroin addicts.\nA Liverpool man said:'The Gees have always controlled addicts, on the outside and inside. \n'Danny's reputation as a hardman is all based on the way he deals with addicts on the inside. \n'They work for him and or he batters them. I have seen him with addicts over his knee while he pulls out bags of heroin from their bum with a spoon. \n'The addicts work for him - they provide him with an income and a layer of protection.\n'But Danny always stayed away from the proper fellas on the wings like me, because I would have smashed him to bits.\n'Darren was similar, but had a bit more upstairs. Darren was a clever, cunning and had loads of arse (guts). He will use a blade or a gun if he has too. Dangerous kid.'\nDarren Gee, who was convicted of conspiracy to murder, is now a successful YouTuber with over 30,000 subscribers to his channel.\nDarren has focused heavily on the role played by the Kinahan Cartel in spreading drugs and crime across Liverpool over recent years. \nHe has also hit out podcasters who interview guests with alleged links to the Kinahans.\nStephen Gee has now been recalled to prison and will serve out the rest of his sentence.\nMerseyside Police\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nInside one of Britain's most notorious gangster families... and how even an SAS trained hitman couldn't take them out\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Security Council heard new demands for an end to suffering in the Palestinian enclave.\n\nNetanyahu, speaking after his security cabinet on Friday approved a much-criticised plan to take control of Gaza City, said he had no choice but to \"complete the job\" and defeat Hamas to free hostages seized from Israel.\n\nGaza City, the enclave's most populous centre, came under escalating Israeli air strikes late on Sunday, witnesses said. At least five people were killed at a sandwich shop in the Sabra neighbourhood, health officials at Shifa Hospital said.\n\nPalestinian media said a missile hit a tent used by journalists near the hospital, and the head of Shifa Hospital, Muhammad Abu Salamiyah, said on Al Jazeera television that seven people were killed there. A tank fire was also reported in the area.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza media office said five Al Jazeera staff died in the attack, including journalists Anas Al Sharif and Mohammed Qreiqeh and three photojournalists. It said the fifth man was a driver and assistant.\n\nIsrael's military said it targeted and killed Al Sharif, whom it claimed was the head of a Hamas cell posing as a journalist. It said the accusation had been confirmed by intelligence and documents found in Gaza. U.N. Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month the claims were unsubstantiated.\n\nNetanyahu's office said late Sunday the prime minister had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about \"Israel's plans to take control of the remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Israeli leader said the new Gaza offensive aimed to tackle two remaining Hamas strongholds in what he called his only option because of the Palestinian group's refusal to lay down its arms. Hamas says it will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established.\n\nIt was not clear when the offensive, which would be the latest in successive attempts by the Israeli military to clear the militants from Gaza City, would begin.\n\n\"The timeline that we set for the action is fairly quick. We want, first of all, to enable safe zones to be established so the civilian population of Gaza City can move out,\" he added.\n\nThe city, home to a million people before the two-year-old war, would be moved into \"safe zones\", he said. Palestinians say these have not protected them from Israeli fire in the past.\n\nIsrael's military chief has voiced opposition to occupying the entire Gaza Strip and has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger the lives of hostages Hamas is still holding and draw its troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare.\n\nNetanyahu said his goal was not to occupy Gaza. \"We want a security belt right next to our border, but we don't want to stay in Gaza. That's not our purpose,\" he said.\n\nSPREADING FAMINE\n\nEuropean representatives at the United Nations said famine was unfolding in Gaza, and Israel's plan would only make things worse.\n\n\"Expanding military operations will only endanger the lives of all civilians in Gaza, including the remaining hostages, and result in further unnecessary suffering,\" Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\n\n\"This is a manmade crisis, and therefore urgent action is needed to halt starvation and to surge aid into Gaza,\" they said.\n\nMalnutrition is widespread in the enclave due to what international aid agencies say is a deliberate plan by Israel to restrict aid. Israel rejects that allegation, blaming Hamas for the hunger among Palestinians and saying a lot of aid has been distributed.\n\nThe U.S. representative at the Security Council defended Netanyahu and said Washington was committed to addressing humanitarian needs, freeing the hostages and achieving peace.\n\nNetanyahu said Israel was working with Washington on creating a surge of aid into Gaza, including by land. After his conversation with Trump, the prime minister's office said he thanked the president \"for his steadfast support of Israel.\"\n\nFive more people, including two children, died of malnutrition and starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, Gaza's health ministry said, taking the number of deaths from such causes to 217, including 100 children.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza government media office said a further 23 people had been killed so far in the war by airdrops of aid, which countries have resorted to due to the difficulties of getting aid in by road.\n\nIn the latest case, a parachuted aid box killed a 14-year-old boy awaiting food with other desperate Palestinians at a tent encampment in central Gaza, according to medics and video verified by Reuters.\n\nThe war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel and killed 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, according to Israeli figures. Israeli authorities say 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza are alive.\n\nIsrael's offensive since then has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to health officials, and left much of the territory in ruins.","summary":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he expected to complete a new Gaza offensive \"fairly quickly\" as the U.N.

Before joining The View as a co-host in 2022, the communications strategist held high-profile roles in the Trump administration.\n\nKnown for her political insight and candid commentary, she’s now a regular presence at the Hot Topics table, balancing her media work with speaking engagements and writing. With her growing profile in both politics and television, many are curious about how much Alyssa has earned. Find out more below.\n\nWho Is Alyssa Farah Griffin?\n\nBefore joining the daytime talk show in 2022, Alyssa served as White House Director of Strategic Communications and Assistant to the President under Donald Trump in 2020, making her the youngest person ever to hold that position. She has also worked as press secretary for the Department of Defense and communications director for the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nFollowing her time in the Trump administration, she became a CNN political contributor and guest co-hosted The Viewduring its 25th season, filling in as the conservative voice after Meghan McCain’s departure, before joining as a permanent co-host the following season. Since leaving Washington, Alyssa has built a high-profile career as a political commentator and outspoken critic of Trump.\n\nWhat Is Alyssa Farah Griffin’s Net Worth?\n\nIn 2025, Alyssa’s net worth is estimated to be around $6 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. She reportedly earns around $2 million annually for her role on The View.\n\nIs Alyssa Farah Griffin Married?\n\nYes. Alyssa is married to Justin Griffin, a business and political consultant. The couple got engaged in 2020 and tied the knot in November 2021 in Vero Beach, Florida. The talk show host called it “the best of my life,” when sharing photos from the wedding on Instagram.\n\nDoes Alyssa Farah Griffin Have Children?\n\nAs of 2025, Alyssa does not have children, but she has been candid about her journey to start a family. In one of her most surprising on-air moments, The View co-host Whoopi Goldberg stopped mid-sentence during a political discussion to ask Alyssa if she was pregnant in 2023. After the unexpected question, Alyssa laughed and asked why, to which Whoopi replied that she had “a glow.” The exchange became even more awkward when Alyssa pointed out that her mother-in-law was in the studio audience, joking, “Oh my God. You can’t say that when my mother-in-law is here!”\n\nAlyssa admitted on air that she and her husband were having discussions about starting a family. “I’m very open to being pregnant soon. I am not blessed to be pregnant yet. My husband and I are thinking about it,” she said, adding that she would take a pregnancy test just in case.\n\nOn The View: Behind the Table podcast in 2024, Alyssa revealed that she and Justin were going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) after trying for more than a year to conceive naturally. “I’m going through IVF right now,” she shared at the time. “My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for about a year and a half, and it wasn’t happening naturally.”","summary":"Image Credit: Getty Images Alyssa Farah Griffin has carved out a unique path from the corridors of Washington, D.C., to daytime television.

And the biggest clue providing a glimpse into the president’s psyche is the simultaneous focus of his entire national security team on Barack Obama, Trump’s first-term predecessor and a figure many have argued propelled Trump’s political ambitions through mockery and dismissal.\n\nBolton, who served as Trump’s national security adviser, explained Sunday that Trump’s peacemaking attempts in Ukraine were part of a clear bid for a Nobel Peace Prize. He pointed to the president’s efforts to claim credit for halting other global conflicts as part of the same concerted campaign; the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, and India’s clashes with Pakistan.\n\n“I think what Trump has done is make it clear that he wants a Nobel Peace Prize more than anything else.... the way to his heart? Offer to nominate him,” Bolton told ABC News.\n\nThough Bolton said that Trump was having mixed success: “I don't think what he has done materially changes the situation in -- in any of those circumstances, or several others he's mentioned, like Pakistan/India, where the Indians, not just the government, the entire country are outraged that he tried to take credit for [a peace agreement].”\n\nOn Friday, the president invited the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia to the White House to sign a peace agreement. The deal is aimed at ending decades of conflict, but builds on a peace process moderated by Russia’s Vladimir Putin and a previous agreement crafted by Russia that the two countries signed. Writing Thursday on Truth Social, Trump boasted of his role in reaching the agreement.\n\nThe agreement between the two nations will create a major trade and transit corridor called the “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.” It will connect mainland Azerbaijan with the autonomous Nakhchivan region, satisfying a major objective of the Azerbaijani government in the peace talks between the countries.\n\nMeanwhile, Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard and Attorney General Pam Bondi collaborate on an effort to reignite interest in “Russiagate” and the 2016 investigation into the Trump campaign. And the president himself continues to rage against a man he now accuses of “treason” and efforts to rig the 2016 and possibly 2020 elections. Gabbard has eagerly echoed his accusations and argued that the Obama administration’s efforts to call out Russian election interference efforts should be considered a “coup”.\n\nBondi acted to give the pair as much political cover at the Justice Department as possible; the embattled attorney general opened a grand jury probe into the “Russiagate” investigation this past week, even despite a previous DOJ special counsel review finding no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in the case. No charges have been filed yet against Obama or anyone else.\n\nCombined with Trump’s bid to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a clear pattern is emerging. As former RNC chair Michael Steele (the only Black chair in the Republican Party’s history) wrote earlier this year in an op-ed for MSNBC: “It’s clear that Obama has been living in Trump’s head rent-free for the last two decades. Some think he first ran for president because Obama made fun of him at the White House Correspondents Association dinner. He mistakenly called Biden by Obama’s name multiple times while campaigning, once even saying he beat Obama in 2016.”\n\n“Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize? Trump spends years obsessing about winning it himself,” Steele added.\n\nIn March, Bolton saw the connection too. He told the New York Times that Trump “saw that Obama got the Nobel Peace Prize and felt if Obama got it for not doing anything, why should he not get it?” The Times noted other instances where Trump has publicly and privately groused about not getting the award in spite of Obama’s reception.\n\n“If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds,” the president told the Detroit Economic Club last year.\n\nThe evidence is clear: Trump is entering the latest phase of a years-long obsession with a political foe who consumes more of his attention than Joe Biden and even, at this point, Hillary Clinton. Obama is, in reality, Trump’s one unvanquished foe remaining on the left. But he’s also the last U.S. president who commanded clear respect and admiration not just in the U.S. but around the world, where he was invited to speak before the legislative bodies of the UK, Canada and Australia as well as to huge crowds elsewhere, like Germany and his father’s home country of Kenya. The 44th president, the nation’s first Black commander-in-chief, struck a nerve in Trump early and the man who would succeed Obama spent years coordinating a false, racist campaign of abuse centered around Obama’s heritage and birthplace. Hillary Clinton won his attention and became a focus of his anger during and after the 2016 election, though she’s largely faded from his view.\n\nBut while the president can order his Cabinet members and aides to launch probes and issue statements tarnishing Obama’s reputation, he’s found so far that his ability to solve geopolitical conflicts is far more limited. Even as Trump has seen some success bullying U.S. trading partners into line with his “reciprocal” tariffs, his promises to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza overnight have dissolved into failure.\n\nThe international community waits to see whether this grudge-turned-ambition will propel Trump to actually force the end of a three-year war in Ukraine or the bloody siege and starvation of Gaza caused by Israel’s blockade, or whether he will once again be frustrated by the realities that have thwarted his efforts so far.","summary":"Trump turns to peacemaking in his latest effort to grasp Obama’s global acclaim.

It has to be effectual recognition and not a political de jure recognition,” Rutte told ABC’s This Week.\n\nZelensky thanked those countries backing Ukraine’s position in his Sunday evening address.\n\n“The war must be ended as soon as possible with a fair peace,” he said. “A fair peace is needed.\n\n“Clear support for the fact that everything concerning Ukraine must be decided with Ukraine’s participation.

The White House had no immediate comment on whether Trump was calling for a count before the 2030 census.\n\nTrump has long railed against the inclusion of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally from the census, which is used to determine the number of seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislative districts.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 blocked Trump from adding a contentious citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying the federal government gave a \"contrived\" rationale.\n\nUpon taking office in 2021, former President Joe Biden used an executive order to affirm the longstanding practice of including all people residing in a state in the official count. Trump revoked that order on his first day in office this term.\n\nSean Moulton, a census expert at the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said some Republicans believed excluding immigrants in the U.S. illegally would benefit Republican districts and hurt urban areas, which are often Democratic-controlled.\n\nBut Moulton said not counting all the people living in a given region hurts everyone there.\n\n\"If we don't count everybody, we wind up misspending our money on infrastructure and hospitals, schools, power grids and water, so everyone winds up being inconvenienced and encountering problems,\" he said.\n\nTrump's announcement comes amid pressure by Republicans to redraw congressional districts in Texas, Florida, Missouri and Ohio, and with Democrats now threatening to redistrict their own voting maps in California, Illinois and New York.\n\nUndertaking an additional census would be time-consuming and costly. The 2020 census cost nearly $14 billion, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nTrump has also launched a nationwide campaign to arrest migrants who are in the country illegally and to deport millions of people, actions that have prompted dozens of lawsuits.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that excludes immigrants in the U.S. illegally.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-orders-new-census-that-excludes-immigrants-in-the-us-illegally/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-772.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:08:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Reuters 08pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Reuters 08pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":349908032,"title":"Exclusive-SK Hynix expects AI memory market to grow 30% a year to 2030","text":"SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO :South Korea's SK Hynix forecasts that the market for a specialized form of memory chip designed for artificial intelligence will grow 30 per cent a year until 2030, a senior executive said in an interview with Reuters. \n\nThe upbeat projection for global growth in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for use in AI brushes off concern over rising price pressures in a sector that for decades has been treated like commodities such as oil or coal. \n\n\"AI demand from the end user is pretty much, very firm and strong,\" said SK Hynix's Choi Joon-yong, the head of HBM business planning at SK Hynix. \n\nThe billions of dollars in AI capital spending that cloud computing companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are projecting will likely be revised upwards in the future, which would be \"positive\" for the HBM market, Choi said. \n\nThe relationship between AI build-outs and HBM purchases is \"very straightforward\" and there is a correlation between the two, Choi said. SK Hynix's projections are conservative and include constraints such as available energy, he said. \n\nBut the memory business is undergoing a significant strategic change during this period as well. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 - involves stacking chips vertically to save space and reduce power consumption, helping to process the large volumes of data generated by complex AI applications. \n\nSK Hynix expects this market for custom HBM to grow to tens of billions of dollars by 2030, Choi said. \n\nDue to technological changes in the way SK Hynix and rivals such as Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics build next-generation HBM4, their products include a customer-specific logic die, or \"base die\", that helps manage the memory. \n\nThat means it is no longer possible to easily replace a rival's memory product with a nearly identical chip or product. \n\nPart of SK Hynix's optimism for future HBM market growth includes the likelihood that customers will want even further customisation than what SK Hynix already does, Choi said. \n\nAt the moment it is mostly larger customers such as Nvidia that receive individual customisation, while smaller clients get a traditional one-size-fits-all approach. \n\n\"Each customer has different taste,\" Choi said, adding that some want specific performance or power characteristics. \n\nSK Hynix is currently the main HBM supplier to Nvidia, although Samsung and Micron supply it with smaller volumes. Last week, Samsung cautioned during its earnings conference call that current generation HBM3E supply would likely outpace demand growth in the near term, a shift that could weigh on prices.\n\n\"We are confident to provide, to make the right competitive product to the customers,\" Choi said. \n\n100 per cent TARIFFS\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the United States would impose a tariff of about 100 per cent on semiconductor chips imported from countries not producing in America or planning to do so. \n\nChoi declined to comment on the tariffs. \n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office the new tariff rate would apply to \"all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States,\" but would not apply to companies that were already manufacturing in the United States or had made a commitment to do so. \n\nTrump's comments were not a formal tariff announcement, and the president offered no further specifics. \n\nSouth Korea's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo said on Thursday that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix would not be subject to the 100 per cent tariffs on chips if they were implemented. \n\nSamsung has invested in two chip fabrication plants in Austin and Taylor, Texas, and SK Hynix has announced plans to build an advanced chip packaging plant and an artificial intelligence research and development facility in Indiana. \n\nSouth Korea's chip exports to the United States were valued at $10.7 billion last year, accounting for 7.5 per cent of its total chip exports. \n\nSome HBM chips are exported to Taiwan for packaging, accounting for 18 per cent of South Korea's chip exports in 2024, a 127 per cent increase from the previous year.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/exclusive-sk-hynix-expects-ai-memory-market-grow-30-year-2030-5287761","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--wo0hjV34--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-08-10t220439z_1_lynxmpel7906z_rtroptp_3_sk-hynix-results.jpg?itok=g","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 22:04:39","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":349916252,"title":"Billionaire Democratic Gov.

Welker asked the Democratic governor if the party should be embracing an anti-billionaire message. \"Look, how much money you have doesn’t determine what your values are, and I’m a Democrat because I believe that everyone deserves health care.

What do you say to those who argue it’s hypocritical for you to criticize Texas for partisanship when your state also drew maps to boost your party’s standing?\" Welker asked. \"Well, remember that what Texas is trying to do is, again, violate the Voting Rights Act. We didn’t. We held public hearings, legislative hearings. People attended them. They spoke out. There was a map that was put out.

Speaking of Biden, as we were, let’s start with former first son Hunter Biden, who—as is his custom—kept it classy:\n\nHUNTER BIDEN: “How do you think you got food on your f—— table? Who do you think washes your dishes? Who do you think does your f—— garden?”\n\nREP. JIMMY GOMEZ, D-Calif., mocked ICE raids as heartless assaults on “the immigrant workers who feed America.”\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-Calif.: “Why are you shipping these immigrants up north? We need them here to pick the crops.”\n\nALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, Biden’s secretary of Department of Homeland Security: “Food is not reaching our table because those who pick the crops have been removed.”REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, D-Fla.: “I mean, you’re going to have vegetables rotting in the fields.”REP. JERRY NADLER, D-N.Y.: “Our vegetables would rot in the ground if they weren’t being picked by many illegal immigrants.”REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y.: “If you think your groceries are expensive now, wait until the farms are empty.”\n\nREP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, D-Wash.: “If you look at the food that’s on your table, think about who picked it.”\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN on CNN: “It’s going to deport 20 million people, the people who pick your crops.”\n\nSEN. DICK DURBIN, D-Ill.: “They come with regularity from Mexico, usually, to work in the fields.”\n\nREP. JASMINE CROCKETT, D-Texas: “Those immigrants that come into our country work in the fields, something we ain’t done in a long time.”\n\nJENNA ARNOLD, Democratic strategist: “I can’t wait until American women can’t get blueberries for their smoothies.”\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN on TikTok: “Good news, Red States, you can now pick your own fruits and vegetables in the blazing hot sun for $5 an hour.”\n\nTHE RT. REV. MARIANN EDGAR BUDDE, Episcopal bishop of Washington: “The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in poultry farms and meatpacking plants; who wash dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals … .”\n\nANNA NAVARRO, one of the co-hosts of ABC-TV’s “The View”: “What’s going to happen here is that milk gets a lot higher [in price], because I don’t know if any of you have ever been in a dairy farm, because it is god-awful work.”\n\nKELLY OSBOURNE on “The View”: “If you kick every Latino out of this country, who’s going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?”\n\nREP. HANK JOHNSON, D-Ga. (best-known for expressing fear that the island of Guam might flip over like a floating Frisbee if too many military personnel were stationed on one side of it): “If we had no immigration, we would have no food on our plates. We would have nobody cleaning up in the hospitals.”\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: “I have friends texting me, like, all morning, ‘My gardener didn’t show up. My housekeeper didn’t show up.’ You’re going to actually have to do some work around your house.”\n\nREP. BECCA BALINT, D-Vt.: “We’re not going to have anyone around to wipe our asses because we don’t have enough people.”\n\nAmid fierce backlash for that crass and demeaning characterization, Balint quasi-apologized for what she called “sloppy and insensitive language.” In truth, however, it was more a case of the Left saying the quiet part out loud, telling us what they really think of illegal immigrants.\n\n“It has been and always will be about protecting immigrants and fighting for dignity and fair wages for every single person in this country,” Balint told the VTDigger.org in an unconvincing attempt at damage control.\n\nThat’s patently false, of course, because if the Vermont Democrat and her fellow liberals were genuinely fighting for “fair wages,” they would strenuously oppose illegal immigration—as they did as recently as the Obama administration. Now as then, the labor surplus created by millions of illegal immigrants holds down wages for American citizens—and even for the illegals themselves. \n\nThe jobs Americans supposedly “won’t do” would be a lot more attractive if supply and demand and market forces were allowed to play out in the absence of illegals in the workforce and thereby create the “living wages” the Left claims to want for American workers.","summary":"For all of their pious pontificating about the nobility of illegal immigrants as people who simply came here in search of a better life for...

As a mid-sized US ally dependent on US security guarantees and market access, the summit is very important for South Korea. It will be closely watched for signals about the future of the alliance.\n\nUnlike previous US presidents, who uniformly supported the US-South Korea alliance, Mr Trump has a more unpredictable approach to US alliances.\n\nDuring his first term, he criticised the cost of stationing American troops abroad and pushed allies to shoulder more of the burden. At times, he appeared to cast doubt on whether the US would honour its security commitments.\n\nStill, South Korea accommodated Mr Trump, with then-president Moon Jae-in going to great lengths to keep diplomacy on track, even publicly stating that Mr Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his historic summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018.\n\nBut much has changed since then, and Mr Lee’s visit to Washington will reflect that.\n\nOnly into his second month in office, Mr Lee is navigating a far more complex geopolitical environment, including a deepening US-China rivalry, a more provocative North Korea and shifting regional alliances.

A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.\n\nThe camps - sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. - had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be \"safe zones,\" but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.\n\nNetanyahu spoke with Trump about plan\n\nNetanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his \"steadfast support.\"\n\nRejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a \"global campaign of lies,\" Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.\n\n\"Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,\" Netanyahu asserted. The goals, he said, include demilitarizing the territory, the Israeli military having \"overriding security control\" and a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge.\n\nIsrael wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: \"There is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.\"\n\nNetanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to \"bring in more foreign journalists\" - which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.\n\nHe again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. \"Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,\" he asserted, adding that Palestinians are \"begging\" to be freed from them.\n\nHamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as \"blatant lies.\"\n\nLate Sunday, heavy bombardment was reported in Gaza City. Shortly before midnight local time, broadcaster Al Jazeera said correspondent Anas al-Sharif was killed in a strike along with other journalists and a driver, citing the director of nearby Shifa Hospital there.\n\nIsrael's military confirmed it, asserting al-Sharif had \"posed as a journalist\" and alleging he was with Hamas. The Committee to Protect Journalists last month said it was gravely concerned for his safety and said he was a \"targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign.\"\n\nU.S. defends Israel at Security Council meeting\n\nThe United States defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.\n\nThe U.S. has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.\n\nOther council members, and U.N. officials, expressed alarm. China called the \"collective punishment\" of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a \"reckless intensification of hostilities.\"\n\n\"This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,\" said Ramesh Rajasingham with the U.N. humanitarian office. \"Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.\"\n\nIsrael faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had \"buckled under\" the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking \"very critically\" but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed.\n\nMore Palestinians killed as they seek aid\n\nAt least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. The Associated Press spoke to witnesses of gunfire in the Israeli-controlled Morag and Netzarim corridors and the Teina area in the south. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys.\n\nFifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.\n\nThe situation is a \"death trap,\" said Jamal al-Laweh, who said Israeli forces opened fire there. \"But I have no other choice to feed the kids.\"\n\nSix were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital.\n\nIn central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.\n\nSix other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.\n\nThe GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.\n\nResponding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: \"There were no incidents at or near our sites today.\" Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.\n\nHunger death toll among children hits 100\n\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began.\n\nAt least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them.\n\nThe hunger toll is in addition to the ministry's war toll of 61,400 Palestinians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians, but says around half of the dead have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.\n\nShurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.

About 800 are considered unsheltered or “on the street,” the organization says.\n\nA White House official said on Friday that more federal law enforcement officers were being deployed in the city following a violent attack on a young Trump administration staffer that angered the president.\n\nAlleged crimes investigated by federal agents on Friday night included “multiple persons carrying a pistol without license,” motorists driving on suspended licenses, and dirt bike riding, according to a White House official on Sunday. The official said 450 federal law enforcement officers were deployed across the city on Saturday.\n\nThe Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, said on Sunday the capital was “not experiencing a crime spike.”\n\n“It is true that we had a terrible spike in crime in 2023, but this is not 2023,” Bowser said on MSNBC’s The Weekend. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.”\n\nThe city’s police department reports that violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 was down by 26% in D.C. compared with last year while overall crime was down about 7%.\n\nBowser said Trump is “very aware” of the city’s work with federal law enforcement after meeting with Trump several weeks ago in the Oval Office.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has control of D.C.’s budget after the district was established in 1790 with land from neighboring Virginia and Maryland, but resident voters elect a mayor and city council.\n\nFor Trump to take over the city, Congress likely would have to pass a law revoking the law that established local elected leadership, which Trump would have to sign. Bowser on Sunday noted the president’s ability to call up the National Guard if he wanted, a tactic the administration used recently in Los Angeles after immigration protests over the objections of local officials.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump pledged on Sunday to evict homeless people from the nation&#8217;s capital and jail criminals, despite Washington&#8217;s mayor arguing there is no current spike in crime.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/10/breaking-news/trump-wants-to-evict-homeless-from-washington/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_2025-08-10T170851Z_487782238_RC2ECCA3UP06_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-WASHINGTON.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-10 21:48:00","author":"None","authors":["None"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.187}]}
