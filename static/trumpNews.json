Around 9pm local time, the former president appeared in front of a blaze of lightbulbs spelling out ‘TRUMP’, a showbiz backdrop redolent of Elvis in his Las Vegas heyday. In silhouette, he looked like a minotaur: bulky in the shoulders but light in the hooves as he trotted over to the lectern. His right ear was still bandaged, occasionally he sweated under the spotlights and in mood he switched from folksy and emotional to pugnacious and aggrieved, then back again. ‘There is love in the room, there is big love in the room,’ Trump purred, before promising to stop all wars, introduce tax cuts, make cities safe again, boost oil and gas production and sort out that illegal migration mess down Mexico way. ‘Drill baby, drill! And close our borders,’ he bellowed, as the fevered crowd roared their approval. But not everyone was pleased. ‘Was there anything in there for the moderates?’ fretted a host on NBC News. There was little room for moderation in the 18,000 capacity Convention Hall, where Trump was given a hero’s welcome from the nailed-on fans, senators and delegates known variously as Trumpers, Trumplicans, Trump Boosters, Trumpists and Trumpites. The 78-year-old leader began his epic 93-minute speech by describing in detail what it’s like to be the target of an assassination attempt, adding that he would never tell the story again because it was ‘too painful’ to recount. This was gripping; raw history being played out on millions of television screens across America. For no one needed reminding that too few presidents, serving or otherwise, have lived to tell the tale. ‘The bullet came within a quarter inch of taking my life,’ he began. ‘Trump, Trump, Trump,’ chanted the crowd, some of them already in tears. ‘I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I’m not supposed to be here tonight,’ he continued. ‘Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are!’ intoned the party faithful. ‘I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,’ he said. ‘USA! USA! USA!’ they cried. Had the shooting changed something in Trump? Tucker Carlson, America’s most influential Right-wing media commentator, seemed to think so. In a speech onstage earlier, the man who proved too toxic even for Fox News, argued that everything was different now. ‘The nation is different, the world is different. Donald Trump is different. When he stood up after being shot and put his hand up, I thought at that moment that was a transformation. I think it was divine intervention.’ That might be pushing it a bit but who can know what goes through a man’s heart and soul when someone tries and fails to kill them by a fraction of an inch? Certainly, it seems clear that Trump feels touched by the hand of God and appears to be invigorated with a new sense of purpose. On an interview with CBS Mornings, on Thursday, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump – wife of his second son Eric – put forward her view. ‘I don’t think you can go through a near-death experience and not come out on the other side impacted,’ she said, meaning mentally, I presume. Lara was there last night, seated with the rest of the Trump family in a little enclave in the arena. There were the First Sons – Eric and Donald Junior – there was Ivanka and Jared, there were the assorted Trumpkin grandchildren, cute as buttons. Everyone was poodle-groomed within an inch of their lives, all were togged out in red, white and blue, like a patriotic but blond Addams Family. No one looked as marvellous as Melania of course, polished and exquisite in her perfectly fitted red Dior suit, but remote as a satellite as always. Everyone had to sit through hours and hours of warm-up speeches, including contributions from Kid Rock (a dull rap song) and former wrestler Hulk Hogan who paid tribute to Trump as ‘my hero, the gladiator’, someone who was going to ‘straighten the country out for all the real Americans’. Even Eric got in on the action. ‘Your conviction is truly next level,’ he said to his father. ‘I am honoured to be your son, our country loves you. One of the most courageous acts in the history of American politics was when you shouted: ‘Fight-fight-fight’.’ ‘Fight, fight, fight,’ chanted the crowd, cheerfully oblivious to hyperbole. Out on the floor, many of the delegates wore cowboy hats, some had MAGA caps, while the legendary Wisconsin delegation – called the ‘Cheeseheads’ – wear wedges of foam cheese on their heads in honour of their state’s impressive dairy production. As a sign of respect, they take them off when singing the national anthem or in moments of high emotion. O ne came when Trump was explaining that there was so much blood when he got shot because of the location. ‘Doctors told me it’s the ears, they bleed more than any other part of the body. So we learn something,’ he said. Indeed we do. What I have learned is how you feel about Donald Trump’s ear bandage reveals how you feel about Donald Trump. In the days preceding his keynote speech there was grumbling from Democrats and Leftists that the former president was milking it; wearing that big ol’ patch like a badge of courage, flaunting his wound like a gauze pennant fluttering on the presidential battlefield. MSNBC host Ari Melber was one of the disbelievers, snorting that the ear bandage was ‘a spectacle’ when Trump made his first appearance inside the hall after being shot. And out on the badlands of X, formerly known as Twitter, there was a typical exchange of half-baked misinformation. Someone called Peggy Vandervoort wrote that ‘Trump’s huge pad bandage on his ear is a PR stunt’. Her source on this was that well known gunshot trauma expert, Martina Navratilova. According to Peggy, the tennis champ had ‘just posted saying her close friend is a nurse from Major Trauma in a big city and concurred that ‘there is no need to dress an ear wound like this, even if half the ear was blown off’.’ Martina had done no such thing. She had reposted a post from someone called LazarTagWolf (Good cook. Stones fan. Native Californian. Biden/Harris Dem. Taurus. Tall in Socks) and it was HER friend who was the charge nurse. ‘It wouldn’t look like this,’ Lazar insisted, and Martina agreed. ‘Of course this is obviously a stunt,’ tweeted Navratilova. ‘The day after the shooting he had no bandage on his ear, not even a Band Aid.’ She was referring to a widely circulated photograph of Trump playing golf used as evidence for this stunt bandage theory, even though it had been taken the week before the shooting. During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Wednesday, son Donald Trump Jr expressed his understandable disgust. ‘He wasn’t shot in the face enough for them? It wasn’t enough?’ he said, explaining the sceptical reactions as part of something he calls The Trump Derangement Syndrome. ‘You can see the photograph at the time. There’s blood everywhere,’ he added. Trump Derangers include Whoopi Goldberg, who complained about the former president’s 17-year-old granddaughter Kai taking to the stage to ‘show a side of my grandpa that people don’t often see’. ‘They are trying to humanise him, don’t fall for it,’ said Whoopi on ABC talk show The View. But others went too far. The actor Jack Black, who also fronts a comedy rock band called Tenacious D, was forced to cancel his group’s Australian tour when a bandmate expressed a wish that the shooter ‘didn’t miss next time’ – a repellent comment about an assassination attempt that killed one bystander and critically injured two others. By Wednesday, convention attendees began wearing their own ear bandages in support. It seemed to start with Arizona delegate Joe Neglia. ‘I thought, ‘What can I do to honour the truth? What can I possibly do?’ he told Fox News Digital. ‘And then I saw the bandage and I thought, I can do that. I put it on to honour Trump and express sympathy and unity.’ It caught on like a contagion. Bandaged ears soon appeared all over the hall, like Life Of Brian disciples suffering amid an ear plague but still worshipping the new messiah. Emily Maitlis was in Milwaukee reporting for her News Agents podcast and had called the delegates ‘weirdos and misfits’ even before the sympathy bandages appeared. I thought it rather a gratuitous sneer at thousands of people expressing their sincerely held political beliefs but that is Emily for you. ‘The conversations in this hall are utterly dystopian,’ she reported to co-host John Sopel. ‘I think it has become more cultish, I genuinely think the people who are spouting this garbage are starting to believe it.’ Bit rich, considering that for 16 years she worked for the biggest and most invidious cult of all: the BBC. Meanwhile, large parts of America are still in shock and distress over what happened last Saturday night. It comes at a time when the moral code of the country seems to be unspooling, amid a backdrop of ideological and partisan divisions along with cultural and political hostilities. There is unease, there is disinformation, there are worries about the incapacity of Joe Biden, about war, migrants, house prices, climate change, drug wars, gun violence and hate speech. Is Donald Trump the man to bring the country together and move forward as one into the golden future he promises, or will he only deepen divisions, just like before? CNN have already listed ‘more than twenty false claims’ they allege he made in his acceptance speech. At the end of this very long night, Pastor Franklin Graham came on and made everyone stand and ‘pray to the heavenly father for saving the life of Donald J Trump’. The Trumplicans sprang up as one. The Cheeseheads took their cheeses off. Donald bowed his head for a moment and Melania appeared on stage to congratulate her husband. ‘Good job,’ she said, as if he’d just put some cutlery back in the correct drawer. Then the couple did one of their awkward, fumbled public kisses, acting like two blind tortoises who are allergic to each other trying to gum the same leaf of lettuce. Then thousands of balloons fell from the ceiling in the traditional euphoric finale and NBC asked a delegate what she thought of Trump now. ‘I think the spirit of the loving God is in him,’ she said, her eyes shining. Amen to that.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAt the end of one of the most incredible weeks in American&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Observing Trump&#8217;s enthusiastic welcome at the Republican Convention &#8211; JAN MOIR reflects on his kiss with Melania and his peculiar bandaged ears first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/observing-trumps-enthusiastic-welcome-at-the-republican-convention-jan-moir-reflects-on-his-kiss-with-melania-and-his-peculiar-bandaged-ears/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Trump-and-Melania-kissed-like-two-blind.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-20 00:15:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":252195274,"title":"Trump speaks with Zelensky over phone to discuss conflict in Ukraine","text":"NEW YORK, July 20. /TASS/.

Last week, the ex-president hosted at his Florida estate Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month.Trump's frequent praise for Putin and reluctance to outright criticize the Russian invasion have stirred concerns among Ukraine's allies that he would force the country into accepting partial defeat.He has also repeatedly suggested backing away from NATO, even undermining the alliance's collective defense guarantee by saying he would encourage Russia to attack any members not who had not met their financial obligations.Trump's running mate J.D.

The New York City Department of Correction did not provide further detail on Weisselberg’s early release, though CBS News reported it was due to good behavior. Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury earlier this year in connection with New York Attorney General Letitia James’ fraud lawsuit against Trump. A fiercely loyal Trump ally, Weisselberg previously served 99 days in jail for committing criminal tax fraud as the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, the former president’s holding company. He was released in April of last year, also for good behavior. Weisselberg’s latest prison term stemmed from James’ civil lawsuit against Trump, in which he and the organization were found liable for inflating the value of properties in New York, particularly a penthouse triplex in Manhattan’s Trump Tower. During two depositions and at trial in October 2023, Weisselberg lied to investigators about his role in juicing property values. He was initially charged with five counts of perjury, and admitted to two in a plea deal. The agreement locked in his latest five-month sentence at Rikers. Weisselberg’s lies did little to help Trump in the civil fraud case, as Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron ordered the former president to pay $454 million in penalties. In the same ruling, Engoron ordered Weisselberg to fork over $1 million, half of a $2 million severance package he received from the Trump Organization. Weisselberg was on the list of potential witnesses at Trump’s hush-money trial, which resulted in the first criminal conviction of a former president in American history. However, neither side called Weisselberg to the stand, given his history of lying under oath. “Allen Weisselberg accepted responsibility for his conduct and now looks forward to the end of this life-altering experience and to returning to his family and his retirement,” Rosenberg said after April’s sentencing hearing. — With News Wire Services","summary":"Donald Trump’s former finance chief Allen Weisselberg was released from Rikers Island early on Friday, after serving 100 days of a five-month prison sentence.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/07/19/trump-cfo-allen-weisselberg-released-prison-rikers/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2X2MCWRSGBCTPOL6BCMRLMAMGA.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:55:43","author":"Joseph Wilkinson","authors":["Joseph Wilkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":252195374,"title":"Trump speaks with Zelensky about assassination attempt in believed first call since leaving office","text":"Former President Donald Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the phone, ostensibly for the first time since leaving office in January 2021. As his chances of victory in the November election appear to grow, some world leaders have started making limited overtures to Trump in preparation for a possible second presidency. One of these has been Zelensky, who is heavily reliant on the United States for support in its war with Russia. Both parties said the call was productive. Trump said Zelensky congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination for president and condemned the “heinous assassination attempt” last Saturday. He also, according to the former president, “remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.” Notably, however, Trump maintained his ambiguous stance toward Ukraine, condemning the war as a whole and urging both sides to come to a peace settlement. “I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families,” he added. “Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.” Zelensky, confirming some of the details Trump revealed, also stressed the bipartisan nature of support for Ukraine. “Ukraine will always be grateful to the United States for its help in strengthening our ability to resist Russian terror. Russian attacks on our cities and villages continue every day,” he added. “We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.” Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine almost immediately upon taking office. He hasn’t revealed the exact details of such a plan, but some supporters of Ukraine fear it could entail territorial concessions as Russia continues to seize on its strategic initiative.

The conspiracy was one of several that gained traction online in the aftermath of the attack, as people filled an information vacuum with unfounded claims and speculation. Secret Service agents shot and killed the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, almost immediately after he fired at Trump shortly after 6 p.m. on Saturday. There is no evidence of a second shooter. Reports from local law enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service, journalists at the event, eye witnesses and hundreds of hours of social media video show there was one gunman at the event, who was located on a roof close to the tower. However, the claim spread almost immediately after the shooting, with users sharing blurred videos to falsely claim it showed a figure on the tower. One of the earliest mentions of the water tower posted to X shortly after the shooting suggested the possibility of movement on top of the water tower. Within an hour, other users posted photos and videos of the rally with captions that echoed the claim.The false claim was picked up by social media users with large followings, who posted references to the water tower. On X, formerly known as Twitter, community notes were added to some of the posts, debunking the claim. One X post included a clip from a Fox News interview with an eyewitness who referenced \"the other shooter\" whom she heard was at the water tower. The same videos were then circulated on other platforms, including Reddit.CBS News verified eyewitness video of the rally posted to social media, including footage showing angles of the water tower in the moments leading up to the shooting and the immediate aftermath. The videos do not show a person atop the tower. However, blurred versions of these videos were used to push the false claim, where a shadow on the tower could be confused for a person. Google Earth imagery shows the shadows are actually a Pennsylvania American Water logo and a vent on top. Both are visible from the front side that was facing spectators at the rally. Experts warn social media users to exercise caution in what they see before sharing unverified information and visuals, especially around breaking and major news stories.

Biden had planned to raise money in Austin, Denver and California next week, but these plans have been shelved, at least for now, the sources said. The president tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday but said today he would return to the campaign trail next week. Biden’s campaign said his fundraisers would go ahead as planned. “Reuters’ sourcing is incorrect, and we look forward to a robust fundraising schedule,” campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said today. A source familiar with the situation said former late-night comic David Letterman would headline a fundraiser for Biden at the home of Hawaii Governor Josh Green in about 10 days, a sign of forward movement for Biden. A number of big donors are closing their checkbooks amid questions about whether Biden should remain at the top of the Democratic Party ticket, the sources said, using their financial clout to tell Biden to drop out of the Nov. 5 race, potentially in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. The campaign hoped to raise some $50 million in big-dollar donations in July for the Biden Victory fund but was on track for less than half that figure as of today, according to two sources familiar with the fundraising efforts. “There are a lot of donors who have said they won’t put another dime in this race. The question is if Biden stays in the race, will they come back?” said one major East Coast campaign financier. Biden raised $28 million in one night in June at a Hollywood fundraiser that was hosted by the actor George Clooney, who later urged Biden to end his campaign. Harris will talk to major donors today at the request of advisers to the president, according to a source familiar with the plan. Fundraising from megadonors was expected to drop from June to July due to many of these people taking vacations, a campaign official told Reuters today. “This narrative that high-dollar fundraising has dried up is wrong,” the official said. The official noted that the campaign has 10 campaign fundraisers on the schedule for this month. More than one in 10 congressional Democrats have now publicly called on the incumbent to drop out following a disastrous June debate against Republican Donald Trump that raised questions about Biden’s ability to win or to carry out his duties for another four years. NOMINATING PROCESS MOVES FORWARD The official party process to nominate Biden is advancing. The Democratic National Convention Rules Committee met today to outline a virtual voting process to bring forward the official nomination of the 81-year-old before the party’s in-person convention starts Aug. 19 in Chicago. Officials argued an early nomination is needed to more easily comply with state election laws or risk being left off the November ballot. “They’re not risks that we as a party can or should take,” Dana Remus, Biden’s former White House counsel, told the committee. For a party already divided over Biden, with fresh calls today from Democrats in Congress to leave, the early virtual vote is another point of controversy. Critics argue it is a means of pushing Biden through early as the party’s official nominee. Others, including DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, say it is necessary to deal with an Ohio law that could have kept Biden’s name off ballots in the state if he wasn’t nominated by Aug. 7, prior to the convention in Chicago. A member of the rules committee asked whether it was possible that another candidate could challenge Biden in a virtual vote. Leah Daughtry, the committee’s co-chair, said any challenger would need the “verified support of hundreds of delegates.” “Such a challenge has never happened over the past half-century of competitive primaries,” Daughtry said. It was unclear how the nominating process would unfold if Biden were to abandon his reelection bid. The committee is expected to meet again next week to finalize the plan. Biden has been isolating since he tested positive for COVID this week and was believed to be taking calls to step aside seriously. Several Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, Reuters reported on Thursday. “The writing is on the wall,” said a Democratic donor today. Biden has insisted for weeks that he would stay in the race despite calls from heavyweights in his party to cede his position. Trump, 78, accepted the Republican Party’s nomination this week in Milwaukee, speaking before a rapt audience on Thursday. Some Democrats have begun advertising against Biden. Pass the Torch, a group that wants Biden to step down, has launched a TV ad to air in Washington and Rehoboth, Delaware, where Biden frequently vacations, and features Democratic voters from Pennsylvania urging Biden to “pass the torch.”","summary":"Several of President Joe Biden&#8217;s reelection campaign fundraisers are on hold, multiple Democratic sources involved in the events told Reuters today, even as the Democratic Party planned to accelerate his nomination and he vowed to continue in the 2024 race.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/19/breaking-news/biden-fundraisers-on-hold-july-donations-plunge-sources-say/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_20240719_brk_bid03.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:50:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":252194696,"title":"Everything Stephen King Has Said About Donald Trump Assassination Attempt","text":"Bestselling author Stephen King weighed in more than once this week about the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.Trump on Saturday narrowly escaped death during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, with a bullet fired by would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks causing a flesh wound after grazing the former president's right ear. One rally spectator was killed in the shooting, while two others suffered serious injuries.King, the author of classic horror novels like The Shining and It and an outspoken Democrat who frequently criticizes Trump, made his opinions on the assassination attempt known by sharing several remarks that roiled Trump supporters on X, formerly Twitter.\"An AR-15 style semiautomatic rifle was used in the Butler shooting,\" King posted on Sunday morning. \"These are the guns the Republican party—and Trump—want to protect.\"X user @TheGeneral_0, a self-described \"America First Conservative,\" was one of several Trump supporters and conservatives who responded negatively to the gun control message, writing the following in response to King's post: \"For a fiction writer, Stephen King knows little about this subject. Stay your [sic] fictional lane.\"\"Here's what I know, as a responsible gun owner: Those people would be alive and Trump would be unwounded if all that crazy kid had access to was a butcher knife,\" King replied. \"Don't tell me to stay in my f***ing lane. I'm an American. Are you, or are you a bot?\"Later on the same day, the \"King of Horror\" reshared an image from satire website The Onion that purported to be an opinion article from a personified AR-15 with the following headline: \"It's An Honor To Continue Being Valued Over Countless Human Lives.On Monday morning, King sparked another round of MAGA outrage by writing the following: \"I fear for my country.\"Trump-supporting X owner Elon Musk and former sitcom star Roseanne Barr were among those who responded to the post, with Barr seemingly implying that King is a communist by jokingly claiming that he is a citizen of \"China.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to Trump's office via email on Friday evening.While King made a number of other remarks on X about Trump, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance and the state of this year's presidential election, his comments on the assassination attempt diminished as the week went on.King's only other related content was a reshare of the following post from user @EricFoltz: \"Two people who were wounded at Trump's rally are in the hospital and one person is dead.

Zelensky also reported his conversation with Trump and expressed thanks for US military aid. But he made no reference in a post on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, to efforts to end the 28-month-old conflict. Trump has said he will end the war in Ukraine before he even takes office in January should he win the November 5 election. He has also said that had he been in office when the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the war would not have taken place. In his Truth Social post, Trump said that as president he “will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives”. “Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity,” Trump said.

In his post, Zelensky said he congratulated Trump on becoming the Republican nominee and condemned the assassination attempt on him last week. “I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” Zelensky said. “I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation’s freedom and independence.” Ukraine, he said, “will always be grateful to the United States for its help in strengthening our ability to resist Russian terror. Russian attacks on our cities and villages continue every day.” Zelensky rejects any negotiations with Russia on ending the conflict as long as Russian troops remain in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president has proposed a peace plan, showcased again at a “world summit” last month to which Russia was not invited, that calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine’s 1991 post-Soviet borders. Russian troops occupy about 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory. Moscow’s forces have made incremental gains in the east of the country along the 1,000km (600 mile) front since capturing the key city of Avdiivka in February.","summary":"Zelensky congratulated Trump on becoming the Republican US presidential nominee and expressed thanks for US military aid.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/russia-central-asia/article/3271222/donald-trump-says-spoke-ukraines-volodymyr-zelensky-pledges-end-war","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/20/6f25b205-97ff-4036-a1bd-519e7c798538_cee770a5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:42:50","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.087},{"id":252194848,"title":"Federal agencies raise security concerns after Trump assassination attempt","text":"Federal agencies raise security concerns after Trump assassination attempt Nearly a week after the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, federal authorities still don't have a motive for the shooting.

The polls, released Friday as part of a swath of Trafalgar Group battleground-state surveys, show the former president poised to win the 25 electoral votes at stake in November if current trends hold. In Wisconsin, home of the just-concluded Republican National Convention, Trump leads Biden 46% to 43% among the 1,087 registered voters polled, with 7% undecided and the remaining voters going to Robert Kennedy (3%), Jill Stein (1%) and Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver, who are each closer to no support than even Stein’s meager 1%. The R+1.5 survey was conducted between July 15 and July 17, encompassing much of the RNC. It has a +/- 2.9% margin of error and accords with trends in Wisconsin polling since the sole debate between Trump and Biden in late June. As FiveThirtyEight’s tracking shows, Biden was slightly ahead until recently on average in Badger State surveys, but Trump’s current lead is 2.5%. Trafalgar’s Michigan survey of 1,091 registered voters was also conducted between Monday and Wednesday, and it’s also showing a close race but one where Trump is slightly ahead of Biden, 45% to 43% — a lead inside the margin of error of +/- 2.9% but aligned with the average lead of 2 points as tracked by FiveThirtyEight. Kennedy is somewhat more of a factor in the Great Lake State than in Wisconsin, garnering 4% support. Stein and West are at 1%, and 5% of voters say they are undecided. Biden has campaigned in Michigan fairly recently, holding a rally in Detroit where he reassured a deeply supportive invitation-only crowd he had no plans to leave the race. “You’ve probably noticed a lot of speculation lately. What’s Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out? Here’s my answer: I am running, and we’re going to win,” the president said last week. Biden continued along this vein, saying he’s “the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me” during the primaries this year, a beauty-contest exercise without serious competition anywhere and with no competition at all in states like Florida, which excluded Biden’s opponents from ballot consideration. “You made me the nominee. No one else. Not the press, not the pundits, not the press, not the donors. You, the voters. You decided. No one else, and I’m not going anywhere,” the president promised. External pressure has only built on Biden since that rally, a fact acknowledged by some of Michigan’s leading Democrats. Sen. Gary Peters — Democratic Senate Campaign Committee chair — told CBS News he’d “been talking to the president’s campaign” and relaying “concerns” about the “very close race” and its downballot impacts. He shied away from offering further “specifics” about his “straightforward and candid assessment” but said the campaign “listened” to his critique in what was a “good, productive conversation.” Team Trump, meanwhile, is playing to win Michigan just like it did in 2016 — and holds a rally Saturday featuring the candidate and running-mate J.D. Vance in Grand Rapids. Biden campaign officials said as recently as last week the “clearest pathway” to 270 votes is through Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But indications are that road is treacherously narrow right now, and the latest polling backs up the theory the re-election campaign is running out of time to fix its steering.","summary":"Fresh surveys from Wisconsin and Michigan show that in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt, Donald Trump is leading President Biden in two of three “blue wall” states.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/bidens-blue-wall-crumbles-as-trumps-ahead-in-two-crucial-midwestern-battleground-states-polls/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85721772.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:38:51","author":"A.g.

Following funeral services for Corey Comperatore, large crowds of mourners waiting outside fell silent as his American flag-draped casket emerged from Cabot Methodist Church. Firefighters ceremoniously removed the flag and presented it to his wife, Helen, before loading the casket onto a fire truck adorned with black bunting. Three firefighters stood sentry on the back of the truck, trailed by more than 100 other emergency vehicles from fire departments across the region, as it rolled slowly toward Comperatore’s hometown of Freeport, where he was to be laid to rest. A sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend’s bloodshed. Officials have said Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump’s rally on June 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, did not attend the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly. Annette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the toll from the “totally senseless” shooting. “He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he’s gone,” Locke said. Joe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession, which took a full half-hour to pass. “The community comes together at times like this,” Joe Brose said. “I thought it was very heartwarming. It was very humbling to see it,” said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally. Trump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore’s firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as “an unbelievable person.” Mike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump’s tribute. “Trump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,” Drane said. Nancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral. “We’re a very close community here,” she said. A woman who was inside the church for the funeral service said Comperatore’s wife and daughters delivered testimonies, and the church’s pastor read a eulogy written by one of Comperatore’s siblings. The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians or Trump representatives among the crowd, which included country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The service was closed to the news media. In nearby Sarver, where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community’s main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. Five-year-old Ryder Presutti, dressed in a red firefighter’s outfit, waved a small American flag as the fire trucks passed by. Others congregated at Andy’s House of Cars or Cabot Archery to await the funeral procession. Outside a Dollar General, at least a dozen SUVs were lined up tailgate-style, with their trunks open. One resident expressed her feelings with a front yard sign made of giant black letters that read, “American Hero Corey Comperatore.” “It’s a very heartbreaking situation,” said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place. She and her sisters came with their families to honor “somebody who put their life in their hands for their family.” “I will definitely be shedding tears (when the procession passes),” she said. Comperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist, and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter, including a stint as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral. On Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. And hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track. Guests at Thursday’s visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life – his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore’s wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. “Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,” the Trumps wrote. A statement issued Thursday by Comperatore’s family described him as a “beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.” “Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,” the statement said. Two other people were wounded at Trump’s rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.

Former President Donald Trump gave a 92-minute speech that had some emotional moments for delegates as he recounted being shot in an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally last weekend. ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch The campaign is now shifting gears from the convention, which, in part, focused on bringing the Republican Party together to the task at hand: taking on the Democrats. But in the presidential race, it the question is, who will be the opponent on the ticket? Red, white and blue balloons floated down on the delegates Thursday night as they floated on cloud nine with the RNC coming to an exhilarating end. “The whole focus on this speech was to say why he’s going to give us four years better than the last four years that we had 48, and I think he definitely delivered that message here today,” said former Cook County GOP Chair Aaron Del Mar. Trump recounted the shooting incident that nearly took his life. “In a way, if I had not turned my head, I would not be here with you tonight,” Trump said. The emotions of the moment hit home for Illinois delegates. “It was very personal, and it was emotional,” said Republican National Committeewoman Rhonda Belford. Many were watching the prime-time address to see if Trump would live up to all the talk of his speech portraying a softer, humbler candidate after surviving the assassination attempt. “And he started out that way talking about his experience with the assassination attempt, talking about how he felt about that, but it quickly devolved into the same old Trump,” said ABC7 Political Analyst Laura Washington. But delegates felt inspired and hopeful.

John Cabello, R-Machesney Park. Even though there remain some divisions over policies or platform issues, Republicans came away from the convention talking about how unified they now are. Some Democrats not buying all that talk. “How can you believe something, and you see something else?” said U.S. Rep. Danny Davis, D-Chicago. But for Republicans, at least they know who their presidential candidate is. “They see that this is an opportunity to win. They’re facing a candidate in a party that is in complete disarray so the fact that they’re unified gives them a lot of strength going forward,” Washington said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMILWAUKEE (WLS) &#8212; Illinois Republicans are still basking in the afterglow of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Speaks at RNC 2024: Ex-President&#8217;s Address on Rally Shooting Resonates with Illinois Delegates first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/donald-trump-speaks-at-rnc-2024-ex-presidents-address-on-rally-shooting-resonates-with-illinois-delegates/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-RNC-2024-Former-presidents-speech.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:32:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":252194844,"title":"Donald Trump’s Granddaughter Kai Has All These Adorable Things To Say About Her ‘Normal Grandpa’","text":"Being the first of the next generation of Trumps to formally enter politics, Kai Trump, the 17-year-old granddaughter of the former president Donald Trump, took the stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and sang adorable praises of her grandfather. Kai, the daughter of Donald Trump Jr. and his ex-wife Vanessa Trump was introduced by her father before his address. The grateful adolescent tried to show the more \"normal\" aspects of the 45th president of the United States and referred to her grandfather as an \"inspiration,\" per The Daily Beast. The youngster is seemingly continuing in the political footsteps of her father and grandfather, with her attending an event for the conservative youth organization Turning Point Action recently. Kai dotes on her grandpa, saying at the convention, “He’s just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren’t looking. When I made the high honor roll, he printed it out to show his friends how proud he was of me.” The young Trump also protested the ex-president's portrayal in the media, following very closely in the footsteps of her father and grandpa. “The media makes my grandpa seem like a different person, but I know him for who he is. He’s very caring and loving, he truly wants the best for this country.” During the convention, the younger Trump revealed that her grandpa talks to her about golf a lot. “He calls me during the middle of the school day to how my golf game is going and tells me all about his. But then I had to remind him that I’m in school and I have to call him back later.” Kai enjoys playing golf as much as her grandpa does, and a majority of her social media presence is devoted to posts about the game. The doting granddaughter shared that Donald frequently tries to get into her head when she's on the opposite side, per CBS News. \"But I have to remind him, I'm a Trump, too,\" she said, smiling. After winning the Ladies Club Championship at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, she shared a picture of herself with Donald on social media. Kai stated in a video that she started playing golf at the age of two and thanked her mother for introducing her to the game on her YouTube channel. After the assassination attempt on Donald at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Kai posted a photo in support of her grandfather's presidential campaign, captioned, \"We love you, Grandpa. Never stop fighting!\" At the convention too, she referred to the shooting. \"On Saturday, I was shocked when I heard that he had been shot,\" she said. \"And I just wanted to know if he was OK. It was heartbreaking that someone would do that to another person. A lot of people have put my grandpa through hell, and he's still standing.\"","summary":"“He’s just a normal grandpa, he gives us candy and soda when our parents aren’t looking.”","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trumps-granddaughter-kai-has-all-these-adorable-things-to-say-about-her-normal-grandpa","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706010/uploads/c0e77ef0-45a2-11ef-9fdc-b9cf988dd9ea_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:31:00","author":"INQUISITR,Suchitra B","authors":["INQUISITR","Suchitra B"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.354},{"id":252194618,"title":"Secret Service director to testify before Congress on Trump rally shooting","text":"Secret Service director to testify before Congress on Trump rally shooting Federal authorities are still investigating the events that led up to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

At least three of those committee members have joined a growing chorus of Democratic officials urging President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign with a warning that his Republican rival poses a “grave” threat, if elected. Congressman Adam Schiff warned in a statement this week that a “second Trump presidency will undermine the very foundation of our democracy, and I have serious concerns about whether the President can defeat Donald Trump in November.” In a recent four-page letter to Biden, congressman Jamie Raskin told the president that “everything we believe in is on the line in the next four-and-a-half months” and that “we have an overriding obligation to defeat the forces of resurgent monarchy and oppression.” “Everything else pales in comparison to this struggle,” he added. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren said in a statement this week that, as a member of the January 6 committee, she knows “perhaps as well as anyone, how unsuitable Donald Trump is to be president.” “His policies are wrong. His character is unprincipled and corrupt. He remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection,” she wrote. “And, if he is elected President again, he will dismantle all that Democrats have achieved for the American people.” “I think from the data it’s pretty clear,” she told MSNBC on July 19, “that the president is on a trajectory to not prevailing in the election, and I think it’s telling that members of the January 6 committee — myself, Adam Schiff, Jamie Raskin — have all suggested that he step aside, and that we get another candidate who can beat Donald Trump.” The former president “is a threat to America and the world. He cannot be elected. He must not be elected,” she added. “This is [Biden’s] decision. But it’s not about him, it’s not about me. It’s about America.” Raskin told The Independent that he wrote the letter, dated July 9, on the Fourth of July weekend. “My point was that we needed a strategic internal discussion about how to move forward to decisively win the election, which is of immeasurable importance to the future of America,” he said in a statement to The Independent. “The letter expressed my profound affection for the president, my great concern for the future of the country and my confidence in the judgment he would make. None of those things has changed.” A months-long House select committee investigation into the events surrounding and leading up to the attack on the Capitol on January 6 included a series of blockbuster public hearings laying out evidence and witness testimony that described Trump’s attempts to remain in office at whatever cost. The panel’s final 845-page report provides a detailed account of Trump’s refusal to cede power — regardless of the outcome — while he privately acknowledged that he lost, even as the ongoing false narrative that the election was “stolen” from him was fueling the mob in the halls of Congress. The committee unanimously determined that Trump should be criminally charged for conspiracy and obstruction as well as inciting an insurrection. Independent Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is separately prosecuting the former president for conspiracy and obstruction in a case that now faces roadblocks under the Supreme Court’s recent decision on presidential “immunity” for actions in office. The committee also led to the criminal prosecutions — and imprisonments — of Trump aides Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, the first members of Trump’s inner circle to face criminal convictions for any crimes connected to Trump’s attempts to reverse his election loss. Both men were found in contempt of Congress after refusing subpoenas for their testimony to the committee. Last month, on his Truth Social, Trump called their convictions a “Total and Complete American Tragedy.” “INDICT THE UNSELECT J6 COMMITTEE,” he demanded. Trump and Republican officials have accused members of deleting evidence in the investigation, all of which is publicly available. “It has to stop, because, otherwise, we’re not going to have a country,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News last month. “Look, when this election is over, based on what they have done, I would have every right to go after them.” Bannon began his four-month prison sentence on July 1. Navarro ended his four-month sentence in a federal prison facility in Miami on July 17, and then hours later he stepped on the stage of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to a hero’s welcome. “If they can come for me, and if they can come for Donald Trump,” Navarro said, “be careful. They will come for you.”","summary":"Trump wants to ‘indict’ them, and they’re now joining calls to warn Biden about the stakes of his potential loss","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-biden-january-6-adam-schiff-b2582844.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/21/2024-07-01T071158Z_1204227868_RC26M8AQS3A2_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMUNITY.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LdMfyH03-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:25:55","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":252194496,"title":"Defiant Biden vows to stay despite Democrat revolt","text":"by Saul Loeb with Danny Kemp in WashingtonUS President Joe Biden pledged to stay in the White House race Friday, defying a growing Democratic party revolt that raised speculation he could bow out as soon as this weekend.\"The stakes are high, and the choice is clear. Together, we will win,\" the 81-year-old said in a statement from the Delaware beach home where he is in Covid isolation.\"I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week,\" Biden added, as his doctor said the president was bouncing back from the symptoms of the disease.But Biden's political health appeared to be in far worse shape, with ten more House Democrats and two senators joining the list of lawmakers publicly calling on him to quit November's election clash with Donald Trump.A disastrous debate performance against Trump three weeks ago triggered panic about Biden's age and health. More than 30 House Democrats and four senators have now called on him to drop out.A key donor, Silicon Valley investor Michael Moritz, also joined other supporters such as actor George Clooney who want Biden to make way.\"Sadly, President Biden has a choice -- vanity or virtue,\" the New York Times quoted Moritz as saying.With reports that top Democrats have also expressed concerns, polls showing Trump on course for a return to the Oval Office, and fundraising drying up, the walls appeared to be closing in.NBC News reported that some of Biden's family had \"discussed what an exit from his campaign might look like\" although there was no final decision to do so.Vice President Kamala Harris, the front-runner to succeed him as the Democratic presidential candidate if Biden does drop out, was holding an emergency call with donors on Friday.Biden's campaign however pushed back against reports that he would bow out, saying that while there had been some \"slippage\" in support, he was still the best candidate.\"Absolutely the president's in this race,\" campaign chairwoman Jen O'Malley Dillon told MSNBC's Morning Joe program. \"Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.\"Dark VisionBiden's statement blasted his rival's speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday, saying that \"Donald Trump's dark vision for the future is not who we are as Americans.\"But the split-screen between the two campaigns has been stark, with Trump receiving a triumphant reception from newly unified Republicans after surviving an assassination attempt on Saturday.The pressure on Biden has soared in the last 48 hours, with reports that former president Barack Obama, ex-House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the party's congressional leaders had all expressed concerns behind the scenes.Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries was evasive on Friday, saying that the \"ticket that exists right now is the ticket we can win on\" but saying it was Biden's \"decision to make.\"The scene could now be set for the most crucial weekend of Biden's presidency, with media speculation that the US leader is using his time hunkered down in Rehoboth Beach to consult family members and mull over the path ahead.The NBC report said it could involve a \"carefully calculated plan\" to step aside based on his own timing, to give some dignity to what would be a historically late decision by a sitting US president not to run.Any decision by Biden to step aside less than four months from the election would also have to try to avoid chaos in the Democratic Party over his successor as nominee.Biden beat Trump in 2020, becoming the oldest president in US history in the process. But a series of polls have shown him trailing Trump in the 2024 race despite his rival being a convicted felon, while some polls show Harris as more competitive.Source: AFP","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2024/07/19/defiant-biden-vows-to-stay-despite-democrat-revolt","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-06/666e97fb-3875-47fe-a4a5-ec81ad1523d0/joe_hunter_biden_2024_06_12_11_32_00.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:25:49","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":252194000,"title":"Trump, Ukraine's Zelenskyy speak by phone","text":"Washington â Former President Donald Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday in a call that comes nearly five years after another phone conversation between the leaders triggered Trump's first impeachment. Both Trump and Zelenskyy shared details of the call on social media, saying the Ukrainian president congratulated Trump on becoming the GOP nominee and condemning Saturday's attempted assassination. Trump, who has insisted that the war between Russia and Ukraine \"would have never happened\" if he were still president, described it as a \"very good phone call.\" \"I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity,\" Trump said, though he has not said how peace would be achieved. Zelenskyy said Ukraine was grateful for U.S. aid and that the two agreed to \"discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.\" Trump has been critical of the Biden administration sending billions in aid to Ukraine to help it defend itself since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Trump has called Zelenskyy \"the greatest salesman of any politician that's ever lived.\" \"Every time he comes to our country, he walks away with $60 billion,\" Trump said on June 15. It's unclear if Trump would support continued military aid for Ukraine if he wins the election. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, has also been critical of Ukraine assistance. During a call between Trump and Zelenskyy on July 25, 2019, the then-president pushed for his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The House, controlled by Democrats at the time, impeached Trump in December 2019, but the Republican-led Senate acquitted him of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress.

Enough violent political rhetoric. Enough pitting one group of Americans against another. And enough spreading this kind of hate online and in real life.” The letter was attached in an email sent by a City Hall staffer to lawmakers and non-profit organizations Friday, asking them to sign it and to commit to a “safer, stronger, more peaceful democracy.” It called on lawmakers to engage in “thoughtful debate” and ensure the safety of those at polling places while also “respecting the will of the voters, and partaking in the peaceful transfer of power.” “We seek nothing less than the mass de-escalation of the current toxic political rhetoric, and we ask friends, citizens, and our supporters to do the same,” the letter said. “Each one of these signatures will help renew and rebuild the foundations of our democracy, one that has been a beacon for freedom, equality, and justice across the globe,” it adds. Several sources in political circles raised eyebrows at the move — questioning the mayor’s decision to take such a strong stance on the matter. One Council source suggested the letter “serves no other purpose except for the mayor to virtue signal to a national audience.” “Maybe the mayor thinks this will get him back into Biden’s good graces?” the source added, referring to the seemingly tense relationship between the two in light of Adams’ public criticism about Biden’s handling of the border crisis. Another source called the move “shameless,” suggesting Adams was trying to cozy up to Trump “by putting on a show with Republicans.” “Where was he when extremists were targeting non-Republicans?” the Democratic operative said. Others applauded the mayor, saying it was important the city and country unite to condemn political violence. “What happened to President Trump was reprehensible and should be unequivocally denounced,” said Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens). “People are getting tired of the vitriol coming from both sides, and I think the mayor recognizes that,” added Councilwoman Joann Ariola (R-Queens). A City Hall rep confirmed the letter was part of a promise toward unity made by Adams over the weekend. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people had signed on to it. Adams stood with faith and political leaders on Sunday in the wake of the shooting at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally that wounded the 2024 Republican presidential nominee to condemn the violence. “We have watched our children [be] radicalized to a place to be anti-everything,” he said at the time. “The extremes have basically hijacked what we feel as a country and what we stand for. A sniper, revealed later to be Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, had managed to climb onto the roof of a manufacturing plant 130 yards away from where Trump was speaking and opened fire on the Republican nominee. Trump revealed exclusively to the Post on Sunday that he was “supposed to be dead.”","summary":"“We must say enough. Enough violent political rhetoric.

Josh Green, a sign that his campaign is forging ahead despite continued calls for the president to bow out of the 2024 race. The fundraiser on July 29 will be at the home of a family friend on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, Green told The Associated Press Friday. It will feature the longtime late-night host, plus Biden and first lady Jill Biden. The campaign has at least 10 other fundraising events over the last 10 days of July. Letterman helmed CBS’ “Late Show” for 22 seasons. The event comes as other celebrities like George Clooney, director Rob Reiner and Stephen King have called on Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. There’s also been growing concern over continued fundraising support after anxious donors expressed serious worries about his performance and the future of the party. Biden insists he is the best person to beat Donald Trump and is not stepping away. On Friday, Biden, who is recovering from COVID-19 at his Rehoboth Beach home, called for party unity and sought to shift the focus back to Donald Trump’s agenda. He said he was looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to challenge the Republican’s claims, “while making the case for my own record and the vision that I have for America: one where we save our democracy, protect our rights and freedoms, and create opportunity for everyone.” “The stakes are high, and the choice is clear,” he said. “Together, we will win.” Green is hosting the event as a growing number of lawmakers have expressed doubts over Biden’s candidacy. A person familiar with the plans initially told the AP the fundraiser would be at Green’s home, but Green later clarified that it belonged to a family friend. Green has known the Biden family for years — his wife’s uncle was Biden’s college roommate — and he said the decision whether or not to leave the race has to come from Biden himself. Green told the AP, “We support the President, the V.P. and the Democratic Party, in good and tough times because he has been there for us as a family and a state.” Green has been governor of Hawaii since 2022, managing the state through the devastating wildfires last summer.

As she introduced her husband and gave a shout out to her Indian immigrant parents, she faced a mostly white crowd gripping signs that demanded “Mass Deportations Now.” It is not that I think the accomplished Yale educated lawyer turned up in Milwaukee against her will to lovingly gaze at her “meat and potatoes kind of guy,” Ohio Sentaor JD Vance, and gush about his willingness to adapt to her vegetarian diet. Chilukuri Vance knows what she signed up for. She has been along for the ride as Vance, once a staunch “never-Trump guy,” went from disparaging the 45th president as “America’s Hitler” to exalting him as the country’s “last best hope to restore what, if lost, may never be found again.” But I have been wondering if Chilukuri Vance, a former registered Democrat, underwent the five stages of grief before embracing her doting wife schtick in MAGA land, which is crawling with bigots triggered by her Brown skin. Vance, Donald Trump’s newly anointed running mate, can’t possibly be a “defender of white identity,” with a wife of South Asian descent and biracial children, Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who was raised in La Grange Park, lamented on his podcast. “He’s not one of us,” far-right wing commentator Stew Peters posted on X about the “Hillbilly Elegy” author. Some Trump supporters have distanced themselves from such vile rhetoric, but let’s be real. They, like many Americans, prefer their elected leaders and their spouses to come in the old Crayola “flesh” crayon color. Just last May, conservative pundit Ann Coulter told her fanboy Vivek Ramaswamy that even though he was the GOP primary candidate she agreed with the most, she still would have not voted for him for president because “you’re Indian.” Ramaswamy is what many call a chamcha — literally a “spoon” in Hindi/Urdu but also a term used to describe a pathetic hanger-on So in true chamcha fashion, instead of standing up for himself, Ramaswamy praised Coulter for having “guts to speak her mind.” I gather many in Trump’s base count on people like Chilukuri Vance, Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley to back the party’s exclusionary policies while staying in their lane, languishing in their desi sunken place. Many Trumpsters are clearly worried that Chilukuri Vance’s Indian heritage and her Hindu faith has turned her husband into a “woke” zombie ready to devour his white Christian brethren. But they can relax. Interracial relationships don’t necessarily make people less racist, according to a recent study by sociology professors at Rice and Texas A&M universities. Jenifer L. Bratter, a co-author of the 2023 academic paper, didn’t touch on the Vances’ union specifically but said the research “shows broadly that interracial relationships do not end discriminatory tendencies, even among individuals who are in these romantic partnerships.” People can still date or marry someone while clinging to stereotypes and their “desires to enter interracial relationships sometimes can be motivated by assumptions about groups - including preferences that are driven by a group’s exoticism, for example,” said Bratter, who teaches at Rice. Vance, in his speech last Wednesday, did praise his Indian immigrant in-laws as “incredible” people who have “genuinely enriched this country.” But he did so minutes after slamming “millions of illegal aliens” for taking jobs and affordable housing away from American citizens. Vance is obviously comfortable maligning other people of color and marginalized communities when duty calls. Whatever goodwill and tolerance Vance possesses, he is ready to scrub them away like his 2016 Tweet that read, “Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us.” God must have had a change of heart. I wouldn’t want to trade places with Chilukuri Vance and be married to MAGA. But on a lighter note, I do envy her just a little, because my husband, who also happens to white but is far from right-wing, hasn’t yet learned how to whip up an Indian meal like Vance has. To be fair, even if Mick wouldn’t know what to do with the garam masala in our pantry, he did implement a no-outdoor shoes policy inside the house well before we met and enjoys mangoes, daal and shehnai wedding music more than I do. And as the vegetarian in our relationship who occasionally force-feeds me kale and broccoli, he does deal with my carnivorous side. I am a lot more open to leafy greens than I was before, but I’m not switching up a steak dinner. Rummana Hussain is a columnist and member of the Sun-Times Editorial Board.

Former President Donald Trump spoke about the July 13 assassination attempt on him in a speech that delegates said showed his humanity. “This is the most regenerating feeling,” said delegate Peter Kopsaftis, Barrington Township Republican committeeman after Trump’s acceptance speech Thursday. “We all have to work for one common goal — the American dream.” Joliet resident and at-large delegate Jay Bergman said there was an “overwhelming enthusiasm and optimism” on the convention floor noting many believed Trump was divinely protected during the shooting. “I have the feeling that the presidency is Trump’s to lose,” Bergman said. The main criticism from some Republicans? The 93-minute speech went too long. “Sixty minutes would’ve been enough,” Bergman said. Trump’s speech appealed to working-class families concerned about the increasing cost of living, delegates added. “The speech was really about the future and providing hope for people,” delegate and former Aurora alderman Rick Lawrence said. Delegate Joe Folisi said he found Trump’s presentation was subdued. “It wasn’t like a rally speech,” said Folisi, a Schaumburg Township Republican committeeman. “I think the shooting really changed it. He really moved the country forward. He did a great job.” The convention also highlighted the party’s efforts to reach out to a wider variety of voters, some delegates said. “I really liked … the way (Trump) and the convention appealed to so many different parts of America, so many different people from all these different walks of life,” outgoing Illinois GOP Chair Don Tracy said Friday. Tracy and others noted the platform’s revised stance on abortion — switching from an all-out ban to saying abortion laws should be left to the states — could help in suburban areas that have, in recent years, favored Democratic candidates. “The platform lays out the Trump agenda in a way that is more well-received in the suburbs,” Tracy said. “And if Trump does better in the suburbs that bodes well for down-ballot races.” Trump’s speech Thursday also offered a stark contrast to President Joe Biden and a Democratic Party struggling to figure out a path to victory in November, delegates said. “This is a well-organized, effective campaign that’s disciplined and on message,” said Richard Porter, a Winnetka resident and Illinois Republican national committeeman. Others agreed. “At this point in time in this country we need an individual that has the ability and is serious about addressing the problems that we face,” Lawrence said.","summary":"Suburban GOP delegates on Friday headed back home from the Republican National Convention, saying they felt energized and hopeful for the November election.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240719/news/suburban-republicans-leave-convention-energized-and-hopeful-for-november/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b400f297-2c84-5d4f-8a61-9d4b8fb801db&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:11:33","author":"Alicia Fabbre","authors":["Alicia Fabbre"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.134},{"id":252193826,"title":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knocks Democratic colleagues for privately raising concerns about Biden: ‘That’s Bulls–t!’","text":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) gave an impassioned defense Thursday of President Biden’s electoral prospects against former President Donald Trump — slamming Democratic lawmakers for privately raising concerns about his candidacy and accusing them of underestimating him. “What I see right now, and I want you all to know, is that over the last several weeks, there have been lots of Democrats who have been giving little anonymous quotes to the press,” the New York Democrat said in a nearly one hour-long Instagram Live post. “I’m not here to knock the press on it, I’m here to knock my colleagues on it. Because to me, I think that’s and I’m sorry — I’m going to say it because it’s after midnight — that’s bulls–t,” Ocasio-Cortez argued. She clarified that her frustration wasn’t with those “who have made a public statement and put their name on it.” “I’m talking about people who are too scared to say what they want to say in public, but somehow not afraid to say what they want to say to a journalist so long as they promise not to use their name,” she said. “That’s a bunch of horsesh*t!” she fumed. The 14th District representative went on to defend keeping Biden, 81, at the top of the Democratic ticket despite his disastrous debate performance against Trump, 78, floundering polling numbers and apparent mental decline. “People underestimate Biden’s performance. I think that is how he became president, is through a lot of people underestimating his performance with demographics that are not traditionally valued,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I think that people see where he’s weak. They don’t often see where he’s strong and just electorally, purely electorally.” “Joe Biden kind of like stomps with older people, like electorally, which is one of the strongest and most consistent electorates, and it’s actually a hard electorate for Democrats to win,” she explained. “You know, those are not people that are on Twitter, but they vote more consistently than almost any other bracket.” The congresswoman also suggested that Republicans could raise legal challenges related to ballot access if Biden were to be replaced so late in the process. Ocasio-Cortez further warned that Democrats are unlikely to unite around Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to drop out of the race. “If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that Kamala, that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,” she said. “A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.” “I’m here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, and a huge amount of these elites, and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee, also are not interested in seeing the vice president being the nominee,” the congresswoman claimed. “Will they win out on that? I don’t know. But I am here to tell you, do not take that for granted,” Ocasio-Cortez added. Three Democratic senators and more than two dozen House Democrats have called on Biden to end his re-election bid.","summary":"Ocasio-Cortez warned that Democrats are unlikely to unite around Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden were to drop out of the race. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/19/us-news/aoc-knocks-democratic-colleagues-for-privately-raising-concerns-about-biden-thats-bulls-t/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/85719717.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BVj7NClu-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:10:28","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":252195204,"title":"Usha Vance, wife of vice presidential nominee JD Vance, has roots in San Diego","text":"More than two decades ago, Usha Chilukuri was a driven student in suburban San Diego, a teen who played in the marching band at Mt. Carmel High School and competed in the school’s Jeopardy-style trivia club. A child of academics, she would head first to Yale then to Cambridge — the proving grounds that led to prestigious spots clerking for then-federal appellate Judge Brett Kavanaugh and later for U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. She became a high-powered lawyer, but not a public figure. Not until now. Last Wednesday, Usha Chilukuri Vance stepped onto a national stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to introduce her husband, vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance. She spoke about her San Diego roots, smiling wide at the spontaneous applause when she mentioned the city’s name. Her upbringing in the community of Rancho Peñasquitos was thousands of miles away, and a far cry from her husband’s challenged childhood in a small Appalachian town. She highlighted that difference during her roughly five-minute speech, noting how her husband was raised by his grandmother in one of the nation’s poorest counties and endured “childhood traumas that I could barely understand,” she said — a life story he famously cataloged in “Hillbilly Elegy,” the book that helped shoot him to stardom. “It’s hard to imagine a more powerful example of the American dream,” she said in her speech. “A boy from Middletown, Ohio, raised by his grandmother through tough times, chosen to lead our country through some of its greatest challenges.” JD Vance, a former Marine, has been a growing presence in politics, becoming one of Ohio’s two senators in 2022, propelled by an endorsement from former President Donald Trump — a figure Vance had previously criticized. The country is just getting to know his wife of 10 years. On stage, Usha Vance explained that she grew up in “a middle-class community” and “with two loving parents, both immigrants from India, and a wonderful sister.” Both of Usha’s parents hold prominent positions in San Diego’s academic world. Her mother, Lakshmi Chilukuri, is provost of Sixth College at UC San Diego and a professor of biology. Her father, Krish Chilukuri, is an aerospace engineer and a lecturer at San Diego State University. Friends who went to Mt. Carmel High School with Vance described her in media reports as a “bookworm.” The 2004 graduate played the flute in the school marching band and had a competitive streak. When she was a 17-year-old member of Academic League, a Jeopardy-style trivia program at the school, she told the Union-Tribune, “It’s not enough to know the answers, you have to do it fast.” It likely surprised few when she was accepted to Yale, where she earned a bachelor’s in history. She earned a master’s degree from the University of Cambridge as a Gates Cambridge Scholar — a tough scholarship to get. Last year, just 1.2 percent of applicants were selected. Usha wouldn’t meet her husband until both became Yale Law School students. She said during her convention speech that the two started as friends. “Who wouldn’t want to be friends with JD?” she told the crowd. “He was then, as now, the most interesting person I knew.” Usha said the way JD approached their many differences — with curiosity and enthusiasm — was a testament to who he was as a person. Despite being a “meat and potatoes kind of guy” he adapted to his future wife’s vegetarian diet and learned to cook Indian food for her mother, she said. “That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country,” she said. From the beginning, JD has been effusive over the impact Usha has had on him. “She seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive quality a human being should have: bright, hardworking, tall, and beautiful,” he wrote in his memoir. “I joked with a buddy that if she had possessed a terrible personality, she would have made an excellent heroine in an Ayn Rand novel, but she had a great sense of humor and an extraordinarily direct way of speaking.” The two were wed in 2014. While her husband penned “Hillbilly Elegy” and practiced law in Washington, Usha pursued federal clerkships, first in the Eastern District of Kentucky, and then in the prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where she clerked for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh before he was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2015, the Vances moved to San Francisco. Usha began her law career as an associate at Munder, Tolles & Olsen, while her husband went to work at Mithril Capital, an investment firm. A few years later, Usha clerked for Chief Justice John G. Roberts on the Supreme Court. According to the New York Times, her colleagues were just as impressed with her intelligence as they were with her dedication to family. “It was clear that her family was immensely important to her,” fellow Supreme Court clerk Sean Mirski told the newspaper. The couple now lives in Cincinnati with their three children. In 2020, Usha joined the board of directors of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra but has largely avoided the political limelight. That stands to change as the race for president intensifies. Should Trump be elected to a second term, securing Vance’s position as vice president, Usha would become the first woman of Indian descent to serve as second lady.

His performance left many voters disconcerted with the Democratic presidential nominee and led to a new and more intense call among some voters and leaders in his own party to reconsider his candidacy. Biden’s fitness for office was again questioned when the White House announced that the President — the oldest in American history — contracted COVID-19 for at least the second time and would need to take time off the campaign trail to self-isolate at his home in Delaware. While many are questioning whether the President is vital enough to compete in the election or govern the country for another two years, his rival has been promoting an image of vitality and strength in contrast. Even after the former President survived a shocking assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, the felon went on days later to clinch the Republican presidential nomination and deliver an energetic speech to thousands of viewers — in stark contrast to many people’s image of Biden. The number of Democrats who have publically called for the President to call it quits before the Democratic National Convention in early August has continued to grow in the weeks since the televised debate. Senator Adam Schiff of California, well known for his role in the hearings that led to Trump’s first impeachment in 2019, may be the highest-profile Democrat to call for the President to drop out of the race yet. Rumors that President Barack Obama and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have encouraged Biden to step down have also been reported. At least 20 party leaders have publically asked the President to step aside at the time of writing. But Biden has repeatedly stated that he has no intention of giving up the Democratic nomination — unless a couple of unlikely circumstances occur. The President has publically acknowledged four different reasons he could be convinced to not seek another term in the White House, according to Fortune. DIVINE INTERVENTION He first admitted that there was at least one situation that could drive him off November’s ticket during an interview on ABC News a few days after the first debate. Biden initially doubled down on his intention to stay in the race before admitting to a special case that could change his mind. “I have convinced myself of two things,” Biden said. “I’m the most qualified person to beat him, and I know how to get things done.” “If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?” journalist George Stephanopoulos countered. “It depends,” Biden responded. “I mean, if the Lord Almighty comes out and tells me that, I might do that.” UNBEATABLE NUMBERS Beyond a sign from above, Biden offered another reason why he might be willing to step aside during a news conference for last week’s NATO summit in Washington. After refuting multiple questions about hypothetical scenarios that could lead to him leaving the White House, Biden offered a new situation. He would not withdraw “unless [pollsters] came back and said, ‘There’s no way you can win,” he said. Biden was then asked specifically what he would do if Vice President Kamala Harris were to begin polling significantly better than him. “No one is saying that. No poll says that,” he replied defiantly. A TRAGIC ACCIDENT During an interview on a Detroit radio station last week, the President admitted to another scenario that could see him forgo the party nomination. “We will 1,000% — in your words — see you on the ballot this November?” host Speedy Morman asked Trump. “Unless I get hit by a train, yeah,” Biden responded with a tinge of irony. “Let’s hope that doesn’t happen, for your safety’s concern,” the host replied. UNKNOWN MEDICAL PROBLEMS Most recently, the President pointed out another and less hypothetical situation that could push him out of the Oval Office. He shared the possibility in a yet-to-be-aired interview with BET journalist Ed Gordon earlier this week. The President might drop out “if I had some medical condition that emerged,” Biden told Gordon. “If doctors came to me and said, ‘You got this problem, that problem.’” UNKNOWN TERRITORY Those urging Biden to step aside are hoping that the President will make the decision before the Democratic National Convention, gearing up to begin on August 19. A presidential candidate for one of the major political parties has not dropped out of the race so late in election season in recent American history. Because of the unprecedented situation, it is hard to tell what will happen if Biden calls it quits. The only certainty is that the processes of replacing Biden on the ticket would be markedly different before he is officially nominated at the DNC and after. If he opts out before the DNC delegates cast their votes in a virtual roll call scheduled for early August, the delegates could cast their ballots for another candidate until a single winner receives a majority. If Biden were to resign, die, or become incapacitated after the DNC concludes on August 22, the path forward is much murkier. The Democratic National Committee chair, Jaime Harrison, would be tasked with negotiating with top congressional Democrats and the Democratic Governors Association to find a replacement, according to CNBC. Harrison would then deliver the group’s pick to the Committee, which could officially fill the vacancy, per party rules.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Joe Biden has repeatedly declared his intention to compete in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Potential Reasons for Biden to Withdraw from 2024 Presidential Race and the Outcome first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/potential-reasons-for-biden-to-withdraw-from-2024-presidential-race-and-the-outcome/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Four-reasons-Biden-would-use-to-drop-out-of-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:08:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":252193780,"title":"Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Senator, suggests Biden should not run for the 2024 election","text":"Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio called on President Joe Biden to end his re-election campaign Friday, becoming the fourth Democrat in the chamber to ask Biden to drop out of the race. “Over the last few weeks, I’ve heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban,” Brown said in a written statement shared first with NBC News. “These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them.” “I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me,” Brown added. “At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign.” Brown’s call follows one Thursday from Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who, like Brown, faces a tough re-election campaign this fall, and another Friday from Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., urged Biden to withdraw from the race last week. More than 30 congressional Democrats now want someone other than Biden to be their party’s presidential nominee. The push for Biden to exit comes after a debate performance with Trump last month that raised alarms about the president’s age and health — and about his ability to lead the Democratic ticket this fall. The push has intensified in recent days, with speculation increasing about Vice President Kamala Harris and others stepping in for Biden. Brown, according to his campaign, will not weigh in on the process to choose a new Democratic nominee and believes Biden should serve the rest of his term. The three-term Ohio senator had previously said that voters in his state, which former President Donald Trump twice won by 8 percentage points, had “legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign” and that he intended to listen to their concerns. But he had stopped short of calling for Biden to end his re-election bid. Brown’s Trump-endorsed Republican opponent, businessman Bernie Moreno, has been linking him closely to Biden’s struggles for weeks. “Sherrod and Joe have been friends and political allies for many years,” said Moreno in a campaign statement earlier this month, “so does anyone truly believe that Sherrod wasn’t fully aware of Biden’s decline long before his disastrous debate performance?”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSen.

Josh Schriver drafting bill to give Trump ‘unlimited’ protection resources in Michigan after shooting","text":"LANSING, Mich. — Michigan Republican state Rep. Josh Schriver is writing a bill that would provide “unlimited” protection resources to former president Donald Trump whenever he visits the state. The announcement came just four days after Trump was nearly assassinated at July 13 campaign event in Butler, Pa. “In light of the left-wing assassination attempt on former President Trump’s life, I’m currently drafting a policy for Michigan to provide the presumptive next president of the United States unlimited law enforcement resources toward his protection every time he visits Michigan between now and his inauguration,” Schriver tweeted. Schriver feels the shooting in Pennsylvania was a security “disaster,” with a lack of resources contributing to the consequences. “A nation as great as America deserves nothing but the best security for her prospective president,” Schriver told The Post. “This bill not only beefs up law enforcement to secure the prospective president, it also acts as a crystal clear PSA to aspiring terrorists and individuals who recklessly give orders for political violence, like that guy in the band Tenacious D. An assassination attempt like July 13 will never come close to happening ever again. Michigan won’t allow it.” Schriver said “unlimited” in this case means “whatever is necessary”: “Anything less is an obvious national-security risk.” The 31-year-old legislator told The Post he sees toxic political rhetoric, particularly from Democrats, as a serious threat to public safety. “There have been countless calls for political violence from the left wing, specifically against Trump,” he said. “Numerous examples of the left’s recklessly violent rhetoric against Trump can be easily found over the past eight years.” Sources in the Michigan statehouse, which is on recess, confirmed the earliest Schriver could drop off his bill for consideration is July 30, when the chamber reconvenes briefly. Democrats control both Michigan’s House and Senate, but Schriver said his bill “should pass if we care about national security.” He expects to see similar measures rapidly adopted in other states across the country.

Trump’s account of the attempt on his life one week ago was honest, poignant and unforgettable. His successful efforts at unifying his party and his promise to unify the country reverberated far beyond the Milwaukee convention center. Just a few hours earlier another contender for the Presidency was addressing another hall full of supporters. With Joe Biden absent due to COVID, and almost certain to be about to be pushed out of the race by his own demoralized party, Kamala Harris is stepping things up a notch. On Thursday afternoon she addressed supporters at Westover High School in North Carolina. Never mind the world watching — it’s not clear that all the people at Westover High school were watching. So how did she do? In a word: terribly. From the moment she bounded onto the stage Harris reminded people of why this November’s election is Trump’s for the losing. First came the fake-hysteria of finding herself on a stage in front of all these people. The almost-hyperventilating note Kamala hits when she wants to sound as if she is really excited about something. She started by saying how great it was to be “with so many incredible leaders” in Fayetville. Her smile was so broad you worried her face would run out of space. She thanked the nation’s servicemen and their families. “I know their families serve with equal dedication,” she said, “and I thank you also.” This last part was done in the vocal register you might employ if addressing a nursery school. Next she chose to patronize Donald Trump´s running-mate, JD Vance. She described his personal life story (related the night before at the Republican convention) as “compelling.” And good for JD Vance for living a life that has caught the interest of the great Kamala. She went on to insist that the thing that was interesting about Vance was not what he had talked about but what he had not talked about. She went on to say that it was interesting that Vance had not talked about “Project 2025.” For anyone who does not get Democratic Party briefing notes, Project 2025 is a project of a conservative think-tank in Washington. In recent weeks the Democrats in Congress and Senate and on the Presidential ticket seem to have decided that Project 2025 is to be this year’s bogey-man. Kamala shook her head as she warned that it is “a 900-page blueprint.” This alone elicited boos from some of the audience. Presumably from people who just hate 900-page blueprints. The Democrats currently seem to imagine that if they just say “Project 2025” everyone will recoil in fear. In fact the project already joins a long list of conservative projects which are famous only on the political left. The Democrats hope that saying the words will have the same effect as saying “Voldemort” to a child at Hogwarts. Soon Kamala was saying “Here’s the thing.” Which is always a prelude to her missing the point. “If you claim to stand for unity you need to do more than just use the word.” She said this with a huge, knowing smirk on her face. It was the smirk of someone who seems to believe that they are in the process of dissing something to death. In fact I doubt whether anyone beyond Kamala and her speech-writers think that line is a zinger. And then came one of those strange accent-shifts. Lots of people shift their speaking style to adapt to their audiences. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sometimes pretends she is black. Hillary Clinton sometimes used to pretend she had been raised in the south. And Joe Biden sometimes tries to pretend he hasn’t forgotten what he was saying. But even in such company Kamala’s voice-shifts are bizarre. After attacking Trump and Vance’s calls for unity she suddenly burst out with an attack of Southern: “We too busy watchin’ what you doin’ to hear what you’re sayin’,” she said. Truly the cringe was great with this one. For her part Kamala looked like she thought her southern-voice had gone down a storm in North Carolina. If she does make it to the presidency in November then I will await with keen interest her first world tour. Will she put on a French accent in France? Or a Chinese accent in China? I can’t wait to see what she does in Africa. The speech built to what could have been a climax when she said that her Republican opponents would take away all the money and rights of the people in North Carolina. By contrast she and Joe had stood up to “Big pharma, the big banks and big corporations.” She might as well have added “And Bigfoot.” What is more they had canceled debt, “including student loan debt.” As a whoop went up she once again forgot where she was. As if she was a southern preacher she suddenly said, “Testify if you have received it.” A few lesbian dance majors in the audience promptly hollered with gratitude. “Trump wants to roll back our progress,” she insisted. Once again hitting that Democrat note so memorably hit by George Clooney. Then “Check this out” she said, unpromisingly. The Republican party has recently held fundraisers “with big oil lobbyists.” “Ultimately,” she concluded, “in this election we each face a question. The question we face is what kind of country do we want to live in. Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate.” Most of the crowd signaled that they were more in favor of freedom than hate and preferred compassion to chaos.

Jeff Keicher that he might assassinate him for holding an event at a public school. Forrest R. Brandon, 58, of the 600 block of North 9th Street, DeKalb, was arrested Friday on charges of threatening a public official. Police reported he left a phone message at Keicher’s office Monday night, saying he wanted to know what was “going on with you hosting a partisan event at a public high school.” “Maybe I might assassinate you. I may. Not saying I will. Just saying I may,” a DeKalb County court document states. He also added an expletive about Republicans. “It was definitely something that you don’t expect to receive and listen to,” said Keicher of Sycamore. “When you hear the tone in the voice, and two days after former President Donald Trump was shot, it is a little chilling.” The event in question was a popular, long-standing Senior Health Fare offering information about state services as well as medical and dental care and veterans’ needs. Keicher and other organizers canceled the fair, which had been set for Thursday at DeKalb High School, but will reschedule it. “It’s my sincerest hope that in hearing about this incident, we are able to dial down the rhetoric in the current political season,” he said. He added that he was “very impressed and thankful for the response of the Illinois State Police and the city of DeKalb Police Department.” According to court records, Brandon, who identified himself as an U.S. Air Force veteran, told police he never intended to carry out the threat and was “angry” and “confused” at the time. As of Friday, Brandon was in DeKalb County Jail and could not be reached for comment. A bond hearing is set for Saturday, officials said.","summary":"State lawmaker gets assassination warning just days after attempt on former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20240719/crime/arrest-made-in-threat-to-assassinate-gop-state-lawmaker-senior-fair-postponed-as-a-result/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=97E168F5-DBA4-41CB-B83B-CE228FD0E825&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 23:01:50","author":"Marni Pyke","authors":["Marni Pyke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":252193648,"title":"Letters: EV charging | Artificial turf","text":"Harden state’s homes against fire danger Re: “Newsom sounds alarm on fires” (Page A1, July 11).

Kelly didn’t hold back when bringing up “The View” hosts’ comments on Trump’s mindset following the July 13 shooting. “There’s no question Trump had religious thought and the belief in God repeated to him and introduced into his life repeatedly when he was in his formative years — I don’t know exactly what his religious commitment is,” she said on Friday’s “The Megyn Kelly Show” podcast. “Then you get this little lecture from — forgive me — those b–ches over at ‘The View.’ He almost died, like five days ago.” The show then played a clip from “The View” where cohost Behar claimed that thinking God was “watching” Trump was “unchristian.” “I’m a Christian girl,” Behar began. “When something like this happens to you — like this assassination attempt — and you say something like ‘God was watching me,’ that is a very unchristian thing to say. It’s very narcissistic.” Kelly called Behar’s view of the incident “warped” by her desire to see Biden win the election over Trump. “She doesn’t get it at all. It’s not, ‘God cared about Trump but not Corey Comperatore,’” Kelly explained. “I think most Christians believe God had other plans for Corey. God called Corey home and had a different mission for him. And those of us who are left behind to grieve the one we love, struggle with that and feel sadness over that and wish you were different. Sometimes it does cause you to question your faith and your beliefs. But most of us get to the place where we reconcile it and we as mere mortals don’t understand the plans.” “We don’t think it’s narcissistic to say ‘thank you God for saving me — I believe I, too, am part of your plan,’” Kelly said. “It’s so warped the way she thinks about this issue.” Kelly continued, “They’re so blinded by their hatred for Trump, and their need for Biden to beat him, that every piece of information is processed through that lens, and therefore truth is totally erased in their zeal to get others to see how bad Trump is — He’s ‘godless,’ right? And Biden is the Second Coming, on the other hand.” Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination Thursday night as the Republic National Convention came to its climax and conclusion.

Bernie Sanders went on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” early Friday to talk about the disastrously boring Republican National Convention. “I’ll tell you what nobody else will tell you,” Sanders told the host. “Why not? It's two in the morning, who's listening anyhow?” While Sanders was indeed funny, he was also dead serious about how important the choice in November is for all working Americans. When it came to Donald Trump’s tortuously long speech, Sanders said, \"You know what stuns me about these things, Stephen, is how little the real problems of the country are discussed, and how few real solutions are given.” “Basically, what the speech was ‘The country is in terrible shape. Vote for me. And I'm going to bring wonderful things to all of you. You don't know how, why, I'm going to do it. Just trust me.\" Sanders went on to say that the GOP’s catastrophic climate change denialism alone should disqualify anyone voting for their candidates—one in particular. \"Nobody in America should be voting for Trump,” the two-time presidential candidate declared, noting that Trump and the Republican Party’s number one policy is cutting taxes for the wealthiest billionaires. Everyone else is screwed. “90% of Republicans want to cut Social Security in one way or another,” Sanders pointed out. “So anyone who has any illusion that Republicans will do anything to benefit the working class of this country is sorely mistaken.\" Colbert asked Sanders his thoughts on the world's most expensive mid-life crisis—Elon Musk promising to pour about $180 million into Republican campaign coffers. \"In a sense, we should thank Musk for making this issue so obvious,” Sanders said. “What we have in America now is a corrupt political system. That's all. We do not really live in a democracy. You live in a semi-democracy. You have the right to vote. But a billionaire out there has the right to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to further his or her aims. And what Musk has done, and other billionaires are doing, is falling into line behind Trump because they know they're going to get massive tax breaks.\" Sanders has shown his support for President Joe Biden during the chaos following the latter’s terrible debate showing on June 27. The senator also wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on Saturday, insisting that Biden was the best candidate to face Trump in November. He reiterated that support to Colbert. “Let me be very clear as to why I support the president. Because I think of all of the candidates out there, I am more than aware of the disastrous debate that he had, and the problems that he has. But I am also aware that he has been the strongest, most progressive president in my lifetime. He is the first president in American history to stand with workers on a picket line. He has taken on pharma and lowered the cost of prescription drugs. We are now rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We've put more money into climate change than any time in the history of this country. Five million Americans have gotten student debt relief, and that's for a start.\" True. True. True. True. But maybe most importantly was Sanders’ final message—the reason why we must keep getting out the vote. “Over the last many decades, Stephen, we should be proud as a nation. We have come a long way in erasing bigotry for our African American brothers and sisters. We've come a long way in fighting sexism and fighting homophobia. Now our job is the economic struggle and to tell the billionaire class, and their greed, they can no longer think they're going to get it all. This country belongs to all of us.\" Regardless of whether Biden stays in the race, the message Sanders delivered applies: \"Nobody in America should be voting for Trump.\" And it’s one we should all amplify.

The 76-year-old US presidential candidate was injured in the ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday. However, it was the remembrance service for 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, who reportedly \"died trying to protect his family\", where Billy, 62, sang the classic hymn 'Amazing Grace' on Friday (19.07. 24). A source told People: \"Corey Comperatore is an Army reservist veteran and former firefighter chief. [Cyrus] BRC has always been passionate about honouring troops and first responders.

He said: \"Tragically the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore, unbelievable person, everybody tells me.

As you know, I have been skeptical of most reporting on the subject. But last week forced me to reconsider that skepticism. That’s when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Joe Biden needs to make a decision. She said this after he had already made it. Since then, she and other big-wheel Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, have argued to Biden that if he stays in the running, he risks bringing down congressional Democrats down the ballot, in addition to paving the way for Donald Trump’s victory. This morning came with the most explicit suggestion yet that Biden is thinking about dropping out. The Post, along with others, reported that Pelosi has told some House Democrats “she believes President Biden can be persuaded fairly soon to exit the presidential race amid serious doubts he can win in November.” “She thinks Biden is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid,” the Post reported. Pelosi is the 21st century’s greatest House speaker. Her clout among Democrats, not just in the US Congress, is pretty much unlimited. If she’s letting it be known that she thinks Biden “can be persuaded fairly soon” to exit or that he “is getting close to deciding to abandon his presidential bid,” it’s probably true. It would be foolish to doubt it. Will it happen? Jesus God, I hope not. Biden is still the best hope of defeating Trump and preventing an authoritarian takeover of the United States government. He’s the incumbent. His achievements are many and great. Social and economic indicators, like crime rates, which are down, and wages, which are up, are moving in the right direction. He has the backing of his party. (Yes, even those, like California Congressman Adam Schiff, who have called on him to drop out.) And the anti-maga majority is still out there for the taking. His campaign continues to say he’s in it to win it, and to God’s hoary ear, I hope that’s correct. But until the convention, I think we should think about how Pelosi and others have been making their case. We know why. The how is just as important, though. The likelihood of victory for Donald Trump will skyrocket the moment the Democratic incumbent leaves, if he leaves. The debate was a disaster. Lots of people recoiled in horror at the sight of an old man on stage. But the stakes are too high. If he leaves, it better be for reasons beyond vibes. Here, the Post’s report is helpful. It said Pelosi gathered evidence to support the contention that the president should leave. In talks with Democratic congresspeople, Pelosi was shown private polling data about their races. This “informed Pelosi’s thinking as she maneuvers through the sensitive discussions with Biden and his inner circle.” Pelosi then used that evidence to challenge Biden. In a recent discussion with the president, according to the Post and other news outlets, “Pelosi rejected the president’s assertion that he was doing fine in the polls. She asked him to bring a senior adviser into the talk so they could compare in detail their divergent internal polling.” A word about polling. First, private polling is better than public polling. The former is high-quality, expensive and necessary for making campaign decisions. The latter is what you and I have access to by reading the news. Second, public polling about the presidential election has been “in the ballpark” of private polling commissioned by Biden’s reelection campaign, according to Ron Klain, a close advisor. It may seem like Pelosi is making a convincing data-driven case to drop out. But that’s not as convincing as it seems. If public polling is “in the ballpark” of being right, that means Biden is probably one polling error away from winning, according to The Economist’s data editor. When Biden said he’s doing fine in the polls, that’s not denial. Despite a disastrous debate, despite endless myopia from the press corps, despite slippage among Democrats, the election is still a dead heat. You can say Biden should step aside because polls are showing he should. But polls are not monolithic. You can find one to support pretty much whatever argument you want. So the question isn’t whether Pelosi is making a data-driven case. It’s what data she’s using to make it. Given the enormity of the stakes, I don’t think it’s enough for even the 21st century’s greatest House speaker to say, “trust me. It’s real bad.” If you’re going to ask the most transformational president of our lifetimes to step aside, base it on something more than a guess. I’m not the first to say that if the damage from the disaster debate is as terrible as Biden’s critics say it is, there would be internal campaign polling that would tell us exactly that – and that someone somewhere would leak it when the time was right. But if Ron Klain is correct in saying that public polling and private polling are “in the ballpark” of each other, that’s why we haven’t seen leaks from anyone anywhere. Polling data, as close to sacred as anything in politics, isn’t showing a clear picture of what to do. You can say Biden should stay the course or you could say he should exit. That’s why we will probably never see it. We will hear about it, as we did in the Post report. But ultimately, if Biden leaves, it will not be for reasons beyond vibes. It will be vibes.","summary":"It pains me to say it looks like the president is thinking about dropping out of the race. As you know, I have been skeptical of most reporting on the subject.

Immigrant advocates kept the issue alive this week by filing notice to the state Supreme Court that they will appeal the judge’s ruling. A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on July 12 rejected an effort by the advocates to keep the proposed initiative off the ballot. The advocates argue that the measure breaks the rules because it deals with more than a single subject. Attorney Andy Gaona, who represents some of the groups, said Friday he was working on legal briefs in the cased that were due later in the day. The Legislature will have until July 26 to respond, he said. “We do think that single subject provision was violated,” Gaona said. “We hope that the court agrees.” Supporters of the initiative argue that it deals with a single subject: the border. The GOP-controlled Legislative in early June voted to allow to proposal to be placed on the ballot, asking voters if local law enforcement should be allowed to arrest migrants who cross illegally from Mexico into Arizona between ports of entry. The measure would also give state judges the power to order people convicted of the offense to return to their countries of origin. It is similar to a Texas law that has been put on hold by a federal appeals court while it is being challenged. Unlike the Texas law, Arizona’s proposal would also make it a felony punishable by 10 years of imprisonment for selling fentanyl that leads to a person’s death. Also included is a requirement that some government agencies use a federal database to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility for benefits. The Republican-backed proposal bypasses Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who had vetoed a similar measure in early March and has denounced the effort to bring the issue to voters. Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to ensure security along the state’s southern border, and that Arizona voters should be given the opportunity to decide the issue themselves. Opponents say the legislation would lead to racial profiling and create several millions of dollars in additional policing costs that Arizona cities, counties and the state can ill afford. The measure would go before voters in a state expected to play a crucial role in determining which party controls the White House and the U.S. Senate — likely razor-close races in Arizona. Republicans hope it will focus attention on the border, which they accuse Biden of mishandling, and dilute the political benefits Democrats seek from an abortion-rights initiative. Disorder on the border is a top motivator for many Republican voters who former President Donald Trump hopes will vote in big numbers. President Joe Biden in early June unveiled plans to restrict the number of migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers in Arizona have tried to criminalize migration. When passing a much-debated 2010 immigration bill, the Arizona Legislature considered expanding the state’s trespassing law to criminalize the presence of immigrants and impose criminal penalties. But the trespassing language was removed and replaced with a requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, question people’s immigration status if they were believed to be in the country illegally. The questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court despite the racial profiling concerns of critics. But courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPHOENIX – The fight to keep a proposed border initiative off Arizona’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ongoing Legal Battle for Arizona Immigration Initiative on Nov. 5 Ballot Sparks Appeals first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/ongoing-legal-battle-for-arizona-immigration-initiative-on-nov-5-ballot-sparks-appeals/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Legal-fight-continues-with-appeals-over-proposed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:51:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":252194172,"title":"U.S. says Iran moving forward on a key aspect of developing a nuclear bomb","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories The CrowdStrike outage is affecting heath-care services in Canada.

Newsweek recently reported that in Florida, the election may start to shift in President Joe Biden's favor, who now enjoys a plurality of women voters' support in the Sunshine State. A FOX 13/Insider Advantage poll of 800 Floridians between July 15 and July 16 found that 47% of female respondents preferred Biden, while 44% preferred Trump. Trump's lead in Florida with male voters, however, remains significant: He leads Biden by a 57-38 margin among men. Still, on women on average have outpaced men in voter turnout among almost every racial demographic, meaning women could narrowly decide who wins Florida's 30 electoral votes in November. READ MORE: FL law enforcement chief sues DeSantis, says he was forced out for refusing to break the law The poll of Florida voters also found that Biden is the strongest candidate to face Trump in November. While some Democrats are pushing him to pull out of the race, the likeliest option to replace him at the top of the ticket is Vice President Kamala Harris. That poll found that Trump's slight lead over Biden with Florida voters grows to double digits if Harris is instead the nominee. Trump also regains the lead with women voters if Harris is on the ballot instead of Biden. Despite Florida having a Republican-dominated legislature, and electing far-right Republican Governor Ron DeSantis to two terms, the Sunshine State remains competitive in federal elections. In 2020, Biden won Florida's female voters over, with 51% to Trump's 48%. Trump won with male voters by a 54-45 margin, and carried the state with a three-point advantage. However, 2024 may be an even tighter race in Florida given that voters will have the opportunity to cast a ballot on abortion rights. So far, abortion rights have succeeded in every state ballot question since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision in 2022. Abortion was even a winning issue in ruby-red states like Kansas, Kentucky and Montana in the 2022 midterms, and won another major victory in Ohio last year. READ MORE: Here's why no RNC speakers are mentioning of the GOP's biggest wins of the century Should Floridians turn out in large numbers for the abortion ballot initiative, it's likely that women will lead the charge given they'll be able to have a direct say in their own reproductive rights. This could influence not only the presidential race, but also a very competitive U.S. Senate race. Rep. Debbie Murcasel-Powell (D-Florida) is within striking distance of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Florida) in the latest polls from June, trailing him by just two points last month. The GOP likely knows its weak spot with women voters when it comes to abortion rights, as no speakers at the recent Republican National Convention once mentioned abortion during the four-day event. A Pew Research survey from May additionally found that nearly two-thirds of both men and women believe the procedure should be legal in most cases. Click here to read Newsweek's full report.

The songwriter says he didn’t want it played","text":"As Donald Trump wound down his rambling 93-minute speech on Thursday night to close out the 2024 Republican National Convention, the five-piece house band launched into Sam & Dave’s 1966 hit, “Hold On, I’m Coming.” The track has become a pneumonic device of sorts for the MAGA movement, playing Trump on- or offstage at rallies in a sonic ritual his followers have come to expect. But while Trump’s base seems to deeply enjoy this bit of theater, David Porter, a 2005 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee who co-wrote “Hold On, I’m Coming” with late R&B icon, Isaac Hayes, said on Friday that he was never asked for permission to use his music and does not appreciate the ongoing association with the twice-impeached former president. “I can say [that] I don’t want any of my songs used for political campaigns,” Grammy-nominated Porter, 82, told The Independent. “Certainly including this one… We create music for uplifting people, not separating them.” Less than a week after Trump’s ear was bloodied in an assassination attempt, the GOP presidential nominee delivered the final RNC address in Milwaukee that started off striking a relatively moderate tone. A seemingly introspective Trump spoke of uniting the country, and serving all Americans rather than just his supporters. However, Trump soon went off-script, attacking the former Democratic House Speaker as “Crazy Nancy Pelosi,” mocking Joe Biden as the “worst” president in U.S. history, and serving up robust helpings of transphobic and anti-immigrant fodder the RNC delegates lapped up with glee. Trump’s well-known penchant for indulging the ugliest of impulses has led numerous artists to protest his usage of their music. Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman, John Fogerty, in 2020 served the Trump campaign with a cease-and-desist letter upon discovering the band’s “Fortunate Son” was providing a soundtrack for his public appearances. Similar objections have been lodged by, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, Neil Young, Adele, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams, R.E.M., Guns n’ Roses, Elton John, the Rolling Stones, and the estates of Tom Petty, Leonard Cohen, Prince, and Sinead O’Connor. In March, representatives for O’Connor’s estate and Chrysalis Records issued a statement expressing “outrage” upon learning that Trump had been playing her beloved performance of “Nothing Compares 2 U,” which was written by Prince, at his political rallies. \"It is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt, and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil,’” the statement said. “As the guardians of her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump and his associates desist from using her music immediately.” The laws surrounding song publishing and performance rights are complex; “willful” use over a copyright-holder’s objections can result in fines of up to $150,000 per occurrence. Shortly before Trump took the stage at the RNC on Thursday, his personal attorney Alina Habba relayed a story to the crowd about Trump’s “love” for music, and recalled the day “a few years ago, [when] he wanted me to hear a new song he had selected for an upcoming rally.” “I could hear it blaring in the background at Mar-a-Lago,” Habba went on. “He landed on a song called ‘Hold on, I’m Coming.’” That Trump continues to use the song is especially galling to Porter, as well as Hayes’ family, in light of the fact that they first raised their objections more than two years ago. “The estate and family of Isaac Hayes DID NOT approve and would NEVER approve the use of ‘Hold on I’m coming’ by Sam and Dave by Donald Trump at this weekend’s National Rifle Association convention,” a spokesperson for the Hayes estate told Variety in May 2022. “Our condolences go out to the victims and families of #Uvalde and mass shooting victims everywhere.” Hayes’ daughter Veronica, who was unable to be reached on Friday, told a local Memphis TV station at the time: “My father’s legacy was very clean and wasn’t tainted by anything. Since we are the survivors, we get to choose how his music is played and who’s allowed to use it.” “Hell to the No!” Porter posted about it on his now-defunct Twitter account. “I did Not and would NOT approve of them using the song for any of his purposes!” Atlantic Records now owns the rights to “Hold On, I’m Coming,” and told K8 News at the time that it had no plans to pursue legal action.","summary":"‘We create music for uplifting people, not separating them,’ David Porter, who co-wrote the iconic track with R&B legend Isaac Hayes, told The Independent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-rnc-speech-songs-b2582857.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/03/11486627.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:48:59","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.258},{"id":252193442,"title":"Legal fight continues with appeals over proposed immigration initiative for Arizona Nov. 5 ballot","text":"PHOENIX (AP) — The fight to keep a proposed border initiative off Arizona’s Nov. 5 ballot is not over yet. Immigrant advocates kept the issue alive this week by filing notice to the state Supreme Court that they will appeal the judge’s ruling. A Maricopa County Superior Court judge on July 12 rejected an effort by the advocates to keep the proposed initiative off the ballot. The advocates argue that the measure breaks the rules because it deals with more than a single subject. Attorney Andy Gaona, who represents some of the groups, said Friday he was working on legal briefs in the cased that were due later in the day. The Legislature will have until July 26 to respond, he said. “We do think that single subject provision was violated,” Gaona said. “We hope that the court agrees.” Supporters of the initiative argue that it deals with a single subject: the border. The GOP-controlled Legislative in early June voted to allow to proposal to be placed on the ballot, asking voters if local law enforcement should be allowed to arrest migrants who cross illegally from Mexico into Arizona between ports of entry. The measure would also give state judges the power to order people convicted of the offense to return to their countries of origin. It is similar to a Texas law that has been put on hold by a federal appeals court while it is being challenged. Unlike the Texas law, Arizona’s proposal would also make it a felony punishable by 10 years of imprisonment for selling fentanyl that leads to a person’s death. Also included is a requirement that some government agencies use a federal database to verify a noncitizen’s eligibility for benefits. The Republican-backed proposal bypasses Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, who had vetoed a similar measure in early March and has denounced the effort to bring the issue to voters. Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to ensure security along the state’s southern border, and that Arizona voters should be given the opportunity to decide the issue themselves. Opponents say the legislation would lead to racial profiling and create several millions of dollars in additional policing costs that Arizona cities, counties and the state can ill afford. The measure would go before voters in a state expected to play a crucial role in determining which party controls the White House and the U.S. Senate — likely razor-close races in Arizona. Republicans hope it will focus attention on the border, which they accuse Biden of mishandling, and dilute the political benefits Democrats seek from an abortion-rights initiative. Disorder on the border is a top motivator for many Republican voters who former President Donald Trump hopes will vote in big numbers. President Joe Biden in early June unveiled plans to restrict the number of migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. This isn’t the first time Republican lawmakers in Arizona have tried to criminalize migration. When passing a much-debated 2010 immigration bill, the Arizona Legislature considered expanding the state’s trespassing law to criminalize the presence of immigrants and impose criminal penalties. But the trespassing language was removed and replaced with a requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, question people’s immigration status if they were believed to be in the country illegally. The questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court despite the racial profiling concerns of critics. But courts barred enforcement of other sections of the law.

With the future of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign in doubt, Williamson’s emissaries have been reaching out to Democratic National Convention delegates to convince them to pull support from Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “They called me yesterday morning to see if I would send a notarized letter rescinding my support of Biden-Harris,” New York State Assembly Member Robert Carroll told TPM in a phone conversation on Friday. “Utter lunacy … on their part,” he added. “I mean, I just think it’s insane.” A second Democratic National Convention delegate, who requested anonymity to discuss the nomination process, told TPM they knew of another delegate who received outreach from Williamson’s campaign in addition to Carroll. According to Carroll, the person from Williamson’s team framed the delegate play as an effort to nominate a new Democratic candidate in response to the concerns that have erupted inside the party following Biden’s lackluster performance in his June debate against former President Trump. Carroll, who first revealed the calls from Williamson’s team on Twitter, noted he is a pledged delegate. There are over 3,900 pledged DNC delegates from around the country, and the rules specify that they should “in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them” and back the winners of the Democratic primary in the area they represent. Because of his victories in the primary, which was largely uncontested, the vast majority of these delegates are pledged to Biden. For his part, Carroll said he is going to nominate Biden at the convention both due to his obligation as a pledged delegate and because he thinks the president is still the best choice to defeat Trump, despite the concerns reportedly raised by party leaders about his candidacy. “I’m an elected member of the Democratic Party. I represent about 145,000 people. I’m an elected delegate. I take that all very, very seriously,” Carroll said, adding, “I think it’s a team effort … and I think we need to stop having a … circular firing squad. “Though I will agree that the debate performance was poor,” he added, “the hysteria of the last three weeks is significantly worse.” Williamson is a “spiritually progressive” author and self-help guru who has stopped and started a presidential bid multiple times during this election cycle. She initially dropped out of the race on Feb. 7 after receiving roughly four percent of the vote in the New Hampshire Democratic primary and about two percent in South Carolina’s Democratic primary. Williamson, who also mounted an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020, announced the unsuspension of her campaign three weeks later before ending it again last month. After her halting primary bid, Williamson has resurfaced in the midst of the Democratic Party’s post-debate drama. Biden’s performance in that debate, which included multiple moments where he seemed to lose his train of thought and have difficulty expressing himself, have led to widespread concerns about his age, health and whether he can lead the party to victory in November. In recent weeks, numerous Democrats have called for him to abandon his re-election bid, citing their fears he cannot defeat Trump. Despite reports Friday that Biden’s family has considered a potential exit plan, his campaign team has insisted he “is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump.” On July 3, Williamson announced that she was re-re-entering the race and said the debate made “very clear that the Democrats need a new nominee on the ballot.” Since then, she has launched the operation focused on the DNC delegates. The delegates are set to nominate the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in a virtual roll call ahead of the convention, which will take place in Chicago starting Aug. 19. In addition to the pledged delegates, there are 739 automatic delegates, who are often called superdelegates. The automatic delegates can vote to nominate any candidate of their choosing, but, as a result of reforms put in place in the wake of the contested 2016 Democratic primary, they cannot vote on the first ballot. A candidate can secure the nomination by winning a majority in that initial vote. If Biden does indeed step aside, his pledged delegates would be released. However, the concerns about his candidacy have caused some delegates and others to wonder if the “good conscience” clause in the party’s rules might allow them to break away even without Biden deciding to end his run. Williamson’s delegate play is centered on this idea. Earlier this week, she released a video outlining her message to delegates and suggesting they can “open up this convention” by sending letters to the DNC. Williamson stressed that these letters would need to be “notarized” and submitted before Friday. “The only chance now to stop this is for you who are delegates to use your power and to step in,” Williamson said in the clip, adding, “You do that by sending a communication … saying that you as a delegate to this convention no longer automatically pledge your vote to Joe Biden, that, according to the dictates of your conscience and your firm belief that we’re in trouble regarding the election in November, you want to hear from any other candidates, you want to open up this convention.” In her video, Williamson stressed that she was not calling for delegates to pledge to support her. “What I’m asking you to do is to just pledge to opening up the convention,” Williamson said. In a note on her site that accompanied the video, Williamson suggested the show of opposition to Biden was focused on convincing the DNC to eliminate a planned, early virtual roll call ahead of the in-person convention. Amid the questions surrounding Biden, others in the party have also raised concerns about the early roll call, which has not been scheduled. In a letter to committee members on Wednesday, the co-chairs of the DNC rules committee indicated the roll call would not occur before Aug. 1 and said it needed to take place prior to the convention due to concerns about ballot access. Carroll, the New York delegate who received the call from Williamson’s team, said they offered to send him text for a potential letter opposing Biden’s nomination. “I told them that I was uninterested and that I wasn’t going to humor them,” he said. Williamson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment asking how many delegates they believe signed the letters or whether she expected to receive any support at the DNC. Biden’s campaign also did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Carroll said that, in the event that Biden steps aside, he would vote for any candidate recommended by the president and he assumes that would be Harris. He also said there is “no universe” where he would vote to nominate Williamson at the DNC. “To be perfectly honest, I barely know who the hell she is,” Carroll said. “I mean, I know that she’s got like crystals to sell or something, but like, I really, I couldn’t tell you if she walked into my office right now …I wouldn’t know that she was Marianne Williamson,” he continued, adding, “I don’t think of her as a Democratic Party person, I don’t think of her as an elected official, I don’t think of her as a party activist or somebody who has got her finger on the pulse. … I know she’s a kooky person, but I don’t spend — I’ve got too many things going on in my life to spend any time on kooky Marianne Williamson and what her ideas are.”","summary":"Marianne Williamson wants to step into the void.

I AM NOT LYING!!\" Others joined in, expressing disbelief and amusement. @airbagged posted a video of the act and captioned the same, \"LMFAO.\" Some however took a more critical stance. A user remarked, \"I mean did you miss the anti-Black tirade he had about his daughter.\" The same user added, \"Trump is not beating the 'First Gay President' allegations.\" In a similar vein, a user quipped, \"Why does he pretend he is not gay? He is the first gay president,\" while another chimed in with, \"Well well…I guess we know why Melania hasn't been around lately,\" adding the pride flag and a laughing emoji. Another comment echoed, \"Pride month never ends.\" Reiterating similar sentiments, an X user added, \"They may have a love affair we shouldn't judge them lol.\" What seemed like a simple thank you turned into a big conversation that bordered on homophobia. In light of the same, a user defended, \"Some people ain't blew a kiss to the homie and it shows.\" Others speculated about the underlying political motivations. @Angelica_Reed1 however suggested, \"He saw the Grindr statistics and knew he had to appeal to them more.\" @okdaksh trolled, \"And people call him homophobic...\" During his RNC speech, Hogan, 70, emphatically pledged his support to Trump, deeming the former president a 'hero' and a 'gladiator'. In a move that reminded everyone of his wrestling days, Hogan ripped off his shirt to show a tank top with Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance's name on it. \"I said! Let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother,\" Hogan boomed. He continued, \"Over my career, I have been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet. Donald Trump is the toughest of them all.\" He further gushed, \"They have thrown everything at Donald Trump, all the investigations, the impeachments, the court cases, and he is still standing and kicking their butts,\" The Daily Beast reported. The wrestling icon also reflected on Trump's Pennsylvania shooting. He stated, \"What happened last week...when they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next President of the United States...enough was enough.\" Hogan by repeating many of Trump's usual talking points, cheered the GOP nominee. Trump, in response, clapped his hands, pumped his fist in the air, and blew him a kiss.","summary":"During his RNC speech, Hogan, emphatically pledged his support to Trump, deeming the former president a &#39;hero&#39; and a &#39;gladiator&#39;.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-blowing-a-kiss-to-hulk-hogan-after-his-rnc-speech-sparks-online-frenzy","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706059/uploads/55b152a0-45bb-11ef-9866-3790ece5385a_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:46:00","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.108},{"id":252194146,"title":"'Had a very good call': Donald Trump says spoke with Zelensky, pledges to 'end the war'","text":"US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he had a \"very good call\" on Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Trump has asserted that he will end the war in Ukraine before he even takes office in January if he wins the November 5 election.

Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic ‘heavyweight,’ asks Biden to bow out of presidential race","text":"Over the last week, the calls for President Joe Biden to bow out as the presumptive Democratic Party nominee have grown louder, and now, one of the Bay Area’s most prominent Democrats, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, is chiming in. Concerns about Biden’s viability in November started circulating following his unsteady performance at the June 27 presidential debate. Since then, more than two dozen Democratic congressmembers have asked the president to suspend his re-election bid including several members of the California delegation like Reps. Adam Schiff, Mike Levin and Scott Peters, all of whom represent the southern part of the state. But through a July 18 letter sent to the president, Lofgren this week became the first Bay Area congressmember to outright call for Biden to reconsider being on the Democratic ticket. In the letter, Lofgren praised the president for his “policy achievements that have benefited the American people,” and said she respects his “lifetime of public service.” But the polling, she notes, isn’t in his favor and puts him “on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot.” “As a Member of the House Select Committee to investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol I know, perhaps as well as anyone, how unsuitable Donald Trump is to be President,” Lofgren wrote. “His policies are wrong. His character is unprincipled and corrupt. He remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection. And, if he is elected President again, he will dismantle all that Democrats have achieved for the American people.” If Biden ultimately accepts the nomination at the Democratic National Convention next month, Lofgren said she will “do everything I can to promote your candidacy.” David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University, said that Lofgren joining the call for Biden to step down is significant given her status as “heavyweight” in the Democratic Party. Lofgren, 76, assumed office in 1995, but her time on the Hill dates back to the 1970s when she worked for the late Rep. Don Edwards amid the impeachment of President Richard Nixon. “Her role, her heft, her pull amongst fellow Democrats is significant,” McCuan said. “She’s also a very practically minded politician and she wants to be in a place where they can get things done, especially as she’s closer to the end of her career.” McCuan said that Lofgren — like Schiff — is very close to former speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly expressed concerns about Biden in private. “The former speaker would have known that this was coming,” McCuan said. Other California Democrats on Friday echoed Lofgren’s call. Rep. Jared Huffman, whose district includes parts of Marin, Mendocino, Sonoma, Humboldt, Trinity and Del Norte counties, released a joint statement with Reps. Marc Veasey (D-TX), Chuy Garcia (D-IL) and Mark Pocan (D-WI) asking Biden to “pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.” “We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,” the representatives said. “At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign.” Rep. Jim Costa, whose district includes parts of the San Joaquin Valley, also called this week for Biden to rethink his candidacy. “I am proud of the work we have done to pass monumental legislation that is leading to the first real investments in our communities in decades,” Costa said. “But for the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started.” Biden’s campaign, however, has brushed aside any calls for him to drop out. “You have heard from the President directly time and again: He is in this race to win, and he is our nominee, and he’s going to be our President for a second term,” Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. Bill James, the chair of the Santa Clara County Democratic Central Committee, said he’s heard concerns and anxiety from local Democrats since the June debate. The local party, he said, has refrained from taking a position since it’s a decision that’s “being made by party leaders at the highest level.” “I think the decision will be made collaboratively and with President Biden largely in the driver’s seat because he does have the pledged delegates going into the convention,” James said. When it comes to Lofgren’s position though, he said that “if anybody in Democratic politics has a right to express their view publicly about this question of whether President Biden should step aside or not, it’s Rep. Lofgren.”","summary":"Lofgren is one of more than two dozen congressmembers who have asked Biden to reconsider.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/07/19/rep-zoe-lofgren-a-democratic-heavyweight-asks-biden-to-bow-out-of-presidential-race/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Trump-Russia-Probe_2.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:44:33","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":252193362,"title":"Trump holds ‘very good’ phone call with Zelensky","text":"Former US president and Republican candidate in the upcoming elections, Donald Trump, has reiterated his pledge to stop the conflict between Moscow and Kiev following his conversation with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky on Friday. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he “had a very good phone call” with Zelensky, during which the Ukrainian politician congratulated him on a “very successful” Republican National Convention and “condemned the heinous assassination attempt.” Trump went on to say that he appreciates Zelensky “for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families.” Zelensky in turn claimed that he “agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.” “I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation’s freedom and independence. Ukraine will always be grateful to the United States for its help in strengthening our ability to resist Russian terror,” he wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday night. Speaking to British state broadcaster BBC during a trip to the UK this week, Zelensky reiterated that his government seeks total victory in the conflict with Russia. “We have to finish with him,” he said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. If Trump is reelected US president in November, Zelensky expects him to lean on Kiev to end the conflict “in 24 hours” as he has promised on the campaign trail. Zelensky described a worst-case scenario in which US sanctions are lifted from Russia under Trump and Putin celebrates victory: “We will never go on this, never. And there is no guy in the world who can push us to do it,” he insisted. Zelensky’s own five-year presidential term, which he won in a landslide in 2019, expired in late May. He has refused to hold a new election, citing martial law in the country, and reiterated to the British state broadcaster his intention to retain power at least until the hostilities end. Moscow has argued that, under the Ukrainian constitution, the parliament remains legitimate, and presidential authority should have passed to its speaker when Zelensky’s term ended. Putin has also stated that he would order a ceasefire and start negotiations with Ukraine as soon as it pledges not to seek membership in NATO and withdraws its troops from all Russian territories, including the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk, and the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye.","summary":"Former US president Donald Trump has reiterated his pledge to stop the conflict following his conversation with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/601372-trump-zelensky-phone-call/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/669aeb20203027463d4acece.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-19 22:41:19","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.218}]}
