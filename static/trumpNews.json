USA!\" as Air Force One flew low over the closing holes at the Bethpage Black course, a show of force that he used on the campaign trail with his private plane and has continued with his government-issued ride.\n\nWhen Mr Trump stepped away from the course after watching the afternoon four-ball matches tee off, some people in the stands behind him chanted \"48,\" a suggestion that they wanted the 45th and 47th president to serve an unconstitutional third term.\n\n\"He's doing a hell of a job for the country,\" Phil Dunn of Pittsburgh said.\n\n\"He's trying to bring people together.\"\n\nGolf has always been something of a refuge for Trump. He owns several courses and visits often on the weekends to play and hold meetings.\n\nOn the day the 2020 election was called for Joe Biden, he played a round in Virginia, ensconced in a bubble of adulation despite voters' rejection.\n\nThe People's Country Club\n\nThis year's Ryder Cup represented a synthesis at the heart of Mr Trump's political appeal as a billionaire with populist tastes.\n\nAlthough golf has a reputation as an elitist sport, Bethpage, on Long Island, is known as the \"People's Country Club\" and is one of the few public courses to host professional tournaments.\n\nThe course is about 44km east of Manhattan, in a suburban county that Mr Trump won in 2024.\n\nThe Ryder Cup draws a patriotic scene since it pits American players against Europeans. Over-the-top attire — red-white-and-blue overalls, bald eagle shirts and even tricorn hats — are common sights.\n\n\"Now Watergate does not bother me,\" Lynyrd Skynyrd sang over the loudspeaker.\n\n\"Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth.\"\n\nThe president arrived through a tunnel beneath the grandstand, an announcer heralding his arrival. The crowd roared and broke into more \"USA!\" chants.\n\nEuropean fans countered with \"Ole!\" but were quickly drowned out. Mr Trump saluted as New York City firefighter Bryan Robinson sang the national anthem. The crowd erupted again as a quartet of military jets raced across the sky.\n\nHe then watched from behind a glass barrier near the first tee and the 18th green as the day's second round of matches got underway.\n\nMr Trump left his perch to greet US captain Keegan Bradley, who gave him a thumbs-up and bowed to him. Bradley also did an imitation of the arm-pumping dance that Mr Trump made famous on the campaign trail and several players, including US Open champion JJ Spaun, followed suit.\n\nMr Trump has often harnessed the platform of sports to broaden his reach in American culture. His armoured limousine led drivers on two ceremonial laps at the Daytona 500, and already this month he mingled with the New York Yankees in their locker room and attended the US Open tennis tournament.\n\nSport becomes central to Trump's presidency\n\nSports will only become more central to his presidency. The US is hosting the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics and the World Cup next year, along with Canada and Mexico.\n\nTrump has suggested reshaping the schedule for the soccer tournament to mesh with his political agenda by moving matches away from US cities that he deems unsafe.\n\nSome of the cities, he said recently in the Oval Office, were \"run by radical left lunatics\" and he proposed expanding deployments of National Guard troops. He added that \"if I think it isn't safe, we'll move it to a different city.\"\n\nLittle of these controversies were on people's minds at Bethpage on Friday.\n\nJody Erwin, of Houston, wore a Captain America costume and a red American flag hat from Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. He played the course on Wednesday, his first time there, and was excited that Trump was attending the Ryder Cup.\n\n\"He supports golf. He loves golf,\" Mr Erwin said. \"That's his whole deal.\"\n\nHe brushed off the idea that golf has been a safe space for someone like the president, saying: \"I don't think he can ever relax.\"\n\nPeter Bruce, who attended from London while decked out in Europe's blue-and-yellow colours, was less enthusiastic.\n\n\"It's not about him, it's about those 12 players for each team out there,\" Mr Bruce said.\n\n\"It would be better if he decided not to come.\"\n\nDavid Ferraro of Babylon, New York, wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat to the tournament and wanted to sit as close to Mr Trump as possible.\n\n\"The more times you can see the president, the more access you get to a president, the better,\" Ferraro said.\n\nEurope dominates US amidst the circus\n\nAmidst the pomp and ceremony of Trump's visit, it was Europe that dominated the US on the scorecard.\n\nJustin Thomas needed to make a 5-foot putt on the 15th green to keep the opening day's most highly anticipated match going at the Ryder Cup. But that putt — like so many others — skimmed the edge.\n\nThomas slumped his shoulders and headed over to shake hands with Jon Rahm and Tyrell Hatton after the European team's 4-and-3 win over the US power pairing of Thomas and Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nA match that was supposed to build momentum did just that — but for Europe, not the United States.\n\n\"Not exactly what we wanted,\" US captain Keegan Bradley said, summing up a morning that left the US staring at a 3-1 deficit that grew even larger in the afternoon.\n\nEurope brings a 5 1/2 to 2 1/2 lead into day two. No team has overcome that big a first-day deficit since the US in 1999.\n\nThe day started with so much promise. With the sun still coming up over Long Island, DeChambeau and Thomas walked to the first tee, draping an American flag over their shoulders.\n\nDeChambeau took out a driver and, just as he had been practising all week, hit it over the trees on the right and tried to drive the green.\n\nIt was the shot American fans woke up early to see — the shot captain Keegan Bradley hoped would spark the Americans to a victory on home turf.\n\nThe ball landed in the fairway, about 40 yards short of the putting surface. A few minutes later, DeChambeau made a 10-foot birdie to go 1-up.\n\nBradley couldn't have drawn it up better. He also probably could not have imagined it would be the only hole his lead team would win all round.\n\nDeChambeau went on to team with Ben Griffin in the afternoon fourball matches. They won two holes in that one, but lost 1-down to Tommy Fleetwood and Justin Rose.\n\nThe morning loss was a loss punctuated not by great drives, but by putters that did not cooperate. The US missed seven putts from 15 feet and closer, any of which would have won or tied holes.\n\nEurope, meanwhile, got breaks and took advantage of them.\n\nThe best picture of the day was Hatton in a plank position in the seventh rough, checking out Rahm's errant drive that was perched awkwardly behind a stick. Hatton sized it up and hit onto the green from that tricky lie and Europe made par.\n\nThomas missed a 7-footer to tie and America's 1-up lead was gone.\n\n\"A bit of a hit-and-hope,\" Hatton called the approach on number seven.\n\n\"Thankfully, it went straight. I was happy to have a clean line and to see that the stick wouldn't affect it.\"\n\nA fan blurted out \"let's go, Europe!\" after that hole — a cheer briefly drowned out by boos from an American crowd still holding out hope.\n\nA hole later, Rahm made a 12-footer to give the Europeans the lead for good. Most of the rest of this match was played in near silence on what was supposed to be one of America's most raucous golf courses, Bethpage Black.\n\nOne exception came on number 12, when Hatton lined up a putt, then stepped away to flick away a gnat. Fans showered him with boos. Then, Hatton lined it up again and made the 20-footer to make it 3-up, Europe.\n\nRahm improved to 5-0 lifetime in Ryder Cup foursomes. The Rahm-Hatton duo is now 3-0-1.\n\nRahm conceded the start was a bit intimidating — all that shouting and DeChambeau hitting a perfect shot under pressure.\n\n\"We stayed in it and started hitting good shots and getting positive vibes,\" he said.\n\n\"Tyrell is very, very dependable when things get difficult. I've got full confidence in him every single time.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump visits on the opening day of the Ryder Cup, but it's the Europeans who dominate heading into day two.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-27/ryder-cup-golf-trump-visit-fails-to-inspire-americans/105823802","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a07e4b5301fca76281a55e4a00bce2b6?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=242&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:36:49","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.068},{"id":363827404,"title":"Anthony Albanese shuts down meeting with Nigel Farage, does not want to see the 'rise’ of populist parties","text":"Anthony Albanese says he won’t meet with Nigel Farage and said he does not want to see the rise of parties like Britain’s populist right party, Reform.\n\nMr Albanese spent Friday headlining a global progressives conference in central London alongside his ‘Three Eyes’ Prime Ministerial counterparts, Keir Starmer of the UK and Mark Carney of Canada.\n\nThe trio also spoke alongside Iceland’s Prime Minister about how to combat the rise of the populist right, which is surging in support across Europe.\n\nCurrent polling puts Mr Farage within a whisker of forming majority government, partly due to anxieties about immigration and the flow from across the English Channel of small boats carrying migrants who claim asylum in the UK.\n\n“I don’t want to see the rise of populist organisations such as that,” Mr Albanese told reporters during a press conference at Stoke Lodge, the official residence of Australia’s High Commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith.\n\n“I met with the mainstream opposition party here.\n\n“Parties of governance have to come up with solutions, not seek to divide people.”\n\nAsked if he had ever met Mr Farage, Mr Albanese said: “No.”\n\nWhen pressed by The Nightly if he would seek a meeting with the populist leader given Reform’s electoral viability, Mr Albanese said he would not.\n\n“I have no plans to meet Mr Farage,” the Prime Minister said.\n\nMr Albanese’s London schedule was dominated by meetings with like-minded leaders, but he held one meeting with a Conservative — the leader of the UK’s opposition Kemi Badenoch.\n\nWhen pressed by The Nightly, about whether this was a good strategy given the failure to prepare for Donald Trump’s election in the United States’ caught Australia’s political establishment unawares, he said: “I’ve given you the answer, I’ve met the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition.”\n\nAustralian officials had to seek Mr Trump’s mobile via golfing giant Greg Norman during the President’s first Administration.\n\nAnd Australia’s Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd waited until the morning after Mr Trump’s re-election last November to wipe social media posts he had published that were critical of the notoriously vindictive President.\n\nIn the UK, Mr Farage’s dominance in the polls is such that UK Labour and Sir Keir has begun treating the Reform leader as the true opposition leader over Ms Badenoch.\n\n“We’re going to face a very different election next time to any of the elections we’ve fought in the United Kingdom for a very, very long time,” Sir Keir said.\n\n“That’s certainly why I want this to be out as an open fight now, between Labour and Reform.\n\n“The choice before the electorate here at the next election is not going to be the traditional Labour versus Conservative.\n\n“It’s why I’ve said the Conservative party is dead. Centre-right parties in many European countries have withered on the vine.\n\n“And the same is happening in this country. And it actually becomes bigger than Labour.\n\n“There’s a battle for the soul of this country now as to what sort of country do we want to be because that toxic divide, that decline with Reform, it’s built on a sense of grievance, grievance politics.”\n\nTrump heralds a new era\n\nBut Sir Keir also said that countries had to accept that the populist economist policies being pursued by President Donald Trump were here to stay.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Trump threatened a 100 per cent tariff beginning October 1 on pharmaceuticals unless the company has a plant in the United States.\n\nIf imposed, it would add to the 10 per cent on tariffs on imports form Australia as well 50 per cent on steel, setting up yet another point of tension in the relationship ahead of Mr Albanese’s October 20 meeting.\n\nAsked if there was anything he could learn from the approach of Sir Keir, who has forged a friendship with Mr Trump, compared to Mr Albanese’s one and only fleeting selfie encounter, the Prime Minister said: “I think that you just deal with these issues in a straightforward manner.”\n\nBut Sir Keir said America’s allies had to accept tariffs were “here to stay.”\n\n“You can have your view on tariffs, you may think they’re good, bad or indifferent,” he said.\n\n“But the fact is they’re here. President Trump believes in them, uses them, and we have to understand that.”\n\n“It’s a profound belief that he has about the way he wants his economy to be reshaped.\n\nSir Keir said this meant being clearer at home about domestic government support for industries compared to the free market.\n\nMr Albanese met one-on-one with Mr Carney, Sir Keir and Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.\n\nOn Saturday he heads to Balmoral to meet King Charles III, becoming the first Australian Prime Minister since Paul Keating to meet the monarch at their Scottish castle.\n\nHe said it was a privilege and that he was looking forward to the meeting, and had shelved his ambitions for a Republic.","summary":"Anthony Albanese will not meet with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, asserting he does not want to see the rise of populist organisations that ‘divide people’.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/anthony-albanese-shuts-down-meeting-with-nigel-farage-does-not-want-to-see-the-rise-of-populist-parties-c-20157763","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20157763/02222b0868d5fd91b51802c06c04abb5bf757d81-16x9-x0y93w6760h3802.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:32:05","author":"Latika M Bourke,The Nightly","authors":["Latika M Bourke","The Nightly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.144},{"id":363830444,"title":"Scottie Scheffler's Ryder Cup woes continue as he matches unwanted Tiger Woods record in front of Donald Trump","text":"Scottie Scheffler's Ryder Cup woes continue as he matches unwanted Tiger Woods record in front of Donald Trump\n\nREAD MORE: 'Captain America' Bryson DeChambeau fell silent at flat Bethpage\n\nBy DANIEL MATTHEWS AT BETHPAGE BLACK\n\nPublished: 01:26 BST, 27 September 2025 | Updated: 01:27 BST, 27 September 2025\n\nEarly on Friday morning, Scott Scheffler was doing his best to cut a path through the rough and mud along one hole of Bethpage Black.\n\nHe was pushing an empty stroller and he was struggling. It was a wet morning – hardly ideal conditions for navigating the hills and undulations of this vast state park.\n\nA few yards away, meanwhile, his son was having a few problems of his own. On the opening morning of this Ryder Cup, Scottie Scheffler was partnered with Russell Henley. The world No 1 and world No 3. In a foursomes match against Ludvig Aberg and Matt Fitzpatrick.\n\nBefore this, the Englishman had the worst Ryder Cup win-rate of any player since Team Europe was formed in 1979. On paper, it looked like a brutal mismatch.\n\nAnd in the end, it was. Scheffler and Henley didn’t even reach the 16th hole. They were taken apart. They won just two holes en route to losing 5&3. Unfortunately for the world No 1, that was only the start of the bleeding on a brutal day for America.\n\nA few hours later, he wandered back out on to the first tee for the fourballs alongside another rookie, JJ Spaun.\n\nScottie Scheffler endured another miserable day at the Ryder Cup after suffering two defeats\n\nThe world No 1 was beaten in his opening foursomes and fourball match-ups in New York\n\nInside the ropes at the Ryder Cup as Donald Trump fails to inspire Team USA after jetting in\n\nDonald Trump was there to greet them - behind a thick pane of glass - and Spaun danced for the president. Scheffler directed a fist pump at his commander-in-chief.\n\nTrump will often text or call Scheffler when the world No 1 wins a tournament. That means they chat pretty often. The 29-year-old is the world’s most dominant golfer since Tiger Woods, after all. He won six times this year – four more than any other PGA Tour player – including the PGA and Open Championships.\n\nOn this early evidence, however, Scheffler won’t need to check his phone over the weekend. He and Spaun were beaten 3&2 by Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka. So after day one of the Ryder Cup, Scheffler’s record reads: two matches played, two lost. Three holes won, 11 lost.\n\nOn an American team featuring four first-timers, Scheffler was pegged as an obvious anchor for Keegan Bradley. So was Bryson DeChambeau. He finished Friday 0-2 as well.\n\nThese losses don’t fall solely on the shoulders of the world No 1, of course. Henley struggled perhaps more than anyone in the morning foursomes. Spaun, meanwhile, didn’t finish a hole between the seventh and the 14th.\n\nBut history suggests Scheffler’s issues run deeper than underperforming partners. After going unbeaten on debut in 2021 (2-0-1), his all-time Ryder Cup record now stands at two wins, four losses, three ties. Across his last six matches, Scheffler is 0-4-2. His three foursome matches have all ended in routs: Scheffler has played 41 holes and won just three.\n\nScheffler failed to produce his best form with president Donald Trump watching on at Bethpage\n\nHe cut a frustrated figure after ensuring he has now lost four of his last six Ryder Cup matches\n\nTiger Woods was the last world No 1 to suffer two defeats on the opening day of the Ryder Cup\n\nIn Rome, two years ago, Scheffler was reduced to tears after Aberg and Viktor Hovland beat him and Brooks Koepka 9&7. That was the shortest foursomes clash in Ryder Cup history. This wasn’t that bad. But still it wasn’t pleasant.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Scheffler missed putt after putt. And on the 14th, after yet another rolled by the cup, some well-oiled European fans taunted the world No 1 with chants of: ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning!’\n\nAt least Scheffler is not alone. Woods could never replicate his dominance in the Ryder Cup either. This was the first time since Woods in 2002 that a world No 1 lost twice on the opening day of a Ryder Cup. It’s only happened four times in history.\n\nThere is no obvious reason why Scheffler should struggle – particularly in foursomes. But on Friday, the issue was not too difficult to diagnose.\n\n‘It really just came down to me not holing enough putts,’ he said. ‘We’ll come back out tomorrow.’\n\nTiger WoodsScottie Scheffler\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nScottie Scheffler's Ryder Cup woes continue as he matches unwanted Tiger Woods record in front of Donald Trump\n\nAdd comment","summary":"DANIEL MATTHEWS AT BETHPAGE BLACK: Trump will often text or call Scheffler when he wins a tournament.

County can rely on federal support.\n\nL.A. County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger, the lone Republican on the five-member board, “has deeply appreciated the support the Trump administration and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) have already provided for debris removal and recovery, and she will continue to explore every avenue of support,” Barger’s spokesperson, Helen Chavez Garcia, wrote in an email on Friday, Sept. 26.\n\nCounty Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who represents residents who lost their homes in the Palisades fire, noted that recovery aid the county and state previously requested from the federal government still had not been provided.\n\nStill, she said, “I remain hopeful that federal leaders will prioritize community safety and resilience.”\n\nA response from the Trump administration on Friday suggested that federal support is far from certain.\n\n“It should not be the role of the federal government or federal taxpayer to bail out poor decisions by substandard state and local government officials,” the Trump administration said in an email.\n\nThis isn’t the first time the Trump administration has raised the possibility of withholding federal support.\n\nSoon after the January wildfires, Trump suggested withholding federal disaster aid unless California agreed to certain conditions, such as changing the state’s water management policies or requiring voter ID.\n\nThen in June, Trump hinted that a feud with Gov. Gavin Newsom over mass federal immigration raids – and the use of military troops to protect federal buildings and agents as they carried out those enforcement actions – could impact additional wildfire aid to California.\n\nMembers of Congress representing Southern California, in the meantime, largely have agreed that disaster aid should not come with strings.\n\nEvery member of California’s congressional delegation, both Democrats and Republicans, signed a letter in March urging senior congressional leaders to support additional federal disaster aid for the victims of the January wildfires.\n\nMeasures recommended in this week’s after-action report to better prepare L.A. County for future wildfires included updating conflicting and outdated policies and protocols, improving emergency response training, increasing staff, updating obsolete communications systems and technology, and addressing resource constraints.\n\nShawn Tyrie, a partner and government president at McChrystal Group, the firm that produced the report, said L.A. County’s Office of Emergency Management had only 37 full-time employees for a county of 10 million people while New York City, with 8.5 million residents, had 200 staffers in its emergency department.\n\nIn addition, the report noted that law enforcement personnel reported inconsistent training regarding wildfire evacuations, and that equipment and personnel shortages were “magnified under the extreme conditions of this incident.”\n\nBelow are reactions from federally elected officials from L.A. County, in response to the findings and recommendations from the after-action report and concerns about funding.\n\n– U.S. Senator Alex Padilla: “Long before the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires, we have known that improving coordination and increasing our response capability is needed to match the intensity and frequency of wildfires. That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation to create a singular, whole-of-government wildfire intelligence center to foster cross-agency collaboration. As we rebuild our communities in a resilient manner, we must continue learning how we can better prepare for the unpredictable next tragedy — and I will continue working in Congress to make sure our local governments have the federal government as a real and steadfast partner in this goal.”\n\n– U.S. Senator Adam Schiff’s office: “Senator Schiff and his team look forward to fully reviewing the report released by the county this week. Senator Schiff is committed to delivering the federal relief needed to help communities recover from the Eaton and Palisades fires, and working with all levels of government to ensure California is better protected against future disasters.”\n\n– Rep. Judy Chu (represents Eaton fire victims): “I certainly would do what I can to make sure that Congress can help our local agencies keep people safe. And if that has to do with having modern communication systems and emergency management grants, then that is what we must do. I certainly would push for that. … There are needs all across this country including in North Carolina, Texas and California. It should not matter whether it’s a blue state or a red state. We should help all those who are at the lowest point of their lives due to a disaster.”\n\n– Rep. Brad Sherman (represents Palisades fire victims): “The report is an opportunity to examine what improvements need to be made to improve coordination tools, strengthen training and provide clearer public communication in responding to disasters.

For example, its fire department contracted for satellite-enabled hotspot tracking and the Sheriff’s Department launched a comprehensive evacuation tracking tool.\n\nBarger plans to introduce a motion at Tuesday’s board meeting to direct county departments to identify potential funding sources to pay for other recommendations mentioned in the report, Chavez Garcia said.\n\n“That discussion will help shape the path forward on implementing further improvements,” she said.","summary":"A report this week includes recommendations to address delays in alert notifications and confusion over evacuation orders.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/26/will-la-county-get-federal-funding-to-better-prepare-for-future-wildfires/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PAS-L-EVAC-REPORT-0926-004.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:17:49","author":"Gqlshare,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":363821934,"title":"Iran facing return of sweeping sanctions over banned nuclear activity","text":"Donald Trump pulled the US out in his first term as US president, criticising the deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama as flawed.\n\nIran barred IAEA inspectors from accessing its nuclear facilities after Israel and the US bombed several of its nuclear sites, as well as military bases, in June after negotiations held indirectly between the US and Iran to try to reach a new nuclear deal became deadlocked. \n\nIran is legally obligated under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to allow inspections.

Comey, who has likened Trump to a mob boss and criticised him frequently, denies the charges.\n\nBut Trump's comments on the indictment, and his public pressure on the justice department to secure it, may have created a weakness in the case and made it harder for prosecutors to win a conviction in court, former federal prosecutors say.\n\nThey are warning that Trump's public attacks on Comey and the unusual circumstances leading up to the indictment could cast doubt on the integrity of the process.\n\n\"This looks like a slapdash rush to the courthouse with one goal in mind: to achieve the president's aims in charging a perceived political foe with a felony,\" said Kevin Flynn, who served as a federal prosecutor in Washington, DC, for three decades.\n\nThe indictment against Comey is just two pages long and comes with little information, making it difficult to assess the strength of the accusations or underlying evidence.\n\nWhile some indictments can be short, the brevity of this one was \"beyond unusual\" for such a high-profile political case, said Marcos Jiménez, who served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida under Republican President George W Bush.\n\nTo convict Comey, the government needs to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he knowingly lied to Congress, Mr Flynn said. That would require showing a jury definitive proof that Comey knew he was misleading Congress, such as witness statements, documentation and other forms of evidence.\n\n\"The best perjury cases involve corroboration,\" Mr Flynn said.\n\nOn Thursday, federal prosecutors asked a grand jury to indict Comey on three charges. The jury decided there was only enough evidence to charge him for two counts, court records show. \n\nThe proceedings of grand juries, which only decide if a case against a person might succeed in court, are secret and sealed, meaning only a small group of people know what evidence was considered in charging Comey.\n\n Mr Jiminez warned that the bar that evidence must clear for a grand jury is lower than at a trial where a conviction hangs in the balance.\n\n\"The standard met at the grand jury level is: Is this likely to have happened?'\" Mr Jiménez said. \n\nWhile charging a figure as high-ranking as Comey was unusual, Annemarie McAvoy, a professor at Columbia Law School, told the BBC's Sumi Somaskanda that there is a history of indicting officials for lying to lawmakers and obstructing congressional investigations. She added that it was possible, although could be difficult, to win a conviction.\n\nComey has been accused of lying when he was asked during a 2020 congressional hearing if he authorised leaking to the press information related to an FBI investigation.\n\n\"If there are others who are willing to come forward and say, 'yes, I got the information from James Comey,' then potentially they certainly have a case,\" Ms McAvoy said.\n\nQuestionable circumstances surround the indictment\n\nOver the last week Trump has used his Truth Social platform to openly call for the prosecutions of Comey and other figures who have opposed him. \n\nWhen the US Attorney in Virginia refused to carry out the prosecutions and resigned, Trump installed a prosecutor from his own orbit to the office, Lindsey Halligan, who then sought the indictment.\n\nSeveral legal experts told the BBC that Trump's actions could provide an opening for Comey to move to dismiss the case on the grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution.\n\nAfter Comey's indictment, Trump posted on Truth Social calling Comey a \"dirty cop,\" and writing that a \"big price must be paid\" for the former FBI director's alleged false statements. \n\nBefore, on 20 September, Trump had complained in a lengthy post that \"nothing is being done\" on taking legal action against some of his political opponents, including Comey. They were \"guilty as hell,\" he declared.\n\n\"The President's social media posts and statements are a major problem for the prosecution, both legally and practically,\" said Jeffrey Bellin, a professor at Vanderbilt University Law School. \n\n\"From the outside, it looks like this prosecution was brought at the direct request of the President, over the objections of the professional prosecutors against a political opponent. And this all happened in public view.\"\n\nTrump, however, denies any political motive.\n\n\"It's about justice, not revenge,\" he told White House reporters on Friday. \"It's about justice.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg42e01p23qo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ef55/live/06b86a20-9b0b-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:16:33","author":"Kayla Epstein","authors":["Kayla Epstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":363821620,"title":"Kamala Harris outraged by the indictment of James Comey: ‘Are you f***ing kidding me?’","text":"Kamala Harris had some choice words about the indictment of former FBI boss James Comey.\n\n“It’s frustrating, but more than that, it’s painful to see,” Harris said, speaking to CNN Friday when asked what she made of Trump’s term so far. “I mean what’s happening with Comey, are you f****** kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?”\n\nThe Department of Justice indicted the former FBI director in documents that were made public Thursday, accusing him of making false statements and obstructing justice during congressional testimony in September 2020.\n\n“No one is above the law,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. “[It] reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.”\n\nDuring her failed presidential campaign against Trump in 2024, Harris – also a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general – warned that he would go after his political enemies.\n\n“He said it, we knew he would do it,” Harris told CNN. “But it is every day, unrelenting.”\n\nThe indictment of Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, is the first in a series of potential charges against critics of the president, who has demanded that Bondi launch swift prosecutions against his political adversaries.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday September 20, the president publicly told Bondi, “We can’t delay any longer” and called for action “now” against Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California, another frequent critic of his.\n\nTrump also replaced the U.S. attorney for the district where Comey was indicted with Lindsey Halligan, an administration official with no prior experience as a prosecutor.\n\nIn her interview with CNN, Harris also noted that Trump’s social media post had been addressed to “Pam” and suggested it had been a direct order to the attorney general.\n\nAsked if the indictment of Comey signaled the “crossing of a Rubicon,” Harris replied, “I don’t know.

The policy has since faced a series of nationwide injunctions, with judges declaring it unconstitutional.\n\nSolicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate lawyer, argued in the Supreme Court filing that longstanding interpretations of the 14th Amendment have been “mistaken” and have had “destructive consequences,” according to the appeal obtained by CNN. He claimed lower courts had “undermined border security” by striking down “a policy of prime importance to the president.”\n\nThe administration is challenging rulings from a federal appeals court in San Francisco and a district court in New Hampshire, both of which blocked enforcement of the order in July. In one case, a coalition of Democratic-led states argued that the decree threatened billions in funding tied to citizenship status. In another, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) won a class-action lawsuit halting the policy nationwide.\n\n“This executive order is illegal, full stop, and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that,” ACLU attorney Cody Wofsy said after Friday’s filing. “We will continue to ensure that no baby’s citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order.”\n\nThe administration insists that the Supreme Court’s landmark 1898 ruling in US v. Wong Kim Ark – which established birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants – has been misapplied for decades. Sauer argued the precedent only applied to children of parents with “permanent domicil and residence” in the United States, not those who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily.\n\nThe Supreme Court has yet to docket the case, and it is unclear if four justices will vote to hear it. In June, the justices issued a procedural decision limiting the power of lower courts to block presidential policies, but left open other pathways for nationwide injunctions.","summary":"The US president’s day one decree to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants has faced repeated roadblocks in lower courts \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/625350-trump-birthright-citizenship-order/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.09/article/68d7291a85f540579a208fb2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:04:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":363827862,"title":"‘Nostalgia is not a strategy’: Albanese joins PMs against populist right","text":"Voters who long for the old ideas of the political left were offered some sharp advice in London from Anthony Albanese and a trio of prime ministers who want to muscle up the populist right.\n\n“Nostalgia is not a strategy,” said one of those prime ministers, Mark Carney of Canada, in a public discussion about how to save progressive governments from rising conservative movements.\n\nCarney did not name Donald Trump.

It’s tied to intense speculation that Binance’s co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) might receive a U.S. presidential pardon — a development many believe could reshape how regulators treat Binance and BNB.Here’s what’s behind the buzz — and what you should know if you follow crypto in the UAE.What is BNB, why it mattersBNB’s story goes back to 2017, when it was first launched as 'Binance Coin' through an initial coin offering designed to fund and fuel the then-new Binance exchange. At the start, its purpose was simple: give users a way to pay transaction fees more cheaply and keep activity within the Binance ecosystem.But like the exchange itself, BNB quickly outgrew its original role. It evolved into a multi-purpose token that now powers applications on the BNB Chain, supports countless projects built on top of it, and is even treated by some investors as a store of value alongside bigger names like Bitcoin and Ether.That tight connection with Binance has made BNB unusually sensitive to events around the company. Regulatory news, leadership changes, or even subtle signals from founder Changpeng Zhao often ripple directly into the token’s price, turning BNB into a barometer for Binance’s influence — and its challenges — in the global crypto market..Trump family in talks for stake in crypto firm Binance: WSJ.3 factors driving recent price surge1. Pardon speculation for CZBinance’s former CEO served four months last year as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities. In May, he said on a podcast that he was seeking a pardon from Donald Trump. On betting site Polymarket, the odds of a pardon climbed to 64% on September 13 before easing to 50%.2. Regulatory, market movesAlongside pardon speculation, traders are closely watching US regulators. Hopes of favorable regulatory moves were among the factors driving BNB to a record high. As one analyst noted, “Rumors of CZ’s possible pardon can fuel further speculation.” Binance is also reported to be moving toward a potential deal with the US Justice Department that could allow it to shed an external compliance monitor — a step the market views as a major win.3. Accumulation, token dynamicsSome entities with large BNB holdings are “accumulators,” meaning they continue to buy and hold, reducing available supply. That pushes prices upward when demand is high. CoinMarketCap data shows that listed accumulators now hold around $560 million worth of BNB, equal to about 0.4% of the total supply..Binance enters Islamic Finance with new Sharia-compliant crypto product.UAE crypto enthusiasts, know thisIf you hold or plan to buy BNB, this moment is a mix of opportunity and risk. The upside hinges heavily on the CZ pardon and regulatory developments in the U.S.Even if Binance US survives regulatory scrutiny, BNB’s success will depend on continued real utility — not just hype.Watch out for updates from Binance — any new regulatory clearance, compliance moves, or new partnerships may all signal where BNB is headed next.","summary":"","url":"https://gulfnews.com/your-money/cryptocurrency/why-binances-bnb-is-making-headlines-from-record-prices-to-us-pardon-talks-for-cz-1.500283482","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/import/2023/06/05/BINANC_1888c84c71a_large.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-27 00:04:00","author":"Justin Varghese","authors":["Justin Varghese"],"language":"en","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0.138},{"id":363821714,"title":"Nicolle Wallace Slams James Comey Indictment as a ‘Flashing Red Warning Sign’ for Democracy Under Trump | Video","text":"Nicolle Wallace didn’t hold back when she slammed James Comey’s indictment as a major red flag for democracy.\n\nOn Friday’s episode of “Deadline: White House,” Wallace broke down Comey’s indictment and how it is the latest bleak shot fired from President Donald Trump’s administration to target his political enemies. She warned that the “health of democracy” was being tested.\n\n“He can force out a U.S. attorney with sterling Republican credentials and relationships in MAGA Republican circles … who refused to bring the case against Comey – until he finds that weak link, one who says yes, and gets an indictment of a critic he’s been obsessed with for years in a matter of days.

Poland uses the Roman alphabet, but the letters it contained were Cyrillic.\n\nMr Michalak raised the alarm and scores of military personnel, police and firemen converged on the farm, in the remote hamlet of Studzieniec, 190 miles north of Warsaw, where they found more bits of the shattered drone strewn across the field.\n\nBeyond Poland, this discovery has gone largely unreported, for this drone was assumed to have been another among the barrage of at least 19 that appeared in Poland's night skies on September 10.\n\nYet there is something about this incursion that makes it even more worrying than the others.\n\nMr Michalak's son, Sebastian, 33, who runs the farm, tells me that he and his wife picked sunflowers in this same field, on Sunday, September 14, four days after Vladimir Putin's outrageous violation, but they didn't see the flattened patch or the drone.\n\nHe has no doubt they would have done so if the crash had occurred before then. This begs a vital question. Did Putin secretly order a second drone foray into Poland, at least four days after the first?\n\nSebastian believes so, and he repeated his story to the Polish authorities during a 90-minute debriefing this week.\n\n'I'm sure that drone wasn't here on September 14. It would have been impossible for me not to have noticed it,' he told me. \n\n'The dogs would also have seen it. They bark even when a plastic bag blows over the field, but there were pieces of drone everywhere.\n\n'I think there must have been a second wave, but the government probably doesn't want to reveal that to the public to avoid causing alarm.'\n\nThe Polish prosecutors office told me they couldn't comment on this incident for security reasons. \n\nHowever, if the Warsaw government are intent on playing down the threat of a full-blown invasion, they are sending out decidedly mixed messages.\n\nPoland's prime minister Donald Tusk has just declared that his country is 'the closest we have been to open warfare since World War II', and he is rushing through a law that will make military training mandatory for adult males.\n\nConscription will bolster a 200,000-strong army that is already Nato's third biggest (after the US and Turkey) and bristles with the firepower of 1,000 new South Korean tanks and hundreds of howitzers, shortly to be augmented by a £3billion fleet of F-16 fighter jets.\n\nLater this month, the government will also send every Polish household an advice pack on how to survive a full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nFamilies will be told what to take with them in 'grab-and-go' evacuation kits, such as medicines, identity documents, a radio, warm clothes, nourishing food, torches and batteries. \n\nThe ante was further upped this week after US President Donald Trump called on Nato countries to shoot down any Russian aircraft entering their airspace. \n\nPoland's foreign minister Radek Sikorski backed this with a defiant two-word tweet: 'Roger that.'\n\nYet Putin, who also sent war planes into Estonia's airspace for ten minutes earlier this month, is showing no inclination to back off.\n\nOn Wednesday, he is suspected to have targeted Denmark by flying drones over its military bases and airports. This provocative sortie has clearly rattled the usually phlegmatic Danes.\n\nSo, with the whiff of war fever growing ever stronger, what is the mood of the 38million Poles?\n\nFor these doughty Slavs, of course, the threat of being overrun from the East is nothing new. \n\nThis is a land that has suffered the ambitions of expansionist Muscovite despots for aeons (witness my grandmother's late 19th-century birth certificate, which says she was born in 'Poland, Russian Empire').\n\nJourneying across the country this week, though, it was difficult to escape the fear that the 'Eastern peril' is about to return – with a vengeance.\n\nEager to capitalise on the nation's angst, a Lodz-based company called Schron.pro recently started making bomb shelters supposedly guaranteed to keep a family of four alive for 30 days after a nuclear attack.\n\nThe owner's daughter, Julia Nowakowska, told me they have already sold 15 – at £100,000 each – and more inquiries are flooding in every day. \n\n'A lot of new Polish companies are making cheaper shelters but theirs are a sham because they are prefabricated and not safe,' she claimed.\n\nHer well-heeled clients insist that their shelters are built discreetly, she added, for they fear they would be commandeered by less wealthy refuge-seekers if war broke out.\n\nKeen to learn how to fend for themselves in the wild, should they be forced to flee their homes, Poles are also flocking to join weekend courses run by outdoorsmen such as Piotr Czuryllo, 60, who lives in a 'preppers' commune in northern Poland. \n\nHe teaches them how to forage for nuts and berries, find fresh water, set fires, use a compass and camp out in the forest, though he stops short of allowing them to join him in hunting wild boar and deer with his Winchester Magnum rifle.\n\n'Because of the position Poland is in, more and more people want to have these skills,' the white-bearded former entrepreneur told me. \n\n'They range from teenagers to people in their 70s, and many are women, I think because it's their instinct to protect their families. \n\n'Preppers know how to survive in the event of war, but it is in the genes of Polish people because we live between two powers, Russia and Germany, and have always faced the threat of invasion.'\n\nAnd yet, as an uncomfortable opinion poll published on Wednesday revealed, among today's population the resolve to defend the motherland is by no means universal. \n\nAlmost half of those surveyed said they would not answer a call to arms in the event of war, with the highest number of refuseniks – 69 per cent – in the 18 to 29 years-old age group.\n\nEvidently these Gen Z Poles are not made of the same stuff as their heroic great-grandparents, some of whom perished in epic battles such as the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis, which claimed up to 200,000 Polish lives.\n\nIn a nation where patriotism traditionally swells with every shot of vodka, their reluctance to serve is perplexing and will doubtless concern the government. \n\nIt certainly sets them apart from young people in similarly threatened nations, such as Finland.\n\nThis week, however, when I met Poles who are very much up for the fight, fervour glinted in their eyes.\n\nWith war creeping ever closer, many parents are eager to enrol their children at a new type of high school that builds military training into the curriculum.\n\nBut as there only about 150 of these institutions in the country, many of them private, and fees typically cost £3,000 a year, they are affordable only to middle-class Poles, and places are at a premium.\n\nVisiting one such school, in central Warsaw, was a strange experience. I sat in a classroom as pupils dressed in combat fatigues learned how to resuscitate a dummy soldier injured in battle and take apart and reassemble a replica AK-47 assault rifle. \n\nHad the lesson been staged in Britain, it would doubtless have brought the teachers' union out on strike.\n\nAccording to 15-year-old Zuzia Kuzniak, however, it was just the sort of thing a responsible Polish teenager ought to be practising.\n\n'These drones are making me feel uneasy – they [the Russians] wouldn't do it for no reason,' she told me, when I asked her whether she thought war was likely. \n\n'I only came here four weeks ago so I haven't learned to shoot yet, but my grandfather will help me. I love my country, and I'd fight for her.'\n\nSmiling coyly, she added: 'I'd shoot a human if necessary – but never an animal.'\n\nZuzia's father, Andrzej, an IT manager who served in the Polish tank regiment is delighted with her progress. \n\n'She likes discipline and being in the countryside, she wants a military career, and she is stressed about the international situation and wants to do something useful, so it's great for her,' he says.\n\n'I don't like the fact that 50 per cent of Poles say they would escape to Germany rather than fight the Russians, maybe because they don't respect the government, or whatever.\n\n'But that is Gen Z. It's not just a Polish issue, it's a global thing. Many young people are living their lives through TikTok.'\n\nHis daughter, he implies loftily, is cut from different cloth.\n\nLater that afternoon, on the banks of the River Vistula, I saw a group of slightly older group of teenagers preparing to face Putin's forces\n\nAlong with 15,000 other fierce patriots in recent years, they have joined the Riflemen's Association, a quasi-military organisation founded in 1910 with the aim of liberating a Poland then partitioned between Russia, Prussia and Austria-Hungary.\n\nWearing masks to hide their identity and giving only nicknames, they told me how they practise drills such as rescuing hostages and storming enemy posts.\n\nIntriguingly, they also revealed how the Polish army sometimes uses them to play the part of Russian soldiers in their exercises.\n\nTo make these skirmishes more lifelike, they wear Russian soldiers' second-hand uniforms, acquired cheaply on the internet, use fake munition with Russian labels, and those who can speak Russian bark orders in their language.\n\nGiven that Moscow's intelligence is said to watch the activities of organisations such as the Riflemen's Association, I suggested, wasn't this form of role play rather foolhardy? Wouldn't demonising the Russians in this way incite more enmity?\n\nThe commander of the 1863 Unit (a 25-year-old film industry worker dubbed 'Sard' because he is half-Sardinian) scowled at me.\n\n'I don't care about that!' he snapped. 'We have been offended by the Russians for hundreds of years, so don't ask me about offending them.\n\n'We see the same situation now as in the 1920s, when Russia wanted to rebuild the empire of Catherine the Great. They could attack Poland at any time, but they won't win. \n\n'If they can't defeat Ukraine in three years, they will lose [to Poland] in a year, maybe six months – if, of course, they don't use the atom bomb.'\n\nIf Russia were to invade Poland by land, there are several possible points of attack. \n\nOne is from Kaliningrad to the north; another could see troops storm through Suwalki Gap, a stretch of land between Poland and Lithuania.\n\nThen there is the 256-mile border that separates the east of the country from Belarus, with its Moscow-friendly dictator Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nFor many years, this line was largely unguarded, and Belarussians and Poles could cross freely. \n\nBut that changed in 2021 when – doubtless at Putin's behest – Lukashenko began enacting a plot designed to destabilise the West, which continues today.\n\nThousands of African and Middle Eastern migrants are being flown to Belarus on the understanding that they will be helped to reach Britain, Germany and France. \n\nIt has compelled Poland to erect a 16ft reinforced steel fence topped with razor wire and send hundreds of troops to support the Border Guard.\n\nOne young soldier was fatally stabbed by a migrant wielding a makeshift spear as he tried to stop him prizing open a gap in the barrier. \n\nOn Monday, the day before my visit, 13 more would-be interlopers, some from Gambia and Afghanistan, were caught.\n\nNow, though, there is a different kind of threat along this lonely border, with its dense pine and spruce forests and boggy terrain.\n\nThough the rapid response unit who took me on patrol could not talk about their mission, they have been instructed to look out for low-flying drones and other possible military incursions.\n\n'The wheels of history are always turning and now they have come full circle,' remarked the unit's leader. \n\n'We are in the same situation as my grandfather was in World War II, and I will honour his memory.'\n\nAs we juddered along in an armoured car, this amiable 46-year-old father of three's mood darkened, and he recounted his forebears' memories of Stalin's army. \n\nTheir animalistic behaviour had made the Nazis seem like gentlemen by comparison, he seethed. \n\nThey raped Polish women, murdered children, and given the opportunity he had no doubt that they would do the same today.\n\n'You have to remember that the mentality of Russian people is different to ours,' he said. 'The price of life in the East is so much lower than in the West. \n\n'If I had a Russian soldier in my sights and a child was near him, I wouldn't fire. If the situation was reversed, the Russian would kill me, and then the kid.'\n\nIt was only one man's opinion, but with Putin intent on pushing this proud nation to the brink and beyond, a reminder of the horrors that would unfold should the West fail to meet his threat.\n\nHorrors that might transpire to have been preluded by the crushing of sunflowers in a farmer's field.","summary":"The field behind Jan Michalak's farmhouse hosts a magnificent stand of giant sunflowers.

Fox’s Jesse Watters said he no longer cares if Democrats label Comey’s case as “revenge.” He asked Tarlov whether members of her party ever thought “this would happen.” (RELATED: Former Federal Prosecutor Breaks Down How Comey Leaked Details To Media)\n\n“They did!” Tarlov said. “Which is why Biden gave preemptive pardons because he knew you were a vengeful bunch of babies!”\n\nWatters hit back.\n\n“But who didn’t get it? Who didn’t get the pardon? Comey didn’t get the pardon,” Watters said. “So this is just the beginning. Everybody has to have their house in order. They’ve got to make sure their taxes are right. They’ve got to make sure they never lied to Congress. They have to make sure they never committed mortgage fraud because the difference here is these things are actual crimes. When you lie to Congress, it’s a crime. When you obstruct an official investigation that’s a crime. They didn’t have to bake up some fugazi, untested, unprecedented law [thing] like [Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin] Bragg.”\n\nIn December 2024, Biden granted clemency to nearly 1,500 individuals, including several Democratic politicians and public officials convicted on corruption charges. Biden also issued pardons to prominent figures, including his son Hunter Biden, Gen. Mark A. Milley and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Tarlov notably said on “The Five” on Sept. 8 that the move from the former president should have gone through the “proper” DOJ channels for his last-minute pardons.\n\nTarlov went on to say that former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who public reports indicate has family ties to Comey, resigned from his position Sept. 19 after President Donald Trump called for his removal.\n\n“Oh Erik Siebert! He’s basically Comey’s best friend. He got stuck in there, and then his son-in-law is in there! And then like all of Comey’s misfits are sitting in there. You get him out of there. Clean out the scum and put real people in there to do the job,” Watters said.\n\nTarlov told Watters that he just “hates accomplished people,” questioning whether he would consider Trump administration officials like current FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi who are willing to do the job. When Watters pushed back, calling Patel a “serious guy,” Tarlov responded by saying Patel once claimed he “didn’t know if Epstein ever trafficked anyone.”\n\n“We really don’t care what you guys say or what you think or how loud you’re complaining because you guys did this. You started it, and we’re gonna finish it,” Watters said.\n\nAccording to the DOJ, Comey faces one count of making an alleged false statement within jurisdiction of the legislative branch and one count of obstruction of a congressional investigation. The announcement from the Justice Department comes a day after reports speculated that the DOJ would ask a grand jury to indict Comey as a legal deadline for charges approaches.\n\nComey’s charges come after reports broke in July that the former FBI director and former CIA Director John Brennan were placed under criminal investigation for potential wrongdoing regarding the infamous Steele dossier as they had testified about it to Congress.\n\nThe former FBI director responded hours after the DOJ announced the charges, posting a nearly minute-long video to Instagram in which he said he and his family have known “for years” the “costs” of “standing up to” Trump but couldn’t “imagine living any other way.” He added that they would not “live on our knees.” He also asked viewers to stay “engaged” and pay attention.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

For the first time in Ryder Cup history, Team Europe won each of the first three matches on American soil to take an early 3-0 lead (Europe needs 14 points to retain the Cup). The final five matches of the day were knotted at 2.5-2.5, but Europe is right where they want to be. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM After the first three matches of the day didn't even reach the 16th hole, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele were able to birdie 18 to salvage the morning and grab a point. The afternoon session looked like it was going USA's way, but Tommy Fleetwood is cementing himself as a Ryder Cup legend. Down a hole, Fleetwood birdied 14 and then gave himself and Justin Rose a 1-up lead with another birdie on 16. Rose's birdie on 18 clinched Europe's fifth point, shortly after yet another dominant victory over Jon Rahm. Hometown kid Cameron Young and Justin Thomas, who lost alongside Bryson DeChambeau in the morning, took a dominant 6 & 5 win over Ludvig Aberg and Rasmus Hojgaard. Cantlay and Sam Burns came back from down two to halve the final match of the day. Rahm and Fleetwood combined to go 4-0-0 on Friday. Yes, that's the same Fleetwood who never even won a PGA Tour event until a month ago yet is now 9-3-2 in his Ryder Cup career. But Team Europe captain Luke Donald praised the Brit for being a \"world-class\" golfer. TRUMP GREETS BRYSON DECHAMBEAU AT RYDER CUP TO KICK OFF AFTERNOON SESSION \"It took him a little time and had to go through a few opportunities that let slip for sure, but I think that, you know, for Tommy, he reframes it in such a positive way. I think that if you see it in a positive way, the ones that get away, it only makes you stronger\" Donald said after Friday's play. \"I think Tommy, he's a guy that just loves being around the team. He loves contributing to that team. Yeah, he's a nice player to play with. I think he's at the top of the list of a lot of guys on the team that people want to play with.\" Simultaneously, Scottie Scheffler and DeChambeau combined to go 0-4-0, with Scheffler, the world No. 1, never even making it to the 17th hole. USA now needs to mount a comeback if it wants to avoid being the first team to lose on home soil since it did so in 2012.

As with everyone else who was tuned in, they were hearing this information for the first time.\n\nWhile Ireland may feel quite far away from Brussels, some journalists may have been straight on the phone to these officials for an explanation on one topic above all.\n\n“We will also put forward a series of packages on affordability and the cost of living,” Ms von der Leyen said. “The first is energy. When energy costs rise, it is not just numbers on a bill. It is every single part of people's lives that is affected.\n\n Energy bills are still a real source of anxiety for millions of Europeans\n\nShe said the EU would act to get rid of “dirty Russian fossil fuels”, create “clean homegrown energy”, invest in infrastructure and interconnectors, along with a new grids package to boost the capacity of the grid. She even explicitly referenced nuclear power, which raised an eyebrow in many quarters.\n\nShe added: “And to go with that, I am presenting today a new initiative called 'Energy Highways'. We have identified eight critical bottlenecks in our energy infrastructure.\n\n“From the Øresund Strait to the Sicilian Canal. We will now work to remove these bottlenecks one by one. We will bring governments and utilities together to address all outstanding issues, because Europeans need affordable energy right now.” \n\nThe European Commission officials were none the wiser as she spoke on what these energy highways would be, how they’d bring ordinary families’ energy bills down, and how soon they would.\n\nThe announcement just adds to their in-tray of multiple sets of policies, laws, and guidelines developed in recent years aimed at doing just that, which officials admit “don’t get much attention”.\n\nWhile Ms von der Leyen’s comments on Israel and migration may have grabbed more headlines — and may explain why she kept the contents of her speech so close in advance — it may be the direction Europe now takes on energy that could have the most tangible effect on Irish households in the months and years to come.\n\n‘It doesn’t matter how good any legislation is if it’s not implemented’ \n\nNobody in Ireland who is about to see their bills surge as we head into winter would disagree that some action is badly needed. In the last few weeks, we’ve seen Bord Gáis Energy, Energia, SSE Airtricity, Flogas, and Pinergia all announce they would be hiking their prices.\n\nThe cost of living developed into a full blown crisis after Russia invaded Ukraine, but inflation for the essentials we need has had an unwelcome resurgence in recent times. Grocery prices are rising significantly. Insurance price rises far outstrip general inflation. Fuel remains stubbornly high.\n\nAnd then we have energy. All eyes are on the budget in just a few weeks’ time and whatever form Government supports may take.\n\nBut, at European level, there are a slew of measures under way with the overall goal to reduce the bills that consumers receive. Prompted by the geopolitical events in recent years, the need to get a grip on all of this was only heightened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“The priority was always to try to secure lower prices,” one senior European Commission official said this week.\n\n Diversifying away from Russian gas was the fundamental driving force of these policies. Had we continued to trade with Russia, the EU as a political organ would’ve been dead\n\n“To bring down prices, we need to become more energy independent. And we need to speed up the energy transition.” \n\nThere is no one single plan to do that, but many with lofty titles and acronyms.\n\nThere’s the affordable energy action plan, published earlier this year, setting out eight actions EU countries can take to reduce the cost of energy bills. It includes all the kinds of things we hear about regularly at home, including building grid capacity, improving energy efficiency of buildings, and building resilience from extreme weather events and cyberattacks.\n\nThere’s the RePowerEU roadmap, published in May, on plans to end Russia gas and oil imports once and for all.\n\nJust this week, as part of Donald Trump’s lengthy diatribe against pretty much everyone in his major United Nations speech, he was disdainful of Europe’s continued reliance on Russian imports, which is a position European officials admit isn’t ideal. Albeit he did go further and claim that climate change was a hoax and all the efforts to pivot to renewables were a waste of time.\n\nElsewhere, the European Union is also working on things like a citizens energy package, a heating and cooling strategy, an electrification action plan, and a revised EU energy security framework.\n\nThe forthcoming grids package, meanwhile, aims to accelerate the expansion, modernisation, and digitalisation of grids. There’s also the renewable energy directive, which sets targets in many areas such as transport, buildings, planning laws, industry, and skills.\n\nIt’s all meant to contribute to countries in very different situations. Poland still relies heavily on coal. Slovakia and Hungary still look heavily to Russian gas. \n\nWhile some look to phase out nuclear power, others are looking increasingly towards it. Out on its own at the edge of Europe, Ireland is aiming to boost its infrastructure with the new Celtic interconnector to France.\n\nAnd when it comes to targets, officials say European countries are falling short in many areas of what they have signed up to.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how good any legislation is if it’s not implemented,” one commission official said this week. \n\n“On renewable targets, we’ve issued formal notice to 26 member states in July (including Ireland) over failing to notify us on directives around renewable energy in all sectors of the economy.\n\n“There’s a limited ambition gap, in terms of what member states have put forward. We need to stay on track and continue on the course.” \n\n ‘There’s a major problem there’ \n\nIreland is certainly one of the countries that must up its game.\n\nIn Eurostat figures covering the 10 years from 2013 to 2022, Ireland was just among a handful of EU countries that increased its emissions in this time.\n\nSimilarly, Ireland’s overall share of energy coming from renewable sources in 2023 was the fourth worst in the EU. This improved in 2024, but more is needed to meet the targets set out by the EU for 2030 and beyond.\n\nOfficials say meeting these targets is not just an abstract concept or an arbitrary goal. Achieving them can make a big difference to energy security and affordability.\n\nOne European Commission official even singled out Ireland during a discussion on data centre and the bloc’s energy efficiency directive this week.\n\n“We say ‘there’s a major problem there, how are you dealing with that, are you trying to reduce data consumption, or implement minimum performance requirements’,” the official said, adding that incentives must be given to take the right action amid congestion and struggles on the grid.\n\nIn terms of the energy efficiency directive, the European Commission has said it wants energy consumption to go down in absolute terms rather than as a proportion of a country’s GDP, which the official said Ireland had been critical of. It is worth noting here that it comes at a time when Ireland’s economy is rising at among the fastest rate in Europe.\n\n“Ireland has said ‘we expect population growth, we want to produce hydrogen, we have data centres during an AI boom’,” he said.\n\n“My personal feeling is going forward, when we revise the directive in five years’ time, we will not be able to get away with an absolute target again.” \n\nOn data centres, Ireland is among the few countries in Europe with a large concentration of them. They already guzzle up more electricity than all urban homes in the country.\n\nThe Government has signalled its support for them as crucial to the economy, but will soon face obligations to adhere to European regulations aimed at making the information about their operation across the bloc more transparent.\n\nIn a recent EU report on the sustainability of data centres, Ireland faced criticism as it “struggled to implement the necessary systems” to capture data on them effectively. A second report due in October is expected to provide a more detailed picture on the sector in Ireland.\n\nThe European Commission plans to bring in a publicly available database setting out key information on data centres across the continent, with member states obliged to capture and supply this information.\n\nFurthermore, it plans to develop a rating system to rank the sustainability of data centres similar to how homes in Ireland have a BER rating.\n\nFooting the bill \n\nIreland's solution to sky high energy bills, at least in the short term during the crisis, has been to give every household money off their electricity. In recent weeks, ministers such as Simon Harris have admitted keeping the likes of these supports indefinitely is “not a good way to run a country”.\n\nIn the long term, fundamental changes to how much energy we consume and where we source it from, can be the more sustainable way to bring down energy bills.\n\nThe work that began to accelerate under the last government in a range of areas continues, including in the retrofitting of homes and renewable energy.\n\nEarlier this week, energy minister Darragh O’Brien announced a slew of new solar, wind, and other projects under the fifth renewable electricity support scheme that he said had secured enough energy capacity to power 357,000 homes.\n\n“The deployment and connection of wind and solar energy generation at pace and at scale to our electricity grid benefits households and businesses by shielding them from volatile fossil fuel imports using our indigenous natural energy resources,” he said.\n\nUnder government schemes to end of 2024, 186,000 homes had benefitted from home energy upgrade supports. The 53,984 homes retrofitted via State support in 2024 was an increase of 13% on the previous year.\n\nNew legislation planned will pave the way for district heating in Ireland — where multiple buildings can be warmed through one hub — and the Government is also plotting its own new energy affordability action plan on the back of Europe’s. However, this work isn’t fixing all the issues we’re facing.\n\nOn top of companies hiking their prices, households face more money being added to their bills this winter due to the regulator ordering further increases to electricity network charges that will see an average of €29 added to a customer’s bill if the energy firm passes it on as expected.\n\nIt follows a hike of just over €100 to network charges last year, with further rises expected in the coming years to fund upgrades and maintenance to the electricity grid.\n\n“Investments planned for 2026 will further strengthen the network’s ability to meet growing demand efficiently,” the Commission for Regulation of Utilities said.\n\nAt an Oireachtas committee, the ESB has itself admitted problems with the grid that are affecting homes being connected, demonstrating how vital it is we get the grid into the shape needed for the future.\n\nWhile highlighting Ireland for a 7% fall in electricity emissions between 2023 and 2024, the Climate Change Advisory Council has been pessimistic on Ireland’s current prospects.\n\n“Renewable energy is still not being rolled out fast enough, and insufficient investment in the electricity grid means that some of the renewable energy we currently generate cannot be used,” the council said.\n\n Emissions are currently projected to exceed the sectoral emissions ceiling, even in the most optimistic scenario\n\nIt has called for urgent action to improve Ireland’s energy resilience, ease planning issues, and reduce costs for consumers through regulatory changes.\n\nIt added: “The council expresses its deep disappointment at Ireland’s failure to transpose the recast Energy Efficiency Directive on time, including the failure to establish a publicly accessible reporting mechanism on the sustainability of data centres operating in Ireland.” \n\nThe European Commission's ambitions to make us all more energy efficient, sustainable, and independent are laudable. It sets demands on its members, including Ireland, to take action and take action now.\n\nIn the long term, its myriad of plans could well bring our bills down substantially and prevent a lurch from crisis to crisis.\n\nHowever, we’re a long way away from that at the minute. More work has to be done in Brussels, but then also replicated in Dublin. And Paris. And Copenhagen. And so on.\n\nSome of the others have a big head start on Ireland. On the grid, on renewable energy sources, on retrofitting — and despite the significant investment that will be needed — we cannot afford to lose any momentum.\n\nIf we don’t, in the long term, it’ll be households who foot the bill. Again.","summary":"New legislation will pave the way for district heating in Ireland and the Government is also plotting its own new energy affordability action plan on the back of Europe’s.

Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw California’s election map, major fundraisers on both sides of the ballot measure have raised more than $112 million in total, drawing political donations from Silicon Valley billionaires as well as Republican and Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C.\n\nSo far, Newsom’s Yes campaign has outraised its two main fundraising opponents 2-to-1. Proposition 50 supporters reported hundreds of thousands of individual donations, while the No camp has relied primarily on a single wealthy donor.\n\nNewsom’s gerrymandering proposal explicitly seeks to flip five seats held by California Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives by persuading voters to approve new maps tilted in favor of his Democratic Party. The goal is to counter a similar move by GOP lawmakers in Texas at the direction of President Donald Trump ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“The outcome could very well determine control of the House of Representatives in 2026,” said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College. “The presence of big money indicates big money donors understand those stakes.”\n\nAs the Nov. 4 election draws nearer, the Yes and No campaigns are using that cash to flood voters’ social media feeds, television screens and mailboxes with a barrage of political ads.\n\nThis week, popular New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appeared in ads in both English and Spanish imploring Californians to support the measure, which would allow Democrats to temporarily draw gerrymandered maps in response to what they describe as a “power grab” by Trump and his Texas allies. Republicans, meanwhile, have turned to Arnold Schwarzenegger, who pushed for California’s current nonpartisan election maps while governor, to make the case against the proposal.\n\nNewsom’s campaign committee has raised more than $77.5 million from his allies, including Bay Area tech titans and labor unions, according to campaign filings submitted this week. The campaign said it has received more than 750,000 individual donations.\n\n“Prop 50 is America’s best chance to stop this reckless and dangerous president, and we will keep doing everything we can to ensure every Californian knows the stakes and is ready to vote Yes on 50 this Nov 4th,” Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson with the Yes campaign, said in a statement.\n\nThe largest individual donor on the Yes side is the Fund for Policy Reform, an advocacy group funded by liberal billionaire megadonor George Soros, which contributed at least $10 million to the campaign. The California Teachers Association donated $3 million, while venture capitalist and California Forever backer Michael Morowitz contributed $2.5 million.\n\nTrump, who has previously demanded that Soros be jailed, this week asked the Department of Justice to investigate Soros’ Open Society Foundation, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife, businesswoman Wendy Schmidt, each contributed $500,000 to a separate committee supporting the measure. There are no limits on campaign contributions to ballot measure committees in California.\n\nThe primary campaign committee fighting the redistricting plan is being bankrolled by Charles Thomas Munger, Jr., a Palo Alto billionaire, physicist and son of a former Berkshire Hathaway executive. He has funded nearly all of the roughly $30 million the committee has raised so far.\n\n“We started communicating with voters early about the consequences of having politicians draw their own lines. We are confident we’ll have the resources necessary to continue through Election Day,” the No campaign said in a statement. “Our coalition is a bipartisan, diverse group who believe that people, not politicians should draw the lines.”\n\nPowerful interest groups representing Democrats and Republicans in Congress have also poured money into the race.\n\nThe House Majority PAC, which supports Democrats in congressional races, has contributed $7.6 million to Newsom’s redistricting campaign. According to election filings, the group’s Republican counterpart, the Congressional Leadership Fund, accounts for the vast majority of the roughly $5 million raised by a committee led by former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from Bakersfield.\n\nPitney said deep-pocketed donors’ plans to continue shelling out millions to sway the election could depend on whether other states follow the lead of Texas and California and move forward with redistricting proposals before the midterm elections.\n\nIt could also depend on polling results as the election approaches, Pitney said. Last month, a UC Berkeley poll found that 48% of voters support the measure, 32% oppose it and 20% remain undecided. Younger voters and voters of color were more likely to be unsure about the proposal, according to the poll. The measure needs a simple majority to pass.\n\nPolitical analysts have forecast campaign contributions in the race could reach as high $200 million. While expensive, that would still fall far short of California’s priciest ballot measure battle — the $460 million fight over dueling initiatives to legalize sports betting in 2022.\n\nStill, Pitney said he wouldn’t be surprised to see more campaign money flow into the redistricting battle.\n\n“This is existential,” he said. “On the House side, everything hinges on who’s in the majority. Very few things are more important than this. Maybe nuclear war, but not much else.”","summary":"There are less than 40 days until voters decide on Gov.

Away from their phone screens and the big screen and towards the sky.\n\nIt was 11am and a thunderous noise was rolling down the 18th fairway. The rumble grew louder and soon the cheers grew louder, too, as the blue underbelly of Air Force One came into focus.\n\nThe crowd hollered and chanted ‘U-S-A’. They sung ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ and, for a moment, they forgot the carnage that was unfolding below. Because, by the time President Donald Trump landed in this corner of New York, the first morning of the 45th Ryder Cup was almost done.\n\nThere was only one match left out on the course - Europe had already wrapped up the other three. 'The team is not doing so well... so when I heard that, I said \"Let's go on the plane we have to try and help them,\"' Trump said.\n\nIn the end, he hung around for just 16 drives; one estimate put the cost of his trip at more than $16million. And what return did American taxpayers see on that investment? Nothing, according to the leaderboard. Team USA ended the afternoon fourballs even further behind Europe. \n\nOn Friday, it was Luke Donald, rather than the Donald, who sprinkled gold on this Black course.\n\nDonald Trump jetted into the Ryder Cup to try and inspire Team USA against Europe on Friday\n\nThe president and his granddaughter Kai arrive at the Ryder Cup in Farmingdale, New York \n\nThey cleared the roads for Trump's motorcade but by midday, when he wandered out of the players’ tunnel to take his seat among the crowd, many had decided that the president ought to be more than a spectator. He should replace one of Keegan Bradley’s struggling team. ‘Donald, where are your sticks?’ someone shouted.\n\nWho knows if the president brought his clubs. But he did arrive at least half-prepared to play. \n\nEarlier on Friday morning, Trump had stepped on to the White House lawns in a dark suit and bright white shoes. Golf shoes. It was quite a look. But then again, the area around the first tee was full of odd images.\n\nTake the panes of thick glass that formed a semicircle around the president, his granddaughter Kai and his entourage. \n\nOr the four snipers – dressed all in black - who were applauded as they climbed to the top of the grandstand before unloading their giant rifles.\n\nOr the sight of Trump leaving his glass cage to wander on to the first tee with Bryson DeChambeau. But perhaps nothing was quite as bonkers as Bradley greeting his commander-in-chief.\n\nTrump took his seat - at the foot of the stand - shortly before the teams emerged for the afternoon session and Bradley was among the first out.\n\nThe Team USA captain pointed at Trump and then performed the president’s signature jig. Finally, Bradley feigned to bow down at the feet of Trump.\n\nTrump greets his friend, DeChambeau, ahead of the afternoon fourballs on Friday\n\nThe president was given a rousing reception by the crowd gathered behind the first tee\n\nHis players were only slightly more restrained. Rookie JJ Spaun danced in front of the president, too, while Scottie Scheffler gave Trump a passionate fist pump. \n\nOthers lined up for a chance to shake his hand including Collin Morikawa. Clearly it didn’t take him or his captain long to get over the massacre of Friday morning.\n\nAs for the visitors? Well European captain Luke Donald was cordial enough. Several of his players wandered past without even a glance at Trump but Rory McIlroy did wave. The crowd gave their president a raucous welcome, too.\n\nNever before, in the 98-year history of the Ryder Cup, has a sitting US President been in the stands. But Trump does tend to have more time for sport than convention.\n\nSince returning to the Oval Office in January, Air Force One has been busy ferrying him around the country to some of the biggest events in the calendar: the Super Bowl, UFC fights, the Daytona 500, the college wrestling championships, the Club World Cup final, the US Open men’s singles final. And now the Ryder Cup.\n\nSo at least law enforcement are used to preparing for days such as these. But the recent assassination of Trump’s political ally, Charlie Kirk, only heightened fears of more bloodshed.\n\nThere was already a vast security operation - including drones and bomb-disposal dogs - but on Friday the Ryder Cup ramped it another few notches.\n\nSome secret service agents surrounded Trump. Others greeted every fan who tried to get near the first tee. There was airport-style security and police dogs patrolling outside the clubhouse.\n\nBethpage Black was on red alert, with snipers and the secret service on hand to protect Trump\n\nSpectators had to pass through TSA-style security at the main gate and the first tee\n\nA number of items were banned including rangefinders. Thomas Matthew Crooks was reportedly seen with the common golf gadget before he shot Trump in Pennsylvania last year.\n\nIt wasn’t long ago that Trump was a golfing pariah. Here, though, he has been treated like a deity. DeChambeau said earlier this week that he hoped the president could inspire the United States to victory. Bradley went even further on Friday.\n\n‘We just had the president fly over in Air Force One. I think things are going to turn here,’ he said towards the end of the morning session.

Scheffler didn’t reach the 17th hole in either of his losses.\n\nScheffler became the first No. 1 player since Tiger Woods in 2002 at The Belfry to lose both his matches on opening day of the Ryder Cup.\n\nAnd the Americans were lucky the deficit wasn’t slightly worse. McIlroy had a 12-foot birdie putt, the final shot of a long day, that broke just left of the cup as he and Shane Lowry settled for a halve with Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns.\n\nTrump became the first sitting U.S. president to attend the Ryder Cup. He was behind protective glass at first, then walked to the first tee for the afternoon session with DeChambeau. He left a little earlier than planned, perhaps not liking what he saw.\n\nU.S. captain Keegan Bradley was on the first tee some 90 minutes before the matches even got started, trying to rile up the crowd — the massive grandstand surrounding the first tee and 18th green was full in the darkness — for a loud and noisy opening session. He grabbed a microphone and said to the crowd, “Let’s (expletive) go, boys!”\n\nBradley also sent out DeChambeau in the opening session, the two-time major champion and entertainer who had said this summer he wanted to bring energy and a “tsunami” of a crowd.\n\nHe pulled out driver and ripped it 344 yards over the trees, leading to a birdie and the first red score on the board for the Americans. He wanted to deliver a clear message.\n\nAnd then the Europeans delivered blue points, filling the board with three blowouts for a 3-1 lead in foursomes, and then two more wins and the halve in the afternoon.\n\n“The morning, although it was great, it was just one part of a long race,” Rahm said. “We started great and we have to keep it going. That’s what we did.”\n\nRahm went 2-0, with Tyrrell Hatton in foursomes and Sepp Straka in fourballs, and his putting was sublime. In the fourballs match, he made five birdies of at least 9 feet, none bigger than his 20-footer on the 15th on top of Scheffler’s 25-foot birdie that appeared — briefly — to give the Americans some hope.\n\nThe Spaniard is now unbeaten in 11 of his last 12 matches in the Ryder Cup, a streak that began with his singles win over Woods in Paris in 2018.\n\nFleetwood, coming off his first win on U.S. soil to capture the FedEx Cup at the Tour Championship, partnered with McIlroy in the morning and one of his English heroes, Justin Rose, in the afternoon.\n\nIt was Fleetwood’s 18-foot birdie putt on the 16th in the afternoon — which DeChambeau failed to match — that paved the way for another European point.\n\n“The scoreboard is what counts,” Fleetwood said. “We obviously feel very prepared, and we’ve been looking forward to this day for a long time now. So to have got off to a good start feels great. Their team is stacked with amazing players, so whoever it is, the match going to be difficult, and the points mean so much.”\n\nThe crowd felt like it belonged at a New York Yankees game, making the occasional insult but rarely a lasting wave of noise because the Americans gave them so little to cheer. McIlroy and Robert MacIntyre had to back off shots when someone from the gallery yelled as they stood over the ball.\n\nSomeone yelled, “Fore, right!” just as Rahm was to take the club away on his first shot.\n\nEurope played through the heckling, match by match building a lead that surely got the Americans’ attention going into another day of eight team matches.\n\nThere were a few bright spots for the Americans. Patrick Cantlay helped avoid a shutout in the opening session when he partnered with new father Xander Schauffele for a 2-up win in foursomes. And he nearly carried Sam Burns to victory in the final match, settling for a halve.\n\nCameron Young, who won a New York State Open at Bethpage Black when he was in college, returned home to his native state and hammered his way with Justin Thomas to the shortest match of the day, a 6-and-5 fourballs win.\n\nRyder Cup rookie J.J. Spaun, the U.S. Open champ from San Dimas, was paired with Scheffler in the afternoon against Rahm and Straka in a 3 and 2 loss for the U.S. Two-time major champion Collin Morikawa was paired with Harris English in the morning and lost 5 and 4 to McIlroy and Fleetwood in the third match of the day.\n\nAfter Saturday, Team USA has a three-point deficit to a European team that looks strong as ever.\n\n“We’ve only played 28% of the points,” Bradley said. “This is first quarter. We’ve still got three quarters to go. I’ve got a lot of faith in my boys.”","summary":"Rahm leads off morning and afternoon sessions with wins as U.S. top players are shut out.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/26/ryder-cup-rahm-leads-europes-charge-to-first-day-lead/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25269777022395.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 23:37:28","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":363831302,"title":"Europe grab 3-1 lead as US seek Trump boost at Ryder Cup","text":"FARMINGDALE: Europe delivered a stunning early domination of the United States to quiet a raucous New York crowd and seize a 3-1 lead as US President Donald Trump arrived for Friday’s opening matches of the 45th Ryder Cup.\n\nTrump was faced with American carnage at Bethpage Black as Europe started 3-0 for the first time on US soil.\n\n“Very proud.

The “Fleetwood Mc” Cup pairing improved to 3-0.\n\n“It has been amazing,” McIlroy said.\n\nMcIlroy, who won the Masters in April to complete a career Grand Slam, won four holes on birdie putts from eight feet or less and blasted from the rough to inches from the sixth hole to set up a Fleetwood birdie.\n\n“One step at a time,” Fleetwood said. “We’ll go all together and see where we get.” Europe’s Matt Fitzpatrick and Ludvig Aberg also won four of the first six holes and never trailed in shocking top-ranked Scottie Scheffler and third-ranked Russell Henley 5&3.\n\n“We hit a lot of nice shots and made it hard for them,” Aberg said. Taking down the two highest-ranked US players was big for Europe.\n\n“Russ and I did some good things. We just didn’t hole enough putts early,” Scheffler said. “We had some chances. The putts just didn’t fall.” Spain’s Jon Rahm and England’s Tyrrell Hatton outfought Bryson DeChambeau and Justin Thomas 4&3, the Americans winning only the first hole as the European duo improved to 5-0 in Cup foursomes.\n\n“We were aware it was going to be a tough day,” Rahm said. “We battled. We stayed in it. We started hitting putts and found our rhythm and were able to get it done again.” “We dug in,” Hatton said. “The atmosph-ere was pretty intense but good fun.” \n\nAmericans Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay never trailed in beating Europe’s Robert MacIntyre and Viktor Hovland 2-up, taking the last two holes after a Europe rally.\n\n“It was a tough match,” Cantlay said. “Nice to get the point on the board and the fans going.” Trophy holders Europe seek the first road triumph by either side since their 2012 “Miracle at Medinah” while the Americans try to win back the Cup after losing two years ago in Rome.\n\nThe Americans need 14.5 points to win the Cup. Europe, winners in 10 of the past 14 meetings, need only 14 of 28 points to retain the trophy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 27th, 2025","summary":"FARMINGDALE: Europe delivered a stunning early domination of the United States to quiet a raucous New York crowd and seize a 3-1 lead as US President Donald Trump arrived for Friday’s opening matches of the 45th Ryder Cup.\n\n\n\nTrump was faced with American carnage at Bethpage Black as Europe started 3-0 for the first time on US soil.\n\n\n\n“Very proud.

It states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”\nThe clause has long been interpreted to mean that anyone born on US soil is a citizen-regardless of their parents’ immigration status. This interpretation was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1898 in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which ruled in favor of a man born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant parents who were denied reentry after traveling abroad.\nWith few exceptions, including children of foreign diplomats, birthright citizenship has remained a bedrock of American immigration and constitutional law.","summary":"The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of ending birthright citizenship, challenging the 14th Amendment and a federal judge's injunction.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/can-birthright-citizenship-be-ended-president-trump-asks-supreme-court-ws-l-9599394.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/Donald-Trump-H-1B-Visa-New-Fee-100000-REUTERS-2025-09-cd1808833ec64dff030fedfa72fced1c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 23:29:07","author":"News18,Ranu Joardar","authors":["News18","Ranu Joardar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":363821612,"title":"Ironic Hillary Clinton twist emerges in Trump DOJ’s indictment of James Comey: report","text":"The allegation against former FBI Director James Comey, that he leaked sensitive information to the media, may ironically not have been related to an investigation into Donald Trump, according to a new report.\n\nComey, who the president fired in 2017, is accused in a federal indictment of authorizing an anonymous leak about an ongoing federal investigation and making false statements and obstructing justice during congressional testimony in September 2020.\n\nDuring questioning in the Senate at the time, Comey defended the truthfulness of prior testimony where he said he did not authorize FBI investigations into Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to be leaked to the press.\n\nBut the indictment, made public Thursday, does not identify which specific leaked details or news reports are at the heart of the case.\n\nIn 2016 the FBI was investigating one matter concerning Hillary Clinton and the potential sharing or improper storage of classified information on a private email server, and a separate investigation of Donald Trump and potential Russian election interference. \n\nOfficials involved in the case told CNN that the false statement charge appears to center on leaks to the media about the investigation into Clinton’s emails.\n\nTrump has vowed that Comey is only the first of his political adversaries to be charged, long-since accusing him of damaging his first term in office by leaking information to the press against him.\n\nThe president celebrated the charges in a Truth Social post, calling Comey “one of the worst human beings this country has ever been exposed to.”\n\nIt would be ironic if the accusations do refer to leaks in the Clinton case, as the former Secretary of State has also accused Comey of damaging her own campaign and helping Trump secure the White House for the first time in 2016.\n\nIn Comey’s indictment, he is accused of lying when he claimed he “had not ‘authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports’ regarding an FBI investigation concerning Person 1.”\n\n“Person 1” refers to Clinton, officials and people briefed on the case told CNN.\n\nThe indictment notes that a grand jury didn’t concur on an additional charge prosecutors originally sought, in which “Person 1” is referenced again regarding the “approval of a plan concerning Person 2” – which is Trump, officials told the outlet.\n\nMore details about the leak are expected to come out at trial. \n\nIf convicted, Comey faces up to five years in prison.

He pledged that the city would be made 'safe' for the World Cup despite the fact it is not currently hosting any games.\n\nHe added: 'If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup… because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it.\n\n'We'll move it around a little bit.

But that was just the start for the medical professionals who serve expecting mothers.\n\nThree San Diego obstetricians interviewed this week said the president’s advice has been on most maternal minds. Reactions have run the gamut from sincere concern to dark humor.\n\nDr. Ronald Salzetti, medical director of women’s health services at Scripps Health and department chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Scripps Clinic, said that his first day seeing patients after Tylenol got Trumped included an encounter with a quite-concerned patient.\n\n“She asked me, ‘Do I have to be worried, because I did take Tylenol at various points during the pregnancy?’” Salzetti said. “We kind of went through the studies that the President was quoting during the press conference, and then other data that we have access to through our societies and the opinions of both the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine.\n\n“After that, I think I was able to reassure her and that she was happy with that.”\n\nAnother late-term patient called, double-checking Tylenol as a recommended medication for pain and bringing down fever, while another, early in her pregnancy, wanted to discuss the drug in the context of Monday’s statements. All in all, Salzetti said, women seemed accepting of his evidence-backed advice that Tylenol can be safely used to address symptoms in pregnancy.\n\nCynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, MD, chair and professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine and perinatologist at UC San Diego Health, said that she has also found her recent patients eager to discuss Tylenol, though none have accepted the advice out of Washington Monday.\n\n“It was really funny because, I mean, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but everyone was like ‘Oh, yeah, of course I’m going to take Tylenol,’” Gyamfi-Bannerman said.\n\nOne pregnant patient, she said, found the situation humorous, asking for Tylenol at work as a joke. “And then she said, ‘Yeah, I would never take my medical advice from Donald Trump,” Gyamfi-Bannerman said.\n\nDr. Joanna Adamczak, chief medical officer at Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women and Newborns, said her doctors have been inundated with serious questions and concerns around Tylenol this week.\n\n“The sense that I’m getting from patients is sort of a mix of fear and guilt if women have taken acetaminophen during the pregnancy because, for example, they were suffering from a headache or a migraine,” Adamczak said. “Now some are worried or very concerned that they may have potentially caused harm to their unborn baby.”\n\nThe President’s remarks included advice for women to avoid Tylenol during pregnancy and to dose themselves only “in cases of extremely high fever that you feel you can’t tough it out.”\n\nThat’s where obstetricians have their greatest worry. Tylenol alternatives such as aspirin and ibuprofen can also bring down fevers, but both have strong evidence of detrimental effects to pregnant women and unborn babies. There is a caveat with aspirin. While it is not recommended in regular or high doses during pregnancy, low-dose baby aspirin is generally considered safe in certain applications.\n\nHaving women turn away from the drug with the least evidence of possible harm could have serious consequences. Concerns are greatest for fevers that are severe enough to cause hospital stays, including those caused by deadly conditions such as sepsis, a runaway overreaction of the immune system often triggered by an infection and resulting in high fever in addition to deadly inflammation that can shut down vital organs.\n\nNone of the local experts said they had yet encountered a pregnant patient who is unwilling to take Tylenol or its generic forms while suffering a severe fever, but there is concern that advice from such a formal source could prove overpowering.\n\n“If the leader of our country, the President, plus the health secretary, say this, you’re supposed to take those types of announcements seriously and actually listen to them,” Adamczak said. “I think some women, unfortunately, will take this to heart and will not listen to their doctor.”\n\nAnd there are other conditions beyond fever that can be fraught. Preeclampsia is a common medical complication in pregnancy that causes very high blood pressure that can have significant consequences, even death, if not treated quickly.\n\nTylenol, Gyamfi-Bannerman notes, is used as a sort of medical test in patients suspected of this condition. If Tylenol eases a pregnant woman’s severe headache, then preeclampsia is generally not the cause. But if it persists, then obstetricians generally induce delivery, which makes the condition abate.\n\nAn unwillingness to take Tylenol in this scenario, then, could send mother and baby down the wrong path.\n\n“We haven’t seen it yet, but, you know, (I’m) just concerned that we’re going to tell someone they have this really bad headache and their blood pressure is high, we’re going to give you Tylenol, and they turn around and say ‘no,’” Gyamfi-Bannerman said. “That might cause people to have preterm deliveries that weren’t needed.”\n\nIn addition to complicating risky situations, there is also concern that the federal advice on Tylenol simply makes more work for doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who already struggle to keep up with crushing workloads.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to spread the burden of explaining drug studies to worried patients, Salzetti said that the early going has revealed a possible Tylenol time sink.\n\n“With my first patient, we definitely went into a little bit more detail because of her level of concern was much greater,” Salzetti said. “That definitely took some time out of my morning to make sure she understood the data, understood what was said on both sides, and felt as comfortable as she could be that the risk, if any, was very low.”","summary":"Obstetricians in San Diego say that Trump's widely-disputed attack on acetaminophen brought immediate patient reactions from concern to humor","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/26/presidents-tylenol-statements-make-more-work-for-already-busy-doctors/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OCR-Z-TYLENOL-PREGNANT-KFF.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 23:10:30","author":"Paul Sisson","authors":["Paul Sisson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":363832450,"title":"At annual legislative conference, Black lawmakers confront Trump-era cuts and civil rights setbacks","text":"By MATT BROWN, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Congressional Black Caucus kicked off its annual legislative conference this week, which has been upended by President Donald Trump’s second term and by the presence of National Guard patrols near the conference’s venue.\n\nThe 62-member caucus, all of whom are Democrats, gathered with business leaders, activists, policy experts, local government officials, and other professionals from across the country to strategize how to build its new agenda and to counter Trump’s policies, which have disrupted federal government programs that address civil rights, education, healthcare, housing, immigration and labor policy, among other areas.\n\nWhile this year’s conference has featured the usual panels, strategy sessions and cocktail parties, many attendees hoped to hear from the “conscience of the Congress” — a moniker bestowed on the CBC for its civil rights work — about what lessons can be learned from American history for the current political climate, and how lawmakers would govern should they win future elections.\n\nHere are some comments from the CBC lawmakers who attended this year’s conference:\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina\n\n“This is probably going to be one of the most consequential weeks that you have ever spent in your lives,” said Clyburn, the former House Democratic leader, during an address at the outset of the conference. “Take it from me: we are on the precipice of losing this democracy. We are. And if you don’t think so, take a journey through the history of the country.”\n\n“I would hope that I would not leave this Earth, and my children and grandchildren would not be sentenced to having to live the life that their grandparents and parents lived,” said the 85-year-old congressman.\n\nRep. Yvette Clarke of New York\n\n“This is not a conventional time. This is the time that we make for ourselves our own destiny,” Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an address to conference attendees.\n\n“This is not a situation where we can necessarily say, well, look, those people in Congress have got it. Because the Congress is broken,” Clarke said. “We delivered democracy to the United States of America. Were it not for the abolitionists, were it not for the Civil Rights leaders, were it not for the foot soldiers on the ground, we’d still be living in apartheid. So let’s get it straight and let’s straighten up our backs.”\n\nClarke added: “I believe in us because were it not for the folks who came before me, I wouldn’t be standing here today as chairwoman of the largest Black Caucus in the history of the United States.”\n\nRep. Jennifer McClellan of Virginia\n\n“It’s not that if (Democrats) get the gavel, we rebuild back to what we had. We are also taking this opportunity to see what we can start from scratch,” said McClellan.\n\n“There are some Republicans in the committee rooms, or in delegations, who share our concerns on some issues, whether it’s the NIH funding cuts, whether it’s First Amendment issues, or whether it’s clean energy rollbacks. And they are taking their concerns behind the scenes to the administration. And in some cases, they’ve been successful and at least making the bad less bad.”\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland\n\n“It’s going to be a new day, in part because they’ve changed the governing structure so much,” Ivey said of how Democrats are planning on governing in response to Trump’s changes to the federal government.\n\n“Part of what we’re going to have to do is fire a big chunk of the bureaucracy that he’s putting in right now, just move them out and start over from scratch,” said Ivey, who represents the suburbs of Washington. “And we’ve got to make sure we understand that for a lot of the legislation we’ve done, we rely on particular government agencies to make it work. That’s not going to fly anymore. The Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division is an example of that.”\n\nRep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California\n\n“The reality is that some of the bad stuff is just going to happen,” said Kamlager-Dove. “There is no strategy to stop some of the bad stuff except to continue to educate folks about the hypocrisy and the duplicity that is happening.”\n\n“Many of these special elections, many of these local elections that are happening ever since Donald Trump came into office and started implementing his Project 2025, Democrats have been winning,” she said. “The strategy is to engage community-based organizations. The strategy is to work more diligently with our legal community. The strategy is to take everything to the court. The strategy is to create some outrage.

An elusive away victory is now palpable to touch, as the last time either side overcame a first-day deficit of this size was in 1999, when the US triumphed at the Battle of Brookline. \n\nThe 2025 edition at Bethpage Black is suffused with an even greater rancour. The sober morning crowd were quiet and subdued during Europe’s dominant foursomes start, but Donald Trump’s appearance at the start of the of the afternoon fourballs was the trigger to let loose all manner of boorish behaviour from the galleries. The coarseness that Trump has permitted in daily American life in America jutted out from the crowds throughout.\n\nEuropean players bore the brunt of it, but the Americans were assailed by travelling fans too. The venom and volume of personal and family abuse was jarring, with the players’ march between holes transformed into something akin to Cerci Lannister’s walk of shame. The Ryder Cup atmosphere needs an edge, but this level of hostility is unsustainable. \n\nThis opening day swung on the performances of the leading men.\n\nJon Rahm was astonishing, brutalising Bryson DeChambeau and then Scottie Scheffler to win both of his matches without needing to darken either of the closing holes. McIlroy, meanwhile, teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood in the morning to hose Harris English and Collin Morikawa, and he then held his nerve marvellous duel with Burns and the flinty Cantlay. \n\nBy contrast, Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau registered a sum total of zero points from four matches. Given the Americans lack the Europe’s depth, this is precisely the misfire they could not afford. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the day, US captain Keegan Bradley was stopped for a snap, preliminary post-mortem on his team’s 3-1 foursomes pasting.\n\n“We just had the President fly over in Air Force One, so I have a feeling things will change here”, he replied. Moments earlier, Trump’s plane had screamed across the 15th fairway. \n\nThe President was introduced to the crowd at the first tee shortly before the start of the afternoon fourballs. While he was recently jeered at the US Open tennis elsewhere in New York, today Trump was drenched in adulation. He was led to a seat overlooking the first and final holes, screened by thick bulletproof glass, and Bradley paid homage whenever he passed his president, at one holding out his palms and bowing in supplication. Trump was greeted by all of the American players, many of whom doing so with a raised fist. Cap-doffing caddie Joe LaCava this time waved his hand in lengthy tribute before setting off with Cantlay for the final match.\n\nMany of the European players walked past Trump without acknowledging him, though McIlroy gave him a friendly wave.\n\nDonald Trump escorts Bryson DeChambeau and his playing partner Ben Griffin to the first tee.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nNot that the president was content to remain in his assigned seat. He sauntered down onto grass to meet Bryson DeChambeau, and escorted him to the first tee, at which Trump remained standing, largely alone, looking like a besuited man waiting patiently for a bus. Once DeChambeau and co. had journeyed off down the fairway, Trump turned to tell the crowd he loved them, and led a rendition of U!S!A!\n\nThe States’ made the fast start they needed, with Scheffler/Spaun taking the first hole against Rahm/Straka. The Euro duo, though, won holes two and three to establish a lead that they did not relinquish. \n\nScheffler entertained an abrupt revisit of his putting woes, and it took until his 33rd hole of the day to find his first birdie. Straka then poured in a monster putt to deny him the hole anyway. Two years ago, Scheffler became the first sitting world number one not to win a Ryder Cup point. Remarkably, he’s now facing a repeat mortification.\n\nDeChambeau, given little help by the hapless rookie Ben Griffin, was eventually tackled in the afternoon by Europe’s slow-burning duo of Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood. The latter did not win a hole until the 11th, though Rose drained a 46-foot putt to somehow tie the seventh after Griffin found the cup from closer to 60.\n\nBut having trailed since the fifth hole, Fleetwood made birdie from short range on 14 to splash the match in blue for the first time. DeChambeau strode off the green, with a face of thunder. They sealed the match 1-Up having been brought to the 18th.\n\nTrump, by the way, didn’t see any of this drama: he had left hours earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Cameron Young, surprisingly benched for the morning, teamed up with Justin Thomas to raze the European fourball duo of Ludvig Aberg and Rasmus Hojgaard 6&5 in a rare exhibit of American dominance. \n\nLowry rolled in a nerveless 20-footer on the second hole to tie his and McIlroy’s anchor match.\n\nThe subdued morning crowd meanwhile came to life, fortified as they were by Bethpage’s 19-dollar pints. McIllroy was forced to step back from a shot on the fifth fairway as insults tumbled too close to his backswing, moments after Lowry looked agitated by an adjacent comment. \n\nThe ferocity of both the crowd and the mid-afternoon sun was making things claustrophobic. Rory, though, brought his own noise, screaming “Come on!” at consecutive holed putts on five and six. Their 2-UP lead was wiped out by Cantlay’s steel on holes 12 and 13, however, the latter after McIlroy saw a short-range putt somehow lip out. McIlroy’s malign fates were satisifed, however, as Cantlay took approximately three days to hit a three-foot putt to take the lead on the 14th hole. It lipped out, and McIlroy walked off with a fist pump for the hectoring crowd. \n\nThey closed in dramatic stalemate from there, with McIlroy matching Cantlay’s birdie on 16 and Burns doing likewise with McIlroy’s on 17. McIlroy had a putt to win the match on 18, but saw it drift agonisingly wide. He and Lowry collapsed into each other and then their team-mates afterward, almost punch-drunk from the gauntlet they had just staggered. \n\nEurope’s players will be stepping more lightly home, however. This was as emphatic a start as they could have wished for. They need only nine more points from here. \n\nGavin Cooney\n\nViewcomments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Euope stand tall after a day of drama, Trump antics, and grim crowd abuse ”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Euope stand tall after a day of drama, Trump antics, and grim crowd abuse ”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

The Guard members won’t be making arrests, Lee said.\n\nThe majority-Black city also presents some stark differences compared with the nation's capital. It's roughly four times as expansive with almost 100,000 fewer residents.\n\nHere is how Memphis fits Trump's deployment plan:\n\n Memphis and Washington \n\nIn growing Tennessee, Memphis’ population has been declining, with nearly 611,000 people across nearly 300 square miles (776 square kilometers). Washington includes about 702,000 people in roughly 68 square miles (176 square kilometers).\n\nMemphis sees about half the number of visitors annually as Washington, with its wider path of sightseeing areas. Memphis might similarly see troops in tourist spots.\n\nThaddeus Johnson, a former Memphis police commander and a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice, worries the presence of troops could worsen Memphis’ economy.\n\n“Imagine a place like Memphis that already can’t compete when it comes to those things, they’re struggling with tourism and getting people to come and feel safe,” Johnson said. “I’m not sure if that’s going to bring businesses back.”\n\nJohnson said it’s important for people to feel safe in highly visited areas, but some neighborhoods have greater needs. Lee has pledged a long-term effort, but Johnson said that if the follow-through isn't enough, the situation could get worse before it gets better.\n\n Governor and mayor weigh in \n\nLee's estimate of 150 National Guard members came with the caveat that it's not finalized, and he's been hesitant to repeat it. And while authorities from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be in town starting next week, it's unclear when Guard members will arrive. Lee also said 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers will be in the region.\n\nTrump's Sept. 15 order setting up the Memphis task force calls for \"large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel\" and \"strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.\" \n\nLee has said the National Guard members will be from Tennessee, the vast majority of them military police, trained for law enforcement. He announced another $100 million from the state for public safety grants for Memphis.\n\nMemphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, has said Washington city officials told him the Guard functioned there more as “a large-scale neighborhood watch than frontline police officers.”\n\nYoung has said he didn't ask for the Guard's deployment and doesn't think it will reduce crime. He thinks the Guard can help Memphis the most through beautification: “clearing more vacant lots, removing more trash, and restoring more blocks.” \n\nHe also called for a federal hand in homelessness services, “from housing vouchers to tiny homes, from job readiness to mental health support.” Housing and health and human services agencies are in the Memphis task force.\n\n How Trump landed on Memphis \n\nLast month, Trump appeared on a Memphis radio show in which host Todd Starnes asked him if there was anything the president could do to help the city. Trump said what they are doing in Washington is “sort of a test” and, regarding Memphis, he said he was glad Starnes mentioned the city and that he “can put that early on the list.”\n\nMemphis was on FBI director Kash Patel's radar in May, when he called it “the homicide capital of America per capita” in a Fox News interview. \n\n“Didn’t know that,” Patel said. “We have a problem there. We’re now addressing it.” \n\nLee said Patel visited him at the Tennessee Capitol. Since May, the FBI says a Memphis operation has arrested some 500 people and produced 101 federal indictments of violent criminals.\n\nThen on Sept. 12, Trump announced he would send the National Guard to Memphis. He quipped that Chicago was his preference, where local politicians have fiercely resisted his plans, but he said the city was too “hostile” with “professional agitators.”\n\nIn Los Angeles, meanwhile, Trump in June deployed roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines after days of protests over immigration raids.\n\nDuring the September announcement, Trump said he decided to send troops into Memphis after Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena — who regularly visited the city while on the board of FedEx — urged him earlier in the week to address crime there.\n\n Crime numbers \n\nMemphis has endured gun violence issues for years. In 2023, the city saw a record of more than 390 homicides, and specific killings have topped headlines. But both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that Memphis is seeing recent decreases in some crime categories. \n\nAcross the first eight months of 2025 compared with the same period in previous years, Memphis police have reported that overall crime hit a 25-year low, and murder a six-year low. Johnson, with the Council on Criminal Justice, said the city still should provide more nuance since the police stats rely on total incidents, not the number of victims.\n\nA study by the Council on Criminal Justice of roughly 30 to 40 U.S. cities found that the homicide rate in Memphis was among the highest from 2018 through June 2025, and its rate was 58% higher in the first half of 2025 compared with the pre-pandemic first half of 2019. The average change across the large cities studied was a 14% decrease. \n\nMemphis' mid-2025 rate dropped 21% below its 2023 homicide peak.\n\nThe city outpaced others in recent declines in reported carjacking and motor vehicle theft, and it made roughly average drops in reported robbery, and residential and nonresidential burglary, the study found. Despite recent declines, motor vehicle theft remained well above 2019 levels.\n\nYoung said that even with rate decreases, work remains \"to get crime at a level where people really, really feel it.”","summary":"President Donald Trump wants to send National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, like he has in Washington, D.C.

They blitzed the morning foursomes 3-1 before Trump arrived and they withstood waves of pressure and fan abuse in shading an achingly brilliant fourballs session after he left. More pointedly still, Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau lost their matches on either side of that surreal visit.\n\nIndeed, whichever way you swung it, this tense opening day at the 45th Ryder Cup belonged to Europe. In planning, execution and mastery of the defining moments, the majority went the way of Luke Donald, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, Rory McIlroy and a collective that will resume the contest on Saturday with a commanding 5.5-2.5 lead.\n\n‘It was a great day,’ said Donald. ‘It was a great start and they grinded to edge the session in the afternoon. That is another box ticked. It is not easy here. They have the crowd but I am so proud of those guys – they can handle this stuff.’\n\nHow Europe wrestled control of the narrative was really quite something. Because it was always going to take a lot to upstage the presence of a sitting President. And even more so when that same man was minded to leave the protection of a bullet-proof screen in order to fist-bump DeChambeau on the tee before the second round of skirmishes.\n\nBut Europe pulled it off. In a foursomes session of utter dominance, the only consolation for Team USA was that Scottie Scheffler did not break down in tears. We will return to that point shortly, because it was only half the story in consideration of Europe then taking the fourballs 2.5-1.5.\n\nLet’s pause here for a pair of statistics: in each of the past five editions, the team that won the first foursomes went on to win by a landslide. Also, a three-point lead after day one has not been overhauled since the US won in 1999. That Europe have reached such a spot in an away match is deeply impressive, even if there are still 20 points to play for.\n\nAs in Rome two years ago, McIlroy was embedded in drama. Naturally he was a target for the New Yorkers – on the 11th hole during the afternoon, he appeared to flip his middle finger at the crowd, which grew rowdier with passing hour and drink.\n\nBut he took a win and one half from his two matches, initially in the alternate shot format with Tommy Fleetwood when they battered Collin Morikawa and Harris English 5&4, and later alongside Shane Lowry against Sam Burns and Cantlay. That match finished all square after the Americans fought back from two down through 11 holes. It was fabulous viewing – a stunning blend of birdies and errors from both sides.\n\nRahm, like Fleetwood, won both his matches and led from the front in each session via his collaborations with Tyrrell Hatton and Sepp Straka.\n\nBut nods were well earned by the wider ensemble, especially Matt Fitzpatrick. That being the same golfer who arrived here with only one point from eight ties and ranked 119th of the 119 who have played in the Cup since 1979.\n\nHe and Ludvig Aberg were sent out in the foursomes against Scheffler and the world No 3 Russell Henley in what was forecast to be a massacre. And it was. Europe won 5&4 and Fitzpatrick was majestic on and around the greens – the 12-footer he dropped below ground on the 15th summed up his day, but we might say the same for the chips to tap-in range on the first and third holes.\n\nScheffler? He was reduced to a non-entity, just as he was when Aberg and Viktor Hovland left him in tears in the same session in 2023. He wasn’t helped by Henley spraying the ball to all corners and missing so many putts, but Scheffler flopped badly. And he flopped again in the afternoon alongside JJ Spaun when they faced Rahm and Straka.\n\nThe Europeans trailed at the first, levelled on the second, and then led from the third to home through the brilliance, primarily, of Rahm and his six birdies. But Scheffler played a full 12 holes of that round before his first birdie – he was desperately poor for too long in that 3&2 defeat and only stirred when the rubber was almost out of reach.\n\nWe often make the comparison between Scheffler and Tiger Woods, which is entirely justified, but does it also extend to a diminished ability in the Ryder Cup, the one arena where Woods struggled?\n\nMaybe. But all observations on the first day of these gatherings must be written in pencil. For now, we can provisionally query elements of Bradley’s captaincy, which was given to him in haste once Woods turned it down and was dominated for months by the uncertainty over whether he would pick himself.\n\nHere, besides a trivial blooper by mixing up a couple of names in the opening ceremony, he made his first real misstep by sending out Collin Morikawa and Harris English for the foursomes against McIlroy and Fleetwood.\n\nTo follow the detailed analysis of Data Golf, which is favoured by the pros themselves in the data game, that Morikawa-English pairing was rated dead last out of all the 132 options Bradley could have chosen, based on their skill compatibility.\n\nDonald would almost certainly have known that – his team is obsessed by the digits and that website in particular. Bradley? He is evidently a gambler, more of a vibes man, which we saw with his early morning deployment of DeChambeau and Justin Thomas, his two biggest crowd-stirrers.\n\nThomas was poor in that tie against Rahm and Hatton’s brand of fire and more fire, and much of DeChambeau’s play, beyond the manner in which he won the first hole in those foursomes, was captured by a drive at the 15th that nestled over by the rubbish bins. Unlike Scheffler, he came to life in his second match alongside Ben Griffin, and thrived in the crackling atmosphere, but was beaten by Justin Rose and Fleetwood.\n\nA word here on the value of moments and momentum swings. They always decide the Cup and Europe excelled in those big passages of play.\n\nIt was shown in the fourballs when Griffin threatened to put himself and DeChambeau two up through seven after sinking a 56-footer, but Rose reacted immediately by holing a monster of similar length.\n\nIt was demonstrated again by Rahm cutting down a revived Scheffler on the 15th with a putt from 20 feet, and once more when Fleetwood stifled a chest-thumping DeChambeau from mid-range on the 11th. \n\nBy contrast, Cantlay, the best US performer with 1.5 points, missed a three-footer at the 14th to go one up in that final match against McIlroy and Lowry – Europe were spared one of those crowd eruptions that can echo into the final holes.\n\nCantlay, for once, ought to be spared some slack. The hatless villain of Rome played well. So too did Cam Young alongside Thomas in trouncing Aberg and Rasmus Hojgaard 6&5 in the afternoon. But their performances and Presidential contributions could only count for so much.","summary":"RIATH AL-SAMARRAI: It was a little after 11am in New York when Keegan Bradley embarked on the kind of punt that has so far typified his eccentric captaincy of Team USA.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-15138577/Team-Europe-lead-Ryder-Cup-Team-USA.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/26/23/102491743-0-image-a-30_1758924556223.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 23:07:54","author":"Editor,Riath Al-Samarrai","authors":["Editor","Riath Al-Samarrai"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":363817012,"title":"Trump on Comey Indictment: ‘I Think There Will Be Others’; Netanyahu: Nations ‘Privately Thank Us’ | Capitol Report","text":"Sep-26-2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump says others may also be indicted after former FBI Director James Comey.

According to the Census Bureau, in 2024, the U.S. imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products. \n\nHowever, experts such as Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, suggested Trump largely blunted the scope of the tariffs by conditioning them on whether pharmaceutical companies are building operations in the United States. \n\nA slew of leading foreign-based companies have announced in recent months commitments to build or expand U.S. manufacturing operations, likely shielding them from the brunt of the latest tariffs. In attempts to prepare for possible tariffs, which Trump has repeatedly teased since taking office, drugmakers Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, GSK, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Roche, Sanofi, Merck & Co., and Johnson & Johnson are among pharmaceutical companies that have unveiled plans to invest in the U.S. by building or expanding their presence in the country. \n\n“The actual comment from the President is direct, but its impact may be somewhere between nebulous and negligible,” Jared Holz, an analyst with Mizuho, said in a note to clients. “All major players have some production presence domestically and almost all have announced increased investment directly tied towards local manufacturing.”\n\nIn his Truth Social post Thursday evening, Trump also declined to say he would place tariffs on generic pharmaceutical imports, which likely would have had a more negative impact, leading to drug shortages. \n\nThe truck tariffs\n\nTrump said he was dropping a 25% tariff on qualifying trucks in order to protect domestic manufacturers, including Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, and Mack Trucks, from “unfair outside competition.” \n\n“We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!” the president stated. \n\nThe tariffs will predominantly affect Mexico, known as the largest exporter of heavy-duty trucks to the United States. In 2024, the U.S. imported almost $128 billion in heavy vehicle parts from Mexico, accounting for approximately 28% of total U.S. imports, according to Mexico. Chrysler-parent Stellantis produces heavy-duty Ram trucks in Mexico, while Sweden’s Volvo Group is building a $700m heavy-truck factory in Monterrey. \n\nMexico has opposed new tariffs, issuing arguments to the U.S. Commerce Department in May that all Mexican trucks exported to the U.S. have, on average, 50% U.S. content, including diesel engines.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the White House earlier this year not to enact new truck tariffs, due to concerns that the top five import sources “are allies or close partners of the United States, posing no threat to U.S. national security.”\n\nThe furniture tariffs\n\nTrump previewed the furniture tariffs in August, saying they would bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, and Michigan.” His comments come as furniture and wood products manufacturing employment in the U.S. has halved since 2000 to around 340,000 today, according to federal data. \n\n“The reason for this is the large-scale ‘FLOODING’ of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,” the president explained Thursday. “It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process.”\n\nThe tariffs will predominantly affect Vietnam and China. The U.S. imported $25.5 billion in furniture in 2024, according to trade outlet Furniture Today. Vietnam and China accounted for roughly 60% of the imports. \n\nIndustry leaders condemned the latest tariffs this week. \n\nIKEA, a Swedish furniture giant, said the tariffs on furniture imports make doing business “more difficult”.\n\n“The tariffs are impacting our business similarly to other companies, and we are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” the company said. \n\nNguyen Thi Thu Hoai from the Wood and Handicraft Association of Dong Nai province, one of Vietnam’s largest furniture clusters, called the tariff “unfair,” saying members “were shocked when we heard the news.” \n\nThe state of tariffs\n\nTrump is imposing the tariffs using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the administration to impose tariffs without congressional action. \n\nThe move marks the president’s decision to utilize more established powers to enact tariffs, as the Supreme Court is examining whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act he used to justify the broader “Liberation Day” tariffs is lawful.\n\nThe latest round of tariffs has sparked differing reactions across the aisle. \n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro framed the announcement as a win for the U.S on Friday.\n\n“This is the three-dimensional chess of President Donald Trump: $17 trillion of new investment, $7 trillion in revenue, stronger supply chains, lower mortgage rates,” he said. “If we tariff it, they will come.”\n\nNavarro’s comments came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in July that Washington could collect $300 billion by the end of the year, more than triple its annual tariff revenue. Trump said that he is directing some tariff revenue back to farmers this week.\n\nSENATE PASSES THREE FUNDING BILLS AFTER STRIKING DEAL AHEAD OF AUGUST RECESS\n\nDemocratic critics said the tariffs would reduce free trade and raise prices for consumers.\n\n“Trump’s tariffs are a tax on hardworking Americans,” Gov. Jared Polis (D-CO) wrote in a post to X. “Want to fix your truck, improve your property, and buy lower-cost prescription drugs? You will pay more because of these outrageous tariffs. Families shouldn’t have to shoulder higher costs because of bad policy.”","summary":"President Donald Trump announced another round of wide-ranging tariffs on Thursday, sparking questions about their implications for consumers and businesses.  In a series of messages to Truth Social, Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on all “heavy” trucks made outside the United States.

He also raised unfounded concerns about vaccines.\n\nHis comments have been widely criticised by autism campaigners and scientists in the UK, who say it is ‘fear-mongering’ and could put women and children at risk of harm.\n\nThe UK and EU medicines regulators have issued comments stressing the safety of the drug in pregnancy.\n\nPharmacies are also assuring pregnant women that it is appropriate to take paracetamol if experiencing a high fever or in need of pain relief and say parents should continue to get their children vaccinated to prevent serious illness.\n\nOlivier Picard, chair of the NPA, which represents around 6000 independent community pharmacies in the UK, said: ‘President Trump’s comments break long standing international consensus around treatments which strong medical evidence suggests are very safe, highly effective and used by millions of people over many years.\n\n‘People have every right to question medicines but it is vitally important that patients get their medical advice from trusted and well evidenced sources, such as pharmacists and doctors who have seen the clinical research underpinning treatments.\n\n‘Statements like these cause alarm to parents, who feel unnecessary guilt for having done the right thing for their health during their pregnancy.\n\n‘Paracetamol remains an effective and safe pain relief option for patients, including for pregnant women and leaving fever and pain untreated can pose risks to unborn babies.\n\n‘Childhood vaccination campaigns have also been crucial in preventing serious illnesses that were common place in the UK 60 years ago, such as measles, but people can easily be swayed by what they hear online or on the television.\n\n‘If patients are concerned about the safety of medication, they should speak to their local pharmacist.’\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, health secretary Wes Streeting said 'I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this’, as he urged pregnant women not to pay ‘any attention whatsoever’ to the US president.\n\nThe MP told ITV’s Lorraine: ‘I’ve just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.\n\n‘In fact, a major study was done back in 2024 in Sweden, involving 2.4 million children, and it did not uphold those claims.\n\n‘So I would just say to people watching, don’t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine.\n\n’In fact, don’t take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists, the NHS.","summary":"The National Pharmacy Association, which surveyed 500 pharmacies serving 2.5million patients, found more than half (58 per cent) believe Mr Trump's comments pose a risk to care in the UK.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15137705/Pharmacists-besieged-worried-patients-Trumps-unfounded-paracetamol-vaccines-claims.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/26/16/102483279-0-image-m-13_1758902271090.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-26 23:01:46","author":"Editor,Shaun Wooller","authors":["Editor","Shaun Wooller"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.024}]}
