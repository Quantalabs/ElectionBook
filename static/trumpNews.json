Nobody knows,” Deputy Opposition Leader Ted O’Brien told the Today show on Friday.\n\n“But what it does expose is the fact we’re even talking about this. It says the Prime Minister needs to meet with the President.\n\n“I mean, it’s crazy. You know, this is the biggest news we have of an engagement with the President of the United States. Says it all.\n\n“Anthony Albanese needs to prioritise a meeting with Donald Trump.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released details of the meeting between Australia’s US ambassador and Mr Trump.\n\n“Ambassador Rudd met President Trump in the dining room of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, on January 11, 2025,” the department announced.\n\n“Ambassador Rudd has professional relationships with, and has met with, a range of senior administration officials.”\n\nDFAT released the skerrick of information this week after taking a question on notice during senate estimates in February.\n\n“If you look at the results to date, it’s, what, 247 days since the President was elected?” Mr O’Brien said on Friday.\n\n“No meeting with the Prime Minister; that’s the priority. At the end of the day, yes, Kevin Rudd’s a former prime minister of Australia, but he is no substitute for today’s prime minister. That’s Anthony Albanese.”\n\nAustralia faces US tariffs of 50 per cent on steel, 25 per cent on aluminium, and 10 per cent on other goods, with Mr Trump also threatening 50 per cent tariffs on copper imports.\n\nMr Albanese had secured a much-anticipated meeting with Mr Trump last month at a conference in Canada.\n\nMr Albanese said he planned to raise the Trump administration’s tariffs on Australian exports and the AUKUS agreement. As well as preparing with Mr Rudd, Mr Albanese revealed he had conferred with Mr Trump’s associate and golfing icon, Greg Norman.\n\nBut Mr Trump was forced to leave the Canadian summit before meeting with Mr Albanese, as there was a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Mr Trump’s early departure also snubbed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nMr Albanese is flying to China on Saturday with a host of Australian business representatives. The trip will mark the fourth time he has met Chinese President Xi Jinping.","summary":"A meeting between Donald Trump and Australia’s US ambassador has been shrouded in mystery and a lack of detail.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/crazy-details-lacking-on-rudd-trump-meeting-as-tariffs-loom-large/news-story/23898ed739f33060f0c92d4dced20fc0?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9c6cfcc6d5d5e6bb58f7b3d589d03262","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 01:33:38","author":"Blair Jackson","authors":["Blair Jackson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":340422322,"title":"‘Game of thrones’ over fate of AUKUS submarine deal","text":"United States Secretary of State Marc Rubio has met counterparts in Southeast Asia this week in his first visit to Asia since taking office.\n\nWashington’s top diplomat joined foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Kuala Lumpur at a meeting that included Australia’s own Foreign Minister Penny Wong, China, the European Union, Japan, Russia, South Korea and others.\n\nDuring that event he was asked about the AUKUS deal that the Biden administration forged and “questions among Asian-Pacific allies and partners about the US defence commitment here in Asia.” \n\n“Well, look, anytime a new administration takes over, there’s a review of all policies,’’ Secretary of State Marc Rubio replied in relation to the AUKUS review.\n\n“I mean, policies are reviewed; doesn’t necessarily mean you’re against it. \n\n“We did a review at the State Department of our diplomatic presence around the world, because I wanted to know which consulates and embassies could be adjusted both in their size and in their presence, could we consolidate their presence. \n\n“We did a review; we haven’t closed any embassies.”\n\nThe secretary of state stressed that just because the US is reviewing something “doesn’t mean you’re going to necessarily act on it.”\n\n“But our policies on AUKUS have not changed,” he added.\n\n‘Game of Thrones’ in White House\n\nMr Rubio’s remarks follow reports in Politico that the Pentagon’s announcement of the AUKUS review completely blindsided many key officials elsewhere in the US government.\n\nThe decision was described as a unilateral move by the Pentagon championed by its policy chief Elbridge Colby, an AUKUS sceptic.\n\nThe Politico report said that many officials at the State Department, the White House-based National Security Council, “weren’t told in advance that the review would happen or what its parameters were” and that counterparts in Canberra and London were also caught off guard.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the AUKUS situation told Politico that the broken process and was creating faultlines in the Trump administration.\n\n“It’s Game of Thrones politics over there,” the person said.\n\nFormer Biden administration officials told Politico that the White House would have reacted if the Pentagon had launched an AUKUS review without telling other parts of the government.\n\nOne said senior White House aides would have “lost it.” Another said, “I can’t comprehend it.”\n\nBrits insist there are benefits to the review\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Stephen Lovegrove who conducted the UK’s own review of the AUKUS pact before being appointed as Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s special envoy, has talked up the benefits of AUKUS.\n\n“The US Navy is right behind it; I speak to them a lot. The State Department is very much behind it [and] many players in the Defence Department are completely engaged in AUKUS and everything it brings to the US,” he said.\n\n“So I’m pretty comfortable that we’ll end up with the right answer for the US, Australia and the UK — this is a critical, critical program.”\n\nIt emerged this week that Australia could face demands for a public declaration or private guarantee that US-made nuclear submarines would be used in concert with the United States in any future conflict with China.\n\nAs the Prime Minister prepares for a six-day tour of China on Saturday there are fresh reports that the Trump administration could demand new conditions for providing nuclear submarines to Australia including even more cash.\n\nIt follows the Prime Minister’s speech over the weekend affirming support for the US alliance but cautioning that Australia will always pursue its own interests first.\n\nThe move comes as both Australia and the UK face pressure from the White House to lift military spending, demands that the Albanese government has resisted to date.\n\nBut Australia is now facing the prospect of a Trump administration review demanding it pay more for submarines under the $368 billion AUKUS pact and a guarantee the boats support the US in a conflict over Taiwan.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that big changes are expected as a result of the US review into the deal brokered by former leaders Joe Biden, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson.\n\n‘Pissing everyone off’\n\nThe man US President Donald Trump deputised to call an investigation into Australia’s nuclear submarine deal is also “pissing everyone off”, according to a fresh report in the United States.\n\nThe Pentagon’s Deputy Under Secretary of Defence for Policy, Elbridge Colby is one of the biggest AUKUS sceptics who has raised concerns about the $363 billion deal.\n\nThe US has launched a review of its multi-billion dollar submarine deal with the UK and Australia, insisting the security pact must fit its “America First” agenda.\n\nBut amid predictions that the US will drive a tougher bargain and demand even more cash from Australia for the submarine deal, reports have surfaced over divisions in the Trump administration.","summary":"Donald Trump’s chief foreign affairs adviser has given a big update on AUKUS as the dysfunction in the White House is compared to Game of Thrones.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/game-of-thrones-over-fate-of-aukus-submarine-deal/news-story/29e43f54ad1492bc134c3e8990005502?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ba765b83d8cd41b2b72d2b305ddd6f04","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 01:33:38","author":"Samantha Maiden","authors":["Samantha Maiden"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.201},{"id":340422710,"title":"NASA shares details for its next Space Station crew as its budget and staffing face new cuts","text":"A new crew will soon be heading to the International Space Station.

Billy Graham preaching about the importance of seeking forgiveness. It then cuts to Trump’s response to Luntz’s question, where he said, “I’m not sure I have…I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.”\n\nThe video ends with a stark message displayed on-screen: “Is there any greater denial of Christ than to say, ‘I do not need his forgiveness?’”\n\nThe group poured over $1 million into ad campaigns aimed at religious voters in key battleground states, contending that Harris’s character and policy positions aligned more closely with Christian values than those of Trump. \n\nRev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham and president of both the BGEA and Samaritan’s Purse, publicly condemned the campaign at the time.\n\n“The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris.

Kennedy, Jr. announced Thursday that effective immediately, undocumented immigrants will no longer be allowed to attend Head Start, the federal program that provides child care, nutrition and health assistance to 800,000 low-income infants, toddlers, and pre-schoolers. The announcement bars all people living in the country without legal status from a suite of federally funding public programs, including health clinics, family planning and the low energy assistance program. While those living in the country illegally are prohibited from using most federal programs, a 1998 notice allowed them to access certain benefits relied on by low-income families with young children. In a press release, however, Kennedy announced that HHS was rescinding this interpretation, limiting the ability of low-income immigrant families to use more than a dozen federal programs run by the agency. “For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Kennedy. “Today’s action changes that—it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.” Head Start has never required documentation of immigration status as a condition for enrollment over the last 60 years of the program, according a statement from the National Head Start Association. \"Attempts to impose such a requirement threaten to create fear and confusion among all families who are focused on raising healthy children, ready to succeed in school and life,\" said Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association. \"This decision undermines the fundamental commitment that the country has made to children and disregards decades of evidence that Head Start is essential to our collective future.\" HHS estimates that prohibiting undocumented immigrants from accessing Head Start would save $374 million in services annually, while costing $21 million in time spent by individuals trying document and review eligibility, as well as transition costs for the Head Start program. The Education Department, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor also announced that those in the country illegally would be barred from programs run by the agencies, including career, technical, and adult education programs. \"Today, at the direction of President Donald J. Trump, the Administration is taking the biggest step in more than 30 years to protect taxpayer-funded benefits for American citizens — NOT illegal aliens,\" the White House said in a press release. \"The move, which preserves roughly $40 billion in benefits for American citizens, overturns decades of bureaucratic defiance and builds on President Trump’s executive order directing an END to the subsidization of open borders.\" The announcement shook the Head Start industry, which has already been reeling this year from a series of program layoffs, cuts, and threats to terminate the program entirely. Head Start leaders said it was not clear how the directive will be carried out. The memo did not specify, for example, whether immigration status would be checked for the parents or the child, said Ed Condon, executive director of the Region 9 Head Start Assn., which represents four states, including California. \"Family status takes us down one road and child status would take us down another. Most of the kids we serve are citizens,\" said Condon. It was also unclear whether the change would apply to all Head Start centers, including those run by school districts. “Everybody is on hold. But this is not good news.\" Limiting access to the program could also deter parents without legal status from enrolling their citizen children in Head Start, said Ted Lempert, president of Children Now and a former California Assembly member. “We guarantee every kid an education in this country, regardless of status,\" he said. \"That shouldn’t be different in terms of early education, and certainly not when it comes to Head Start.” The federal action — which comes on the tail of additional cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food assistance in the just-approved Republican budget — will impact some of the most vulnerable young children in the nation, child care experts said. “Lower income families often avail themselves of multiple services,\" including housing, energy and food assistance, said Donna Sneeringer, chief strategy officer for the Child Care Resource Center, which provides Head Start services to 2,500 children in Southern California. \"They are doing everything they can to put the pieces together to care for their families.” The notice announcing the change in policy will be published in the Federal Registry, at which point a 30-day public comment period will begin. HHS said the change, however, is effective immediately because \"any delay would be contrary to the public interest and fail to address the ongoing emergency at the Southern Border of the United States. In a press release, the ACLU said that if the notice takes effect, plaintiffs in a lawsuit that was filed in April challenging attacks by the Trump administration to Head Start plan to amend their complaint to include the changes.

In a fiery statement, Trump singled out the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which oversees PBS and NPR, calling it “worse than CNN & MSDNC put together” and demanding its defunding. The House has already greenlit the cuts, but the Senate faces a July 18 deadline to act. The rescissions package, a priority for the Trump administration, targets funding for USAID, the US Institute of Peace, and other programs, alongside the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Trump’s February executive order to dismantle the US Institute of Peace underscores his push to redirect federal funds. However, the proposal has sparked divisions within the GOP, with some senators wary of the cuts’ broader impact. GOP Senators Raise Concerns Over Cuts Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) has repeatedly criticised the proposed cuts to the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a program widely praised for its global health impact. Collins emphasised the program’s role in saving lives, warning that reductions could undermine critical health initiatives abroad. Other senators, including Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), have voiced concerns about defunding public broadcasting, which many rural communities rely on for local news and information. The debate over public broadcasting cuts has reignited long-standing GOP criticisms of PBS and NPR, with many Republicans accusing the outlets of political bias. Supporters of the rescissions package argue that the cuts are overdue and align with fiscal conservative principles. Yet, the potential loss of local stations in underserved areas has sparked pushback, complicating the Senate’s path to approval. Senate Vote Looms Amid GOP Tensions With the July 18 deadline approaching, the Senate’s vote on the rescissions package will test Republican unity under Trump’s pressure. The House’s approval last month kept the proposal alive, but the Senate's hesitations could stall progress. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” as he called it, has dominated GOP efforts, sidelining the rescissions package until now. As the Senate prepares to take up the cuts, GOP leaders face the challenge of balancing Trump’s demands with concerns from moderates wary of slashing programs with broad support. The outcome will signal how much sway Trump holds over the party as he pushes his fiscal agenda. Updates will follow as the Senate’s decision nears.

More chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell takes to the podium during a press event in the Rose Garden at the White House, November 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Current Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's term expires in February. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nPresident Trump continues to aggressively criticize Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chair whom he nominated to succeed Janet Yellen in 2018. However, despite Trump’s repeated recent push for lower interest rates it’s unclear that it’s within the scope or ability of the Fed Chair to cut the overall interest expense on the national debt.\n\nIncreasing U.S. Government Debt\n\nThe U.S. government debt has doubled in Gross Domestic Product terms from 60% before the Great Financial Crisis to 120% today according to FRED data. U.S. government borrowing now stands at about $36 trillion in absolute terms.\n\nAs a result, the cost of simply servicing the national debt is now similar to the entire U.S. Medicare or defense budget. These are very large costs. President Trump’s logic is clear, bringing down interest rates would help save money on debt costs. That, in turn, would help balance the budget.\n\nMarkets and Mandates\n\nHowever, there are two catches. First the overall interest rate on overall government debt depends far more on market forces, not on the very short-term Federal Funds rate that the FOMC sets eight times a year. Those market forces typically matter far more for interest rates than the Federal Funds rate.\n\nSecond, achieving low interest rates is not part of the FOMC’s mandate as defined under Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act. The FOMC is focused on the goals of price stability and full employment together with moderate long-term interest rates. Low interest rates aren’t part of the FOMC’s mandate today. For example, there’s a risk that lower interest rates today could bring inflation, or perhaps aren’t necessary because employment appears to remain robust.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMost U.S. Government Debt Is Longer Term\n\nAs of July 2025, U.S. government debt was about 20% bills, that’s debt with a maturity of 4 to 52 weeks. The interest rate on those bills can correlate with the Federal Funds rate set by the Federal Reserve together with expectations for near-term rate decisions.\n\nHowever, there’s another 80% of government debt that has a longer maturity of up to 30 years. There rates are typically set by a host of longer-term forces including inflation expectations, currency trends, economic growth and the fundamentals of supply and demand across asset prices among other factors. Furthermore, the interest rate the government actually typically pays depends on the interest rate at the time of issuance not the market rate. Much of government borrowing is subject to past debt auctions.\n\nTherefore, the FOMC has limited ability to set the overall rate across all U.S. government borrowing. One example of this is that the Fed Funds rate has remained steady at 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024 when the FOMC most recently cut rates. Over that period, the rate on the U.S. government 10-year bond has swung from 4.1% to 4.7% on economic news despite no change in policy from the FOMC. That arguably illustrates the extent to which longer term interest rates are beyond the FOMC’s full control.\n\nTrump vs. Powell\n\nTrump and Powell are looking for different things. As much as they might want to, Jerome Powell and the FOMC cannot control the overall interest rate on U.S. debt. Cutting short-term rates appears unlikely, in isolation, to simply bring down interest costs for longer term-debt which depends on a range of factors. Powell often alludes to this with one of his preferred expressions when talking about the neutral rate for interest rates. For example at a press conference in September 2024, Powell said. “There are model-based approaches and empirically based approaches that estimate what the neutral rate will be at any given time. But, realistically, we know it by its works.” This hardly suggests that Powell believes he controls the overall term structure of interest rates.\n\nThe FOMC controls the very short end of government borrowings and even that is subject to market forces and transmission effects. So, although the President, and maybe even Powell might want overall interest rates to be lower, that’s not the FOMC’s mandate, which is focused on controlling inflation and maintaining job creation.\n\nOf course, President Trump will nominate a new Fed Chair for 2026 and it will be interesting to see how that appointee handles the trade-offs between what Trump wants and what the FOMC can achieve under its mandate and with its policy tools. Additionally, the FOMC may be on track to cut rates later in 2025 anyway so Powell may give Trump a little of what he wants before Powell’s term ends.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Trump wants to see lower interest rates.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, his Republican primary challenger, announced a separation and impending divorce from his wife, state Senator Angela Paxton, who cited “biblical grounds” for their differences.\n\nIt was a development that was as expected as it was laden with potential political opportunity for Cornyn, who is running behind his opponent even in a survey commissioned by the McConnell and John Thune-tied PAC, Senate Leadership Fund (SLF). Paxton went through a messy impeachment fight in 2023; he survived, but in documents published as part of the process, Uber records showing him traveling to the residence of an affair partner were made public.\n\nMake no mistake: this is going to get ugly. Even if Cornyn himself doesn’t jump into the gutter, the groups tied to him and his allies happily will, as they try to use Paxton’s long history of personal and political scandals to weigh down and ultimately defeat the attorney general and would-be senator. The Texas Senate race is one (though not the easiest) of the avenues for Democrats to win back majority control of the Senate next year, a crucial step in halting the president’s legislative agenda.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) was the first dive in on Thursday. Like SLF, the NRSC is closely tied to GOP leadership and works to protect incumbent senators as well as back challengers to Democrats.\n\n“What Ken Paxton has put his family through is truly repulsive and disgusting,” said Joanna Rodriguez, the NRSC’s comms director, on Thursday. “No one should have to endure what Angela Paxton has, and we pray for her as she chooses to stand up for herself and her family in this difficult time.”\n\nAnd if Angela Paxton’s own statement is any indication, Thursday’s development stemmed from an as yet unreported conflict between the couple, given that she tweeted that her decision came “in light of recent discoveries” and her husband’s affair has been in the public eye for two years.\n\nYes, the seemingly obvious issue of “candidate quality” is rearing its ugly head again for the Republican Party’s far-right wing. Paxton, who is running a MAGA-aligned campaign against “RINO” Cornyn (without President Donald Trump’s endorsement, so far) is just the latest example of an ultra-conservative Republican who could be bogged down by personal scandal and whiff an otherwise winnable election. McConnell, retiring next year, has worked for much of his career to keep such candidates from his party out of general election contests, though not always with success.\n\nIn 2022, McConnell, then minority leader, famously downplayed his party’s chances of winning the Senate in that year’s midterm contests in an interview over the summer, months before the elections. He cited “candidate quality” as a key factor. Months later, after the election, he unloaded on Trump for being the source of that problem as he sought out Republicans who would put loyalty to him and his false claims about the 2020 election over other factors when awarding his endorsement.\n\n“We ended up having a candidate quality test,” McConnell said in December of 2022, pointing to the defeats of Kari Lake in Arizona and Herschel Walker in Georgia.\n\nHe added: “Our ability to control the primary outcome was quite limited in ’22 because the support of the former president proved to be very decisive in these primaries.”\n\nTrump appeared to learn his lesson, at least somewhat, and in 2024 his party retook the Senate on the back of several of his endorsed candidates, such as Bernie Moreno in Ohio and Tim Sheehy in Montana. The party still ran Royce White, who got busted spending his previous campaign’s money at a strip club in Florida, in a race against Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota.\n\nCornyn, for his part, made clear earlier this year that he believes that a win for Paxton in next year’s primary would mean defeat for their party in the general election. \n\n\"I’m absolutely determined to run and to win — if I didn’t think I could win, I wouldn’t run,\" he said in late June, according to Houston Public Media. \"I’ve simply labored too long in Texas Republican politics to turn the seat over to Democrats in November. ... Any suggestion that I’m thinking about dropping out of the race is false.\" \n\nDemocrats have not settled on a candidate yet, either. Colin Allred, a former congressman, is running again after losing to Ted Cruz in 2024. A recent poll conducted by the NRSC also tested the popularity of Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Rep. Joaquin Castro, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke against Allred’s, though none of the three have announced an intent to run.\n\nWere any of the three to jump in the race it could set up two hyper-competitive primaries for the same seat next year.","summary":"The battle over John Cornyn’s seat is shaping up to be one of the ugliest Senate races of 2026, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ken-paxton-texas-divorce-senate-b2786900.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/16/17/Trump_Cabinet_Bessent_77417.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 00:31:23","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.086},{"id":340414682,"title":"Secret Service agent suspended over Trump assassination attempt is unmasked... as widow of firefighter killed blasts agency","text":"One of the six Secret Service agents who was suspended over the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a campaign rally has been pictured as the heartbroken widow of a firefighter shot dead in the botched attack hit out.\n\nMyosoty Perez has been identified as a Secret Service agent who was suspended for between 10 and 42 days following the July 13, 2024 attack in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nShe was sent to the location of the rally ahead of time and was specifically tasked with helping to secure the surrounds, the New York Post revealed.\n\nShooter Thomas Crooks, 20, fired off eight shots from a nearby rooftop, narrowly missing Trump's vital organs and scraping his ear in a horrifying moment caught on live television.\n\nFirefighter Corey Comperatore was in the crowd and tragically killed by a stray bullet. \n\nHis heartbroken widow Helen launched a blistering attack on the Secret Service for failing to protect 'the love of her life' during an interview with Fox News almost a year on from his death.\n\n'We were all sitting ducks that day,' she said.

prominent leaders convene to discuss shared challenges and opportunities, they inevitably set the stage for progress.\n\nIn inviting key African leaders, President Trump signaled an understanding of Africa’s crucial role in global affairs.\n\nBy choosing to engage in dialogue and listen to these leaders’ concerns, the United States acknowledged its responsibility in shaping a positive future for African nations, particularly Liberia.\n\nThe imperative for social and economic emancipation was at the core of these discussions.\n\nAs President Boakai highlighted, the importance of a united front among African leaders who advocate for their nations’ rights and opportunities on the global stage cannot be underestimated.\n\nBy voicing Liberia’s social and economic aspirations in such a prestigious forum, President Boakai defined his people’s desires and laid a foundation for collaboration on economic initiatives and investments.\n\nThe Role of Leadership in National

ambition for a country that has faced significant challenges.\n\nFollowing years of civil strife and political instability, Liberia’s leaders are tasked with rebuilding and redefining the nation’s identity on both social and economic fronts.\n\nAt the table where influential world leaders gathered, President Boakai’s presence and contributions reflected a commitment to advancing Liberia’s interests.\n\nHe articulated that effective leadership hinges upon vision and a willingness to advocate tirelessly for one’s nation, particularly in an environment that may sometimes undervalue smaller nations.\n\nAs he competently presented Liberia’s case for development, he exemplified an essential quality of leadership: assertiveness.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that “when lions and lionesses are at the table discussing the future of the jungle, they pay no attention to little puppies that bark nonsense” illustrates the reality of power dynamics in international relations.\n\nThis metaphor encapsulates that unproductive comments should not be taken seriously when productive leaders discuss ideas.\n\nUnproductive and insincere noisemakers should be overlooked in favor of positive ideas, more dominant ideas, like those propounded by leadership, like President Boakai and his African brothers at the table.\n\nThe voices of the un-noisemakers should matter and call for recognition.\n\nHuman and Commercial Diplomacy: Pathways to Progress:\n\nHuman and commercial diplomacy intertwining is critical for Liberia’s socioeconomic growth and emancipation.\n\nHuman diplomacy prioritizes individuals’ needs and aspirations, acknowledging that social equality and human rights are fundamental to sustainable development.\n\nPresident Boakai’s advocacy for social reforms is key in addressing poverty, education, and healthcare issues.\n\nHowever, these social reforms may remain theoretical rather than practical without commercial diplomacy, which entails fostering trade partnerships and foreign investments.\n\nIn discussing Liberia’s economic potential, President Boakai highlighted the rich natural resources and untapped markets that Liberia offers.\n\nBy laying out a clear economic strategy and inviting foreign investment, he signaled a readiness to engage constructively with international partners.\n\nThese conversations invite the world’s most influential nations and corporations to invest in Liberia’s growth story, facilitating socio-economic emancipation.\n\nMoreover, Liberia’s past is marked by a complex interplay of political instability and economic marginalization.\n\nThe historical context of exploitation must be addressed through rigorous diplomatic efforts that uphold justice and provide mechanisms for equitable growth.\n\nTo this end, commercial diplomacy becomes indispensable.\n\nThe nation can position itself as a vital player in the global landscape by fostering partnerships that respect Liberia’s sovereignty while encouraging economic influx.\n\nThe Promise of U.S. Engagement in Liberia’s Future:\n\nAs a global superpower, the United States has significant influence and resources that can help shape Liberia’s trajectory.\n\nThe engagement of U.S. leadership in discussions concerning African nations is promising.\n\nAs observed from global leaders’ interactions on major news platforms, such as CBS and Fox News, the body language and interactions among the delegates conveyed a sense of optimism.\n\nWhen leaders like President Trump show genuine interest in the concerns of African nations, it represents a potential for collaborative efforts that uplift nations like Liberia.\n\nLiberians can find solace in the historical partnerships formed with the U.S., often rooted in shared values of democracy and development.\n\nHowever, this engagement must translate into meaningful action.\n\nDialogue must evolve into concrete policies, infrastructural development support, and sustainable human capital investment.\n\nAs Liberia seeks to emancipate itself socially and economically, the onus lies on both the U.S. government and Liberian leadership to forge a path that meets the aspirations of the Liberian people.\n\nThe Broader Implications for African Development:\n\nBoakai’s diplomatic initiative resonates beyond Liberia, representing a clarion call for social and economic emancipation for all African nations.\n\nAfrican leaders must engage in sustained dialogue that addresses immediate economic needs and long-term sustainability.\n\nThe necessity of unity among African nations can not be overemphasized, and together, they can negotiate effectively on the global stage, garnering respect and ensuring their voices are integral to shaping international policies that affect them.\n\nFurthermore, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) exemplifies how cooperative economic agreements can enhance intra-African trade and foster regional stability.\n\nAfrican nations can mitigate the historical and ongoing exploitative practices stifling development by advocating for collective bargaining power.\n\nPresident Boakai’s presence at the White House emphasized the importance of addressing socio-economic disparities through partnered initiatives focused on infrastructure, education, energy, clean and safe drinking water, and healthcare.\n\nThe interdependence of nations in tackling global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality amplifies the need for sustained conversations that lead to actionable outcomes.\n\nThe July 09, 2025, meeting at the White House, featuring President Boakai and other African leaders, was pivotal for Liberia and Africa.\n\nThrough their diplomatic engagements, they underscored the necessity for social and economic emancipation, articulating the aspirations of millions within their nations.\n\nPresident Boakai’s leadership exemplifies the potential of African leadership to rise to the occasion in the face of global challenges.\n\nThe path toward development requires the union of human and commercial diplomacy, sustained commitment from global powers like the United States, and a cooperative spirit among African nations.\n\nUnder the astute leadership of President Boakai, Liberia can look forward to a future that is not only aspired to but realized through collective effort, innovation, and resilience.\n\nThe call for a peaceful world characterized by social justice and economic progress rests with those willing to engage, dialogue, and act.\n\nThe journey may be complex, but with leaders who dare to dream and pursue their vision, hope for a brighter future is seriously attainable.","summary":"By:Austin S Fallah-A True

The woman, identified as Caroline Shaw, 49, of Orlando, was detained July 7 on accusations of driving with a suspended license and failing to register her vehicle, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. At the time of the incident, Trump was in Washington, D.C., when Shaw allegedly drove what was described by law enforcement as a Mercedes van to the south gate of Mar-a-Lago shortly before 10 p.m. and parked along Southern Boulevard. According to an arrest report, she then walked to the gate and told U.S. Secret Service agents she needed to \"speak with Trump urgently.\" Shaw then informed agents there were guns in her vehicle.

But the Senate must first vote to confirm him to the role.\n\n“Emil Bove belongs nowhere near the federal bench,” Durbin wrote. “This vote will be a litmus test for Senate Judiciary Republicans.”\n\nDurbin indicated the emails and texts he released come from a Justice Department source: Most of the names in the correspondences have been redacted.\n\nBut they appear to corroborate allegations made in a complaint in June by Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who worked under Bove until his dismissal in April.\n\nIn his complaint, Reuveni alleged that Bove told Justice Department lawyers that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘f*** you'” if they interfered with President Trump’s deportation plans.\n\nThe expletive came up in the context of Trump’s controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law that, until recently, had only been used in the context of war.\n\nTrump, however, has argued that undocumented immigration constituted an “invasion” and has attempted to deport people under the law’s authority, without allowing them to appeal their removal.\n\nAccording to Reuveni, Bove explained to the Justice Department that Trump planned to start the deportation flights immediately after invoking the Alien Enemies Act. He “stressed to all in attendance that the planes needed to take off no matter what”.\n\nReuveni understood that interaction as an attempt to circumvent the power of the courts.\n\nIn another instance, Reuveni said he was discouraged from asking questions about the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant wrongfully deported to El Salvador despite a court protection order.\n\nWhen Reuveni admitted before a Maryland court that he did not have “satisfactory” answers about Abrego Garcia’s return, he said Trump officials pressured him to make assertions against Abrego Garcia that “were not supported by law or the record”. He was fired shortly afterwards.\n\nThe documents gathered by Senate Democrats appear to offer a look inside those incidents.\n\nIn one series of emails, dated March 15, Reuveni responded to a notification that planes bearing deportees under the Alien Enemies Act were still in the air.\n\n“The judge specifically ordered us not to remove anyone in the class, and to return anyone in the air,” he wrote back.\n\nThe emails reflected an injunction from District Judge James Boasberg barring deportations and ordering the planes to turn around.\n\nNevertheless, the planes landed in El Salvador and delivered their human cargo to a maximum security prison, where many remain to this day.\n\nIn another instance, a member of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) replied to an email thread by saying: “My take on these emails is that DOJ leadership and DOJ litigators don’t agree on the strategy. Please keep DHS out of it.”\n\nText messages also show Reuveni and an unnamed colleague discussing Bove’s request to tell the courts “f*** you”.\n\n“Guess we are going to say f*** you to the court,” one text message reads.\n\nIn another, the colleague appears to react to Trump officials lying before the court. “Oh sh**,” they write. “That was just not true.”\n\nIn an interview published with The New York Times on Thursday, Reuveni underscored the grave dangers posed by an executive branch that he sees as refusing to comply with judicial authority.\n\n“The Department of Justice is thumbing its nose at the courts, and putting Justice Department attorneys in an impossible position where they have to choose between loyalty to the agenda of the president and their duty to the court,” he told the Times.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, has responded with defiance, repeating its claim that Reuveni is simply a “disgruntled employee” lashing out at the employer who fired him.\n\n“He’s a leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.\n\n“No one was ever asked to defy a court order. This is another instance of misinformation being spread to serve a narrative that does not align with the facts.”\n\nBove himself denied ever advising his colleagues to defy a court order. The Senate is set to decide on his confirmation to the circuit court in the coming weeks.\n\nIf he passes the Senate Judiciary Committee – in a vote scheduled for July 17 – he will face a full vote on the Senate floor.","summary":"Senator Dick Durbin has said the messages appear to support claims that the Trump administration defied court orders.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/11/democrats-publish-leaked-justice-department-messages-on-deportation-push?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-01-10T155104Z_1326754470_RC237CAJ8CZI_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEW-YORK-1752191492.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 00:21:51","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":340414136,"title":"Secret Service Suspends Six Agents Over Trump Assassination Attempt","text":"The Secret Service said on Thursday that it was suspending six agents involved in securing the site of a campaign rally where a gunman tried to assassinate Donald J.

Throughout the match, my wrist, arm and body literally froze with the expected negative outcomes. \n\n'I had difficulty breathing, and it was not a fitness issue. It got a bit better as the match progressed, but I was not able to overcome it. \n\nFan footage emerged on social media showing Ackman taking part in the ATP event\n\nOne moment showed Ackman double-faulting on two points in a row before trudging to the net\n\nFans on social media were quick to question how Ackman found himself competing on the day\n\n'I regularly play with mid-20-year-old D1 college players and recently retired pros on a familiar court with no audience with none of the same symptoms. \n\n'It was a very humbling experience that gives one even more respect for the pros who play for a living in front of the cameras and the crowds'.\n\nPrior to the tournament, the 59-year-old - who is a known tennis benefactor and MAGA supporter - revealed that Nick Kyrgios had proposed a match together before discovering that Sock had been given a wildcard for the Hall of Fame Open.\n\nTaking to X, he wrote: A tennis update. I met @NickKyrgios on @X and he proposed we play an ATP tournament together. Unfortunately, Nick got injured so our doubles hopes have been delayed, but fortunately fate intervened.\n\n'@JackSock managed to get a wildcard into the Hall of Fame Open in Newport Rhode Island, an Challenger and 125 event, and invited me to be his partner. I of course accepted. Doubles matches begin next Tuesday, July 8th'.\n\nAckman's political stance has also been a topic of discussion, particularly his recent endorsement of Donald Trump in the 2024 election. \n\nA vocal presence on X with over 1.8 million followers, Ackman has been outspoken on various social and political issues, including his support for Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Ackman's partner Sock is a 32-year-old American who won four doubles majors and a gold medal in the Olympics before retiring in 2023.\n\nBill AckmanRhode Island\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMAGA hedge fund billionaire, 59, slammed after 'buying his way' into professional tennis tournament... with disastrous results\n\nAdd comment","summary":"In a bizarre move that enraged fans and retired pros alike, billionaire Bill Ackman took part in a doubles match at the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-14895243/MAGA-hedge-fund-billionaire-slammed-buying-way-tennis-tournament-disastrous-results.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/01/100207429-0-image-a-16_1752192390394.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 00:11:00","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":340415050,"title":"Trump's 50% Brazil tariff stretches emergency powers already facing court challenge","text":"President Donald Trump's politically charged new tariff threat — a blanket 50% duty on imports from Brazil — stretches an interpretation of his powers that is already facing a high-stakes court challenge.\n\nTrump said in a letter Wednesday that he is imposing the massive new tariff at least partly in retaliation against Brazil's treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nBut to do so, he is citing a law that only grants him emergency economic powers in order to deal with certain foreign threats to the United States, a White House official told CNBC Thursday.\n\nThat same law — the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA — is at the center of an ongoing lawsuit over Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs that is currently before a federal appeals court.\n\nTrump's lawyers say his invocation of the law to impose those tariffs was an appropriate move to address multiple national emergencies, including \"America's exploding trade deficit.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about Trump's letter to Brazil, including how Bolsonaro's circumstances relate to Trump's stated authority under IEEPA.\n\nWhile the latest levy on Brazilian imports may not have a direct impact on the lawsuit already underway, critics say it could further erode the administration's credibility as Trump pursues an aggressive trade agenda.\n\nTrump's letter announcing the tariff on Brazil \"takes abuse of power to a whole new level,\" said Sen.

The death toll remained at 120 Thursday, nearly a week since the floods first hit.\n\nAuthorities say they have carefully gone over the list of those unaccounted for but those numbers are often tough to pin down in the immediate aftermath of a disaster.\n\nThe unrelenting power of the floods forced families to make unnerving escapes with little time to spare in the middle of the night. One woman recounted how she and others, including a toddler, first climbed into an attic and then onto a roof where they heard screams and watched vehicles float past. Photos and videos captured their ordeal.\n\nMore than 2,000 local, state and federal workers were involved in the search for victims. Stifling heat and mounds of trees, hunks of lumber and trash made the task more difficult.\n\nAt a small shopping center damaged in the floods, people piled debris gathered from the rivers.

Greg Abbott called on state lawmakers to approve funding for new warning systems and emergency communications in flood prone areas when the Legislature meets later this month. Abbott also asked for financial relief for the response and recovery efforts.\n\n“We must ensure better preparation for such events in the future,” he said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nPublic officials in the area have come under repeated criticism amid questions about the timeline of what happened and why widespread warnings were not sounded and more preparations were not made.\n\nKerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha has said those questions will be answered after the victims are recovered.\n\nLocal leaders have talked for years about the need for a flood warning system, but concerns about costs and noise led to missed opportunities to put up sirens.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pledged to provide whatever relief Texas needs to recover and is planning to visit the state Friday.\n\nPolls taken before the floods show Americans largely believe the federal government should play a major role in preparing for and responding to natural disasters, which are becoming a growing worry. On Tuesday, a deluge in New Mexico triggered flash floods that killed three people.\n\nThe devastation in Texas stretched from Hill Country all the way to just outside the state’s capital. At least 15 people died in the Austin area and adjacent counties.\n\nJust north of Austin, floodwaters from the San Gabriel River swamped two RV parks in Georgetown.\n\nTeri Hoffman watched the water lift up her camper with her two dogs inside.\n\n“The camper just kind of goes over on its side and starts floating. And then all the other campers just started crashing into it,” she said.\n\nRescuers were able to save the dogs and she managed to dig out the last picture she has of her late mother.

Now comprising 30% of the population, this movement — propelled by firebrand pastors — played a pivotal role in putting him into power.\n\nCosta says he was unqualified, even inept, and his most-supporting pastor, the TV evangelist Silas Malafaia, rants out the details of his vision: no land returned to the Indigenous, no reparations for slavery, no abortion, gay marriage or legalized drugs. They’re attacked as Marxist policies. Why can people promote them and I can’t talk about Jesus? Spouts one pastor. Christians should control all aspects of society, says another. Bolsonaro likes to call himself Messiah, a version of his middle name, but during COVID, when Brazil had the second-largest outbreak on earth, he said he couldn’t do miracles. He lost the next election, refused to concede, was alleged to be planning a coup and was arrested after mobs swarmed into public buildings. That’s the case Trump is on about. He calls it a witch hunt, much like he endured. \n\nThe film is compelling, too thin in its conclusions but features personal interviews with many of the principal figures and leaves me with this question: did Bolsonaro learn from Trump or was it the other way round?

This one is for sure, as it explores a sea-going mystery and has you savouring every clue and added bit of information you encounter. And speculate on what was in the mind of a Norwegian sailor named Peter Tangvald. He was an ocean adventurer for whom traveling in his boat on the high seas represented freedom. “He didn’t want anyone telling him what to do,” it’s said. Also: “He had to be free at any cost.” The cost was high. He died in a shipwreck and, later, when his son was also lost at sea, his daughter, Virginia Tangvald, set out to find what happened to him, to the son and the philosophy he lived by. “The ghost of my father still haunts me,” she says.\n\nShe was only five when he died and 23 years later and, by then living in Canada, tries to understand him by interviewing people who knew him, friends and some family members. There’s lots of drama there. He built his “dreamboat” himself, sailed the Atlantic solo, lost his wife in a pirate attack and a second wife to drowning. He was a risk-taker and refused to have a motor, radio or phone on board. He explains why and what drove him on some audio tape he had recorded and in a log book from which we hear excerpts in his own voice via a speech synthesizer. He was living his dream and said whoever is not willing to take chances “is not as wise as he thinks.” \n\n He was following his destiny and couldn’t escape it. “I’m floating between life and death,” he says at one point. And “on the verge of a nervous breakdown,” at another. One of the people interviewed said he became reclusive and “turned into a desperate old madman,” a phenomenon that, according to another, often happens to men at sea. The revelations are very affecting in this Canada/France co-production from The National Film Board.

From the stage on First Avenue, he managed to say with a straight face that “Iran has never initiated a war” and “has never occupied the territory of an nation.”\n\nThe people of Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Gaza, among others, might have watched for Pezeshkian’s nose to grow as he made these claims. \n\nAnd the citizens of Israel — who were attacked by Iran’s forces on Oct. 7, 2023, might also marvel at the claim that Iran has never started a war.\n\nBut the unelected and dictatorial “president” of Iran was allowed to make these remarks anyway.\n\nAnother frequent visitor to this city is the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \n\nAs well as the aggression that Erdogan consistently wages against the stateless Kurdish people, it might be noted that President Erdogan is also an occupying colonialist. \n\nSpecifically Erdogan and his government continue to illegally occupy the northern half of Cyprus. \n\nWhich is an European Union member state.\n\nFor some reason, I do not hear student-style politicians calling for the immediate arrest of Erdogan. \n\nAny more than I hear the same people calling for the arrest of members of the loathsome regime that oppresses the Iranian people.\n\nI wonder why people like Mamdani do not urge the arrest of the Turkish or Iranian leadership?\n\nMamdani pretends that he would have no choice but to arrest the elected leader of the world’s only Jewish state.\n\nIn a recent interview Mamdani said: “As mayor, New York City would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu. This is a city that — our values are in line with international law. It’s time that our actions are also.”\n\nShow your math\n\nI mentioned here last week how fantastically economically illiterate Mamdani is. He recently proved that he can’t even read a budget sheet and doesn’t seem to know the difference between public and private money.\n\nWell here he is also demonstrating how legally illiterate he is as well. \n\nPerhaps he should have spent the years in which he was trying to be a rapper mugging up on the law instead.\n\nIndeed the degree that Mamdani did get from Bowdoin College — in African Studies — seems to have done nothing for his education other than make him think that it allows him to identify as an African American. \n\nBut I digress.\n\nIf Mamdani had spent even a few minutes mugging up on international law, he might have realized that this country wisely never signed up to the Rome Statute and is not a signatory of the International Criminal Court. \n\nAmericans from both sides of the aisle used to recognize that the ICC would become simply another corrupt and politicized international body.\n\nSo it has proven, with Amal Clooney and a corrupt British Muslim judge using their energies in the past year not to prosecute the leaders of Iran and their terrorist proxies, but the elected prime minister and defense minister of Israel.\n\nThat’s because the ICC is a joke, run by bigoted activist prosecutors who imagine that they are something they are not. \n\nThe whole court’s legitimacy is falling apart. And the decision of Democrats and Republicans in the past that no American soldier or statesman should ever be subjected to trial by a foreign court has been utterly vindicated.\n\nAs a result, this country is under absolutely no obligation to act on the whims or campaigns of the ICC.\n\nAnd whether or not Mamdani ever becomes mayor, the state of New York is not going to suddenly become a signatory of the Rome Statute or a member of the ICC.\n\nIt’s all misdirection\n\nSo what is Mamdani actually doing with such actions? Two things.\n\nFirstly he is signaling his own deeply prejudiced worldview. \n\nBy taking potshots at a Hindu prime minister and a Jewish prime minister, and singling them out for special treatment he is showing who he really is. Presumably he is hoping that his supporters either agree with him or do not notice this.\n\nSecondly he is doing what failing mayors always do.\n\nThe mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also likes to make pronouncements on the world stage. \n\nMost famously he has repeatedly scolded the American public for daring to vote in Donald Trump as president.\n\nWell guess what? It doesn’t matter. \n\nThe mayor of London doesn’t have a vote in the US elections, and all Khan is doing — like Mamdani — is grandstanding on the world stage because he has failed completely with what he is meant to do. Knife crimes, phone theft, bicycle theft and robberies are an epidemic in London. \n\nBut Khan doesn’t care to deal with those things.\n\nIt is the same with Mamdani. How will he make New Yorkers safer? \n\nHow will he clean up the subway or the streets? \n\nWe have yet to hear. Because Mamdani doesn’t know.\n\nWatch for this rule of thumb. \n\nMayors grandstand on abroad when their home is falling apart.","summary":"Zohran Mamdani, was in the news again for his foreign-policy positions.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/opinion/mamdani-just-latest-mayor-wannabe-who-thinks-they-can-police-the-world/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/new-york-city-mayoral-candidate-107958608-e1752190774348.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:49:42","author":"Douglas Murray","authors":["Douglas Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":340412970,"title":"Hakeem Jeffries’ team blasts Zohran Mamdani’s liberal ‘Team Gentrification’ as primary threats spark NYC Dem feud","text":"The extreme leftist clique that helped Zohran Mamdani were slammed as “Team Gentrification” by top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries’ team after threats of primaries devolved into a Big Apple Democrat feud.\n\nTensions surfaced after Democratic Socialists of America leaders and reps from the left-wing Working Families Party suggested that House Minority Leader Jeffries and other incumbent congressional Democrats from the city could face primaries after Mamdani’s big victory in last month’s New York City mayoral primary.\n\n“His leadership has left a vacuum that organizations like DSA are filling. I think that is more important right now,” Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of the DSA’s city branch, told CNN.\n\nOther congressional Democrats in the city that could be targets for primaries from far-left challengers include Reps. Jerry Nadler and Yvette Clarke, the network reported. \n\nBut Jeffries’ team was ready to dig in.\n\n“Leader Hakeem Jeffries is focused on taking back the House from the MAGA extremists who just ripped health care away from millions of Americans,” Jeffries senior adviser André Richardson told CNN.\n\n“However, if Team Gentrification wants a primary fight, our response will be forceful and unrelenting. We will teach them and all of their incumbents a painful lesson on June 23, 2026,” he warned.\n\nThe beef is unfolding as pressure builds on state and local Democrats in the city to back Mamdani in the general election over fears they could face primaries if they don’t join the coalition. Mamdani will face Republican Curtis Sliwa in November, but former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams will appear on minor party lines on the ballot.\n\nCuomo lost the primary to Mamdani, while Adams dropped out of the race with his sights set on an independent run.\n\nBrooklyn state Assemblywoman Phara Souffrant Forrest, a DSA member whose district overlaps with Jeffries’ congressional district, warned Jeffries to be careful what he wished for.\n\n“Weird threat to make since Hakeem already went after @JabariBrisport [DSA state senator]and I.How’d that go for him, again?,” Forrest said in a statement on X Thursday.\n\n“2022 Primary Results:SD 22 Jabari Brisport: 70.4%. AD 57 Phara Souffrant Forrest: 67.2% If the leader wants another public beatdown, he knows where to find me,” Forrest said.\n\nForrest later toned down her criticism of Jeffries in a statement to The Post, but did not offer any bouquets, either.\n\n“There are no plans that I am aware of to primary Leader Jeffries. Our districts overlap and there is plenty of opportunity for collaboration on issues of shared importance,” Forrest said.\n\nJasmine Gripper, the co-chair of the local Working Families Party which supported Mamdani in the primary, also warned some House members they could face a fight.\n\n“If you are a mismatch, that does make you vulnerable to someone saying, ‘Maybe I’m a better match,’” she told CNN.\n\nBut Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres, who endorsed Andrew Cuomo for mayor and could face a primary challenge next year, defended Jeffries and said any DSA challenge to the man who could be the first black Speaker of the House only benefits Donald Trump.\n\n“If you side against Jeffries,” Torres told The Post, “you’re doing the bidding of Donald Trump. You’re siding against the black political establishment in the US.”\n\nTorres accused DSA members of a “double standard” by not backing Kamala Harris for president while pressuring city Democrats to immediately endorse Mamdani for mayor. \n\nRobert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member from New York and a close ally of Jeffries, also slammed the DSA for picking a fight instead of helping Democrats win the House majority.\n\n“The choice is clear: Hakeem Jeffries as House Speaker or Donald Trump continuing to rule without any checks or balances on his power,” Zimmerman told The Post.\n\n“The DSA is being dangerously counterproductive and hypocritical,” he said.\n\nSome lefty activists said one House member who could face a real primary challenge is Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents lower Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.\n\n“If Brad Lander ran against Goldman, we’d support him in a minute,” Arthur Schwartz, political director of the NY Progressive Action Network said, referring to the city comptroller, who lost in the primary for mayor but cross-endorsed Mamdani.\n\nThe tiff comes as Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, is trying to rally people around his candidacy who did not support him in the primary — particularly black and Jewish elected officials and their constituents. He and his campaign are conducting outreach campaigns with lawmakers and Democratic leaders to expand and consolidate his support heading into the general election.","summary":"A rift erupted between Zohran Mamdani's leftist Democratic Socialist allies and House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, with threats of running primaries against each other.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/us-news/hakeem-jeffries-team-blasts-zohran-mamdanis-liberal-team-gentrification-as-primary-threats-spark-nyc-dem-feud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-ygw002o36-1752190477187.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752176100&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZPV40z8O-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:49:13","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":340411330,"title":"Stefanik challenger posts bizarre deepfake video of her mocking flirt with governor bid","text":"It also features an AI-altered President Donald Trump saying, “I’ve got bigwigs waiting and whispers galore.”\n\nAI deepfakes in campaign videos have been a hotly debated subject, especially during the 2024 election cycle.

North Country voters will swiftly demand his apology,” he added, concluding, “NY21 voters overwhelmingly support Elise running for Governor if she decides to run, where she will demolish Kathy Hochul.”\n\nStefanik has flirted with a 2026 New York gubernatorial bid for months and is considered the top GOP candidate.

Mike Lawler (R-NY), who is also considering a run for governor.\n\nGendebien may have not only offended Republicans with the ad but also the law, as his video may have violated New York election law.\n\nA portion of the New York FY 2024-25 budget says a “person, firm, association, corporation, campaign, committee, or organization that distributes or publishes any political communication that was produced by or includes materially deceptive media and knows or should know that it is materially deceptive shall be required to disclose this use.”\n\nAnd that for visual media, “the disclosure shall be printed or typed in a legible font size easily readable by the average viewer that is no smaller than other text appearing in the visual media and in the same language used on the communication to read as follows: ‘This (image, video, or audio) has been manipulated.'”\n\nThe video’s disclosure is smaller than other text lines in the video, such as the “We decided to announce for Elise Stefanik, since she can’t seem to do it herself” line.\n\nGendebien looks more competitive than other Democrats who have challenged Stefanik in the past, given that he has raised millions in the preceding months.

More the world.”\nGetty Images\n\nThe price of bitcoin increased by more than 4% on the day to just under $116,000 as of around 7:35 p.m. EDT, after briefly setting a new record high of $116,626 earlier in the evening.\n\nThursday’s record-setting performance for bitcoin marks the first record for the cryptocurrency since May 22, when the price of bitcoin increased to a then-record high just below $113,000 before fluctuating lower over the following month.\n\nOther cryptocurrencies have surged over the last 24 hours, including ethereum (up 7%), XRP (5.3%), Solana (4.3%) and the meme token dogecoin (6.2%).\n\nThe GOP-led House Committee on Financial Services announced earlier this month the week beginning July 14 would be “Crypto Week,” during which the House would consider crypto-friendly legislation like the GENIUS Act, among others, in moves the committee said would help make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.”\n\nBitcoin’s rise also comes amid more major crypto investments, including from GameStop, which purchased a batch of bitcoin worth about $513 million in May, and Trump Media and Technology Group, which said it would raise $2.5 billion to build a corporate bitcoin reserve.\n\nWhat Is The Genius Act?\n\nThe GENIUS Act, introduced in February by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., would set the first federal regulations for stablecoin issuers. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a more stable asset, like the U.S. dollar, in an aim to be less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Because of this, some analysts have argued the GENIUS Act would make stablecoins—a $238 billion market, according to CoinDesk—more trustworthy among new investors. The bill was approved by the Senate in a 66-32 vote in May, with 16 Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. New limits would require companies issuing stablecoins to hold a reserve of assets to back the cryptocurrency, a provision some legislators disputed would protect consumers. The GENIUS Act also requires stablecoin issuers to prioritize coin holders for repayment or reimbursement if the companies go bankrupt.\n\nAbout $160 billion. That’s how much was added to the global crypto market’s aggregate market value over the last 24 hours, increasing from $3.53 trillion to $3.69 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nKey Background\n\nBitcoin has traded over $100,000 in recent months as investors appear to sustain optimism for pro-crypto policies under President Donald Trump. The latest rise for bitcoin comes as both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 set new closing records, and as Nvidia became the first company valued at $4 trillion. House Republicans have echoed Trump’s call during his presidential campaign for the U.S. to become the “crypto capital of the planet,” and his election victory sent bitcoin above $100,000 for the first time within a month of Election Day. Growth slowed in the months after Trump’s inauguration before he announced the U.S. would establish a digital asset stockpile.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesTrump Media’s $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Bet Mirrors White House Crypto StrategyBy Zach EversonForbesBitcoin Hits All-Time High Of Over $109K Amid Crypto RallyBy Ty RoushForbesAI Titan Nvidia Becomes First $4 Trillion Company EverBy Derek Saul\n\nGot a tip?

The European Commission, the EU’s executive, announced 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in support.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been increasingly frustrated with Vladimir Putin over the lack of progress towards ending the war raging since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and has accused the Russian president of throwing a lot of “bullshit” at U.S. efforts to end the conflict.\n\nAt talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov while in Malaysia, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had reinforced the message that Moscow should show more flexibility.\n\n“We need to see a roadmap moving forward about how this conflict can conclude,” Rubio said, adding that the Trump administration had been engaging with the U.S. Senate on what new sanctions on Russia might look like.\n\n“It was a frank conversation. It was an important one,” Rubio said after the 50-minute talks in Kuala Lumpur. Moscow’s foreign ministry said they had shared “a substantive and frank exchange of views”.\n\nZelenskiy said Thursday’s assault by Russia had involved around 400 drones and 18 missiles, primarily targeting the capital.\n\nExplosions and anti-aircraft fire rattled the city. Windows were blown out, facades ravaged and cars burned to shells. In the city centre, an apartment in an eight-storey building was engulfed in flames.\n\n“This is terror because it happens every night when people are asleep,” said Karyna Volf, a 25-year-old Kyiv resident who rushed out of her apartment moments before it was showered with shards of glass.\n\nAir defences stopped all but a few dozen of the drones, authorities said, a day after Russia launched a record 728 drones at Ukraine.\n\nUKRAINE’S AIR DEFENCES STRAINED\n\nEscalating Russian strikes in recent weeks have strained Ukraine’s defences at a time when its troops are facing renewed pressure on the front line, and forced residents in Kyiv and across the country into bomb shelters.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said it had hit “military-industrial” targets in Kyiv as well as military airfields.

It features 11 alternating red and white stripes and a blue square with a single white star.\n\nThe white star symbolises Liberia as the first independent republic in Africa.\n\nThe US flag, in comparison, has 13 stripes representing the original 13 colonies and 50 stars, one for each state.\n\nThe Liberian flag was designed by seven black women, all born in America.\n\n4: Ex-president's son plays for US football team\n\nTimothy Weah, the son of Liberia's former President George Weah, is an American professional football player who plays for Italian club Juventus as well as the US national team.\n\nThe 25-year-old forward was born in the US but began his professional career with Paris St-Germain in France, where he won the Ligue 1 title before moving on loan to the Scottish team, Celtic.\n\nHis father, George, is a Liberian football legend who won the Ballon d'Or in 1995 while playing for Juventus's Italian rivals AC Milan. He is the only African winner of this award, and went on to be elected president in 2018.\n\n5: Former president won the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nLiberia produced Africa's first elected female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.\n\nShe was elected in 2005, two years after the nation's bloody civil war ended, and served as president until 2018.\n\nJohnson Sirleaf has a strong American background as she studied at Madison Business College and later went to Harvard University, where she graduated as an economist.\n\nShe has received worldwide recognition and accolades for maintaining peace during her administration.\n\nHer story is pitted with remarkable feats of defiance and courage.\n\nIn 2011, along with Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karmān, she won the Nobel Prize for Peace for her efforts to further women's rights.\n\nIn 2016, Forbes listed her among the most powerful women in the world.\n\n6: World's largest rubber plantation\n\nThe plantation, which measures 185 square miles (479 sq km), is owned by Firestone Liberia, a subsidiary of the US tyre manufacturer.\n\nIt was founded in 1926 to give the US access to rubber at a time when the product was controlled by the UK.\n\nFirestone remains Liberia's largest private employer, with more than 4,000 workers.\n\nThe company has been accused of human rights abuses going back almost to the foundation of the rubber industry in Liberia. In 2006, a UN report into Liberia's rubber industry said: \"Plantation workers are exposed to hazardous working conditions without adequate training or safety equipment.\n\n\"Many workers… do not receive fair wages or equal remuneration, and do not have the right to strike. Child labour is frequently used on the plantations,\" it said.\n\nFirestone has always denied such allegations and, in 2011, it was cleared of using child labour by a US court.\n\nRubber remains one of Liberia's biggest exports, and the US its largest market.\n\nWhat do Liberians make of Trump's comments?\n\nForeign Minister Sara Beysolow Nyanti denied it was an awkward moment, saying there was a \"lack of understanding\" around the world about the languages people speak in Africa, which she described as a \"multi-lingual continent\".\n\n\"Liberia happens to have the American-English intonation, and I believe President Trump heard something familiar in the way President Boakai spoke, which is different from the way others speak on the continent,\" she told the BBC's Newsday programme.\n\n\"We were not offended at all,\" she said, adding that away from the TV cameras, there was a discussion of the two countries' shared history.\n\nBut there was a mixed reaction among other Liberians.\n\nAccountant Joe Manley, 40, told the BBC that Trump should have been properly briefed before meeting Liberia's leader.\n\n\"Liberia has always been an English-speaking country. Our president represents a country with a rich educational tradition.\"\n\nFor human resources professional Henrietta Peters Magbollah, the US president's surprise at Boakai's eloquence reflects a broader problem of global ignorance regarding African nations and their peoples.\n\n\"From travel experiences and observations, most citizens of other nations outside Africa do not know a lot about African countries,\" she said. \"The few that know a little, their minds are clouded by narratives of war, poverty, and lack of education.\"\n\nHowever, lawyer and politician Kanio Gbala agreed with the foreign minister that no insult was meant.\n\n\"I believe President Trump's remark was a genuine compliment on President Boakai's command of English,\" he told the BBC. \"There is no evidence of sarcasm. Reading it as disrespectful may reflect political agendas.\"","summary":"US President Donald Trump has praised Liberian President Joseph Boakai for speaking \"good English\" and asked him where he went to school.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/six-things-trump-should-know-about-liberia-after-he-praised-leaders-good-english/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-835.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:39:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 39pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 39pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.238},{"id":340420040,"title":"White House: $40 Billion in Benefit Programs Protected from Illegals Under Trump EO","text":"An executive order issued by President Donald Trump in February is resulting in the protection of roughly $40 billion in public benefit programs from illegal aliens, according to the White House.\n\nIn February, Trump issued his executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,” which directed agencies to identify federally funded programs that allow “illegal aliens to obtain any cash or non-cash public benefit.”\n\nOn Thursday, the White House issued a release announcing that illegals would no longer have access to a number of public benefits within five different agencies following the review, including the departments of Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Justice, and Labor. \n\n“Past presidents sat by and allowed illegal aliens to steal public benefits at the expense of hardworking American taxpayers – that ends now.

With Rob Lowe, telling the Parks and Recreation alum that he flagged the President's lewd comments \"the day of filming\" in 2005.\n\n \"I called my producer [and] said, 'You're not gonna believe what Trump said. He is going after Nancy.' All I said was 'Nancy O'Dell' because I didn't hear the other stuff,\" Bush told Lowe, referencing his Access Hollywood colleague O'Dell. \"I said, 'He's trying to take Nancy furniture shopping to sleep with her. This is crazy. He's done it again! The guy's an animal!'\"\n\n Bush said he reported Trump's comments about O'Dell to his superior — seemingly leaving out Trump's comments about grabbing women by the genitals despite responding to him in the video — but claims the warning sat \"in a desk forever.\"\n\n \"Had that tape leaked out when it actually occurred in 2005, I would've been fired for an entirely different reason; killing [NBC's] cash cow,\" Bush alleged. \"Trump was a protected, revered source. He was a hundred million dollars in profit for NBC. He was the king of the ratings.\"\n\n That reverence didn't last long, according to Bush.\n\n \"It cost a lot of money to make The Apprentice cost nothing,\" he told Lowe. \"And his ratings were huge... Then, years later, the falling out, he used to own the pageant and air it on NBC and they have litigation and they hate him, and now he's running for president and they want him dead,\" he claimed.\n\n The veteran broadcaster alleged the NBC executives had been on the hunt for clips that featured Trump speaking in a disparaging manner about women after a former pageant queen came forward and said the then-presidential candidate had been inappropriate with her.\n\n \"Trump said, 'I've never said or done anything inappropriate with women ever in my life,'\" Bush recalled. \"And then NBC, who hates him, sent out these messages to every division of the company: 'Do you have any tapes...what they really wanted was Mark Burnett's tape, the guy who ran The Apprentice, because there's outtakes forever -- but [they asked], 'Does anyone else have anything of him talking disparagingly about women? We need this.' And my producer at the time was like, 'Holy s***. The bus ride. That tape, that was like 11 years ago. That's the time when Bush called me right after it happened.'\"\n\n The Washington Post later published an exposé revealing the audio and created a huge scandal late in the 2016 election cycle, ultimately leading to Bush's firing from the network. In the tape, Trump was heard on a hot mic making lewd comments about women and seemingly bragging about committing sexual assault. \"When you're a star, they let you do it,\" Trump is overheard saying. \"You can do anything.\"\n\n Bush does not say much in the interaction, only heard laughing and occasionally egging the then-Apprentice host on. But his involvement ended up costing him a job at NBC's Today.\n\n \"They had what they thought was the one thing — we've learned later, nothing takes him out,\" Bush noted. \"But this, at the time, I think everybody agreed had to be the thing.

The official cautioned that \"reaching it would take a very difficult recovery effort.\"The Israeli assessment also holds that Iran's stockpiles were spread across Isfahan, Fordo, and Natanz, and had not been moved before the \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" strikes, despite some nuclear experts suggesting Tehran may have attempted to relocate them as tensions rose and U.S. involvement appeared imminent.The White House declined to comment on the situation to the Associated Press on Thursday, as questions continue to mount about whether the U.S. mission achieved its intended goal of permanently disabling Iran's nuclear program.The evolving analyses from Israel, U.S. intelligence agencies, and international observers suggest that while damage was indeed inflicted, Iran may yet have the means—or at least the potential—to rebuild.The June 22 strikes, ordered by President Donald Trump, marked a bold U.S. intervention into Israel's ongoing conflict with Iran, aimed at crippling Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Trump has repeatedly insisted the attacks \"obliterated\" the sites, declaring them fully destroyed. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed that sentiment, calling the facilities \"destroyed.\"However, early assessments from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency offered a more cautious analysis, stating the Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan sites suffered significant—but not total—destruction.CIA Director John Ratcliffe, defending the operation before skeptical lawmakers, asserted that the U.S. eliminated Iran's only metal conversion facility—an essential part of the nuclear process.Despite these claims, doubts remain about the efficacy of the U.S. munitions used in the strikes. Two officials from the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which developed the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs specifically for hard-to-reach Iranian targets, said Thursday they have yet to confirm whether the bombs reached the intended depth. These officials also spoke on condition of anonymity, revealing that the agency still awaits post-strike data to evaluate bomb performance.Meanwhile, attention has shifted to Isfahan, where U.S. B-2 stealth bombers did not strike, unlike the Fordo and Natanz sites. The Isfahan nuclear site in Iran is known for its role in the conversion of uranium, a key step in the nuclear fuel cycle.Although B-2s were not used for Isfahan, the Pentagon said a U.S. submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets at the Isfahan site. These missiles were likely aimed at different types of targets within the complex compared to those targeted by the B-2s at Fordo and Natanz.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a recent interview with conservative U.S. broadcaster Tucker Carlson, said the strikes had caused such extensive damage that Iranian officials have yet to access the affected nuclear facilities.\"Unfortunately, as a result of the United States' unlawful attacks against our nuclear centers and installations, many of the pieces of equipment and the facilities there have been severely damaged,\" Pezeshkian said.He added that Iran is open to resuming cooperation with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but cannot yet guarantee full access to inspectors.Rafael Grossi, director general of the IAEA, stated last month that Iran's facilities \"have been destroyed to an important degree.\" Still, he added a caveat: \"If they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"Grossi emphasized that a full damage assessment depends entirely on Iran allowing inspectors into the sites.\"Frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared, and there is nothing there,\" he said.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"The Israeli assessment also holds that Iran's stockpiles were spread across Isfahan, Fordo, and Natanz, and had not been moved.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/adl-greenblatt-missed-musk-salute-grok-antisemitism-hitler-2097590","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2681015/operation-midnight-hammer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:28:39","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.737},{"id":340417500,"title":"\"Bad Day\": Trump Reflects On Assassination Bid One Year Later","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-reflects-on-assassination-bid-one-year-later-8857795\" on this server.\nReference #18.91a12417.1752195614.2d86660\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.91a12417.1752195614.2d86660","summary":"US President Donald Trump says \"mistakes were made\" but he's satisfied with the investigation into his near-assassination a year ago, as the Secret Service announced disciplinary actions Thursday against six staff members.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-reflects-on-assassination-bid-one-year-later-8857795","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:27:30","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1}]}
