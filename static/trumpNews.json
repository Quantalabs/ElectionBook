Mr. Corbyn, an avowed socialist who took control of the party in 2015, was its most left-wing leader in a generation, with plans for a sweeping programme of nationalisation.

Qasem Soleimani in January 2020. \n\n'We're honored to be joined by 150 airmen and their families from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the home of the B-2 bomber,' Trump said from the Truman Balcony Friday to cheers from the crowd. \n\n'And we've kept them a little bit on guard, we've kept them a little bit - let's be a little bit quiet about it. If you want to raise your hand very quickly, raise your hand, because you people are just incredible,' the president instructed. \n\nMelania Trump, dressed in a white shirt-dress, could be seen shaking her head and then laughing. \n\nAt least one member of the crowd appeared to raise his hand at the president's request. \n\n'We don't want to be in disguise, we don't have to do that,' the president continued. 'They're looking at us like we're a bunch of babies.'\n\n'We don't have to be in disguise. We saw all those hands go up,' he added. 'Thank you very much. We owe you everything.'\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request on whether the servicemembers would receive protection if Iran decided to retaliate against them.\n\nBefore the president made his remarks, there were three military flyovers the White House, two which featured the giant B-2 stealth jets - which dropped 'bunker buster' bombs onto the Iran nuclear site Fordow. \n\nTomahawk missiles fired from a submarine were used to attack the Iranian nuclear sites of Natanz and Isfahan as well. \n\nAs Iran woke up to the news, Trump addressed the bombings from the White House that Saturday night, saying the sites were 'completely and totally obliterated.' \n\nHe railed against CNN and The New York Times for reporting on an initial assessment that didn't paint as rosy a picture about the destructive nature of the attacks, suggesting they only set the Iranian nuclear agenda back by a number of months. \n\nTrump said the B-2 pilots needed to be 'respected' by news outlets. \n\n'Very unfair to the pilots that risk their lives for our country, and then they get fake news and CNN make up a phony story to get some hits. That's the only reason I care about it, because those pilots were so brave, I've never seen anything like it,' Trump said last week while attending the NATO Summit in the Hague. \n\n'They flew into the hornets' nest and then they got hurt so badly by what the fake news wrote,' Trump argued. \n\nIran retaliated by sending missiles toward the Al-Udeid Air Base located outside of Doha in Qatar - the U.S.'s largest military installation in the Middle East, which Trump had visited the month before. \n\nThose missiles were all intercepted and later that day, the president announced a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel - which has since held, after a few initial missile firings and some strong language about the conflict out of Trump's mouth. \n\nThe president was in a much better mood on Friday, celebrating both the servicemembers in the South Lawn and what he called his 'greatest victory yet' - Congressional passage of the so-called 'Big, Beautiful Bill.' \n\nAfter the flyovers and a brief speech, Trump walked down onto the South Lawn and signed the bill into law, surrounded by Republican lawmakers.\n\nHe gleefully tapped the gavel presented to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was standing along Trump's side. \n\nThe crowd was interspersed with Cabinet members and top Trump officials including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan 'Razin' Caine, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, EPA Secretary Lee Zeldin and more.","summary":"Melania Trump gave Donald Trump a pointed glance when he asked the B-2 pilots involved in the Iran strike to reveal their identities as they were feted at the Fourth of July celebration Friday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14877027/melania-trump-flinches-donald-trump-b-2-pilots-identities.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/01/100025899-0-image-m-39_1751674058081.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 00:54:15","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":338396716,"title":"'Just ignore Farage': Boris Johnson tells Tories how to counter the rise of Reform - as calls grow for former PM to lead the Conservatives once again","text":"Boris Johnson has suggested that the best way for the Conservative Party to tackle the rise of Reform is to simply ignore them. \n\nThe former prime minister, who led the Tories when the Brexit Party, now known as Reform, was polling at 'zero per cent', believes that attacking them head-on is a waste of energy.\n\nSpeaking about his time leading the Conservatives, Mr Johnson pointed out that Reform's popularity in the polls was practically non-existent when he was in charge. \n\nHe said that his approach was clear: 'My strategy with the individuals that you mention is don't talk about them.'\n\nHe added: 'I think Conservatives need to focus on the economy and making life better for people and giving people opportunity. \n\n'I think if we concentrate on the economy we mount full spectrum warfare on all the things that Starmer is doing wrong, we will win.' \n\nHis advice comes after Reform's rise in the polls, with the party making a significant impact in the May local elections. \n\nMeanwhile, some Tory MPs have been calling for the former prime minister to make a dramatic return to the Commons, hoping he can evive the ailing Conservative Party.\n\nReform gained control of seven local authorities and became the largest party in three more, a stunning sweep that left Conservative strongholds in tatters. \n\nHis remarks come amid growing concern in Conservative ranks about the threat from Reform, which has seen increasing support, particularly since the last general election. \n\nWhile the Tories lost a staggering 252 seats and only managed a 23.2 per cent vote share, Reform surged to secure five seats with 14.3 per cent of the vote. \n\nIn recent months, both Sir Keir Starmer and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch have come under fire for spending too much time attacking Reform. \n\nMrs Badenoch, in a March interview with The Telegraph, dismissed Nigel Farage as a 'reality TV star,' suggesting that government should not be about drama. \n\nBut Mr Farage fired back, saying it was a good thing people knew who he was, comparing his TV background to Donald Trump's unconventional political rise.\n\nIn May, the Prime Minister escalated his rhetoric, attacking Reform directly and calling them his main political rival. \n\nYet, his attempt to discredit the party has only backfired. \n\nLast month, he echoed Reform's tough stance on immigration, warning that Britain could become an 'island of strangers.' \n\nHis words sparked outrage among Labour MPs, and he was forced to walk back the comment, admitting regret.\n\nIn May this year, Mr Johnson's allies were reportedly trying to convince him to make a bombshell return.\n\nMrs Badenoch attempted to play down the prospect of a political return by Mr Johnson in a TV interview this morning, telling GB News: 'So, I love Boris.\n\n'He sends me lots of messages, gives me lots of advice, like Iain Duncan Smith, like David Cameron.\n\n'I have great people who have been in this situation before, who dealt with difficult times. So it's up to him what he wants to do.\n\n'I have to focus on my job, which is making sure that Keir Starmer does not do more than the damage he's doing right now.\n\n'We have to get him out in four years time, otherwise there's not going to be a country left I'm afraid.","summary":"The former prime minister, who led the Tories when the Brexit Party, now known as Reform, was polling at 'zero per cent,' believes that attacking them head-on is a waste of energy.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14877087/Just-ignore-Farage-Boris-Johnson-tells-Tories-counter-rise-Reform-calls-grow-former-PM-lead-Conservatives-again.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/01/100026069-0-image-m-25_1751675626081.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-05 00:51:38","author":"Editor,Jose Ramos","authors":["Editor","Jose Ramos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":338398798,"title":"Trump signs his landmark bill at Fourth of July picnic; his historic, divisive policy win now cast in stone","text":"APPresident Donald Trump signs his signature bill of tax breaks and spending cuts at the White House.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed his package of tax breaks and spending cuts into law Friday in front of Fourth of July picnickers after his cajoling produced almost unanimous Republican support in Congress for the domestic priority that could cement his second-term legacy. Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill's final passage Thursday. Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic - and divisive - legislative victory in time for the nation's birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic. \"America's winning, winning, winning like never before,\" Trump said, noting last month's bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear programme, which he said the flyover was meant to honour. \"Promises made, promises kept, and we've kept them.\" The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The US Marine Band played patriotic marches - and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.Live Events Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energised as the legislation's passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of US Supreme Court ruling she's fought for. The budget legislation is the president's highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended \"our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,\" because of the legislation. Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability. \"Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country's largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,\" AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. \"Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a USD 5 trillion gift.\" The legislation extends Trump's 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by USD 1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law. The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering. It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump's wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote. In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump's well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill. The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama's Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden's tax credits for renewable energy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add USD 3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage. Democrats vow to make bill a midterm issue Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill \"devastating\" and said in a statement that Trump's signature on the legislation \"sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests - not working families.\" He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. \"This was a full betrayal of the American people,\" Martin said. Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, \"and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn't vote at all and it's terrible.\" He said their \"standard line\" is to say Republican legislation is \"dangerous\" or \"everybody's going to die\" and \"we can't let them get away with it.\" With his bill, Trump said, \"it's actually just the opposite, everybody's going to live.\" \"And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it's all a con job,\" Trump said, defending a package that now is law. Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats \"hate Trump - but I hate them, too.\" The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year's midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements. Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as \"very popular,\" though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best. For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of US adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid. But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about USD 45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centres. About 60 per cent said it was \"unacceptable\" that the bill is expected to increase the USD 36 trillion US debt by more than USD 3 trillion over the next decade.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrumpdonald trumptrump billbig beautiful billus tax cut billus spending cut bill\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

It's been everywhere and it was just appalling that it got stolen in Essex'. \nDevelopment of the Silver Ghost goes back to the start of the 20th century, before development was suspended during World War 1. \nDuring the conflict, the chassis and engine were used for armoured cars - while a blue 1909 model known as Blue Mist was used by legendary officer Laurence of Arabia.\n\nDevelopment of the Silver Ghost goes back to the start of the 20th century, before development was suspended during World War 1\n\nMr Fitton says he is delighted to be reunited with his beloved Rolls – and he hopes its next stop will be Helsinki, as originally planned\nA total of 7874 Silver Ghosts were produced between 1907 and 1926, with former owners of the luxury vehicle including American President Woodrow Wilson. It was named the 'best car in the world' by Autocar in 1907.\nThe theft - and joyful recovery - comes as Essex Police announced a drop in vehicle crime, with 573 fewer offences recorded in the country over the past year, representing a ten per cent decrease.\nShaun Kane, Essex Police's Detective Superintendent, said: 'Vehicle theft is not a victimless crime - it causes real distress to owners and disruption to their everyday lives and their businesses. \n'We're proud to have made such significant progress in reducing this type of crime, and it will be welcomed by everyone in Essex.' \nFor now, Mr Fitton says he is delighted to be reunited with his beloved Rolls – and he hopes its next stop will be Helsinki, as originally planned.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \n'Irreplaceable' 100-year-old Rolls-Royce stolen in hotel heist is returned after schoolboy spotted it and told his father - who then tipped off police\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

serangan terbesar ke atas Ukraine","text":"KYIV: Russia semalam menyatakan pihaknya tidak melihat sebarang jalan diplomatik segera untuk menamatkan perang di Ukraine, hanya beberapa jam selepas melancarkan serangan dron dan peluru berpandu terbesar sejak pencerobohan bermula.\n\nSerangan berterusan selama beberapa jam itu memaksa rakyat Ukraine berlindung di tempat perlindungan di seluruh negara dan dan ia berlaku sejurus satu panggilan telefon antara Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump dan Presiden Russia, Vladimir Putin yang berakhir tanpa membuahkan hasil.\n\nTrump turut berkata beliau tidak mencapai sebarang kemajuan dalam perbincangannya dengan Putin bagi menamatkan lebih tiga tahun pertempuran sengit sejak Kremlin mengarahkan tenteranya menceroboh Ukraine.\n\nTerdahulu, wartawan AFP di Kyiv melaporkan bunyi dengungan dron berlegar di ruang udara ibu negara dan letupan berlaku sepanjang malam ketika sistem pertahanan udara Ukraine bertindak balas terhadap serangan itu.\n\nPresiden Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky yang turut bercakap dengan Trump, berkata mereka bersetuju untuk bekerjasama memperkukuh pertahanan udara negara itu bagi menangkis serangan dari udara.\n\n\"Kami berbincang mengenai peluang dalam aspek pertahanan udara dan bersetuju untuk bekerjasama memperkukuh perlindungan ruang udara kami,\" katanya di media sosial selepas panggilan itu.\n\nBeliau berkata, berkata amaran serangan udara mula bergema di seluruh negara ketika panggilan telefon antara Trump dan Putin berlangsung.\n\n\"Sekali lagi, Russia menunjukkan ia tidak mempunyai niat untuk menamatkan perang dan keganasan,\" katanya di media sosial.\n\nBeliau turut menggesa AS supaya meningkatkan tekanan terhadap Moscow, yang pada Jumaat mengumumkan pencapaian baharu di barisan hadapan selepas menawan sebuah kampung di wilayah Donetsk.\n\nPoland pula memaklumkan bangunan kedutaannya di Kyiv rosak dalam serangan itu, namun semua kakitangannya selamat.\n\nKementerian Luar Jerman pula berkata masa serangan itu menunjukkan Moscow terus memilih pendekatan keganasan.\n\n\"Ukraine memerlukan lebih banyak bantuan untuk mempertahankan diri, bukan sebaliknya,\" menurut kementerian itu di media sosial.\n\nSeorang jurucakap kerajaan Jerman memberitahu wartawan bahawa Berlin sedang meneliti kemungkinan untuk membeli lebih banyak sistem pertahanan udara Patriot dari AS bagi dibekalkan kepada Ukraine.\n\nDi Kyiv, seorang mangsa berjaya diselamatkan dari runtuhan selepas serangan itu, yang turut mencederakan sekurang-kurangnya 26 orang, menurut perkhidmatan kecemasan.\n\nMenurut pihak tentera udara Ukraine, serangan itu membabitkan 539 dron dan 11 peluru berpandu.\n\nSeorang wakil tentera udara memberitahu media tempatan ia adalah serangan terbesar sejak pencerobohan Russia bermula.\n\nSerangan yang disasarkan ketika waktu malam oleh Russia dilaporkan semakin memuncak dalam beberapa minggu kebelakangan ini.\n\nPerangkaan AFP mendapati Moscow melancarkan jumlah rekod tertinggi dron dan peluru berpandu ke atas Ukraine sepanjang bulan lalu, ketika rundingan damai secara langsung antara Kyiv dan Moscow dilihat menemui jalan buntu.\n\nWartawan AFP di Kyiv menyaksikan puluhan penduduk ibu negara berlindung di sebuah stesen metro.\n\nDi Kyiv, kebimbangan semakin memuncak mengenai sama ada AS akan terus menyalurkan bantuan ketenteraan yang menjadi kunci kepada keupayaan Ukraine menangkis serangan dron dan peluru berpandu.\n\nMinggu ini AS mengumumkan pihaknya akan mengurangkan sebahagian daripada penghantaran bantuannya.\n\nPresiden Suruhanjaya Eropah, Ursula von der Leyen menyifatkan langkah itu sebagai isyarat jelas Kesatuan Eropah yang dianggotai 27 negara perlu 'meningkatkan usaha'.\n\nUkraine turut

Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley wished America a happy 249th birthday:\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the American colonies came together to declare their independence, opposing oppression and creating the foundation for one of the world’s greatest experiments in self-governance.\nIndependence Day celebrates the birth of our nation and serves as a reminder of the remarkable gift of freedom that embodies the American spirit. As we gather with loved ones, we pay tribute to the brave individuals who paved the way for this aspiring nation with their noble sacrifices. May our freedoms be blessed, and may America be blessed as well.\n\nCompare that message with the one from the melancholy DNC:\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, however, released a July 4 statement criticizing President Donald Trump and Republicans for passing the tax-cut and spending bill, stating it was “putting the American Dream out of reach.”\n“America should be the land of opportunity but under Donald Trump, the American dream is dying,” the DNC said.\n\nThe patriotism divide has shown up in polling, as RedState’s Becky Noble and Nick Arama have reported:\n\nWhen Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and spent the subsequent four years trying to ruin the country, my patriotism did not evaporate, and I loved my country as much as ever. Democrats, however, have a long history of denigrating our accomplishments and downplaying the successes of the Great Experiment. When they don’t get their way, they spend most of their time droning on about how awful we are as a people and as a nation and how over half of us are “garbage” and “deplorable.”\n\nIt’s a losing strategy in the long run, in my opinion, because more and more Americans are finding out it’s cool to be patriotic again.\n\nThat’s proving true today all across the country. ‘Merica is back, and too bad for the doomsday crowd if they don’t like it. They can put in earplugs tonight and watch re-runs of “The West Wing.”\n\nHelp us continue to report how Trump is making America great again!

\"momentous occasion,\" noting it will be the first bilateral visit by an Indian PM in over five decades.\nArgentina would be the third leg of PM Modi's five-nation tour after Ghana, and Trinidad and

On the next day, PM, Modi will pay homage to Jose de San Martin, widely regarded as the Father of the Argentine Nation, at the Plaza de San Martin in Buenos Aires. PM Modi will also hold delegation-level talks with Argentine President Javier Milei, and thereafter, he will visit the famous Boca Juniors Stadium to have a look at Argentine football.\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Conferred With 'The Order of the Republic of Trinidad & Tobago' During Ceremonial Event at President's House in Port of Spain (See Pics and Videos).\n\"Prime Minister arrives late in the evening... He will be received by the community... The next day, the Prime Minister will pay his respects and homage to the father of the Argentine nation. He's commonly known as the Libertadores Plaza de San Martin. At the Plaza, he would be joined by the foreign minister of this country. Thereafter, he will have an official delegation-level meeting at the Casa Rosada, which is the president's office. He will meet the President of Argentina, Javier Milei. In the afternoon, before he departs, we have scheduled a small visit for him at the Boca Juniors Stadium, where he will get a look at the Argentine football,\" Ajaneesh Kumar said. Ajaneesh Kumar also emphasised that this will be the first visit by the Indian Prime Minister in over five decades and mentioned the \"multifaceted\" relations between both nations. \"Prime Minister Modi's visit to Argentina is a momentous occasion in our bilateral relations. This visit is coming after a long time, over five decades. Prime Minister had the occasion to meet the President of Argentina last November during the G20 in Brazil. This visit will only consolidate the points discussed during the last meeting. India and Argentina relations are multifaceted. We have cooperation across a range of subjects. It was only last year that we celebrated 75 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries,\" he said. Ambassador Ajaneesh Kumar also shed light on India-Argentina cooperation in various sectors \"There is a wide segment of sectors in which the two countries are cooperating already and some of them we need to open the doors and windows for the future... We have a good cooperation going between the energy companies of India... We have a good representation of Indian two-wheelers in Argentina... Argentina is a major agricultural country, and we have tractors present here,\" he said. He also suggested that Argentina could benefit from India's pharmaceutical sector, as India is referred to as the \"pharmacy of the world.\"\n\"There is another sector which needs to be looked at very carefully, and Argentina can make use of, and that is the Indian pharmaceutical and medical devices sector... India is called the pharmacy of the world, and the medical devices made in India are of top grade. They have found markets all over Europe, in the European Union as well as in the United States... I don't see any reason why they cannot come to the Argentine market and the people of this country benefit at a cheaper cost and good quality,\" he said. Additionally, President of CIARA, Argentine Edible Oil Association, Gustavo Idigoras, highlighted the significance of PM Modi's visit to the South American nations, pressing on the need to have a closer economic and commercial relationship with India.\n\"This visit of PM Modi in Argentina will be the most important visit in the last 20 years. Argentina needs to have a closer economic and commercial relationship with India. We are promoting better dialogue,\" Gustavo Idigoras said. \"The Argentine administration and President Milei are totally convinced that he needs to work more closely with PM Modi. We are very happy to receive him with the idea to boost and double the bilateral trade, which is currently more than 5 billion (dollars). Our idea is to try to reach more than 8 billion in the next 3-4 years,\" he added. PM Modi is headed for Buenos Aires at the official invitation of the President of the Republic of Argentina. After completing his visit to Argentina, PM Modi will head to Brazil from July 5 to July 8 to attend the 17th BRICS Summit 2025. In the final leg of his five-nation tour, the PM will visit Namibia and also address its parliament.

The world seems more unstable and unpredictable than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Conflicts have been proliferating. New ones have erupted even as longer-running wars persist. The Middle East remains in turmoil and the war in Gaza continues. The Ukraine war is still raging. President Donald Trump has contributed much to international volatility by his disruptive policies and upending of the global trade system, but the world was already passing through unsettled times with multilateralism under unprecedented strain. Geopolitical tensions have escalated while the US-China confrontation remains the most significant strategic dynamic in a world in flux. \n\nThe global order has been fragmenting with increasing attacks by powerful countries on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of weaker states or those regarded as adversaries. Long-established global norms are being undermined. The threat or the use of force has become all too frequent. Examples abound of how international law is being flouted with impunity by countries launching military strikes on other nations in what are often disingenuously called pre-emptive wars. This has produced what UN Secretary General António Guterres once described as an “epidemic of impunity”. Israel’s war on Gaza, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombing of Iran, India’s unprovoked attack on Pakistan and Israeli strikes on Iran all violated international law and the UN Charter. Does this represent what some call a new era of escalation? Is this a dangerous ‘new normal’?\n\nCountries taking such military offensives seem to calculate that there will be minimum or no international consequences or diplomatic costs of their actions. This is encouraging a casual and careless defiance of international law. In some cases, there hasn’t even been global condemnation of military aggression. For example, no Western country denounced the Israeli attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, prohibited by international law, additional protocols of the Geneva Conventions and UN Security Council resolutions; instead, some countries applauded the strikes. Then there is the double standard practised by much of Europe towards the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza — condemning Russia and supporting Ukraine but not applying the same principle to Israel, the aggressor, in its genocidal war on Gaza. For many countries of the Global South, this has spelt the denouement of a rules-based order, whose rules were in any case unequally applied and advantaged Western powers.\n\n History is testimony to the fallacy that the use of force can bring peace and security.\n\nThe fraught security environment, marked by lawlessness, armed conflicts and mounting geopolitical tensions, has had an obvious impact. It has led to a significant rise in global defence spending, with the world rearming at an alarming pace. According to the annual 2025 report by Sipri (Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute), global defence expenditure has hit a record level. The most significant spending increases are accounted for by countries either engaged in or anticipating regional conflict. The annual Military Balance report by IISS (International Institute of Strategic Studies) also found global defence spending soaring to a new high. This is having a destabilising impact at both the global and regional levels.\n\nGrowing insecurity and rising threat perceptions have also engendered renewed thinking among countries about seeking nuclear weapons. Having witnessed how Iran and Ukraine were attacked by nuclear powers — Iran, an NPT member-nation being bombed by two nuclear weapon states — many countries have been encouraged to see nuclear weapons as the most viable option for their security. The lesson countries facing security challenges may have drawn from recent events is that without nuclear weapons they are more vulnerable to external aggression and attacks on their sovereignty. This makes a discriminatory global non-proliferation regime, that has been eroding over time, more questionable in the eyes of many states. The Sipri report highlights the potential for more countries to consider developing or hosting nuclear weapons. This at a time when the nuclear arsenals of nuclear-armed states are being “enlarged and upgraded”.\n\nAccompanying these trends is declining faith in diplomacy. This doesn’t of course mean that diplomacy isn’t needed, but when diplomacy fails to produce results or negotiations are used as a smokescreen for military action — as Israel has been doing in talks with Hamas and the US did with Iran — its efficacy comes into doubt. This is consequential as the breakdown of trust makes countries reticent and sceptical about negotiations, as for example Iran is in response to talks offers from the US. \n\nMultilateral institutions, too, are faced today with a crisis of credibility and legitimacy. Guterres has repeatedly said trust in global institutions is at a breaking point with multilateral organisations ailing and in need of urgent reform and revitalisation. The loss of faith in multilateralism, he has said, is because people see “broken promises, unmet commitments, double standards, and vast inequalities”. Former secretary general Ban Ki-moon has gone even further arguing that “the UN is slipping into dysfunction”. In a recent essay in The Economist, co-authored with Helen Clark, he attributed this to the organisation’s powerful members, who “disregard the rule of law when it suits them”, and to “certain leaders who want to see the UN on its knees”.\n\nWhat has brought the UN into disrepute is the role of the Security Council whose principal responsibility is to prevent conflicts, end wars and preserve international peace. The Council has failed to live up to this responsibility because of its veto-wielding members and the divisions among them. Not only has the SC failed to prevent genocide in Gaza and end Israel’s war there, some of its permanent members have invaded countries, bombed states and attacked the sovereignty of other nations. \n\nWhat all this adds up to is growing international disorder in which unilateral actions by big countries and regional powers are posing new risks and magnifying threats to international peace and security. The most dangerous approach adopted by leaders of some countries is based on their belief that the use of force will deliver peace and stability. History bears testimony to the fallacy of such a notion. \n\nThe writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025","summary":"IF recent developments have demonstrated anything it is that there are few certainties in geopolitics today.

Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.\n “America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month’s bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear programme, which he said the flyover was meant to honour. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.” The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The US Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.\n Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energised as the legislation’s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of US Supreme Court ruling she’s fought for.\n The budget legislation is the president’s highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended “our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” because of the legislation.\n Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.\n “Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country’s largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. “Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a USD 5 trillion gift.” The legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by USD 1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.\n The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.\n It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.\n In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill.\n The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.\n The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add USD 3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.\n Democrats vow to make bill a midterm issue Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill “devastating” and said in a statement that Trump’s signature on the legislation “sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests — not working families.” He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. “This was a full betrayal of the American people,” Martin said.\n Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, “and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn’t vote at all and it’s terrible.” He said their “standard line” is to say Republican legislation is “dangerous” or “everybody’s going to die” and “we can’t let them get away with it.” With his bill, Trump said, “it’s actually just the opposite, everybody’s going to live.” “And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it’s all a con job,” Trump said, defending a package that now is law.\n Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats “hate Trump — but I hate them, too.” The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year’s midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.\n Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.\n For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of US adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.\n But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about USD 45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centres. About 60 per cent said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the USD 36 trillion US debt by more than USD 3 trillion over the next decade.

The ceremony of signing the One Big Beautiful Bill into law was attended by many high-profile Republican members of Congress, as well as First Lady Melania Trump. The event coincided with the Fourth of July, America’s Independence Day. In his speech presiding over the signing, Trump lavished praise on congressional Republicans who pushed the bill through both chambers in close votes that saw several Republicans ditch the party line to vote against the legislation. Trump specifically touted the tax cut aspect of the bill, which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts, exempting tips and overtime pay from tax, as well as the expansion of immigration enforcement and deportation efforts. “We made promises, and it’s really promises made, promises kept,” Trump declared. In a surprising turn, Trump publicly praised and thanked Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska after she cast a crucial vote in favor of the bill in the Senate, following substantial incentives directed toward her state. The gesture was unexpected, given Murkowski’s long-standing opposition to Trump, including votes against him in the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections, as well as her vote to convict him during his second impeachment trial. In addition to the tax cuts, the Big Beautiful Bill significantly cut funding for key social programs, including Medicaid and SNAP. It also rolled back incentives aimed at promoting green energy, such as the electric vehicle (EV) tax exemption, drawing sharp criticism from former Trump megadonor and close advisor Elon Musk.

As a result, it is expected to add approximately $3.4 trillion to the national debt over that period. Congressional Democrats were unanimous in their opposition to the Big Beautiful Bill and found support among some Republicans, including Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick and Thomas Massie in the House, and Senators Rand Paul, Thom Tillis, and Susan Collins in the Senate.

Email nic.white@dailymail.com\nBy NIC WHITE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:13 BST, 5 July 2025 |Updated:01:13 BST, 5 July 2025 \n\nAs they frolic around Disney's massive Dream cruise ship, the last thing 2,500 passengers are worried about is falling overboard.\nSturdy railings stand 42.5 inches (3.5ft) off the floor, protecting a gust of wind or rough seas from throwing anyone to almost certain death.\nFamilies lounge on deck chairs or play shuffleboard just a couple of feet from the edge of the ship as joggers speed past on deck four's running track.\nYet somehow, a five-year-old girl disappeared over the side on Sunday as the ship steamed back to Fort Lauderdale from the Bahamas.\nThe little girl plunged 45 to 50ft into the water, with her father, 37, heroically diving in seconds later to save her.\nHundreds of passengers watched as the pair were dramatically rescued by the ship's crew after the brave dad kept his daughter afloat for 20 minutes.\nUsing video and photos taken on the ship by passengers, the Daily Mail has pinpointed the spot she fell, and where rescuers leaped into action.\nThe footage reveals what experts call a near-fatal flaw in the ship's design that Disney fixed in later additions to its fleet - but didn't retrofit on the Dream.\n\nA five-year-old girl fell out a porthole just like this on the Disney Dream cruise ship on Sunday after climbing up and sitting on the railing. The shelf the boy in this photo is leaning on is a glaring weakness in the design as it allows a child to easily climb onto the railing\n\nThe hall on the port side of deck four of the Disney Dream where the portholes she fell out of are\nPolice confirmed she fell from the one spot on the whole ship a mischievous child could get into trouble - a series of portholes along deck four's aft section.\nUnlike railings elsewhere on the ship, which are lined with smooth plexiglass from top to bottom, the portholes have one glaring weakness.\nUnder the porthole, the steel wall forms a kind of shelf, about the height of a man's thigh, that the rest of the railing is built on top of.\nThe design makes it easy for even a child to climb onto the shelf, and then on top of the much shorter railing above it that doesn't have any plexiglass, sea safety expert Mario Vittone explained.\nAnother Disney cruise ship, the Fantasy, has a slightly different design where the railing is at the front of the shelf with plexiglass blocking it, making it much more difficult to climb on. \nBroward County Sheriff Gregory Tony, whose office is investigating, explained the girl 'lost her balance while sitting on a railing' and fell backwards over the side.\n'After the girl’s mother alerted her husband, who didn’t see the incident, he jumped into the ocean to save his daughter,' he said.\nSheriff Tony said the ship’s security camera caught the entire horrifying series of events on video.\n\nAnother Disney cruise ship, the Fantasy, has a slightly different design where the railing is at the front of the shelf with plexiglass blocking it, making it much more difficult to climb on - as pointed out by a passenger posting this photo to Reddit\n\nThe portholes are open to the sea, as shown here where a passenger stuck their phone out of one to record the outside of the ship and sunset\nVittone, a 28-year US Coast Guard veteran, said the near-fatal accident should ring alarm bells for Disney.\n'We had a saying in the USCG prevention division: \"All safety regulations are written in blood\",' he told the Daily Mail.\n'We very often learn things are a problem when something we didn't expect, happens.\n'This child, essentially, put her center of gravity over the rail and then tumbled. She climbed off the ship... unintentionally.'\nVittone said the Dream's portholes were built to regulation, but he expected every ship in Disney's fleet would quickly be updated to improve safety. \n'Where Disney will have a problem is in parsing the decision to make one ship \"safer\" for the (unpredictable, on their own unsafe) child passengers, but not make that same modification to the other ships in its fleet,' he said.\n'Cruise ships routinely overboard railings beyond requirements to make leaving the ship all but impossible but for the most determined to leave.\n'They missed this feature on this particular ship. No doubt, they will now fix this on every ship like it.\n'Thankfully, this lesson wasn't written in blood. That the father saw the incident and jumped is the only reason.'\n\nDeck four includes a jogging track and is lined with railings that extend 42.5 inches from the floor with plexiglass in front of them\n\nMario Vittone, a 28-year US Coast Guard veteran and sea safety expert, said the near-fatal accident should ring alarm bells for Disney\nDisney didn't immediately respond when asked why the porthole design was changed for the Fantasy and if its older ships would be retrofitted.\nWhat police didn't explain was what the girl's parents were doing while she climbed onto the porthole railing.\nMonica Shannon, who was on holiday with her husband and young child, said a crew member told her they were engrossed in a game.\n'She said the parents were playing shuffleboard and the girl was climbing on the railings... and as she went to climb up again she flew off,' she told the Daily Mail. \nThe South Florida native said she was in her room on a lower deck directly below the shuffleboard area and 'saw something go by really fast'.\n'I didn't think anything of it, I definitely didn't think it was a person or a body that just fell off the ship,' she said. \nHowever, the footage shows the shuffleboard area on the port side is towards the front of the ship, a long way from the portholes at the back end of the jogging track.\n\nThe rescue boat used to bring the father and daughter back to the ship is visible on the right\n\nThe ship's crew taking the father and daughter back to the Dream after plucking them from the ocean. The girl is sitting on ship's doctor Alyssa Charles' knee as she examines her\n\nThe father is said to have dived in within seconds of his daughter, and with the ship moving at 25mph he would have had even farther to swim if he jumped from near the shuffleboard.\nThese factors have called the shuffleboard account into question and make it more likely they were no longer playing when the girl fell.\nPassengers and crew threw flotation rings and other buoyant items into the ocean for them to grab on to, which may have been what Shannon saw fall past her window.\nSeveral passengers said the girl's mother was hysterical after watching her daughter and husband go over the side.\n'The mom was yelling \"she's five and can't swim\",' passenger Shannon Lindholm said.\nThe shuffleboard area came into play later as the spot where the rescue craft was launched from and was pulled back onto the ship from is right next to it.\nThe father was hurt as he fought to save his daughter and was hospitalized after the ship returned to port, but police declined to specify the injury.\n\nSome passengers said staff told them the girl fell overboard while her parents were playing shuffleboard on deck four and she climbed on the railing\n\nHowever, the shuffleboard area on the port side is towards the front of the ship, a long way from the portholes at the back end of the jogging track, making the theory less likely\n\nThe shuffleboard area came into play later as the spot where the rescue craft was launched from and was pulled back onto the ship from is right next to it\nThe father was initially hailed as a hero for saving his daughter from almost certain death on her own in the ocean, without regard for his own life.\nBut the tide turned when rumors that he caused her to fall by lifting her onto the railings for a photo began to spread, and he was pilloried online by thousands of strangers who repeated the false accusations as if they were fact.\nThis was despite no one who saw the girl fall publicly saying what happened, and no evidence he did anything wrong.\nWithin seconds of the girl falling, the ship's automatic man overboard alarm and the emergency code 'Mr MOB' blared over the intercom.\nWithin minutes the crew readied a yellow motorized rescue boat and went after the stricken pair as hundreds of passengers rushed to the railings.\n\nThe father looks up at the crowd of passengers cheering their safe return\n\nA father and daughter were rescued from the ocean 20 minutes after the girl fell off the side of the Disney Dream cruise ship and her dad dived in to rescue her\nPassengers described the massive 130,000 gross tonnage ship turning around as the rescue boat raced to find them before they drowned.\nThe dad, clearly exhausted and distraught, gave the crowd a thumbs up as the boat approached the ship, then wiped his face with his hand.\nHis daughter was sitting on ship's doctor Alyssa Charles' knee as she was checked out, appearing healthy despite her ordeal.\nThe physician has been praised online for stroking the girl's hair to keep her calm. \nThe Disney Dream was built in 2010 and last refurbished in 2024, according to Cruise Mapper.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAlarming video reveals new twist in blame game over girl's horror plunge from Disney cruise ship\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Flanked by Republican legislators and members of his Cabinet, Trump signed the multitrillion-dollar legislation at a desk on the White House driveway, then banged down a gavel gifted to him by House Speaker Mike Johnson that was used during the bill's final passage Thursday. Also Read | Big Beautiful Bill: Donald Trump Plans to Sign His Tax, Spending Cut Bill at White House July 4 Picnic. Against odds that at times seemed improbable, Trump achieved his goal of celebrating a historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation's birthday, which also was his self-imposed deadline for Congress to send the legislation to his desk. Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic. “America's winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month's bombing campaign against Iran's nuclear programme, which he said the flyover was meant to honour. “Promises made, promises kept, and we've kept them.” Also Read | PM Narendra Modi Conferred With 'The Order of the Republic of Trinidad & Tobago' During Ceremonial Event at President's House in Port of Spain (See Pics and Videos). The White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The US Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers. Trump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energised as the legislation's passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration. That included the Iran campaign and a series of US Supreme Court ruling she's fought for. The budget legislation is the president's highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended “our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” because of the legislation. Big cuts to Medicaid and food stamps Critics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability. “Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country's largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. “Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a USD 5 trillion gift.” The legislation extends Trump's 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by USD 1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress' nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law. The legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering. It passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump's wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote. In the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump's well-funded political operation. No Democrats voted for the bill. The legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama's Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden's tax credits for renewable energy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add USD 3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage. Democrats vow to make bill a midterm issue Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill “devastating” and said in a statement that Trump's signature on the legislation “sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests — not working families.” He predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. “This was a full betrayal of the American people,” Martin said. Trump complained Friday about Democrats opposing the bill, “and we knew that because their hatred of either the country or me or both is so great they didn't vote at all and it's terrible.” He said their “standard line” is to say Republican legislation is “dangerous” or “everybody's going to die” and “we can't let them get away with it.” With his bill, Trump said, “it's actually just the opposite, everybody's going to live.” “And I just want you to know, if you see anything negative put out by Democrats, it's all a con job,” Trump said, defending a package that now is law. Speaking in Iowa on Thursday night, Trump said Democrats “hate Trump — but I hate them, too.” The package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year's midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements. Upon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best. For example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of US adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid. But the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about USD 45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centres. About 60 per cent said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the USD 36 trillion US debt by more than USD 3 trillion over the next decade.

Five were killed in northern Jabalia, medics said. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.Later on Friday, Palestinians gathered to perform funeral prayers before burying those killed overnight. \"The ceasefire will come, and I have lost my brother? There should have been a ceasefire long ago before I lost my brother,\" said 13-year-old Mayar Al Farr as she wept. Her brother, Mahmoud, was among those killed.

We ask the world, we don't want food...We want them to end the bloodshed.\"Trump earlier said it would probably be known in 24 hours whether Hamas has accepted a ceasefire between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.

(RBI) (TSX:QSR), which has its head office in Miami.\n\nRBI’s largest shareholder is the New York City-based private equity firm 3G Capital Partners Ltd.\n\nSimon Fraser University marketing professor emeritus Lindsay Meredith told BIV that Tim Hortons will be considered to be a Canadian brand because of marketing and brand recognition through the decades.\n\n\"The name is Tim Hortons, and it's the brand,\" he said. \"The branding stops with where that name is. Do a lot of consumers look past the front-end brand name? No, they don't.\"\n\nThe flip of this, however, are the many Canadian companies that have American-sounding brands, with U.S. cities or states in the name. \n\nThat, Meredith said, could be a problem.\n\n\"You could be totally Canadian sourced, Canadian supplied, but, look, if you have the wrong front-end branding on your name, you could be toast,\" he said.\n\nCanadian entrepreneurs are doing what they can to set the record straight.\n\nCalifornia Closets Vancouver faces the reverse of Tim Hortons' ownership structure, and perhaps some confusion among consumers about its owners.\n\nIts name hints that it is an American company. And while its parent, California Closets, is based in California, the company is fully owned by Ontario-based FirstService Corp. (TSX:FSV).\n\nStephan Maingot bought franchise rights for B.C. back in 1999 and launched the business in 2000.\n\nThe brand had no local presence before he bought those rights, and he said he has expanded the venture to 80 employees in Metro Vancouver.\n\nHis California Closets Vancouver operates out of a 20,000-square-foot manufacturing facility near the Amazing Brentwood neighbourhood in Burnaby, and Maingot contracts Canadian suppliers, he told BIV. \n\n“One hundred per cent of the wood that we buy is from Canada, as is our distribution and our accessories supplier,” Maingot said.\n\nCalifornia Closets gives its franchisees leeway to find its own suppliers, he added.\n\n“They let us do it in Western Canada because we were so organized and so professional,” Maingot said.\n\nHis business mostly manufactures closets and shelving for direct-to-consumer sales, with a target demographic of women between 35 and 55 years old, he said.\n\nMing Yang owns three Vancouver franchises of American-owned Honolulu Coffee but she told BIV she similarly contracts local suppliers for most of her coffees, which come largely from outside the U.S.\n\n“Kona coffee beans are the only thing we get that is air-shipped from Hawaii every two weeks,” she said.\n\nShe said she has put a sign in her stores to say how much her franchises use local suppliers, and she has posted about her franchise’s Canadian roots on Instagram.\n\nFranchisor Honolulu Coffee’s owner, Ed Schultz, is based in the U.S.\n\nConfusion may also linger for companies that are fully B.C.-owned.\n\nSome might think Vancouver-based Boston Pizza is American, given its name.\n\nFounder Gus Agioritis, however, launched the business in Edmonton in 1964. He reportedly chose the name because he thought it would be easy for customers to recognize and recall.\n\nBoston Pizza vice-president of marketing James Kawalecki told BIV that his company’s marketing efforts through the decades have helped ingrain in most of its customers that the venture is Canadian.\n\nHockey has been at the core of some of that marketing.\n\nBack in 2011, when the Vancouver Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals, Boston Pizza temporarily rebranded as Vancouver Pizza.\n\nBoston Pizza opened its restaurant near BC Place in 2014 | Chung Chow, BIV\n\nIn this year’s Stanley Cup playoffs, the pizza chain produced advertising spots that centred around planning a Stanley Cup parade.\n\nThe first-round playoff advertising started off just floating the idea of holding a parade to welcome the return of the Stanley Cup to Canada. The next round’s spots included astronaut Chris Hadfield agreeing to drive a bus in the parade.\n\nBy round three, the bus had a new hood ornament, Kawalecki said.\n\nUnfortunately for Edmonton Oilers fans, that parade never materialized.\n\nAnother initiative that helped the Boston Pizza brand find traction as being Canadian was its chairman and owner, Jim Treliving, taking part in the long-running CBC pitch show Dragon’s Den, between 2006 and 2020.\n\nKawalecki said he heard much feedback after the CBC comedy series This Hour Has 22 Minutes aired a sketch soon after Trump started stoking Canadian nationalism.\n\n“Someone said, ‘I guess we can’t go to Boston Pizza anymore,’ and the response was, ‘Nope. They’re Canadian,’” Kawalecki said.\n\nAttention such as that helped the company turn in strong first-quarter results, Kawalecki added.\n\nIndeed, the Boston Pizza Royalties Income Fund’s (TSX:BPF.UN) performance, which mirrors that of the parent company, bears that out.\n\nThe fund enjoyed 4.1-per-cent revenue growth in the first three months of this year, according to its financial statements.\n\nThe fund’s revenue is based on a slice of sales from 372 franchised Boston Pizza restaurants that are in the fund’s royalty pool.\n\nLooking across the country, there are many other Canadian companies that have American-sounding names that are trying to make clear to customers that they are based north of the border.\n\nEarlier this year Ontario-based Montana’s BBQ & Bar touted “four delicious, convenient, and Canadian-made products” available in grocery stores, including “pulled pork in Texas Bold BBQ sauce.”","summary":"Geopolitical tensions have left some Canadian companies with American-sounding names facing unprecedented marketing challenges.

When it comes to holidays, nothing sours the poolside mojito quicker than the feeling that your cash is disappearing too quickly. Thankfully, the Post Office has looked into where in the world the British pound delivers the most value for money this year. We've put the biggest bargain cities and outrageous rip-offs resorts on an interactive map, so you can book armed with all of the facts. If you're looking for the most bang for your buck, then head to the Algarve. The Portugese coastal resort is a huge favourite with Brits, who take advantage of cheap, regular flights from across the UK to flock to the southern region en-masse each summer. It's basket of holiday goodies cost £58.95, 1.6 per cent less than in 2024. This is due to the rock-bottom cost of meals and drinks. The average cost of a three-course meal for two with wine in Albufeira weighed in at £40.33 – the lowest recorded across the 47 destinations surveyed (figure 9) and one third the cost in New York (£128.27). The Algarve is one of 19 resorts or cities that got cheaper this year than last, according to Post Office research. Others to do so include Delhi, India; Phuket, Thailand; Spain’s Costa del Sol and Prague in the Czech Republic. If you're keen to stay in Europe, then Prague is a good bet. Far more than just stag-dos and strip clubs, the former Soviet city is enriched by a huge amount of history, art, and music. The Czech capital's basket of holiday goods cost £75.92 this year, a significant price fall of over 20 per cent compared to 2024. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest deals can be found a little further away from the UK, although bargain-hungry holidaymakers will have to factor in the cost of getting to these destinations when choosing where to go. Cape Town in South Africa is the second cheapest destination looked at this year, with a basket of essentials costing £59.84. This is a great destination for Southern Hemisphere wine buffs as a glass of grape costs just £2.07; a fifth of the price it'll set you back in New York. Japan’s capital city, Tokyo, has been massively popular with Brits over the past year, thanks to the very favourable exchange rate. A glass of wine and a bottle of beer can be purchased there for the equivalent of just over a fiver. One destination to keep an eye on is Delhi. At £69.52, prices in the Indian city have dropped 10.7 per cent. Although alcohol prices there are a little on the steep side, soft drinks, water and food won't lighten your wallet too much. At the other end of the scale, New York is the most expensive of 47 destinations surveyed, with a barometer total of £167.85 - a rise of 15.6 per cent year-on-year. Not only will you have to spend upwards of £7 for a beer in the Big Apple, you'll be expected to tip generously on top of that. The eye-watering continues in Hawaii, the second most expensive destination on the list and the home of £9.18 insect repellent, and in Nice, France. Head to the French city, and you'll find yourself being stingy with the suncream, as a bottle costs close to £17. While the world has been in turmoil since Donald Trump returned to the White House (and perhaps was before), sterling remains strong against many other currencies. Over three-quarters of Post Office’s top 30 currencies – including the euro and most other European currencies – have weakened since last March. This could provide holidaymakers with a big incentive to choose destinations where sterling will provide more ‘bang for their buck. Appetite for traveling remains high and is growing. Three-in-five (60 per cent) of Brits surveyed about their holiday plans for the coming year told Post Office Travel Money that they will be travelling abroad – up from 51 per cent who were asked the same question a year ago. Almost three-quarters (73 per cent) of them will holiday in Europe and most (95 per cent) will be making a repeat journey to a European destination. Although a big majority are planning to get away this year, most share a desire to keep things as cheap and cheerful as possible. Travelling away from busy periods is regarded as the best way to make travelling abroad more affordable, with two-in-five holidaymakers prepared to swap peak season travel for cheaper times of the year. More than a quarter of those questioned say they will book cheaper accommodation (27 per cent), take fewer holidays (27 per cent) or go to a destination that costs less (26 per cent).

It should be a win-win agreement. India never negotiates trade deals based on deadlines. Our focus is always on fairness and the country’s benefit,” Goyal told media persons on the sidelines of an event, a day after Indian trade negotiators returned from an eight-day visit to the US to close a trade pact before July 9. The minister ruled out him visiting the US in the near term. The Indian negotiating team returned from Washington after hectic parleys with their US counterparts.'India Always Ready to Do Deals' “India’s national interest should always be supreme… keeping that in mind, if a good deal happens then India is always ready to do deals with developed countries,” Goyal said. “Jab deal achchhi ban jaaye, puri tarah se pakk jaaye tab usko sweekar karenge (When a good deal is done and ready, then we will accept it),” he emphasised. Asked whether he was hopeful of a trade deal with the US, Goyal said, “I have told you many times that India negotiates FTAs on its own terms”. He added that trade discussions are on with the European Union and different countries—New Zealand, Oman, US, Chile and Peru. Live EventsUS President Donald Trump on Thursday said that his administration would send letters to individual countries which don’t have a deal with the US, specifying the tariffs they would now have to pay to export to America. In April, Trump had announced reciprocal tariffs for most of the trading partners based on their trade surpluses with the US, including a 26% levy on India. The Indian government wants the entire 26% levy to be rolled back and is negotiating with the Trump administration. However, the US’ demand for market access across sectors, including sensitive agriculture and dairy products, and insistence on genetically modified crops, have been some sticky areas. On the issue of the two sides inking multiple deals on issues as and when they get agreed, an official said that all possibilities are on the table.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ontrade deal India USPiyush GoyalIndia US relationsUS trade negotiationsfree trade agreements\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Jobs have been slashed, prompting protests.\n\nThere are shifting priorities from the Trump administration with proposals to roll back restrictions on green house gas emissions and funding cuts for environmental improvements in minority communities.\n\nHundreds of EPA workers, most anonymously, spoke out in the letter of dissent, calling the changes dangerous to the health and wellbeing of the American public.\n\nLoreen Targos is an EPA scientist in Chicago Region 5 and Executive Vice President of American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, the union representing EPA workers.\n\n“This is unprecedented,” Targos told the I-Team. “I’ve been at EPA for 10 years.

It pointed out that the US Constitution bars “cruel and unusual punishment”.\n\nIn the past, the US Department of State has accused South Sudan of “extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and cases of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment”. It advises no American citizen to travel there due to an ongoing armed conflict.\n\nBut the US Supreme Court has twice ruled that the Trump administration could indeed deport the men to countries outside of their homelands. Its latest decision was issued on Thursday.\n\nThe US Department of Justice indicated that the eight men were set to be flown to South Sudan by 7pm US Eastern Time (23:00 GMT) on Friday. They hailed from countries like Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam.\n\nThe last-ditch appeal was filed on Thursday night, shortly after the Supreme Court rendered its decision.\n\nInitially, the case was assigned to US District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington, DC, who signalled he was sympathetic to the deportees’ request.\n\nHe briefly ordered the deportation to be paused until 4:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT), but ultimately, he decided to transfer the case back to Murphy, the judge whose decisions helped precipitate the Supreme Court’s rulings.\n\nMurphy had previously issued injunctions against the deportations to South Sudan, leading to successful appeals from the Trump administration. The eight men, meanwhile, had been held at a military base in Djibouti while the courts decided their fate.\n\nBefore he transferred the case back to Murphy, however, Judge Moss said it was possible the deportees could prove their case that the Trump administration intended to subject them to abuse.\n\n“It seems to me almost self-evident that the United States government cannot take human beings and send them to circumstances in which their physical wellbeing is at risk simply either to punish them or send a signal to others,” Moss said during the hearing.\n\nLawyers for the Trump administration, meanwhile, argued that the deportation’s continued delay would strain relations with countries willing to accept migrants from other countries.\n\nMurphy, who denied Friday’s request, had previously ruled in favour of the deportees, issuing an injunction against their removal to South Sudan and saying they had a right to contest the deportation based on fears for their safety.\n\nThe Supreme Court first lifted the injunction on June 23 and clarified its ruling again on Thursday, giving a subtle rebuke to Judge Murphy.\n\nThe Trump administration has been pushing for rapid removals as part of its campaign of mass deportation, one of President Trump’s signature priorities.\n\nOpponents have accused the administration of steamrolling the human rights of undocumented people in order to achieve its aims, including the right to due process under the law.\n\nBut the Trump administration has framed undocumented migration as an “invasion” that constitutes a national security crisis, and it argued that its strong-armed efforts are needed to expel criminals.\n\nThe eight migrants slated to be sent to South Sudan, it said, were “barbaric, violent criminal illegal aliens”. It added that they had been found guilty of crimes, including first-degree murder, robbery and sexual assault.\n\n“These sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release on Thursday.","summary":"The US Supreme Court has twice upheld Donald Trump&#039;s ability to deport foreign nationals to countries outside their own.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/migrants-in-us-detention-lose-appeal-against-deportation-to-south-sudan?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25157540699407-1751671294.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 23:48:53","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":338383604,"title":"World News | Human Remains Located After California Fireworks Warehouse Explosion","text":"New York, Jul 5 (AP) Investigators have located human remains following an explosion at a Northern California fireworks warehouse, Yolo County said in a statement Friday.

The county confirmed that its Coroner's Division was allowed access to the site of the fire incident, and the Coroner's Office has been in contact with the families of those who had been reported missing.

Two people were treated for injuries according to officials. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the blast. The warehouse was managed by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which has more than three decades of experience designing and producing fireworks shows in the Bay Area, according to a screenshot of its website before it was taken down. The company, with headquarters in both San Francisco and Esparto, focuses mainly on display fireworks for big productions instead of those for retail. The company said in a statement it would cooperate fully with officials in their investigation. Further south in the state, authorities said that one man was found dead on the scene after a “fireworks-related blaze” ripped through four homes in a Los Angeles neighbourhood Thursday night. A woman was taken to the hospital in critical condition, four others were given treatment for smoke inhalation on the scene and several animals were injured, the Los Angeles Fire Department said in a statement. Fireworks were still erupting in the area when firefighters arrived at the blaze, which they brought under control later that night, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The cause of the fire is still being investigated, department spokesperson Lyndsey Lantz said.

Hamas has been seeking guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war, now nearly 21 months old. Trump has been pushing hard for a deal to be reached, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit the White House next week to discuss a deal.\n\nThe Hamas statement came as Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in Gaza early Friday, while a hospital said another 20 people died in shootings while seeking aid.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said it has recorded 613 Palestinians killed within the span of a month in Gaza while trying to obtain aid. Most were killed while trying to reach food distribution points run by an Israeli-backed American organization, while others were massed waiting for aid trucks connected to the United Nations or other humanitarian organizations, it said.\n\nEfforts ongoing to halt the war\n\nTrump said Tuesday that Israel had agreed on terms for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, during which the U.S. would “work with all parties to end the war.” He urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen.\n\nIn its statement late Friday, Hamas said it “has submitted its positive response” to Egyptian and Qatari mediators.\n\nIt said it is “fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations regarding the mechanism for implementing this framework.” It did not elaborate on what needed to be worked out in implementation.\n\nA Hamas official said the ceasefire could start as early as next week but he said talks were needed first to work out how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in return for each freed Israeli hostage and to specify the amount of aid that will enter Gaza during the truce. Hamas has said it wants aid to flow in greater quantities through the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the response with the press.\n\nThe official also said that negotiations would start from the first day of the truce on a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in return for the release of remaining hostages.

Hamas has been seeking guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war, now nearly 21 months old. Trump has been pushing hard for a deal to be reached, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit the White House next week to discuss a deal.\n\nThe Hamas statement came as Israeli airstrikes killed 15 Palestinians in Gaza early Friday, while a hospital said another 20 people died in shootings while seeking aid.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said it has recorded 613 Palestinians killed within the span of a month in Gaza while trying to obtain aid. Most were killed while trying to reach food distribution points run by an Israeli-backed American organization, while others were massed waiting for aid trucks connected to the United Nations or other humanitarian organizations, it said.\n\nEfforts ongoing to halt the war\n\nTrump said Tuesday that Israel had agreed on terms for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, during which the U.S. would “work with all parties to end the war.” He urged Hamas to accept the deal before conditions worsen.\n\nIn its statement late Friday, Hamas said it “has submitted its positive response” to Egyptian and Qatari mediators.\n\nIt said it is “fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations regarding the mechanism for implementing this framework.” It did not elaborate on what needed to be worked out in implementation.\n\nA Hamas official said the ceasefire could start as early as next week but he said talks were needed first to work out how many Palestinian prisoners would be released in return for each freed Israeli hostage and to specify the amount of aid that will enter Gaza during the truce. Hamas has said it wants aid to flow in greater quantities through the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the response with the press.\n\nThe official also said that negotiations would start from the first day of the truce on a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in return for the release of remaining hostages. He said that Trump has guaranteed that the truce will be extended beyond 60 days if needed for those negotiations to reach a deal.

Mencken, particularly those in his July 26, 1920, article in The Evening Sun (Baltimore), “Bayard vs Lionheart,” a scathing indictment of the intelligence of the voting public. It concludes:\n\n“As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. … On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.”\n\nJayne Thomas\n\nVoters must oppose\nICE enforcement\n\nDonald Trump is engaged in a campaign of terror focused on incarcerating and deporting immigrants, particularly people of color from Mexico and Central and South America. He is militarizing the enforcement of these actions by targeting those protesting them.\n\nThe vast majority of people he is pursuing are ordinary people striving to make a living. They should be considered worthy, not just because of the work that they do or the citizenship papers that they possess, but because they are people of equal value to all other people. When their safety, livelihood and very being are under threat, as they are now, we must act.\n\nFor this reason, I urge readers to advocate for immigrants facing insecurity and risk here and in their home countries by learning about and upholding their rights; documenting their treatment by ICE agents; contacting and engaging with elected officials; and peacefully participating in vigils and demonstrations.\n\nLucinda Pease-Alvarez\n\nHow government spends\nis ripe for criticism\n\nRe: “Actions speak louder than nagging criticism” (Page A8, June 8).\n\nIn Max Ritter’s letter, I wonder at his encouragement to readers to consider how they spend their own money before shaming the country for how it chooses to spend its money.\n\nI suggest he and others remember that the Constitution created the federal government as a democratic republic. The people of the United States and their representatives are the supreme power in government. As such, it’s up to us constituents to tell our representatives how we want them to vote, work to change their minds when they don’t, and thank them when they do.\n\nI also suggest he consider that many “charity” programs, such as Medicaid, food stamps, Head Start, Child Tax Credit and USAID, are also critically needed investments that save future federal, state and local government costs.\n\nJim Driggers\n\nThere are powers that\ntop Mother Nature\n\nRe: “Mother Nature will have final say on our climate” (Page A8, June 29).\n\nDoug McKenzie says that “Mother Nature” will have the last word on climate change. But, if so, then what difference does it make what we do?\n\nHowever, there are billions of people on the planet who don’t believe that nature is supreme. We believe that there is a creator God who is supreme, including over nature. And we believe that this Creator gave us the responsibility to be caretakers of the planet. If the human race is merely part of nature, then we couldn’t have this responsibility.\n\nSadly, most people today have been taught to dismiss and mock this theistic perspective. I was, too, until I actually started to think for myself and started seeing the flaws in today’s God-denying worldview, and also how it’s only by viewing us as divinely created beings that we can understand ourselves and our responsibilities.\n\nChristopher Andrus","summary":"Also: Mencken's prediction &#124; Oppose ICE &#124; Government spending &#124; Mother Nature.

(RBI) (TSX:QSR), which has its head office in Miami.\n\nRBI’s largest shareholder is the New York City-based private equity firm 3G Capital Partners Ltd.\n\nSimon Fraser University marketing professor emeritus Lindsay Meredith told BIV that Tim Hortons will be considered to be a Canadian brand because of marketing and brand recognition through the decades.\n\n\"The name is Tim Hortons, and it's the brand,\" he said. \"The branding stops with where that name is. Do a lot of consumers look past the front-end brand name? No, they don't.\"\n\nThe flip of this, however, are the many Canadian companies that have American-sounding brands, with U.S. cities or states in the name. \n\nThat, Meredith said, could be a problem.\n\n\"You could be totally Canadian sourced, Canadian supplied, but, look, if you have the wrong front-end branding on your name, you could be toast,\" he said.\n\nCanadian entrepreneurs are doing what they can to set the record straight.\n\nCalifornia Closets Vancouver faces the reverse of Tim Hortons' ownership structure, and perhaps some confusion among consumers about its owners.\n\nIts name hints that it is an American company. And while its parent, California Closets, is based in California, the company is fully owned by Ontario-based FirstService Corp. (TSX:FSV).\n\nStephan Maingot bought franchise rights for B.C. back in 1999 and launched the business in 2000.\n\nThe brand had no local presence before he bought those rights, and he said he has expanded the venture to 80 employees in Metro Vancouver.\n\nHis California Closets Vancouver operates out of a 20,000-square-foot manufacturing facility near the Amazing Brentwood neighbourhood in Burnaby, and Maingot contracts Canadian suppliers, he told BIV. \n\n“One hundred per cent of the wood that we buy is from Canada, as is our distribution and our accessories supplier,” Maingot said.\n\nCalifornia Closets gives its franchisees leeway to find its own suppliers, he added.\n\n“They let us do it in Western Canada because we were so organized and so professional,” Maingot said.\n\nHis business mostly manufactures closets and shelving for direct-to-consumer sales, with a target demographic of women between 35 and 55 years old, he said.\n\nMing Yang owns three Vancouver franchises of American-owned Honolulu Coffee but she told BIV she similarly contracts local suppliers for most of her coffees, which come largely from outside the U.S.\n\n“Kona coffee beans are the only thing we get that is air-shipped from Hawaii every two weeks,” she said.\n\nShe said she has put a sign in her stores to say how much her franchises use local suppliers, and she has posted about her franchise’s Canadian roots on Instagram.\n\nFranchisor Honolulu Coffee’s owner, Ed Schultz, is based in the U.S.\n\nConfusion may also linger for companies that are fully B.C.-owned.\n\nSome might think Vancouver-based Boston Pizza is American, given its name.\n\nFounder Gus Agioritis, however, launched the business in Edmonton in 1964. He reportedly chose the name because he thought it would be easy for customers to recognize and recall.\n\nBoston Pizza vice-president of marketing James Kawalecki told BIV that his company’s marketing efforts through the decades have helped ingrain in most of its customers that the venture is Canadian.\n\nHockey has been at the core of some of that marketing.\n\nBack in 2011, when the Vancouver Canucks played the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals, Boston Pizza temporarily rebranded as Vancouver Pizza.\n\nBoston Pizza opened its restaurant near BC Place in 2014 | Chung Chow, BIV\n\nIn this year’s Stanley Cup playoffs, the pizza chain produced advertising spots that centred around planning a Stanley Cup parade.\n\nThe first-round playoff advertising started off just floating the idea of holding a parade to welcome the return of the Stanley Cup to Canada. The next round’s spots included astronaut Chris Hadfield agreeing to drive a bus in the parade.\n\nBy round three, the bus had a new hood ornament, Kawalecki said.\n\nUnfortunately for Edmonton Oilers fans, that parade never materialized.\n\nAnother initiative that helped the Boston Pizza brand find traction as being Canadian was its chairman and owner, Jim Treliving, taking part in the long-running CBC pitch show Dragon’s Den, between 2006 and 2020.\n\nKawalecki said he heard much feedback after the CBC comedy series This Hour Has 22 Minutes aired a sketch soon after Trump started stoking Canadian nationalism.\n\n“Someone said, ‘I guess we can’t go to Boston Pizza anymore,’ and the response was, ‘Nope. They’re Canadian,’” Kawalecki said.\n\nAttention such as that helped the company turn in strong first-quarter results, Kawalecki added.\n\nIndeed, the Boston Pizza Royalties Income Fund’s (TSX:BPF.UN) performance, which mirrors that of the parent company, bears that out.\n\nThe fund enjoyed 4.1-per-cent revenue growth in the first three months of this year, according to its financial statements.\n\nThe fund’s revenue is based on a slice of sales from 372 franchised Boston Pizza restaurants that are in the fund’s royalty pool.\n\nLooking across the country, there are many other Canadian companies that have American-sounding names that are trying to make clear to customers that they are based north of the border.\n\nEarlier this year Ontario-based Montana’s BBQ & Bar touted “four delicious, convenient, and Canadian-made products” available in grocery stores, including “pulled pork in Texas Bold BBQ sauce.”\n\nMontana’s website highlights the company for being “Canada’s home for BBQ for 30 years.”","summary":"From Boston Pizza to California Closets Vancouver, businesses in B.C. aim to make clear that they support the local economy","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/hospitality-marketing-tourism/canadian-businesses-with-american-sounding-names-lean-into-their-roots-10899251","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/images/stephan-maingot.jpg;w=983;h=692;mode=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 23:30:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":338390986,"title":"Protesters in downtown Miami, Everglades decry Trump, ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ as guard gates go up","text":"OCHOPEE, Fla.

This is very reminiscent to, honestly, Auschwitz, because there’s only one way, and one way out,” said a protester who identified himself as Gabriel.\n\n“Don’t get spoiled into believing that it can’t happen here. Not only can it happen here, it’s happening here,” said another demonstrator.\n\nJust after 6 p.m., 7News cameras captured at least 30 people holding signs near the entrance to “Alligator Alcatraz.” They did not chant, however, as their protest is silent.\n\nThe protests take place as approximately 200 U.S. Marines from the corps’ air station in North Carolina are being deployed to Florida to augment the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, it will be mostly logistical help, not necessarily boots on the ground.\n\nThursday afternoon, Democratic lawmakers wanted to get their boots on the ground at “Alligator Alcatraz,” but they were turned away at the entrance.\n\n7News cameras rolled as state senators and representatives were denied access to the facility.\n\nMike Jachles, a spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, spoke with the lawmakers.

Fighter jets and stealth bombers streaked through the sky over the annual White House Fourth of July picnic.\n\n“America’s winning, winning, winning like never before,” Trump said, noting last month’s bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear program, which he said the flyover was meant to honor. “Promises made, promises kept, and we’ve kept them.”\n\nThe White House was hung with red, white and blue bunting for the Independence Day festivities. The U.S. Marine Band played patriotic marches — and, in a typical Trumpian touch, tunes by 1980s pop icons Chaka Khan and Huey Lewis. There were three separate flyovers.\n\nTrump spoke for a relatively brief 22 minutes before signing the bill, but was clearly energized as the legislation’s passage topped a recent winning streak for his administration.

A line on the bill where he would have signed because of his role as president of the Senate was crossed out and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., added his name instead, photographs show. Cotton has the responsibility of stepping in when the vice president isn’t available for his Senate duties.\n\nThe budget legislation is the president’s highest-profile win yet. It includes key campaign pledges like no tax on tips or Social Security income. Trump, who spent an unusual amount of time thanking individual Republican lawmakers who shepherded the measure through Congress, contended “our country is going to be a rocket ship, economically,” because of the legislation.\n\nBig cuts to Medicaid and food stamps\n\nCritics assailed the package as a giveaway to the rich that will rob millions more lower-income people of their health insurance, food assistance and financial stability.\n\n“Today, Donald Trump signed into law the worst job-killing bill in American history. It will rip health care from 17 million workers to pay for massive tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations, amounting to the country’s largest money grab from the working class to the ultra-rich,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement. “Every member of Congress who voted for this devastating bill picked the pockets of working people to hand billionaires a $5 trillion gift.”\n\nThe legislation extends Trump’s 2017 multitrillion-dollar tax cuts and cuts Medicaid and food stamps by $1.2 trillion. It provides for a massive increase in immigration enforcement. Congress’ nonpartisan scorekeeper projects that nearly 12 million more people will lose health insurance under the law.\n\nThe legislation passed the House on a largely party-line vote Thursday, culminating a monthslong push by the GOP to cram most of its legislative priorities into a single budget bill that could be enacted without Senate Democrats being able to block it indefinitely by filibustering.\n\nIt passed by a single vote in the Senate, where North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis announced he would not run for reelection after incurring Trump’s wrath in opposing it. Vance had to cast the tie-breaking vote.\n\nIn the House, where two Republicans voted against it, one, conservative maverick Tom Massie of Kentucky, has also become a target of Trump’s well-funded political operation.\n\nThe legislation amounts to a repudiation of the agendas of the past two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, in rolling back Obama’s Medicaid expansion under his signature health law and Biden’s tax credits for renewable energy.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the package will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the decade and 11.8 million more people will go without health coverage.\n\nDemocrats vow to make bill a midterm issue\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin on Friday called the bill “devastating” and said in a statement that Trump’s signature on the legislation “sealed the fate of the Republican Party, cementing them as the party for billionaires and special interests — not working families.”\n\nHe predicted Republicans would lose their majority in Congress over it. “This was a full betrayal of the American people,” Martin said.\n\nTrump exulted in his political victory Thursday night in Iowa, where he attended a kickoff of events celebrating the country’s 250th birthday next year.\n\n“I want to thank Republican congressmen and women, because what they did is incredible,” he said. The president complained that Democrats voted against the bill because “they hate Trump — but I hate them, too.”\n\nThe package is certain to be a flashpoint in next year’s midterm elections, and Democrats are making ambitious plans for rallies, voter registration drives, attack ads, bus tours and even a multiday vigil, all intended to highlight the most controversial elements.\n\nUpon his return to Washington early Friday, Trump described the package as “very popular,” though polling suggests that public opinion is mixed at best.\n\nFor example, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll found that majorities of U.S. adults support increasing the annual child tax credit and eliminating taxes on earnings from tips, and about half support work requirements for some adults who receive Medicaid.\n\nBut the poll found majorities oppose reducing federal funding for food assistance to low-income families and spending about $45 billion to build and maintain migrant detention centers. About 60% said it was “unacceptable” that the bill is expected to increase the $36 trillion U.S. debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade.","summary":"Trump achieved the historic — and divisive — legislative victory in time for the nation’s birthday.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/07/04/trump-signs-tax-bill/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/APTOPIX_Trump_Congress_Tax_Cuts_92402.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 23:21:38","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":338392002,"title":"US expands militarized zones to 1/3 of southern border, stirring controversy (World)","text":"Orange no-entry signs posted by the U.S. military in English and Spanish dot the New Mexico desert, where a border wall cuts past onion fields and parched ranches with tufts of tall grass growing amidst wiry brush and yucca trees.\n\nThe Army has posted thousands of the warnings in New Mexico and western Texas, declaring a “restricted area by authority of the commander.” It’s part of a major shift that has thrust the military into border enforcement with Mexico like never before.\n\nThe move places long stretches of the border under the supervision of nearby military bases, empowering U.S. troops to detain people who enter the country illegally and sidestep a law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. It is done under the authority of the national emergency on the border declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.\n\nU.S. authorities say the zones are needed to close gaps in border enforcement and help in the wider fight against human smuggling networks and brutal drug cartels.\n\nThe militarization is being challenged in court, and has been criticized by civil rights advocates, humanitarian aid groups and outdoor enthusiasts who object to being blocked from public lands while troops have free rein.\n\nAbbey Carpenter, a leader of a search-and-rescue group for missing migrants, said public access is being denied across sweltering stretches of desert where migrant deaths have surged.\n\n“Maybe there are more deaths, but we don’t know,\" she said.\n\nMilitary expansion\n\nTwo militarized zones form a buffer along 230 miles (370 kilometers) of border, from Fort Hancock, Texas, through El Paso and westward across vast New Mexico ranchlands.\n\nThe Defense Department added an additional 250-mile (400-kilometer) zone last week in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and plans another near Yuma, Arizona. Combined, the zones will cover nearly one-third of the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nThey are patrolled by at least 7,600 members of the armed forces, vastly expanding the U.S. government presence on the border.\n\nReaction to the military buffer has been mixed among residents of New Mexico's rural Luna County, where a strong culture of individual liberty is tempered by the desire to squelch networks bringing migrants and contraband across the border.\n\n“We as a family have always been very supportive of the mission, and very supportive of border security,” said James Johnson, a fourth-generation farmer overseeing seasonal laborers as they filled giant plastic crates with onions, earning $22 per container.\n\nMilitary deployments under prior presidents put “eyes and ears” on the border, Johnson said. This version is “trying to give some teeth.”\n\nBut some hunters and hikers fear they’re being locked out of a rugged and cherished landscape.\n\n“I don’t want to go down there with my hunting rifle and all of a sudden somebody rolls up on me and says that I’m in a military zone,” said Ray Trejo, a coordinator for the New Mexico Wildlife Federation and a Luna County commissioner. “I don’t know if these folks have been taught to deescalate situations.”\n\nA former public school teacher of English as a second language, Trejo said military trespassing charges seem inhumane in an economy built on immigrant farm labor.\n\n“If the Army, Border Patrol, law enforcement in general are detaining people for reasons of transporting, of human smuggling, I don’t have a problem,” he said. “But people are coming into our country to work, stepping now all of a sudden into a military zone, and they have no idea.”\n\nNicole Wieman, an Army command spokesperson, said the Army is negotiating possible public access for recreation and hunting, and will honor private rights to grazing and mining.\n\nIncreased punishment\n\nMore than 1,400 migrants have been charged with trespassing on military territory, facing a possible 18-month prison sentence for a first offense. That’s on top of an illegal entry charge that brings up to six months in custody. After that, most are turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for likely deportation. There have been no apparent arrests of U.S. citizens.\n\nAt a federal courthouse in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on the banks of the Upper Rio Grande, migrants in drab county jail jumpsuits and chains filed before a magistrate judge on a recent weekday.\n\nA 29-year-old Guatemalan woman struggled to understand instructions through a Spanish interpreter as she pleaded guilty to illegal entry. A judge set aside military trespassing charges for lack of evidence, but sentenced her to two weeks in jail before being transferred for likely deportation.\n\n“She sells pottery, she’s a very simple woman with a sixth-grade education,” a public defense attorney told the judge. “She told me she’s going back and she’s going to stay there.”\n\nBorder crossings\n\nBorder Patrol arrests along the southern border this year have dropped to the lowest level in six decades, including a 30% decrease in June from the prior month as attempted crossings dwindle. On June 28, the Border Patrol made only 137 arrests, a stark contrast with late 2023, when arrests topped 10,000 on the busiest days.\n\nThe first militarized zones, introduced in April and May, extend west of El Paso past factories and cattle yards to partially encircle the New Mexico border village of Columbus, and its 1,450 residents. It was here that Mexican revolutionary forces led by Pancho Villa crossed into the U.S. in a deadly 1916 raid.\n\nThese days, a port of entry at Columbus is where hundreds of children with U.S. citizenship cross daily from a bedroom community in Mexico to board public school buses and attend classes nearby.\n\nColumbus Mayor Philip Skinner, a Republican, says he's seen the occasional military vehicle but no evidence of disruption in an area where illegal crossings have been rare.\n\n“We're kind of not tuned in to this national politics,” Skinner said.\n\nOversight is divided between U.S. Army commands in Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Huachuca, Arizona. The militarized zones sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits the military from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.\n\nRussell Johnson, a rancher and former Border Patrol agent, said he welcomes the new militarized zone where his ranch borders Mexico on land leased from the Bureau of Land Management.\n\n“We have seen absolutely almost everything imaginable that can happen on the border, and most of it’s bad,” he said, recalling off-road vehicle chases on his ranch and lifeless bodies recovered by Border Patrol.\n\nIn late April, he said, five armored military vehicles spent several days at a gap in the border wall, where construction was suspended at the outset of the Biden presidency. But, he said, he hasn't seen much of the military in recent weeks.\n\n“The only thing that’s really changed is the little extra signage,” he said. “We’re not seeing the military presence out here like we kind of anticipated.\"\n\nCourt challenges\n\nFederal public defenders have challenged the military's new oversight of public land in New Mexico, seizing on the arrest of a Mexican man for trespassing through remote terrain to test the legal waters.\n\nThey decried the designation of a new military zone without congressional authorization “for the sole purpose of enabling military action on American soil” as \"a matter of staggering and unpreceded political significance.” A judge has not ruled on the issue.\n\nIn the meantime, court challenges to trespassing charges in the militarized zone have met with a mixture of convictions and acquittals at trial.\n\nRyan Ellison, the top federal prosecutor in New Mexico, won trespassing convictions in June against two immigrants who entered a militarized zone again after an initial warning. “There’s not going to be an issue as to whether or not they were on notice,” he told a recent news conference.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union attorney Rebecca Sheff says the federal government is testing a more punitive approach to border enforcement with the new military zones and worries it will be expanded border-wide.\n\n“To the extent the federal government has aspirations to establish a much more hostile military presence along the border, this is a vehicle that they’re pushing on to potentially do so. … And that’s very concerning,” she said.","summary":"Orange no-entry signs posted by the U.S. military in English and Spanish dot the New Mexico desert, where a border wall cuts past onion fields and parched ranches with tufts of tall grass growing amidst wiry brush and yucca trees.

They also discussed joint industrial projects.\n\nThe two leaders, who have previously traded insults and fell out spectacularly at the White House earlier this year, spoke at length hours after Putin fired a record 539 drones and 11 missiles at Ukraine. The bombardment left at least one dead and 23 injured in Kyiv.\n\nThe attack, described as ‘absolutely horrible’ by Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha, was launched after the call between Mr Trump and Putin, with the Russian leader refusing to agree to a ceasefire.\n\nMr Trump, who has been criticised for not being tough enough with Putin to force him to make concessions, said: ‘I don’t think he’s there. I don’t think he’s looking to stop this fighting.’\n\nWhile no specific commitments emerged yesterday, it appears the US is willing to give Ukraine additional air defence systems as Mr Zelensky said on social media that he and Mr Trump had a ‘fruitful conversation’, with Ukraine ‘grateful’ for the support.\n\nHe added: ‘Today we discussed the current situation, including Russian airstrikes and the broader frontline developments. President Trump is very well informed.\n\n‘We spoke about opportunities in air defence and agreed we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.\n\n‘We are ready for direct projects with the United States.’\n\nLast night, another strike caused a blackout in Ukraine after destroying the power line connecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to the country’s power grid.\n\nIt follows reports that the US is to reduce the amount of military hardware it gives Ukraine, with US defence officials yesterday denying rumours of a weapons shortage.\n\nDefence secretary Pete Hegseth was also said to have halted weapons shipments to Ukraine without consulting other US government departments.","summary":"The US President made the pledge after a 'very disappointing' phone call with Vladimir Putin on Thursday night, with Russia launching the barrage hours after.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14877057/Russia-blitz-Trump-promises-air-defences-Ukraine-disappointing-call-Putin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/05/00/100025111-0-image-a-28_1751671066462.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-04 23:19:57","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol Diplomacy","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol Diplomacy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":338387662,"title":"Republican donors and Florida’s hurricane know-how helped build ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ so quickly","text":"In a matter of days, an isolated training airport in the Everglades where endangered Florida panthers roam became a sprawling immigration detention center christened “Alligator Alcatraz,” modeled after the state’s frequent responses to hurricanes and built in part by companies whose owners have donated generously to Republicans.\n\nIt’s been less than two weeks since the state seized the property from Miami-Dade County. Massive tents have been erected and a steady stream of trucks carrying portable toilets, asphalt and construction materials have been driving through the site inside the Big Cypress National Preserve around the clock in what environmentalists fear will have a devastating impact on the wildlife in the protected wetlands.\n\n“We are dealing with a storm,” said Jae Williams, spokesman for Republican Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is credited as the architect behind the proposal. “And the storm’s name is immigration.”\n\nThe first detainees arrived Thursday at the facility, which will cost $450 million to operate and consists of tents and trailers surrounded by razor wire on swampland about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami.\n\nRepublicans named it after what was once one of the most notorious prisons in the U.S. and have billed it as a temporary lockup that is essential to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nOpponents decry it as a political stunt and fear it could become permanent. The Republican Party of Florida has taken to fundraising off the detention center, selling branded T-shirts and beer koozies emblazoned with the facility’s name.\n\n“The proposal was rolled out without any public input in one of the most ecologically sensitive regions of Florida, and arguably the United States,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, which is among environmental groups that have sued to stop the project.\n\nSome GOP donors whose companies helped build and will assist in running the facility are being given seven-figure sums. Five Democratic state lawmakers who tried to visit the site Thursday issued a statement calling it “a pay-for-play scheme to enrich GOP donors under the pretense of border enforcement.” One of the lawmakers, state Sen. Shevrin Jones, posted on social media that they were denied access.\n\nFlorida built ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ using expertise from its response to hurricanes\n\nHot, humid summers; regular flooding; and wildlife that includes alligators and venomous snakes make the area where the detention center is located inhospitable to long-term living.\n\nFor the state emergency management staff leading the project, it wasn’t unlike responding to another hurricane, just with more chain-link fencing, and barbed wire stretching more than 28,000 feet, according to state officials.\n\nFlorida’s leaders pride themselves on the state’s disaster response capabilities, an expertise sharpened by tropical storms that sweep ashore year after year. Florida had a system and a command structure, as well as a fleet of vendors ready to help set up portable generators, floodlights, temporary kitchens and bathrooms, officials said.\n\n“We understand how to act fast without bureaucracy in the face of any emergency,” said Kevin Guthrie, director of Florida’s emergency management division, sitting alongside DeSantis and Trump in one of the temporary shelters during an unveiling event at the facility. “We’re able to translate this knowledge to what we did here,” Guthrie added.\n\nHuman rights advocates say this is not a storm, but people — people who could be left indefinitely in inhumane conditions.\n\nUthmeier said the location had the advantages of an existing site and a 10,500-foot (3,200 meters) runway, with the Everglades serving as a natural security perimeter. For DeSantis, the location in the rugged and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent from escape, much like the California island fortress Republicans named it after.\n\nIt’s also another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying on scare tactics to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.\n\nGOP donors will get paid for ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ work\n\nVendors chosen for the project include Lemoine CDR Logistics and CDR Health Care, companies led by Carlos Duart, a major Republican donor who along with his businesses have given millions of dollars to political committees for DeSantis, Trump and other GOP candidates, according to federal records. CDR Companies has been a go-to vendor for the state for years, and it provides engineering, emergency management and health care services across the country.\n\nDuart confirmed his companies’ involvement to The Associated Press but declined to specify the services they’re providing, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Asked if his businesses were picked because of his political support, he said, “we get chosen because we do exceptional work.”\n\nA database of state contracts also showed that Granny’s Alliance Holdings Inc. signed a $3.3 million contract to provide meals at the facility. IRG Global Emergency Management had inked a $1.1 million deal to provide “flight and operational support” services. Some of the company’s vehicles were seen at the facility, according to images shared with the AP.\n\nIn a sign of its importance to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, the president toured the facility Tuesday. The White House posted on its social media account a graphic of the president standing besides alligators sporting Immigration and Customs Enforcement ball caps under text of “Alligator Alcatraz: Make America Safe Again.”\n\nThe Everglades ecosystem is fragile\n\nIn recent decades, $3.9 billion in federal and state funds have been allocated to restore grasslands in the Everglades. The ecosystem was degraded and transformed when a highway connecting Tampa and Miami was built in 1928.\n\nIn response to the environmental groups’ lawsuit over the detention center, the federal government said in court papers that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security hadn’t authorized or funded the facility, which the state built and will operate.\n\nHowever, Florida plans to seek payment from the federal government.\n\nDeSantis has described it as temporary, with no plans for sewers, and claims there will be “zero impact” on the Everglades. His administration reiterated that stance in court papers responding to the lawsuit.\n\nBut opponents still fear it will become permanent.\n\n“If it becomes more permanent, that is a bigger concern since that permanently evicts these species from the site so they can never come back,” said Elise Bennett, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, which also joined the lawsuit trying to stop the construction. “Our concerns are great now and will only become greater as this project proceeds.”\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Big, Beautiful Bill’ during Military Family Picnic","text":"July 4 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump signed into law House Resolution 1, which he called \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" while hosting a Military Family Picnic event at the White House on Friday evening.\n\nThe bill signing included a flyover of a pair of F-35 fighters escorting a B-2 Spirit bomber, which is the same type that dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21.\n\nSome 150 airmen and airwomen from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri were among the military members and their families who attended the picnic and bill signing.\n\n\"The American people gave us a historic mandate in November,\" Trump said of his election victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA triumph of democracy\n\nTrump called the bill's passage a \"triumph of democracy on the birthday of democracy,\" and said it is \"the most popular bill ever signed in the history of our country.\"\n\nIt includes the single largest tax cut, the largest spending cut and the largest border security investment in U.S. history, the president said.\n\nHe said the measure modernizes the military, funds the creation of a\" golden dome\" national air defense system and drives economic growth.\n\n\"This bill will fuel massive economic growth and lift up the hardworking citizens who make this country run -- the factory workers, farmers, mechanics, waiters, waitresses, police officers, firefighters, coal miners [and] truck drivers,\" Trump said.\n\nThe bill makes tax cuts permanent, including no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security, the president said.\n\nIt also makes the child tax credit permanent, creates a tax deduction on the interest paid on the purchase of new U.S.-made vehicles and eliminates the estate tax on family farms and small businesses.\n\nThe 'Golden Age' of America\n\nTrump said the bill cuts taxes on new businesses and existing ones that build and expand their operations.\n\n\"We have hundreds of factories, including car plants and [artificial intelligence], coming into our country at levels we have never seen,\" he told the audience.\n\n\"Not only will we have the strongest economy on Earth, we also will have the strongest borders,\" Trump said, adding that there were no recorded illegal border crossings into the United States in June.\n\n\"We are creating an economy that delivers wealth for the middle class, a border that is sovereign and secure, and a military that is unmatched[and] unequaled anywhere in the world,\" Trump said.\n\n\"The Golden Age of America is upon us,\" the president said. \"It's going to be a period of time, the likes of which ... the country has never experienced before.\"\n\nLawmakers were thanked ahead of signing\n\nTrump thanked House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and other Republican lawmakers who were among those in attendance for delivering the bill for signing on Independence Day.\n\nThe controversial measure provides funding for the federal government for fiscal year 2026, which begins on Oct. 1, but adds an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump said it reduces spending by $1.7 trillion while also delivering the \"largest tax cut\" in the nation's history.\n\nTrump delivered the 25-minute speech from the south portico of the White House and signed the bill into law from a small desk placed outside, while surrounded by supporters at 5:45 p.m. EDT\n\nJohnson then presented the gavel used when the House
