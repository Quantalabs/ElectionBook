(Photo by Ifeanyi Immanuel Bakwenye / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nDecember 21, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Nigerian government frees 130 kidnapped Catholic schoolchildren \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AFP)—Nigerian authorities have secured the release of 130 kidnapped schoolchildren taken by gunmen from a Catholic school in November, a presidential spokesman said Sunday, after 100 were freed earlier this month.\n\n“Another 130 abducted Niger state pupils released, none left in captivity,” Sunday Dare said in a post on X.\n\nIn late November, hundreds of students and staff were kidnapped from St Mary’s co-educational boarding school in north-central Niger state.\n\nThe attack came as the country buckled under a wave of mass abductions reminiscent of the infamous 2014 Boko Haram kidnapping of schoolgirls in the town of Chibok.\n\nThe west African country suffers from multiple interlinked security concerns, from jihadists in the northeast to armed “bandit” gangs in the northwest.\n\nThe exact number taken from St Mary’s has been unclear throughout the ordeal.\n\nInitially, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said 315 students and staff were unaccounted for after the attack in the rural hamlet of Papiri.\n\nAround 50 of them escaped immediately afterwards, and on December 7 the government secured the release of around 100.\n\nThat would leave about 165 thought to be still in captivity before Sunday’s announcement that 130 were rescued.\n\nBut a UN source told AFP that all those taken appeared to have been released — as dozens thought to have been kidnapped had in fact managed to run off during the attack, and make their way home.\n\nThe accounting has been complicated because the children’s homes are scattered across swathes of rural Nigeria, sometimes requiring three or four hours of travel by motorbike to reach their remote villages, the source said.\n\nThe source told AFP that “the remaining set of girls/secondary school students will be taken to Minna”, the capital of Niger state, on Monday.\n\n“We’ll have to still do final verification,” Daniel Atori, a spokesman for CAN in Niger state, told AFP.\n\nHe added that Niger state Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago had called the bishop of the Kontagora diocese, which runs the school, “to confirm the release of the children and teachers”, though “the figure was not mentioned”.\n\n– Spate of mass kidnappings –\n\nIt has not been made public who seized the children from their boarding school, or how the government secured their release.\n\nAnalysts have said that based on past rescues, it was likely the authorities paid a ransom, which is technically prohibited by law.\n\nKidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make quick cash in Nigeria.\n\nBut a spate of mass abductions in November put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country’s already grim security situation.\n\nAssailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers and a bride and her bridesmaids — with farmers, women and children also taken hostage.\n\nThe kidnappings came as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that there were mass killings of Christians that amounted to a “genocide” and threatened military intervention.\n\nNigeria’s government and independent analysts reject that framing, which has long been used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe.\n\nOne of the first mass kidnappings that drew international attention was in 2014, when nearly 300 girls were snatched from their boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok by Boko Haram jihadists.\n\nA decade later, Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis has “consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry” that raised some $1.66 million between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags:

Plan","text":"US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said Russian and American officials held “productive and constructive” meetings in Florida over the last two days as part of efforts to advance President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv’s negotiating team was separately engaged in detailed talks with US envoys on ending the war.\nIn an X post, Witkoff said Russia’s special envoy Kirill Dmitriev met the American delegation in Florida to move discussions forward.\n“Over the last two days in Florida, the Russian Special Envoy Kirill Dmitriev held productive and constructive meetings with the American delegation to advance President Trump’s peace plan on Ukraine,” Witkoff wrote.\nHe said the US delegation included himself, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and White House staff member Josh Gruenbaum.\n“Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine,” Witkoff mentioned, adding that Moscow “highly values the efforts and support of the United States to resolve the Ukrainian conflict and re-establish global security.”\nThe post came hours after Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s negotiating team was in Florida holding meetings with US representatives, including envoys of President Trump.\n“Ukraine’s negotiating team is currently working in Florida – there will be more meetings today with the American delegation, with envoys of President Trump,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.\nHe said discussions were focused on documents related to “ending the war, on security guarantees, and on reconstruction,” adding that talks were detailed and constructive.\n“Work on the documents on ending the war, on security guarantees, and on reconstruction is ongoing – they are going through each point in detail, and there is constructive engagement with the American side,” Zelenskyy mentioned.\nIn a video message accompanying the post, Zelenskyy described the past week as a major diplomatic moment for Ukraine.\n“I would like to conclude this historic week for Ukraine, a significant diplomatic week,” he said, highlighting the European Union’s decision to provide €90 billion in support over two years.\n“The main thing is that we have provided Ukraine with 90 billion euros for two years.”\nZelenskyy said Ukraine would receive “a minimum of 45 billion euros annually for the next two years” and stressed that the funds would come from Russian assets frozen in Europe.\n“Russia must pay for its war,” he said.\n“90 billion euros is a financial guarantee of security for all of Ukraine,” he added.\nHe also confirmed that negotiations in Florida included discussions on timing.\n“They are also discussing timing, possible timeframes for specific decisions,” he said, adding that he expected reports from Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Andrii Hnatov.\nThe Florida meetings followed earlier talks between US, Ukrainian, and European officials and are part of Washington’s attempt to coax both sides toward an agreement to end the war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nDmitriev told reporters after meeting Witkoff and Kushner that discussions were constructive and would continue, Reuters reported.\nWhile US officials have reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv, the report mentioned that US intelligence assessments continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin has not softened his demands, including opposition to Ukraine joining NATO and insistence on territorial concessions.","summary":"US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said American and Russian officials held

other’","text":"After a long weekend of debates about whether the movement should exclude figures such as bigoted podcaster Nick Fuentes, Vance came down firmly against “purity tests.”\n\n“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during the convention’s closing speech.\n\nTurning Point leader Erika Kirk, who took the helm after the assassination of her husband, Charlie Kirk, has endorsed Vance as a potential successor to President Donald Trump, a helpful nod from an influential group with an army of volunteers.\n\nBut the tension on display at the four-day gathering foreshadowed the treacherous political waters that Vance, or anyone else who seeks the next Republican presidential nomination, will need to navigate in the coming years. Top voices in the “Make America Great Again” movement are jockeying for influence as Republicans begin considering a future without Trump, and there is no clear path to holding his coalition together.\n\nDefining a post-Trump GOP\n\nThe Republican Party’s identity has been intertwined with Trump for a decade, but he’s constitutionally ineligible to run for reelection despite his musings about serving a third term. Tucker Carlson said people are wondering, “who gets the machinery when the president exits the scene?”\n\nSo far, it looks like settling that question will come with a lot of fighting among conservatives. The Turning Point conference featured arguments about antisemitism, Israel and environmental regulations, not to mention rivalries between leading commentators.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, used his speech on the conference’s opening night to denounce “charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty.”\n\n“These people are frauds and they are grifters and they do not deserve your time,” Shapiro said. He specifically called out Carlson for hosting Fuentes for a friendly interview on his podcast.\n\nCarlson brushed off the criticism when he took the stage barely an hour later, and he said the idea of a Republican “civil war” was “totally fake.”\n\n“There are people who are mad at JD Vance, and they’re stirring up a lot of this in order to make sure he doesn’t get the nomination,” he said. Carlson described Vance as “the one person” who subscribes to the “core idea of the Trump coalition,” which Carlson said was “America first.”\n\nTurning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet framed the discord as a healthy debate about the future of the movement, an uncomfortable but necessary process of finding consensus.\n\n“We’re not hive-minded commies,” he wrote on social media. “Let it play out.”\n\nIf you love America, you’re welcome in the movement, Vance says\n\nVance acknowledged the controversies that dominated the Turning Point conference, but he did not define any boundaries for the conservative movement besides patriotism.\n\n“We don’t care if you’re white or black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,” he said.\n\nVance didn’t name anyone, but his comments came in the midst of an increasingly contentious debate over whether the right should give a platform to commentators espousing antisemitic views, particularly Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as working to preserve America’s white, Christian identity. Fuentes has a growing audience, as does top-rated podcaster Candace Owens, who routinely shares antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\n“We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said.\n\nVance ticked off what he said were the accomplishments of the administration as it approaches the one-year mark, noting its efforts at the border and on the economy. He emphasized efforts to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies, drawing applause by saying they had been relegated to the “dustbin of history.”\n\n“In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore,” he said.\n\nVance also said the U.S. “always will be a Christian nation,” adding that “Christianity is America’s creed, the shared moral language from the Revolution to the Civil War and beyond.”\n\nThose comments resonated with Isaiah White-Diller, an 18 year-old from Yuma, Arizona, who said he would support Vance if he runs for president.\n\n“I have my right to be Christian here, I have my right to say whatever I want,” White-Diller said.\n\nTurning Point backs Vance for president\n\nVance hasn’t disclosed his future plans, but Erika Kirk said Thursday that Turning Point wanted Vance “elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible.” The next president will be the 48th in U.S. history.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a nationwide volunteer network that can be especially helpful in early primary states, when candidates rely on grassroots energy to build momentum. In a surprise appearance, rapper Nicki Minaj spoke effusively about Trump and Vance.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, and they supported each other over the years. After Kirk’s assassination on a college campus in Utah, the vice president flew out on Air Force Two to collect Kirk’s remains and bring them home to Arizona. The vice president helped uniformed service members carry the casket to the plane.\n\nEmily Meck, 18, from Pine City, New York, said she appreciated Vance making space for a wide variety of views.\n\n“We are free-thinkers, we’re going to have these disagreements, we’re going to have our own thoughts,” Meck said.\n\nTrump has spoken highly of both Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, even suggesting they could form a future Republican ticket. Rubio has said he would support Vance.\n\nAsked in August whether Vance was the “heir apparent,” Trump said “most likely.”\n\n“It’s too early, obviously, to talk about it, but certainly he’s doing a great job, and he would be probably favorite at this point,” he said.","summary":"“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during the Turning Point convention’s closing speech.","url":"https://fortune.com/2025/12/21/gop-antisemitism-jd-vance-purity-tests-turning-point-usa-convention-erika-kirk/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25355730663079_78869a-e1766366192180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 01:25:29","author":"Jonathan J.

It catches the lingering heart of a story that the frantic pace of the breaking news cycle so often leaves behind.\n\nElizabeth Flux, arts editor\n\nThe best culture stories are the ones that take either something you think you understand or something that has faded into the background of everyday life and makes you look at it in a new way. Meg Watson’s interview with Agnes Lee does both of these things. Lee is the mind behind the Australian Women’s Weekly “ducky cake”, and this article delves into how an icon came into being while also offering a look at a very specific moment in time.\n\nIn the same way, a collaboration between Nell Geraets, Gabriela Sumampow and the Visual Stories Team delved into the Labubu phenomenon – even before most of us had started to notice the growing number of strange furry monsters clipped onto the handbags and backpacks of people around us, work was beginning on a piece that not only explained a growing mania, but that let you experience a piece of it through clever use of interaction.\n\nMichael Bachelard, senior writer\n\nThere is no sharper skewer to pop the pretensions of a puffed-up politician or public figure than the prose of Tony Wright. Given his vast longevity and prodigious memory, his attacks are always delivered with a lacing of history.\n\nThis year, I loved his take-down of Clive Palmer’s “magnificently flatulent” new undertaking, Trumpet of Patriots. His account of Kevin Rudd’s mortification by Donald Trump – “I don’t like you … and I probably never will” was almost as delicious.\n\nTony also has an uncanny ability to recall and distill the history of pretty much any country town in Victoria.\n\nHis portrait of Porepunkah – the scene of Dezi Freeman’s shooting of two police officers in August – was as fascinating as it was timely. The town, he recalled, had a “dark history” – of murderous white supremacist gold miners and a deviant conman called “Brother Ron”. Decades in the service and still at the top of his game.\n\nAlso, Mel Fyfe’s Good Weekend feature about forced marriage in Australia was pitch-perfect. Her opening line grabs you from the start: “Before escaping out the window, Miriam waits for her parents to doze off”.\n\nShe builds the drama of the impending, unwanted wedding, as she describes her subject chipping away at the glue her parents used to jam her window shut. Chilling.\n\nCassandra Morgan, breaking news reporter\n\nA slew of Erin Patterson stories come to mind when I think about the best journalism of the year. But this piece, from Erin Pearson and Chris Vedelago, is one that I found myself sharing with family and friends to illustrate the cruel deception of the case. The lede, accompanied by Jason South’s incredible photograph of Simon Patterson looking skyward, sets up a horrible and compelling tale of secrets, needless suffering, and a family’s faith – in God and the good nature of people.\n\n“It was a gathering born of dread, not devotion. On August 2, 2023, the close-knit Patterson and Wilkinson clans converged at the Austin Hospital’s 24-hour chapel. Just down the corridor, four of their loved ones lay desperately ill in hospital beds. Amid constant distressing updates from doctors, Simon Patterson had a secret to share – a chilling explanation and a story of hidden hate.”\n\nCatherine Chisholm, homepage editor\n\nJust like clockwork, I can rely on Kate Halfpenny to make me smile every Friday. As a homepage editor, my daily grind is a tsunami of politics, crime and breaking world news.\n\nWhile we work hard to keep the homepage dynamic, offering a mix of journalism at The Age, to me, especially come Friday, Halfpenny’s column feels like a necessary exhale. Her pieces are consistently well-read, honest, and delightfully amusing.\n\nShe has a knack for cutting through the noise and delivering an insightful, yet often biting, perspective on the hot topics of the week.\n\nTake, for example, her hilarious takedown of Meghan’s show. This column made me laugh out loud.\n\nRoy Ward, sports writer\n\nI love this time of year and remembering so many great stories from the year gone by. Our election hot seats slow blog looking at a couple of key Victorian seats was such a winner and, perhaps because I live in Kooyong, I loved Rachael Dexter’s reporting, especially when she caught out Amelia Hamer on a pretty huge omission after calling herself a renter – despite owning property in Australia and the UK. Brilliant legwork from Rach to get Hamer’s UK property records. Also loved coverage of the other seats and the snapshots of those corners of the state.\n\nI also have to give Carla Jaeger a shout-out on her investigation into sickening child abuse in home-based daycare. It was a five-month investigation and so heartbreaking, but an essential read. Such a breach of trust and one that really should never have been allowed to happen.\n\nFinally, I’m not the biggest racing fan, but Danny Russell put on a tour de force during the Spring Carnival. He filed heaps of excellent stories and also teamed up with all and sundry across sport and news on other key stories, including some cracking investigative work on the chaotic tenure of MRC chair John Kanga, who resigned after some questions from our reporters.\n\nHe also came up with stellar reporting from the track for our blogs and post-race reports, including Jamie Melham’s historic Caulfield Cup win. His stories had something for the hardcore fans and those who mostly tune in at springtime.\n\nAshleigh McMillan, breaking news reporter\n\nSometimes the best stories are built around a piece of information that seems obvious, but no one has done the hard yards to dig out the statistics and prove it.\n\nEveryone knows properties in Melbourne are going for hundreds of thousands more than they are advertised for. Go to any dinner party with a bunch of 30-somethings desperately trying to pull themselves up onto the property ladder, and you will hear manifold stories about the termite-infested “fixer-upper” that sailed past a million dollars on auction day, or the boxy two-bedroom apartment fought over by retirees, foreign investors and young families alike.\n\nThe Bidding Blind series by Aisha Dow, Nigel Gladstone and the visual stories team proved that underquoting is at epidemic levels, through a detailed investigation of 26,000 auctions. Even better, they managed to effect real change – landmark legislation will be introduced in Victoria next year requiring properties to have a minimum sale price listed before they go to auction.\n\nDebbie Cuthbertson, culture news editor\n\nSenior culture writer Kerrie O’Brien has had a bumper year, leading the coverage of major stories from the Bendigo Writers Festival walk-out to the MSO cancelling pianist Jayson Gillham’s concert and the shock closure of long-running Australian literary magazine Meanjin.\n\nShe capped that off with an exclusive in November, revealing the State Library of Victoria’s proposal to significantly cut staff. In December, its chair announced exclusively to Kerrie that the library was abandoning its restructure plan.\n\nOne of the biggest responses we’ve had to a culture story this year was to senior culture writer Karl Quinn’s gripping, in-depth look at the changing of the guard at Netflix in Australia. His deep dive into the events behind the departure of its local content chief Que Minh Luu was months in the making, and had a big impact, especially in terms of readership when it was published in September.\n\nKarl was also responsible for one of the funniest interviews of the year - when he himself was overcome with laughter while interviewing the cast of Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (be sure to watch the accompanying video), directed by the incomparable Rob Reiner, who sadly died this month.\n\nShelby Garlick, homepage editor\n\nThe entire AFL powerbroker series was an intriguing glimpse into the tangled web of Melbourne’s elite and our footy clubs. All profiles were meticulously researched and expertly produced by the sports team. The 11-part series managed to capture the soul of each club, but for me, one was a particular standout.\n\nAs a LSSF (Long Suffering Saints Fan), I’ve never really understood how St Kilda has some of Australia’s wealthiest men as die-hard fans, yet the club has been stuck on welfare support for what feels like eternity. Finally, it feels like I got an explanation: the money men leave their chequebooks at home and wield their power in other ways.\n\nThe detail of Gerry Ryan calling Ross the Boss “in his hour of need” isn’t just a catchy headline; it’s a powerful illustration of the personal, often invisible support systems that keep clubs afloat.\n\nSam McClure cleverly portrayed a drought-stricken club desperate to shake its financial woes at the same time it’s going on a multimillion-dollar recruitment spree. Maybe I’m just a hopeful fool, but there was a glimpse of hope that things are slowly turning around – at least, financially. But the question begs, which will come first: the Saints getting off welfare or finally getting that drought-breaking premiership?\n\nI’m also going to highlight Jake Niall’s series, The 30-year Blues. My favourite time of year is the week before footy starts, where hopes for footy fans are sky-high, perhaps none more so than Carlton supporters.\n\nJake beautifully illustrated – thanks to the willingness of former coaches to speak out – the internal dysfunction, pressure, and heartbreak the club has experienced. Overall, it painted a grim portrait of a club that has often gone from crisis to crisis – on and off the field.\n\nThe series was the ultimate scene setter for Round 1 and what (if you asked my fiance) was going to be the year it all turned around for the Baggers. But in typical Carlton style, that came crashing down spectacularly when Richmond, a team nobody thought was going to even win a game this season pulled off a glorious come-from-behind win.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for Carlton from there. If the Carlton faithful needed answers on why 2025 went so horribly wrong, Jake’s series was a good place to start.\n\nPaul Pennay, deputy content director\n\nI’ll be honest, half the yarns that popped into my head when contemplating this brief actually turned out to be from 2024 – and I still think Lachie Abbott and Sophie Boyd’s man v Metro Tunnel train video is a thing of joy.\n\nHowever, this clear but nuanced piece by Cassandra Morgan about the pitfalls around finding the words to talk about trauma and grief hit a nerve for me. Cass manages to weave together the heartbreak and tragedy of individual stories with clear-headed advice and piercing analysis. It amazes me that she can pull together such a wise, practical and human piece while juggling her regular breaking desk workload with its roll call of crime, violence, death and destruction.\n\nIn the shadow of the horrors we saw in Bondi this week, I recommend it to you.\n\nAisha Dow, investigative journalist\n\nReflecting on the year that was is a reminder of the impressive coverage that this newsroom produces day in and day out. My colleagues are often at their very best when big news breaks, and unfortunately, this year has had its share of horrific crime and tragedy. Not long ago, I was speaking to a workmate, Melissa Cunningham, who was at the scene of a high-profile alleged crime. She was still wearing the same clothes from the previous day, after leaving the office 24 hours earlier and driving to the scene many hours away, without even a toothbrush. And of course, she still manages to file with accuracy and flair.\n\nThen there was our gripping and Walkley-winning coverage of the mushroom trial, our innovative coverage of local seat battles in the federal election, and so much more.\n\nHowever, the story that sticks with me most from 2025 is the two-part investigative series Follow the mice by Liam Mannix, documenting an extraordinary case of scientific fraud by Mark Smyth, once one of the nation’s most lauded scientists. I read every word. If you missed it, make sure you add it to your summer reading list.\n\nPaul Rovere, deputy picture editor\n\nUtilising the vibrant colours of the Australian Ballet dancers’ costumes, a rhythmic composition and a playful use of light and shadow, Eddie Jim delivers a masterclass in the core pillars of photography.\n\nThe “Jesus rays” streaming through the high windows and the strong contrast between light and dark elevate this simple portrait of Reverend Father George Frangos by Simon Schluter into something transcendent.\n\nPhotographer Justin McManus captured the magnitude of the 500-kilometre Walk for Truth in a single frame, documenting the journey led by Yoorrook commissioner Travis Lovett. The image distills the profound gravity of this moment for First Nations people, reflecting both the powerful momentum towards Treaty and the enduring hope it creates for the future.\n\nWhen we ask our photographers to shoot for a hot weather story, they invariably come back with sunbathing beachgoers at St Kilda. Jason South’s iconic photo of these women dressed for the 40-degree heat playing lawn bowls in Altona was so far removed from the typical shot that it’s now the official benchmark for all future hot-weather assignments.\n\nEmerging almost supernaturally from the mist and mud of Porepunkah in winter, Joe Armao’s photo captures the despondency of the Victoria Police Special Operations Group members following their fruitless search for Desmond Freeman. The image documents a sombre moment in the hunt for the man linked to the August shooting of two police officers.\n\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

It had also previously carried Iranian crude, according to the ​vessel monitoring service.Trump's pressure campaignThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday, while US President Donald Trump had last week announced a \"blockade\" of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela.Trump's pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed in the attacks.The Skipper, a very large crude carrier and the first Venezuela-related vessel seized by the U.S. on December 10, reached the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area near Houston on Sunday. Very large crude carriers cannot transit the Houston ship channel, as the waterway is not deep enough, and typically ​transfer the ⁠oil on board to smaller tankers at GOLA.The first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National ⁠Economic Council, said in a television interview on Sunday.\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the ‌U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" Hassett said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"But analysts said the new seizures may push oil prices slightly higher when Asian ​trading resumes on Monday.\"We might see prices increasing modestly at the opening, considering market participants could see this as an escalation with more Venezuelan barrels at risk\" because the tanker intercepted on Saturday was not under U.S. sanctions, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on ‍Wednesday that the country's oil trade will continue. But the ‍new U.S. focus on ⁠oil tankers will raise geopolitical risks and probably hurt Venezuela's oil revenue, analysts said.The effects could be felt quickly as Venezuela's export volumes fall significantly and oil storage tanks fill up faster, forcing the OPEC producer to cut output, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute.(With inputs from Reuters)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-coast-guard-pursues-sanctioned-oil-tanker-linked-to-venezuela-in-caribbean-report-11766363609082.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/12/22/1600x900/logo/Venezuela-Oil-0_1766363743348_1766363763869.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:41:37","author":"Livemint","authors":["Livemint"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":388019934,"title":"US attorney-general faces contempt push over Epstein files","text":"Two congressmen say they will recommend United States Attorney-General Pam Bondi be held in contempt of Congress for failing to meet a legally mandated deadline to release the entire tranche of the Epstein files.\n\nThe House of Representatives would need to vote on the contempt resolution.\n\nThe US Department of Justice was ordered last month to release all unclassified documents it held on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by midnight Friday, local time.\n\nThat day, Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche said his department would fail to meet that deadline because it needed more time to redact the information of about 1,200 survivors in the hundreds of thousands of pages due to be released.\n\nSince then, thousands of photos, court documents, grand jury exhibits, phone message notes and other documents have been published on the department's website.\n\nBut the condemnation from both survivors and politicians over the full trove being held back has been unrelenting.\n\nTwo congressmen who spearheaded the Epstein Files Transparency Act — democrat Ro Khanna and republican Thomas Massie — have now said they are drafting documentation that will find Ms Bondi in contempt for not abiding by the legal deadline.\n\nMr Khanna told The Washington Post Ms Bondi would likely be given a 30-day grace period, after which she would receive daily fines until she released all the files.\n\nHe also said the pair were pursuing contempt findings because it would not need Senate approval.\n\n\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Mr Massie said on CBS News this morning, local time, alongside Mr Khanna.\n\nIn a post on X earlier today, Ms Bondi encouraged \"any victim to please come forward with any information pertaining to any individuals who engaged in illicit activity at their expense\" in relation to Epstein.\n\n\"We believe in the equal standard of justice in this country and will ensure that Justice is served,\" she said.\n\nAfter the first release of files, the Department of Justice was criticised for publishing documents that were entirely redacted.\n\nOn Sunday, local time, the department announced it had re-released a 119-page document that had earlier been completely blacked.\n\n\"Here is the document now with minimal redactions.

The Indian high-skilled workers had appointments cancelled between December 15 and 26, the lawyers said, a period coinciding with the US holiday season. In emails viewed by The Washington Post, the State Department told visa holders their interviews were being delayed after the implementation of the Trump administration's new social media vetting policy, \"to ensure that no applicants... pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety.\"\nAlso Read | Dipu Chandra Das Lynching: 2 More Arrested in Connection With Mob Lynching of Hindu Youth in Bangladesh, Taking Total to 12.\nThe United States has expanded its review of social media and online presence to cover all H-1B speciality occupation workers and their H-4 dependents, the US Embassy in India said on December 10.

Under the proclamation, a USD 100,000 fee must accompany every new H-1B visa petition filed after the deadline, including those submitted for entry into the 2026 lottery.\nThe new fee requirement applies only to individuals or companies filing new H-1B petitions or entering the H-1B lottery after September 21.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:09 GMT, 22 December 2025 |Updated:00:17 GMT, 22 December 2025 \n\nThomas Skinner has reportedly parted ways with his agent as Strictly's true voting figures are revealed, after he 'sought legal advice' amid claims BBC bosses rigged the results to axe him first. \nThe Apprentice star, 34, had already been deemed a controversial signing due to his outspoken Right-wing views, but the storm only grew when he confessed to cheating on his wife Sinead just weeks after they tied the knot.\nThomas, who has denied the claims, was reportedly informed by Insanity management, who also represent the likes of Sam Thompson, Roman Kemp and Vick Hope of their decision on Saturday. \nHis legal threats also seemingly lie in tatters after an independent poll showed the star received just 1.4% of the public vote, despite claims he received an anonymous email of evidence proving otherwise. \nThe exit pole of 125K viewers was conducted by website Strictly Spoiler and is completely separate from the BBC main vote, showed 'clear evidence of his unpopularity' after he received just 1805 votes, the lowest of all the contestants. \nA source told The Mirror: 'The poll - which is larger than an exit poll for a- comprehensively shows that Skinner was the least popular contestant by a long way. There is no conspiracy. These are the cold, hard facts'.\n\nThomas Skinner has reportedly parted ways with his agent as Strictly's true voting figures are revealed, after he 'sought legal advice' amid claims bosses rigged the results to axe him first \n\nThe Apprentice star, 34, had already been deemed a controversial signing due to his outspoken Right-wing views, but the storm only grew when he confessed to cheating on his wife\nDaily Mail have contacted Insanity and Thomas Skinner for comment.\nThomas and pro partner Amy Dowden, 35, scored a dismal 29 out of 80 over two shows and landed in the bottom two with former rugby player Chris Robshaw, who was eventually saved by the judges. \nA BBC spokesperson said: 'Strictly Come Dancing's public vote is independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy every week. Any claims to the contrary are entirely without foundation. Unfortunately, despite requests for it, Mr Skinner is yet to share the email he references with anyone from the BBC so we are unable to comment on it'.\nIn addition, PromoVeritas – the company who independently verify the Strictly public vote – said: 'All votes are independently and comprehensively verified by two auditors. We can confirm that all votes received are validated. This has been the case every week.'\nIt comes after a since deleted statement, as reported by The Mirror, by Thomas said he 'really regretted' appearing in this year's Strictly.\nThe reality star said he was 'not perfect' and had 'made mistakes' but was convinced he was right about the votes being rigged.\nWhile insisting the only positive experience of his stint was meeting pro partner Amy, he also claimed he was still on 'good terms' with the BBC. Despite his legal action and pulling out of Saturday's final, which saw Lioness Karen Carney win.\nThomas said: 'First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone who has followed my journey and supported me along the way. I genuinely appreciate it more than you'll ever know'. \n\nHis legal threat seemingly lie in tatters after an independent poll showed the star received just 1.4% of the public vote\n\nThe exit pole of 125K viewers was conducted by website Strictly Spoiler and is completely separate from the BBCmain vote, showed 'clear evidence of his unpopularity' \n\nThomas, who has denied the claims was reportedly informed by Insanity management, who also represent the likes of Sam Thompson (pictured) on Saturday\n\n Tom Skinner breaks silence on early Strictly Come Dancing exit as he 'seeks legal advice' after claiming 'BBC bosses rigged official voting figures' \n'I also want to be honest. I know what's likely to come next. I expect people will call me a liar, they'll try to cancel me, say I'm hated, or even claim I didn't get any votes at all. At this point, I don't care anymore. I know what's right, and I know the conversations I've had'.\nThomas, who shares three children with his wife, continued: 'I understand that much of what's happened is my own fault. I know I've made plenty of mistakes in my life and I hold my hands up to that. I'm not perfect and I've never pretended to be. \n'But what I can't accept is my family being dragged into this. So I need to take a step back. I never wanted any of this to become public. If I'm being completely honest, I really regret doing Strictly Come Dancing'. \nHe went on: 'I wish I'd never done it. The only positive to come from it was making a new friend in Amy, who is a genuinely lovely person. Aside from that, it's brought a huge amount of negative attention, and it has affected me more than I'd like to admit.'\n'It was on good terms. I want to be clear: I don't hate the BBC. They gave me my big break when I appeared on The Apprentice six or seven years ago, and I'm grateful for that. I'm not looking for conflict. I just want to get on with my life.\n\nWhile insisting the only positive experience of his stint was meeting pro partner Amy Dowden, he also claimed to still being on 'good terms' with the BBC\n\nThis comes Despite his legal action and pulling out of Saturday's final, which saw Lioness Karen Carney and pro Carlos Gu win (pictured) \n\nThomas previously said he wished he 'never went on Strictly', as he has received 'constant abuse' following the revelation that he cheated on his wife (pictured together)\nBefore adding: 'Tomorrow I'll be back at work, focusing on my family, my children, and my beautiful wife. I'm lucky I have work every day an I'm focusing on that. The amount I've been attacked this year really isn't right.'\nDaily Mail have contacted Thomas' representatives for further comment. \nA source told The Sun: 'The BBC is already facing a £7.5billion lawsuit from Donald Trump – now Thomas, a friend of Vice President JD Vance, is taking them on too'.\nThe president filed a $10billion lawsuit against the corporation after the embattled corporation was found to have doctored his speech in a Panorama episode. \n'Thomas is adamant he got a larger share of the public vote and believes he has the evidence to prove it. He is determined to see it through, but there’s no way the BBC will take this sensational claim lying down. They’ll robustly defend any kinds of claims that the voting was rigged or fixed'.\n'He’s convinced the BBC was hell-bent on getting him out as soon as possible, no matter how many of his fans got behind him'. \nSam ThompsonBBCThomas SkinnerVick Hope\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThomas Skinner 'parts ways with his agent as Strictly's true voting figures are REVEALED' after he 'sought legal advice' amid claims bosses 'rigged' the result to get him axed\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the nearly four-year-old conflict as soon as possible, but Russia wants to keep the Ukrainian ‍areas it ⁠has seized and Kyiv has refused to cede ground. After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev on Saturday, Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner met on Sunday with officials from Ukraine and Europe, and then separately with the Ukrainian delegation, led by senior official Rustem Umerov. Witkoff, in a social media post, called Sunday's talks \"productive and constructive\" and focused on a \"shared strategic approach between Ukraine, ​the United States and Europe. \"In a separate X post that used ‌some of the same language, Witkoff said his talks with Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive.\" \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine,\" Witkoff said in the post. \"Russia highly values the efforts and ​support of the United States to resolve the Ukrainian conflict and re-establish global security. \"Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said earlier on Sunday that Ukrainian and European input into the peace proposals under discussion had , but said \"After that, we will formulate the position with which we will proceed, including in our contacts with the Americans,\" Ushakov said in remarks posted by Kremlin pool journalist Pavel Zarubin on his Telegram channel. The meetings in Miami were the latest in a series of talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine on a US-drafted 20-point plan to end the war. Witkoff said ‌the US-Ukraine meeting focused on four key points: further development of the 20-point plan, a multilateral security guarantee framework, a US security guarantee framework for Ukraine, and further development on economics and prosperity to ‌rebuild Ukraine. Negotiators focused especially on \"timelines\" and \"sequencing of next steps,\" Witkoff said. US, Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, ‌but it remains unclear if those terms will be acceptable to Moscow. \"Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" Witkoff said. Prior to the Miami ‌meeting, U.S. intelligence continued to indicate ‍Putin has not ⁠abandoned his ambitions ​of taking over Ukrainian territory, according to six people familiar with the intelligence. In response to a Reuters report on Friday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on X that US ⁠intelligence assessments have shown Russia “does not currently have the capability to conquer and occupy ⁠all of Ukraine, let alone Europe. ”Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump's, said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday it was still unclear if Putin would accept the current deal. If he does not, Graham said, the Trump administration should adopt ‌an approach similar to its recent actions with oil tankers near Venezuela and \"seize ships that are carrying sanctioned Russian oil. ”A Russian refusal to accept the current proposal should also lead to labeling “Russia ‌a state sponsor of terrorism for kidnapping 20,000 Ukrainian kids,” Graham said.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-envoy-witkoff-calls-ukraine-russia-talks-productive-10432274/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/12/US-5-13.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:15:31","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":388017050,"title":"Nicki Minaj's Career 'Could Be Over' After Rapper Called Donald Trump 'Handsome, Dashing President'","text":"Nicki Minaj just made headlines after she proclaimed her love for Donald Trump at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest event on Sunday.

The re-release of the photograph has drawn massive criticism from the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, with some accusing the DOJ of excessive redactions and a lack of transparency.According to reports, the photo, which shows Trump alongside Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and others, was part of a collection of documents released by the DOJ on Friday. However, it was removed shortly after, citing concerns about possible victim images. However, after a massive criticism and outrage, the DOJ has re-released the photo, stating that a review found no evidence of Epstein victims in the image.As the shocking developments surfaced, the lawmakers from both parties have criticized the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files, with some accusing the department of being too slow to release documents. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said the redactions were excessive, while Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., threatened to draft contempt charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., also criticized the DOJ's response, saying all these files need to come out.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche defended the DOJ's actions, saying the department was following the law and protecting victims' identities. He stated that the removal of the photo was due to concerns about photographs of women in the same image, and not related to Trump. The official also asserted that the DOJ was in a \"very methodical process\" to ensure no victims' names are accidentally released.Meanwhile, the controversy surrounding the Epstein files has taken a dramatic turn after the re-release of the photo of Trump found in Jeffrey Epstein's files. Earlier, the disappearance of 16 files from the US Justice Department's webpage related to Jeffrey Epstein led to a major controversy, fuelling suspicion about a possible calculated cover-up. The files, which included a photo of Donald Trump alongside Epstein, Melania Trump, and Ghislaine Maxwell, were available on Friday but vanished by Saturday with no explanation from the government.The Democrats on the House Oversight Committee demanded transparency, questioning what else is being covered up. The Justice Department claimed it was reviewing documents and would release more records, citing the need to protect victims' identities. The critics, meanwhile, claimed that the release has been incomplete and heavily redacted, fueling conspiracy theories about Epstein's powerful connections.The Epstein controversy has been a major talking point, especially with the recent release of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy American financier, who was accused of sex trafficking and exploiting numerous underage girls as young as 14 and below. The controversy gained momentum when the US Justice Department released thousands of files, including photos and testimonies. One of the key figures linked to Epstein is US President Donald Trump, who reportedly had a well-documented friendship with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump has however, denied any wrongdoing, claiming he cut ties with Epstein years before his arrest. However, the Democrats have accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information, pointing to the removal of a photo showing Trump alongside Epstein, Melania Trump, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Justice Department, however, claimed the removal was to protect victims' identities.The released documents have fuelled speculation about Trump's involvement, with some alleging he knew about Epstein's activities. Trump has called the controversy a \"Democrat hoax,\" shifting his stance over time from finding it \"interesting\" to downplaying its importance. The lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Justice Department's handling of the files, demanding greater transparency.The Justice Department has pledged to release more documents, but the critics claimed that the initial release was incomplete and heavily redacted. The Epstein files controversy is likely to remain a contentious issue amid the approaching 2026 midterm elections.","summary":"US Justice Department reportedly re-releases Trump photo from Epstein files after initial removal.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-epstein-photo-removed-then-restored-as-doj-accused-of-cover-up-lawmakers-fume-over-transparency","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/trump-epstein-photo-removed-then-restored-as-doj-accused-of-cover-up-lawmakers-fume-over-transparency-1766362408761-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:13:33","author":"Abhishek Tiwari","authors":["Abhishek Tiwari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":388005460,"title":"US Justice Department restores Trump photo in Epstein files after removal","text":"The US Department of Justice on Sunday restored an image from the Jeffrey Epstein files that shows President Donald Trump, reversing an earlier decision to remove the photograph from public view after facing criticism.The action came after 16 files disappeared from the US Justice Department’s public website containing records on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein less than a day after being posted.The image in question appeared as part of materials published on the Justice Department's website on Friday and was later taken down. It contained two separate photographs featuring Trump among a collection of items displayed on and inside Epstein's desk or credenza..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}One photograph showed Trump posing with a group of women. The other was a widely circulated image of Trump standing alongside his wife, Melania Trump, Epstein and Epstein's now-convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.Following the removal, the department addressed the decision in a post on X.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said.The department did not clarify whether the reference to the Southern District of New York applied to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan or to the US Attorney's Office that handles federal prosecutions in the district.The image's brief removal drew criticism from those who questioned whether the department was selectively withholding information. Justice Department officials said the removal was procedural and based on the need to protect victims, not political considerations.NEXT PHASE OF EPSTEIN DISCLOSURESAlongside the clarification over the image, the Justice Department said a substantial volume of Epstein-related records has yet to be released. A department fact sheet stated that \"hundreds of thousands of pages of material\" remain under review, including photographs, documents and court records connected to the disgraced financier.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department could not meet the congressionally mandated disclosure timeline without risking harm to survivors of Epstein's abuse.\"The reason why we are still reviewing documents and still continuing our process is simply to protect victims,\" Blanche said, adding that thousands of records contain sensitive information requiring individual assessment.The Justice Department said more than 200 lawyers are working continuously on the review, a process being carried out jointly by the department and the Southern District of New York. Officials said the scale and sensitivity of the material have slowed the pace of disclosure but will not prevent eventual release.In the DOJ's initial release on Friday, photographs, interview transcripts, call logs and court filings were made public, but some of the most closely watched records -- including FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memoranda outlining charging decisions -- were not included.- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Dec 22, 2025","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/us-justice-department-restores-trump-photo-epstein-files-glbs-2839592-2025-12-22","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202512/epstein-files-22032624-16x9_0.png?VersionId=l0opusFwHNRdsHogK1I9CpQL2AQMCsK_?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:12:18","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":388016688,"title":"What Did Nicki Minaj Say at the Turning Point USA Event?","text":"Music mogul and rap artist Nicki Minaj made a surprise appearance on Sunday at the Turning Point USA's AmericaFest, the annual conference in Phoenix that features conservative commentators, elected officials, and media figures. The conference this year is the first since Charlie Kirk's assassination in September, and Erika Kirk, his widow, took over as CEO of the enterprise. The weekend has seen a star-studded list of guest speakers including Ben Shapiro, JD Vance, and, most surprisingly, Minaj. However, Minaj has recently cozied up to the Trump administration, finding common ground with President Donald Trump on the plight of Christians in Nigeria. Her sit-down talk with Erika Kirk on Sunday covered topics including faith, the Trump administration, and politics in America. What To Know The following is the transcript of Nicki Minaj's conversation with Turning Point USA CEO Erika Kirk. It has been lightly edited for accuracy and clarity. Erika Kirk: So those of you who know Charlie was very good about having a surprise for every and we we are so blessed to have you. We are so grateful. I mean - Nicki Minaj: Thank you. I'm honored to be here. I am honored to be here. Thank you for having me. Love you guys. Erika Kirk: So we're just going to dive right into this. You had some fun words for Governor Newsom. I just - I have to read these tweets because they're amazing, and they're so funny. Okay, first one, we'll do this one, unless you want to read it in your own voice. I think it'd be really great. Nicki Minaj: Okay. Oh, yeah. (Pause) It only gets worse from here for you, buddy. It's the end of the road for you, my love. Get on the Dallas jetski and let that beautiful hair blow in the wind. It'll make you happier than this race that you will not win. Enjoy life. Erika Kirk: Okay, okay. One more, one more. Nicki Minaj: Imagine being the guy running on wanting this trans kids haha. Not even a trans adult would run on that. Normal adults wake up and think they want to see healthy, safe, happy and not Gav. The Gav-nots. Gav - not in, Gav out. Send in the next guy. I'm bored. Erika Kirk: So I'm just going to like your rep. Like I want you to say whatever you want to say to Gavin Newsom. Nicki Minaj: Dear Newscum: we don't have a problem cleaning up the scum if we have to. Please try live. That's what I would say to Gabby Poo.

Erika Kirk: So with regard to the current administration, what has been maybe the biggest surprise for you or something that you just really has put on your heart, that you've learned about our president and our vice president? Nicki Minaj: I have the utmost respect and admiration for our president... And he has - I don't know if he even knows this, but he's given so many people hope that there's a chance to beat the bad guys and to win and to do it, with your head held high and, your integrity intact. He's from Queens, New York, like me, so, but what he's shown me, personally, is, sometimes, you know, even as - even in the worst feeling times in your life, you think that you're never going to come back from it, but you do, and our president shows that. He's been through every single thing a person could be through, public, having to constantly be lied on. It's not really that funny until you are in that person's shoes, that being lied on, you will never understand what it feels like. That person is a human being, they have a family who has to read those lies. That's not and it's just not fair, but this administration is full of people with heart and soul, and and they make me proud of them. Our vice president, he makes me, well, I,. Erika Kirk: I love both of them,. Nicki Minaj: But I they're both powerful men. Smart, strong, all of that. But both of them have a very uncanny ability to be someone that you can relate to. I can relate to that. When I hear them speak, I know that they're one of us. Like, I know that they're not - don't you guys agree? They haven't - they haven't lost - they haven't lost touch of the world. You know, they're still connected to the world and what's happening in the world, with the younger people and older people, with the richer people and not so rich people. They have the ability to still connect and be real, and make us feel proud to be American. What Did Nicki Minaj Say About Politics in America? Erika Kirk: So why now? Have you have you been involved with speaking about politics? What was kind of the - the turning thing for you? [Laughs] Yes. What was the turning point? Nicki Minaj: Well...I just got tired of being pushed around. Sometimes you just get tired of it and then you realize: Wait a minute. I have something inside of me that's stronger than what's out there. Erika Kirk: That's right. Nicki Minaj: So when you had enough, you realize, wait a minute. This - why do I even care about these people and what they don't? Who are they? They don't even know who they are. So I'm not going to - I'm not going to back down anymore. I'm not going to back down ever again. Erika Kirk: Amen. Can the students in the room raise your hand? Wow. This question is for you guys. So - you guys are very courageous and bold on your campus. Nikki I know our students feel this way, but why do you think speaking your mind has become so controversial? Nicki Minaj: Because people no longer are using their minds, their brains. So right now, just imagine - we're not allowed to have a different opinion anymore. We're not allowed to think out loud anymore. We're not - like, it just, this is not what the world used to feel like. Especially for the young people - I don't want them growing up in a world where they feel like they're right. I mean, they deserve for their voices to be heard. They have valid feelings, and and they are thinking about things, and it deserves attention. You know, we should we should listen to what they're saying, and if you're growing up in a world that tells you it's taboo to say something that the masses don't agree with about, well, that, that's not okay, we're not going to have it. And I, and I love that, you know, that it's it's given the younger people confidence that they will need later on in life. You guys will need it and you will have it. So yeah, I'm rooting - I'm waiting for you. Erika Kirk: Again, Charlie would always say that it really does not take skill to be courageous. It takes a choice. It takes a decision. And I just I want to say again, thank you for coming and being courageous, and being able to share your feelings with us, and the reason why that also holds true sentiment-wise, is because I know that you are getting a lot of backlash from your own industry. What is your reaction to that? Nicki Minaj: I didn't notice. Erika Kirk: Amen. I feel the same way. When people are like, what do you think about them? I'm like, I don't think about them. Nicki Minaj: Same girl. Erika Kirk: We don't even think about them. Erika Kirk: We don't have time to for two busy building, right? Yeah. Nicki Minaj: Where the where the cool kids. Erika Kirk: Okay. Nicki Minaj: The other, the other, the other people, they're the ones who are still just disgruntled, but really, they're just disgruntled with themselves. They they are angry with themselves, you guys. So you can wake up and think about somebody who is determined to just stay lost. I literally tell them, stay mad. Stay mad, because we are going to stay joyful, and peaceful, and iconic, and smart. Yeah, we're going to stay thinkers in a world that doesn't want us to think. We will think by ourselves on our own. We will continue to think. Erika Kirk: This is something I know that's really important to you and on your heart, and I just, I, I personally want to know what inspired you to speak out for the Christians that are being slaughtered in Nigeria. Nicki Minaj: Well... and that brings me back to our great president and this administration and our great country that we take for granted that are right now in this world are people who cannot worship God as they please, where they please. If we take them for granted because we have it, we can't even imagine not having that right, but every time we pray in fellowship, we have to remember the people that are right now in this world hiding to pray in fellowship. And we have to pray for them, and - first of all, Nigeria is a place I've always loved, someone very dear to me, my pastor, is Nigerian, I have lots of Nigerian bonds, and so hearing that people are being kidnapped - while they're in church, people are being kidnaped, people are being killed, brutalized, all because of their religion. That should spark outrage in the Great America, and that's what it's doing. And again, we're not backing down anymore. We are not going to be silenced by the bullies anymore. Okay? Know that. Hear that. Receive that. Bullies. We won't be silenced ever again. We will speak up for Christians wherever they are in this world. Erika Kirk: Amen. Amen. I don't know if you can see this at home, but she is getting a ton of standing ovation from I love you guys so much. Nicki Minaj: Thank you. Thank you guys.

(Photo by Caylo Seals/Getty Images) What Did Nicki Minaj Say About Prayer and God? Erika Kirk: So going along that thread, can you tell us about your relationship with God? Because I think a lot of us [indecipherable]. Nicki Minaj: Sure. Well, my relationship in, with God started - well, when I was a toddler in Trinidad, my grandmother, if things got spicy in the house, like if people - if the kids and grandkids were arguing or fighting, she would make all the little kids go in her room and make us say, like, and say a prayer. So, later on in my life, well, now it's not much later when I was like 10, 11, 12, I started going to church in New York, and, it changed everything, changed my life for the better because I was going every week, I was hearing the Word of God be preached, and then I was going home and I was applying it to my life, even as a little girl, I learned how to pray very early. I always had this faith that made people think, you know, the kind of faith that you think a person is crazy, like, oh, please, like, you know, but I had that, instinctively, once I started hearing about [indecipherable], you know, just getting more into the Bible, I got baptized when I was about -and I got baptized when I was about 13. I got baptized and, I have just always applied those teachings to my life. I try to, I mean, and that's the thing: we're not perfect. I'm trying. Sometimes I would wake up and feel so far removed from - not God, but from fellowship. You know, I was like, oh my God, I just go to church on Wednesdays, Friday, and Sunday every week. Like literally three days out of the week, and then later on in your life you become busy and you start thinking, oh, well, you know, God is in my heart and, you know, but then sometimes you can be in an industry as well that pulls you away even more, so lately I've been feeling like, you know, like if you haven't seen a long lost best friend for, you know, for a long time, and then you bump into them again, that's how it's been feeling for me, like just going back to God and praying and talking to him, and you know, and he said to me, where were you? Where've you been? I've been waiting on you! And since that moment that God had that ... and something's better, because now I'm thinking about is God pleased? Not if the bullies and uglies are pleased, but if God is pleased. And when you have that personal relationship with God, guess what? Even in school, he's there. Wherever you are and whenever you need it, you have something that you can tap into immediately. It's immediate. You don't have to leave a message. He's not going to call you back. He's there immediately for you. Call on him, and on the first ring, he's going to answer. And I want you guys to remember that. You're young. And first of all, first of all, I want to say I'm proud of you guys. This is a major to to be. So yeah. For you guys that are in college, to be so young and to care this much, this early in your life, it tells us how smart you are and it tells us that there's hope for our future. So God bless you. Congratulations you guys. You're amazing. Congratulations. You guys are amazing. Okay? Know it. Feel it. Yes. Yes. Proudly. Be proud. Be who you are, proudly. What Did Nicki Minaj Say About Children in America? Erika Kirk: Amen. So what have you. I mean, you're an amazing mother. What have you seen that has been a struggle for young women today. And then also, since both of us have little boys, I would love for you to also talk about the male side of that question as well. Nicki Minaj: Okay, well, it's something that I have noticed recently is that for little girls, I think that no matter how you look, we should be trying to instill into them to be proud of how they love. Recently in the media, it's almost been like a push to - it's not just making young black children feel proud of themselves, but it's almost like doing that and at the same time telling other children not to be proud of themselves. I don't want any child feeling that way. If we - if it's as if we as black women we felt that we were not being represented and not being admired for our beauty - if we felt like that as a black woman, why would we want to do that to other women? Why would we now need to make other people downplay their beauty so that we can feel - no, that's not how it works. I don't need someone with blond hair and blue eyes to downplay their beauty, because I know my beauty. Do you understand? It doesn't bother me that a woman feels and says that she's beautiful. Why shouldn't she feel that? Why have we gotten to a point where certain colors or certain kinds of people have to be afraid of loving themselves and loving the way they look? Like, isn't that wild? So for little girls, I don't want what was done to little black girls done to little white girls. I don't want it done to any girls. I want all the little girls in the world to know that you are unique. You are beautiful. You are you. And you can compliment another girl. You can compliment another woman and still know that you are epic and amazing. So that's what I would say about for the girls, and I know the older - I know, my adults understand clearly where I'm, where I'm going with that, where I'm, you know, I just, I don't like - I don't like that. I don't like people making other people feel badly about themselves in any way. We need to nurture young girls. Erika Kirk: Yes. Nicki Minaj: Whether they are black, white, Asian, Hispanic, they still need to be nurtured. They cannot continue to pay for other people since they haven't done anything wrong.

(Photo by Caylo Seals/Getty Images) What Did Nicki Minaj Say About JD Vance? Erika Kirk: Amen. What do you think about for young men, for young men and for young men? Nicki Minaj: Don't be Newscum. Yes. See, there, young men, you have amazing role models like, handsome, dashing president. And you have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president, and when I say that... Erika Kirk: Trust me, there's nothing new under the sun that I have not heard. So you're fine. Yes, we did. You have to laugh about it. Truly. I have been called every single thing, and you know what? God is so good, you let it roll right off your back. And this is what's so beautiful about this moment, because if the internet wants to clip it, who cares? I love this woman. She's an amazing woman. She has a soul and a heart for the Lord. And words are words, but I know her heart and it doesn't even matter, and you say what you want to say because I know your heart that you will not judge that. Nicki Minaj: Thank you. Erika Kirk: Fo boys, boys be boys. Erika Kirk: Amen. Nicki Minaj: Be boys, it's okay. Be boys, there's nothing wrong with being a boy. How about that? Erika Kirk: Amen. Nicki Minaj: How powerful is that? How profound is that? Amen, boys will be boys, and there's nothing wrong with that. Crowd: Yeah! Nicki Minaj: Yeah, that's what I want to say. Erika Kirk: What's something the media and the world in general misunderstands about you? Nicki Minaj: Oh. I think people that I'm relying on, you know, when you have a strong sense as a woman to just box, you answer one box of one category of, or, you know, the other words they want to, like, put you in a box to be able to label you what they want you to be, but you're so much more than that because you, because you intimidate them, you know, they want to find something, and if they can't find something, they'll make something up, and so they'll put a label on you, but uhm, you know, it doesn't - what people misunderstand about me now? I don't care about - I really don't. They - in fact, I love that they misunderstand me now. What Did Nicki Minaj Say About Christians in Power? Erika Kirk: I do too, because it shows that you're you're not a part of this world. Someone once told me, do not be surprised when the world acts like the world. And I held on to that so much, because even being in this, this role now, people don't - they're trying to figure me out? Okay, enjoy. I am who I am, there's nothing to hide. And I know you feel the same way when people misunderstand you and you're like, okay, well, I have an audience of what - I have an audience of two, but I have an audience in heaven, and and I know the Lord knows me, Lord knows you, and he put everything in you to be able to make a difference in this world. Likewise, to all these students and everyone else here, and to go into that further, I know that this - and I'll end on this - I know that a lot of you guys have been hearing about, you know, we are doing this for Charlie, and we're doing this for his legacy, but we're also doing it because each and every one of you guys have a legacy, and I want you guys, when you leave this conference to take something with you, and when it gets tough out there, I want you to hold with you a word - it could be anything. For me, it's Charlie, but for you guys, it could be, I don't know, refocus. Family, children, future - something. Hold that word in your heart so that when you go back out into the world and you have someone screaming in your face, someone spitting in your face, someone flipping your table on campus, someone making fun of you because you're conservative, so I'm making fun of you because you love the Lord - say that word to yourself out loud or internally to refocus your brain and your heart and your soul. To know that you're about something so much bigger and greater. The legacy with Turning Point USA, yes, but also for yourself. And so Nikki, I want to ask you in closing, what is something that you want to leave as a legacy in this world for your family and for your baby, for everything? Nicki Minaj: Well, that it's, that it's okay to change your mind. It's okay to change your mind. You don't have to, you know, there's sometimes there's a lot of things projected on to you when you change your own mind, you know, they project fear, shame, on to people who don't think and do as they think and do, but I've traveled the world, I've performed at huge crowds all around the world. No matter how many songs I do on that stage, it didn't mean as much as this because this is a direct link for younger people. This is a direct link between young people and God. And there's been, there's been, there's been a lack of that. There's been a lack of that in our media, in our everyday conversation. People have been, you know, interestingly enough, people have been even persecuted - Christians have been being persecuted right here in our country in different ways. So when we talk about Nigeria and other countries, know that prior administrations saw nothing wrong with that, and that's what was wrong with that. I truly feel that there are people out there who felt good about chastising Christians right here in our country, and it's kind of really, really sick. We can't let people like that be in power. You guys. That's the truth. I can sugarcoat it and laugh and Kiki, but the truth is, I am here today to tell you guys that we absolutely cannot let people who have a problem with us worshiping God. We cannot have that in power. We cannot have them in power. All you have to do is look at what is happening in other places in the world. Look at what is being done to Christians all around the world, and ask yourself why people in this country that were in positions of power felt so comfortable to try to take our voices from us. They were that afraid. They are that intimidated. They are that insecure. They are that small inside that hearing us and seeing us worship God irritated them. Our spirit irritates them, because when we speak, they get shown up. When the truth walks in the room, the lies hide. They don't come out willingly. You got to pry it out of them. They hide because they don't want you or anyone to know who they really are behind closed doors, because even they know how evil it is to try to deprive people of worshiping God. Erika Kirk: Amen. We love you. Nicki Minaj! Nicki Minaj: Thank you guys! My darling, thank you for having me.","summary":"Nicki Minaj made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA&#039;s AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona on Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nicki-minaj-turning-point-usa-americafest-vance-trump-11251885","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2252438109.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:11:54","author":"Hollie Silverman,Peter Aitken","authors":["Hollie Silverman","Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.051},{"id":388018700,"title":"Justice Department restores Trump photo to public database of Epstein files","text":"p>New York: A photo of U.S. President Donald Trump that had been removed from the cache of Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Department of ​Justice was restored on Sunday after officials determined none of Epstein's victims were ‌in the image, the department said.The photo showing ⁠a desk with an ‌open drawer containing a photo of Trump with various women was flagged by the Southern District of New York for review to protect potential victims.\"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims ​are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction,\" the Justice Department said on X on Sunday.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said earlier ‌on Sunday his ‌office removed the photo because of concerns about women in the photo. “It has nothing to do with ⁠President Trump,” Blanche said during a Sunday morning appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\"The Justice Department released thousands of documents on Friday related to Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted ⁠sex offender who committed suicide in 2019.

Jamie Raskin Says Redactions In Epstein Files Are 'All About Covering Up'","text":"Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) argued that the redactions in the Epstein files released on Friday are nonsensical and most likely indicative of a cover-up.\n\n“If you read the statute, the only things that are allowed to be redacting are related to child sex abuse, physical abuse, ongoing investigations, which they say there are none, and national security. So how can you block out an entire document? It makes no sense,” Raskin told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on an episode of “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\n“And, remember, Trump opposed the legislation up until the very end, when he could read the writing on the wall. Then he said, ‘Oh, I’m for it,’” Raskin said, reasoning that Trump’s switch-up came after Trump’s followers decided that they would work to “obstruct the implementation of the legislation.”\n\nHundreds of Epstein files were released on Friday, but the Justice Department has removed at least 16 so far, CNN reported. The DOJ said online Saturday that it will continue reviewing and redacting the files, and, on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the purpose is to protect victims.\n\nHunt asked Raskin whether he believed some of the redactions actually served to protect victims, rather than to orchestrate a cover-up.\n\n“They have not shown any deference or respect for the victims at all, for the survivors of this nightmare. And it’s all about covering up things that, for whatever reason, Donald Trump doesn’t want to go public, either about himself, other members of his family, friends, Jeffrey Epstein, or just the social, business, cultural network that he was involved in for at least a decade, if not longer,” Raskin said.\n\nHunt followed up by asking Raskin about the Justice Department: “So do you think the actions that the Department of Justice are taking on in this are specifically designed to protect Donald Trump?”\n\n“I mean, that’s their whole business model. In fact, they’re trying to reorganize American constitutional jurisprudence and the rule of law around the idea that the entire executive branch serves one guy,” Raskin responded. “That’s the unitary executive theory, that this is all about serving whatever Donald Trump wants. So, yes, I can’t imagine what other interests they have in mind.”\n\nHunt also asked Raskin about a couple of next moves that some Dems have proposed, including suing the Justice Department or impeaching Attorney General Pam Bondi. \n\n“If it’s possible, we will be bringing litigation, but we’re trying to work that through right now,” he said in part, adding. “I think everything is on the table here, but people are coming up with solutions that require a majority in Congress.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jamie-raskin-epstein-trump-cover-up_n_69484c2ee4b0dd220fa0e1ce?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/694859cd2600003dcd8379ef.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:09:30","author":"Taiyler S.

During a recent rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina—held on Friday, 19 December 2025, at the Rocky Mount Event Center—the President left his audience in a state of bemused silence before veering into a highly personal anecdote. What began as a diatribe against the investigations into his conduct soon evolved into a bizarre, five-word tribute to his wife's meticulous habits regarding her undergarments.The moment occurred as Trump was recounting the 2022 FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate, a grievance that remains a central pillar of his public addresses. While discussing the alleged intrusion into his private life, he pivoted to the First Lady's dressing room.'I had these animals trying to attack me at Mar-a-Lago,' he told the crowd, before describing the moment agents allegedly entered Melania's closet. 'They looked at her drawers... and she's a very meticulous person,' he noted, adding that her garments were 'folded perfect, wrapped, so perfect.' Then came the line that sent social media into a frenzy: 'I think she steams them.'The Lingerie Detour: Why Donald Trump Pivoted From Prices To PantiesIt is a hallmark of the Trumpian style to interweave the profoundly serious with the surprisingly mundane. However, even by his standards, the detailed description of Melania's 'unmentionables'—which he explicitly referred to as 'panties' during the speech—raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.The remarks were particularly jarring given the event's primary focus on his 'affordability' agenda and recent inflation data showing a 2.7% rise in consumer prices. The transition was so abrupt that the North Carolina crowd, usually boisterous and reactive, reportedly fell into a 'dead silence' before a few awkward laughs broke the tension.Critics were quick to seize on the absurdity of the moment. On X, users questioned the appropriateness of discussing the First Lady's lingerie at a formal political event. 'The president of the United States talking about the First Lady's panties. South Park and Saturday Night Live, you don't even need to write the script on this one,' one user remarked.Others pointed out that while the President was meant to be discussing inflation and pharmaceutical negotiations, his mind seemed anchored in personal grievances and domestic details that felt out of place in a national affordability address. At one point, he even attempted to mime the act of meticulously folding laundry for the benefit of the cameras.A History Of 'Boy Talk': How Melania Handles The Donald Trump SpotlightMelania Trump has long been a master of the silent response, often remaining famously reserved while her husband navigates the fallout of his more controversial rhetorical flourishes. When she has chosen to speak, it has frequently been to offer a protective shield.This latest episode recalls her defence during the 2016 Access Hollywood tape scandal. At the time, she dismissed her husband's crude remarks as 'boy talk', suggesting he had been 'egged on' by his hosts to say 'dirty and bad stuff.'In a separate interview with Fox News years ago, she admitted such words were 'offensive to me, and they were inappropriate,' but famously concluded, 'This is not the man that I know.' Whether this latest departure into her private drawers will elicit a similar response remains to be seen.The First Lady did not travel to Rocky Mount for the rally, instead remaining in Florida to prepare for the family's upcoming Christmas holidays. As the 2025 campaign trail heats up, it is clear that for Donald Trump, no topic—no matter how private—is entirely off-limits when he is on the stump.As the 2025 campaign trail gathers pace, Donald Trump's penchant for the unpredictable continues to redefine political discourse. While his supporters remain focused on his economic promises, these idiosyncratic detours into private family life serve as a stark reminder of the unconventional path the President treads.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-confession-why-he-told-rally-crowd-melania-steams-her-underwear-1764459","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1762755/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=955f1bec1be990ee1218e4e24ac9e930","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:04:37","author":"Briane Nebria","authors":["Briane Nebria"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.159},{"id":388017034,"title":"Donald Trump Being Monitored for Dementia, Expert Says","text":"US President Donald Trump might be actively monitored for dementia, according to a psychologist who claims the president's own statements suggest a pattern of cognitive decline. The suggestion is the latest in the increasing concerns many have about the US leader's cognitive health.In an episode of The Daily Beast podcast, psychologist Dr John Gartner, a former professor at Johns Hopkins, suggested that Trump's claim of having passed three Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA) is a sign that he is being monitored for the progression of dementia, not just routinely screened. The White House has hit back furiously, branding Dr Gartner a 'deranged leftist' with 'zero credibility'.'You're Monitoring Dementia, Not Assessing It''You know, he kind of gave the game away again, as he often does,' said Dr Gartner. 'You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCa once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you're giving it to him three times, that means you're not assessing dementia. That means you're monitoring dementia.''Because if you keep feeling like, no, he's still got the symptoms, we've got to see how bad he's doing now, we've got to check again, see how bad he's doing now – I think they're giving him cognitive tests and MRIs every six months to monitor the progress of his dementia,' Dr. Gartner added.Trump underwent an MRI in October, six months after his physical in April. The White House said at the time that it was a preventative measure.Trump's Recent Speech Another Potential Sign of Mental DeclineDr Gartner also suggested that Trump's manner of speaking during his speech defending his administration may be a sign of 'hypomania.''We have to judge people against their own baseline, and if somebody doubles their rate of speed, that's a mental change status of some kind,' said the psychologist. 'I've always said that Trump is on the bipolar spectrum. He's not manic, he's hypomanic. \"Hypo\" is Greek for \"less than,\" so he's not fully manic.'When it came to why Trump was speaking quickly, Dr Gartner said that it may be because he is scared. Dr Gartner stated that Trump actually believes in what White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said, that he was 'losing the country' over several issues.'They'll never admit it, of course, and so this was his attempt to kind of make a comeback, and so the anxiety stimulated his hypomania, which then made him speak at this hypomanic pace that isn't even typical of him,' explained Dr Gartner.White House Insists Trump is in Good HealthThe White House criticised Dr. Gartner's comments, insisting that Trump is in good health. They also reiterated the statement released by the official White House physician Dr. Sean Barbabella stating that he is in good condition. Assistant Press Secretary Liz Huston said in a statement that Dr. Gartner was a 'deranged leftist' and that anyone who could defend former President Joe Biden's cognitive state is 'pathetic' and has 'zero credibility.''As the President's physician, Dr Sean Barbabella has made clear time and again–and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day–President Trump remains in excellent overall health,' said Huston.'President Trump's work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden's serious mental and physical decline from the American people,' Huston continued. 'Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans' trust in the media just fell to an all-time low.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-being-monitored-dementia-expert-says-1764656","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768901/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=2fa34b6dc67f043101329e898ba9736c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:04:03","author":"Denise Nequinto","authors":["Denise Nequinto"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":388008678,"title":"Nicki Minaj praises Donald Trump and Vance at conservative event in Arizona","text":"Rapper Nicki Minaj made a surprise appearance at a conservative gathering in Arizona on Sunday, where she praised US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, calling them “role models” for young men. Minaj appeared on stage at AmericaFest, an annual event organised by the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, which was held to honour the late activist Charlie Kirk. She was interviewed by Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, who now leads the organisation. During the discussion, Minaj spoke about her recent support for Trump, despite having criticised him in the past. She also referred to her public comments condemning violence against Christians in Nigeria. “This administration is full of people with heart and soul,” Minaj said. “Our vice president, he makes me… well, I love both of them.” Nicki Minaj speaks during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest 2025, Sunday, Dec. 21, 2025, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Jon Cherry) She added that Trump and Vance had an ability to connect with people, saying, “Both of them have a very uncanny ability to be someone that you relate to.” Minaj also mocked California Governor Gavin Newsom, using a nickname previously used by Trump. Newsom, a Democrat, is seen as a potential contender in the 2028 presidential race. There was an awkward moment when Minaj described Vance as an “assassin” while trying to praise his political skills. She quickly paused after realising the choice of words, as the audience reacted quietly. Charlie Kirk was assassinated in September. Erika Kirk played down the moment, saying, “If the internet wants to clip it, who cares? I love this woman.”Last month, Minaj shared a post by Trump on his social media platform Truth Social that spoke about possible sanctions on Nigeria over the persecution of Christians. Experts say the violence in Nigeria is complex and cannot be explained by one cause. “Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude,” Minaj later wrote on X. “We live in a country where we can freely worship God.” Didn’t have a clue. Carry on. https://t.co/k4D0d9ZXdt— Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) December 21, 2025 Following that post, she was invited to speak at a panel at the US mission to the United Nations alongside Ambassador Mike Waltz and religious leaders. At the Arizona event, Minaj said she was tired of being “pushed around” and argued that expressing different views had become controversial. “People are no longer using their minds,” she said. Erika Kirk thanked Minaj for what she called her courage, despite criticism from parts of the entertainment industry.

Minaj, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago, is known for hits including Anaconda, Starships and Super Freaky Girl. She has received 12 Grammy nominations. In 2018, Minaj was among several celebrities who criticised Trump’s immigration policy that separated thousands of children from their families at the US-Mexico border. At the time, she described herself as an “illegal immigrant” after arriving in the US at the age of five. “This is so scary to me,” she wrote then. “Can you try to imagine the terror these kids feel right now?”On Sunday, Minaj addressed her change in position, saying, “It’s OK to change your mind.”","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/nicki-minaj-praises-donald-trump-and-vance-at-conservative-event-in-arizona-10432253/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/12/US-2-26.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:02:51","author":"Express Web Desk","authors":["Express Web Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.19},{"id":388012562,"title":"What Do the Stranger Things Actors Do When They're Not Filming?","text":"The young cast of Stranger Things lead very busy lives and careers outside of the Netflix show.\nWith Stranger Things coming to an end, Joe Keery, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown and their costars have already started lining up professional pivots.\nBrown is balancing her career as one of Netflix’s in-demand movie stars with raising her newborn daughter on her Georgia farm, while Sadie Sink and Gaten Matarazzo have established themselves as breakthrough stage actors on Broadway and beyond.\nMeanwhile, Wolfhard and Keery have both developed passionate fanbases in the world of music through their work with The Aubreys and Post Animal, respectively.\nKeep scrolling for more about what the cast of Stranger Things do away from the set.\nFinn Wolfhard\nDuring Stranger Things’ early seasons, Finn Wolfhard split his time between playing Mike Wheeler on the Netflix show and serving as the vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Vancouver rock band, Calpurnia.

At all.”\nGaten Matarazzo\nAs one of his first major ventures outside of playing Dustin Henderson on Stranger Things, Gaten Matarazzo executive produced the Netflix hidden camera, horror-themed prank show, Prank Encounters.\nThe show caused controversy before it was even released because its premise revolved around strangers being pranked on their first day of a new job. According to Netflix’s press release, two contestants’ day started as “business as usual until their paths collide[d] and these part-time jobs turn[ed] into full-time nightmares.”\nPrank Encounters faced a backlash via social media for potentially being insensitive to job seekers — though Netflix insisted that every participant was paid for their time and enjoyed the experience.\n“The pranks in Prank Encounters are spooky, supernatural and over the top, and everyone had a great time,” a Netflix spokesperson told Time Magazine in June 2019. “All participants came in with the expectation this was a one-day, hourly gig and everyone got paid for their time.”\nPrank Encounters aired two seasons on Netflix.\nSince wrapping up the Netflix prank show, Matarazzo has starred on stage in the Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, in addition to making limited appearances in Into the Woods and Dear Evan Hansen.\nHe has been in a relationship with actress Elizabeth Yu since 2018.\nCaleb McLaughlin\nAside from his starring roles in the movies Concrete Cowboy and The Book of Clarence, Caleb McLaughlin carved out a niche as a voice actor on animated projects like Summer Camp Island and The Boys Presents: Diabolical.\nMcLaughlin — who plays Lucas Sinclair on Stranger Things — spoke to Rolling Loud in June 2025 about the differences between his live action and voice acting work.\n“Every word, your tone, your question, statement, had to be represented [with live acting]. They had to be expressed,” he explained. “Animation kind of helps that, you’re seeing the visual.”\nMcLaughlin has become a regular on the convention circuit after overcoming early instances of racism during fan encounters.\n“My very first Comic-Con, some people didn't stand in my line because I was Black... Sometimes overseas you feel the racism, you feel the bigotry,” he told fans at the Heroes Comic Con Belgium convention in 2023. “Sometimes it's hard to talk about and for people to understand, but when I was younger it definitely affected me a lot.”\nNatalia Dyer\nAfter studying at New York University, Natalia Dyer branched out from playing Nancy Wheeler in Stranger Things with several unique projects.\nShe narrated the personal letters of U.S. Air Force veteran Reality Winner in a 2021 documentary. The Wim Wenders-produced film Reality Winner examined Winner’s 2018 conviction for leaking classified documents to the media.\nDyer appeared in the 2023 horror movie All Fun and Games and the acclaimed black comedy Velvet Buzzsaw. She had a recurring role in the first season of Kaley Cuoco’s Peacock dark comedy thriller series Based on a True Story.\nAway from the screens, Dyer has been in a long-term relationship with her Stranger Things costar Charlie Heaton, who plays her onscreen love interest Jonathan Byers, since 2016.\n“It's an interesting thing to work with somebody who you go home with. It's always really fun,” she told Refinery29 in 2019. “We're really comfortable with each other. So we can play and feel more free, and we can talk about it before.\"\nCharlie Heaton\nPrior to landing the role of Jonathan Byers in Stranger Things, Charlie Heaton got his start in the London music scene with the bands Comanechi and Half Loon.\nHeaton parlayed his Stranger Things success into a leading role in the Marvel Comics film adaptation of The New Mutants, playing Cannonball. He has since starred in the Cannes Film Festival hit The Souvenir Part II and joined the cast of HBO’s financial drama series Industry.\nThe actor has dated his Stranger Things costar Natalia Dyer since 2016. Speaking to Wonderland magazine in November 2025, he said that sharing his life and work with Dyer has been “precious.”\n“It’s been a gift to work with my best friend,” he said. “To be able to have a shared experience with your partner about the anxiety when you don’t get a job – I know what that feels like, she knows what that feels like.”\nHeaton continued, “You can be there to talk about it, or when you have a s*** day at work, or come away from a scene and you didn’t think it worked. To be able to both understand each other on that level is great.”\nNoah Schnapp\nNoah Schnapp — who plays Will Byers — established himself as an entrepreneur outside of the Stranger Things set.\nHe worked with Elena Guberman and Ba Minuzzi to launch the sustainable snacking company To Be Honest (TBH) in 2021. He has since partnered with IHOP to launch their delivery-only chicken tender brand, TenderFix.\nSchnapp enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business in February 2022 to major in entrepreneurship and innovation. Notable alumni from Wharton include Elon Musk, Donald Trump and Dr. Mehmet Oz.\nIn November 2025, Schnapp told The Hollywood Reporter that it was always “a priority” for him to get a college education.\n“I always grew up valuing that path. And it was never really a question whether I would go to college or not, just more of what I would study,” he said. “I knew I wanted to be an actor, but I wasn’t rushing it. I wanted to have my childhood and get all those experiences first before rushing into everything and losing the sense of normal life. So I had to put some projects on the side burner to prioritize school.”\nHe went on, “But now it’s interesting because I’m graduating in a few months at the same time the finale is coming out. So all these chapters of my childhood are closing, and now I’m stepping into a brand new world of anything can happen. It’s equally terrifying and exciting.”\nSchnapp came out as gay in January 2023.\nSadie Sink joined the Stranger Things cast in season 2 as Eleven’s friend Max Mayfield. The Texas native has since starred in the Oscar-winning drama The Whale and has a mysterious role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s 2026 blockbuster Spider-Man: Brand New Day.\nHaving made her Broadway debut at age 10 in the 2012 production of Annie, she later appeared in John Proctor Is the Villain. Sink will make her West End debut in 2026 opposite Noah Jupe in Romeo & Juliet at the historic Harold Pinter Theatre.\nTaylor Swift handpicked Sink to depict an age-gap romance with Teen Wolf’s Dylan O'Brien in the short film for 2021’s “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version).” The film has amassed more than 109 million views on YouTube alone.\nDuring a 2025 interview with Teen Vogue, Sink explained why she prefers not to discuss her dating life in public.\n“I think the more private I am, also, the more believable the roles can be,” she said. “I don't want anyone to know anything about me in my personal life or know too much about who I am just as Sadie, because I think the louder that gets, the quieter the impact of your characters can be.”\nJoe Keery’s debut as Steve Harrington in Stranger Things came just a year after he joined the Chicago-based psychedelic rock band Post Animal in 2014. He served as drummer, guitarist and vocalist for the group prior to leaving Post Animal in 2018 — though he later rejoined the band in 2025.\nHe embarked on a solo career under the name Djo, releasing his debut solo album, Twenty Twenty, in 2019. In 2025, he headlined the Back on You World Tour, where Post Animal actually opened up for Djo.\nChatting to The Guardian about his 2025 album, The Crux, Keery said he was aware his music would face extra scrutiny because of his Stranger Things fame.\n“You kind of can’t really let it get you down, I guess, or affect what you’re doing too much, to be honest with you,” he said.\nKeery dated It Follows and Longlegs actress Maika Monroe from 2017 to 2023. He opened up about how their split impacted his work on the FX series Fargo in a 2024 interview with Variety.\n“I had also gone through a big breakup, right as I was leaving Rome, so I was really isolated and focused on my work,” he said. “My social life pretty much revolved around the show; my work life revolved around the show. We weren’t really leaving due to COVID-19.”\nKeery added that he “started working out a bunch and changed my diet a little bit” as a way to turn the page on his past relationship.\n“I’ve never really done that for a job. I didn’t realize it at the time, but I think it kind of informed me physically … I had a very simple lifestyle, and I was cooking for myself,” he explained.\nMaya Hawke was practically born into the entertainment industry as the daughter of Hollywood legends Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. She made her screen acting debut on the BBC’s 2017 adaptation of Little Women and was next cast as Robin Buckley in Stranger Things season 3.\nFollowing her success on Stranger Things, Maya continued to land notable parts as a Manson Family member in director Quentin Tarantino’s Oscar-winning 2019 comedy Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and joined filmmaker Wes Anderson’s 2023 comedy Asteroid City alongside Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks and Margot Robbie.\nMaya has acted opposite both of her famous parents — appearing with her mom, Uma, in 2023’s comedy thriller The Kill Room and headlining her dad Ethan’s directorial effort Wildcat that same year.\nShe told People in 2021 that she was appreciative of her family opening doors for her career.\n\"I'm very grateful for the fact that [my parents] made it so easy for me to do the thing that I love,\" Maya said. \"I think I'll get a couple chances on their name and then if I suck, I'll get kicked out of the kingdom. And that's what should happen. So I'm just going to try not to suck.\"\nMaya released three albums and a 2024 EP as a solo music artist.\nMaya has reportedly been dating musician Christian Lee Hutson since 2023. Hutson contributed to Maya’s third studio album, Chaos Angel, in 2024.\nPriah Ferguson\nPriah Ferguson had roles in Atlanta and Mercy Street before her casting as Lucas Sinclair’s younger sister, Erica, in Stranger Things season 2.\nShe has lent her voice to Disney’s animated show Hamster & Gretel and Netflix’s My Dad the Bounty Hunter.\nFerguson told Teen Vogue in November 2025 that she hoped to venture beyond acting once Stranger Things concluded.\n“Outside of the craft, I'm really into beauty and cosmetic marketing and science, and I hope to have my own skin care brand one day,” she explained. “I was going to school for cosmetic science to learn the science behind perfume-making so I don't just slap my name onto something; I [want to] actually know the science behind it.”","url":"https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/what-do-the-stranger-things-actors-do-when-theyre-not-filming/","image":"https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/What-Do-the-Stranger-Things-Actors-Do-When-They-re-Not-Filming-TCDSTTH_ZX093.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:00:20","author":"Justin Harp","authors":["Justin Harp"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.552},{"id":388007600,"title":"Brian May confirms Queen will release a previously unheard track for Christmas - 51 years after cutting it from their second album","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Dec 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBondi Beach massacre dad unmasked at last in final photograph before the deadly attack - as fresh new details are revealed about his trips to India with terror suspect son Naveed\n\nThe Wire star James Ransone dies by suicide at 46 in Los Angeles\n\nPrincess Beatrice 'snubs her disgraced father and is spending Christmas FAR away from him... and Fergie'\n\nI lost 4 stone on Mounjaro and went from a size 18 to an 8.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:00:00 GMT, 22 December 2025 |Updated:00:00 GMT, 22 December 2025 \n\nQueen fans are in line for an early Christmas present after Brian May announced plans to release a previously unheard track from the band, originally recorded more than half a century ago.\nMay will host a Christmas special for digital radio station Planet Rock from 6:00pm on December 22, during which fans will be given their first opportunity to hear unreleased Queen track Not For Sale. \nThe song, written by May, was originally recorded in 1974 during sessions for the band's second studio album, Queen II, but failed to make the final track-listing.\nIt has since been remastered and will feature on a re-release of the album in 2026, but not before fans get an early Christmas preview, exclusively on Planet Rock. \n‘People might possibly have heard a bootleg version of Not for Sale (Polar Bear) by Smile, it’s a song that goes back a very long way, but to my knowledge no one has ever heard this version,' said May. \n'It’s a work in progress and will appear on the forthcoming rebuild of the Queen II album - coming next year – but I’m sneaking this into my Planet Rock special because I’m fascinated to know what people think about it. \n\nBrian May will debut a previously unheard track from the band, originally recorded more than half a century ago, when he hosts a special Planet Rock show on December 22\n\nThe song, written by May, was originally recorded in 1974 during sessions for the band's second studio album, Queen II, but failed to make the final track-listing (pictured in 1977)\n'I hope people have a wonderful Christmas and a great New Year!’ \nQueen released fifteen studio albums over a 23 year recording career, their last coming three years after lead singer Freddie Mercury's death to AIDS, aged just 45, in 1991. \nMade In Heaven, released in 1995, featured vocal arrangements and piano parts recorded by Mercury over a period of years before his death. \nEarlier this year, May revealed the band had returned to the studio with Adam Lambert, their touring singer since 2014. \nDespite releasing two live albums together, Queen have yet to put out new original music with Lambert, who found fame as a contestant on US talent show American Idol, as their front-man. \nMay's festive show, which is repeated on Christmas Day, will include his personal festive jukebox, with the veteran guitarist sharing a hand‑picked selection of his favourite Christmas and seasonal tracks.\nAlong the way he will reflects on the music that has soundtracked his own Christmases over the years, while offering warm stories, memories and insights from his colourful life and career. \nHis jukebox will include songs from the likes of Bad News, Slade, Chuck Berry and The Crystals, as well as a surprise Christmas hit for his wife, the former EastEnders actress Anita Dobson.\n\nQueen released fifteen studio albums over a 23 year recording career, their last coming three years after lead singer Freddie Mercury's death to AIDS, aged just 45, in 1991\n\nQueen perform Killer Queen on Dutch TV show Top Pop in 1974, the same year they released their second studio album, Queen II\nMay has suffered a series of health scares over recent years, including a heart attack in 2020 and a recent stroke that left him unable to use his left arm. \nConfirming his stroke in September, the legendary musician told Instagram followers: 'I'm here to bring you some good news - the good news is that I can play guitar after the events of the last few days.\n'I say this because it was in some doubt because that little health hiccup that I mentioned happened about a week ago and what they called it was a minor stroke.'\nMay revealed the incident left him temporarily unable to use his left arm and he had a 'very exciting' emergency ambulance journey to Frimley Hospital in Surrey.\n'All of a sudden, out of the blue, I didn't have any control over this arm, so it was a little scary, I have to say,' he continued.\n'I didn't want to say anything at the time because I didn't want anything surrounding, you know. I really don't want sympathy.'\nHe added: 'Please don't do that because it'll clutter up my inbox and I hate that.'\nBrian MayFreddie Mercury\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrian May confirms Queen will release a previously unheard track for Christmas - 51 years after cutting it from their second album\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

New polling offers a revealing snapshot of how Americans are closing out 2025 and what kind of mood they’re carrying into 2026.\n\nThe toplines are not encouraging.\n\nA new survey from YouGov asked Americans to assess this past year both personally and nationally, and what emerges is a country that feels worn down, uneasy, and distinctly unconfident about what comes next.\n\nLet’s start with the personal assessments. Just 9% of Americans said 2025 was “great” for them, and 29% called it “good.” The largest share—37%—landed in the middle, describing the year as being only “OK.” But the distribution’s darker edge was hard to ignore: 15% said the year was “bad,” and another 10% called it “terrible.” \n\nIn other words, roughly 1 in 4 Americans said their experience of 2025 was actively negative.\n\nIf Americans’ personal experience of the year is lukewarm at best, they’re even more downbeat about the country’s performance in 2025. Only 24% rated the year as “good” or “great” for the United States. Another 24% called it just “OK.” But nearly half—48%—said the year was “bad” or “terrible” for the country as a whole.\n\nThat dissatisfaction shows up clearly when Americans were asked to rate how things are going nationally on a 1-to-10 scale. Forty-seven percent placed their answer between one and four. But just 30% gave the year an seven or higher.\n\nOther polling points in the same direction. The latest Economist/YouGov survey found that 56% of Americans said the country was “off on the wrong track,” compared with just 35% who said it was headed in the right direction.\n\nOptimism, in other words, is in short supply.\n\n“It’s not surprising that, overall, the results indicate the level of ambivalence and negativity that they do,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, told Daily Kos. “The country has been in deep, polarized political and social conflict, and that usually doesn’t feel like a good thing to most people.”\n\nReeher cautioned against reading these kinds of questions too literally, though. Assessments of “how the year was” often act as proxies for a tangle of other forces: personal psychology, financial stress, perceptions of national decline, and what social scientists call expressive bias.\n\n“There’s so much noise in these kinds of questions,” he said. “Respondents are often signaling something else that they want others to know about them,” adding that, in this case, that could be views about the president himself or about politics more generally. \n\n“It’s simply impossible to unwind all these threads,” Reeher said.\n\nStill, the broader gloom didn’t materialize out of thin air. Polling throughout the second half of 2025 has shown rising economic anxiety—particularly around the holidays—alongside sagging approval ratings for President Donald Trump. Those pressures appear to be shaping how people look back on the year, even if they don’t fully explain it.\n\nAt the same time, Reeher is quick to note that pessimism about the future long predates Trump.\n\n“The polarization we are experiencing is not new or a product of Trump, and neither is the pessimism about the future,” he said. “That’s been a growing feature since the mid-2000s, with some temporary exceptions.”\n\nEven so, the political undercurrent in the YouGov data is unmistakable. Forty-three percent of Americans describe 2025 as “one of the worst” years in American history. Some of that is almost certainly recency bias, or overemphasizing the effects of recent events. But the willingness to apply such language to the year is striking.\n\nNotably, YouGov didn’t ask respondents why they felt this way. But the answers to questions about New Year’s resolutions offer some clues. The most common goals were modest and familiar: exercising more (25%), being happy (23%), eating healthier (22%), and saving money (21%).\n\nMore forward-looking ambitions were far less common. Just 9% said they planned to pursue a career goal in 2026, and only 12% hoped to pay down debt. Even saving money—named by 21% of Americans—comes across less as optimism than as self-protection, a reflection of how many households are still feeling financially boxed in.\n\nLooking ahead provides little reassurance about the country’s trajectory. \n\nWhile 48% of Americans believed 2026 would be good or great for them personally, only 31% said it would be great for the country. Worse, 27% predicted it would be one of the worst years in American history.\n\nThose are dramatic numbers, but they likely reflect generalized pessimism rather than a literal comparison to historical calamities. The question asked about “one of the best years,” not whether the country would improve. Still, the pattern is clear: Far more Americans expect trouble for the country than for themselves.\n\nIt’s a familiar dynamic in polling. People often believe they’ll manage personally—even as they conclude that the broader system is failing.\n\nSo how seriously should we take these responses? Reeher urged some caution in reading too much into polls like YouGov’s.\n\n“Those who are saying the past year has been great are probably trying to signal that they support the president,” he said. “Those who are saying that the past year has been one of the worst are probably trying to tell the surveyor that they really, really don’t like the president. The people more in the political middle are probably reacting to all the conflict and political chaos, and are either ambivalent or negative.”\n\nThat doesn’t make the data meaningless. But it does limit how much can be drawn from it.\n\nAt best, polls like this offer a reading of national mood—an emotional barometer rather than a precise diagnosis. Anyone trying to extract more than that does so at their own peril, politically or otherwise.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Daily Kos has reported extensively on the cracks forming in Trump’s coalition—first among Latinos, then young voters. Now, new data from NBC News Decision Desk and SurveyMonkey confirms the trend. The largest declines in strong support since April are among Republicans overall, particularly those who identify with Trump’s MAGA movement. MAGA Republicans continue to widely approve of Trump, with 70% saying they strongly approve of him, but that represents an 8-percentage-point drop from earlier this year. Meanwhile, fewer Republicans report being part of the MAGA movement compared with earlier in 2025, highlighting early signs of fraying in Trump’s base.\n\n Americans remain deeply ambivalent about the rapid spread of artificial intelligence, even as they’re increasingly using it on the job. Gallup reports that the share of U.S. employees using AI at least a few times a year increased from 40% to 45% between the second and third quarters of 2025. Frequent use also increased from 19% to 23%. So, while Americans may not love AI, more of them are learning to live with it.\n\nIt’s easy enough to freeze up over holiday gifts, especially with people you don’t see often. Wanting to give something that signals your thought and care doesn’t always come with the clarity about what that something should be.\n\nNew polling from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research offers some reassurance. Nearly 9 in 10 say it’s acceptable to give cash (88%) or gift cards (87%). Even regifting or giving secondhand items—long treated as a social faux pas—now clears the bar for a solid majority: 64% say it’s fine.\n\nAge, unsurprisingly, shapes those views. Adults ages 18 to 45 are significantly more open to secondhand gifts than those 45 and older (73% vs. 58%), reflecting the growing normalization of thrift and resale culture. The flip side is that enthusiasm for cash and gift cards declines with age, suggesting older Americans still place more weight on presentation—or at least pretense.\n\nThe poll looks beyond presents as well, examining how people are spending the holidays. Nearly half of adults (44%) plan to be in bed before midnight on New Year’s Eve—an understated way to close out a year many seem ready to move on from.\n\nStill, signs of seasonal enthusiasm remain. About a third of Americans say they’ve worn or plan to wear a holiday sweater or accessories this month. And 30% are getting into the spirit by buying gifts for their pets—present company included. This year, we got our shelter pooch a DNA test, and I’m really excited to learn more about him.\n\nAs for Christmas Day itself, traditions vary. Nearly a quarter of Americans (24%) say they’ll watch sports, while 5% plan to head to a movie theater.\n\nPlease sound off in the comments and tell us how you’re spending the holidays. Are you keeping things low-key? Sticking to old traditions? Spoiling your pets? However you’re marking the season, we want to hear it—and happy holidays!","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics or culture.\n\n\n\n\nWith the winter holidays approaching—and with this marking the last formal edition of Survey Says for the year—it’s a natural moment to take stock.

Within months, the investigation was dropped. By August, Crypto.com announced it was investing roughly $1 billion in assets in a venture with the Trump Media and Technology Group.\n\nLegal and ethics experts say Crypto.com's journey is a case study on the conflicts of interest that have arisen in Trump's second presidency. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has allowed his family businesses to enter lucrative arrangements with companies regulated by the federal government, some of which have benefited from action taken by his administration.\n\nIn this instance, the deal struck with Crypto.com favored the president's social media company, which has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since its 2021 launch. Trump Media and Technology Group put up little cash yet received a substantial ownership stake in the new treasury for Crypto.com's Cronos token.\n\nPresidents have historically gone to great lengths to \"avoid even the appearance that they are using the office for personal profit,\" said Kedric Payne, who was formerly a top attorney for the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nCalling the government a \"pay-to-play administration,\" Payne, who leads the ethics program at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington, said there was a clear perception that, in order to obtain favorable policies and actions from the administration, a company needed to provide a financial benefit to the president.\n\nHowever, Crypto.com spokeswoman Victoria Davis disagreed with legal and ethics experts.\n\n\"Crypto.com looks to partner with companies that are pro crypto and share our vision for its future,\" said Davis, who called Trump Media \"a pioneer in digital media.\"\n\nTrump Media, while refusing to respond to specific questions about the arrangement, stated briefly that the story seemed to have been spoon-fed to The Associated Press by political operatives.\n\nThe White House also said that Trump had avoided any conflicts of interest by placing his business holdings in a trust controlled by his sons after the election.\n\n\"Neither the President nor his family has ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, which has yet to be finalized, Crypto.com would contribute the lion's share of the capital, committing about $1 billion worth of its Cronos token to the venture.\n\nYorkville Advisors, a financial services firm with close ties to Trump Media, would provide a line of credit.

US officials said the ship refused to submit to boarding and continued sailing, prompting what one official described as an \"active pursuit.\"\n\nThe escalating seizures are part of Trump's broader pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, which has included a significant US military buildup in the region and dozens of US strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats since September.\n\nVenezuela has denounced the actions as piracy and warned that the seizures amount to economic warfare aimed at strangling its oil-dependent economy. Caracas has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain control of the country's vast oil reserves.\n\nRussia and China have both warned that the growing US military activity risks triggering wider instability, urging restraint and respect for international law.","url":"https://www.barbadosnews.net/news/278768163/us-tries-to-raid-third-oil-tanker-near-venezuela-media","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/46bacf2/e889fd82-05dd-465f-9baf-721c9bbf7fa5/0/MTdhZDYwMDMtMmM-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":388014880,"title":"Experts question ethics of deal between Trump Media and crypto firm","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C.: A cryptocurrency company that had been investigated for more than a year by the Joe Biden administration is now working with a new partner — Trump's social media company.\n\nFor more than a year during the previous administration, financial regulators had told Crypto.com that enforcement action was likely, as part of an aggressive push to regulate the largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry.\n\nCome November 2024, following Donald Trump's election victory, the company's legal problems disappeared.\n\nCrypto.com donated US$11 million to political committees tied to the Republican president, records show.

Caracas has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain control of the country's vast oil reserves.\n\nRussia and China have both warned that the growing US military activity risks triggering wider instability, urging restraint and respect for international law.","url":"https://www.argentinanews.net/news/278768163/us-tries-to-raid-third-oil-tanker-near-venezuela-media","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/46bacf2/e889fd82-05dd-465f-9baf-721c9bbf7fa5/0/MTdhZDYwMDMtMmM-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ar","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":388013708,"title":"Experts question ethics of deal between Trump Media and crypto firm","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C.: A cryptocurrency company that had been investigated for more than a year by the Joe Biden administration is now working with a new partner — Trump's social media company.\n\nFor more than a year during the previous administration, financial regulators had told Crypto.com that enforcement action was likely, as part of an aggressive push to regulate the largely unregulated cryptocurrency industry.\n\nCome November 2024, following Donald Trump's election victory, the company's legal problems disappeared.\n\nCrypto.com donated US$11 million to political committees tied to the Republican president, records show. Within months, the investigation was dropped. By August, Crypto.com announced it was investing roughly $1 billion in assets in a venture with the Trump Media and Technology Group.\n\nLegal and ethics experts say Crypto.com's journey is a case study on the conflicts of interest that have arisen in Trump's second presidency. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has allowed his family businesses to enter lucrative arrangements with companies regulated by the federal government, some of which have benefited from action taken by his administration.\n\nIn this instance, the deal struck with Crypto.com favored the president's social media company, which has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since its 2021 launch. Trump Media and Technology Group put up little cash yet received a substantial ownership stake in the new treasury for Crypto.com's Cronos token.\n\nPresidents have historically gone to great lengths to \"avoid even the appearance that they are using the office for personal profit,\" said Kedric Payne, who was formerly a top attorney for the Office of Congressional Ethics.\n\nCalling the government a \"pay-to-play administration,\" Payne, who leads the ethics program at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center in Washington, said there was a clear perception that, in order to obtain favorable policies and actions from the administration, a company needed to provide a financial benefit to the president.\n\nHowever, Crypto.com spokeswoman Victoria Davis disagreed with legal and ethics experts.\n\n\"Crypto.com looks to partner with companies that are pro crypto and share our vision for its future,\" said Davis, who called Trump Media \"a pioneer in digital media.\"\n\nTrump Media, while refusing to respond to specific questions about the arrangement, stated briefly that the story seemed to have been spoon-fed to The Associated Press by political operatives.\n\nThe White House also said that Trump had avoided any conflicts of interest by placing his business holdings in a trust controlled by his sons after the election.\n\n\"Neither the President nor his family has ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, which has yet to be finalized, Crypto.com would contribute the lion's share of the capital, committing about $1 billion worth of its Cronos token to the venture.\n\nYorkville Advisors, a financial services firm with close ties to Trump Media, would provide a line of credit. Trump Media's contribution would be more limited and would include \"a license to use certain intellectual property,\" according to an SEC filing.\n\nA company press release said all three firms would hold \"majority ownership\" in the new venture, though the size of Trump Media's stake has not been disclosed.\n\nCorey Frayer, a cryptocurrency policy expert and a senior official at the SEC during Biden's presidency, said that it looks more like a plea deal than a business deal.","url":"https://www.shanghainews.net/news/278762512/experts-question-ethics-of-deal-between-trump-media-and-crypto-firm","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/c046626/2d774e37-47de-4abd-bdd5-e4fdb339fc73/1/6-President-Donald-Trump-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":388012494,"title":"16 Epstein files removed from US Department of Justice website","text":"At least 16 files released in the batch of Jeffrey Epstein documents by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) appear to have been removed from the website, as of Sunday morning (local time), reported ANI, quoting CNN.\n\nCNN had reported on Saturday that one of the files removed included a photograph of US President Donald Trump.\n\nAmong other files that appear to have been removed, the majority depicted explicit artwork, showed mail slots filled with envelopes, a tiled hallway, and a notebook page with names and apartment numbers.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Department of Justice clarified that the recently released Jeffrey Epstein-related documents are being redacted solely to protect victims, and no politicians' names are being withheld.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated, \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law -- full stop. Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"\n\n\"The Justice Department is not redacting the names of any politicians. As Todd Blanche made clear: 'The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law -- full stop.

His allies have previously confirmed that his name appears in the files about Epstein.","url":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/worldwide/46896/16-Epstein-files-removed-from-US-Department-of-Justice-website","image":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/facebook-adhikar.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.445}]}
