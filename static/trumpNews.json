At a follow-up meeting in London on Wednesday – which was downgraded at the last minute after Zelensky publicly rejected key US suggestions – Ukrainian officials and their NATO European counterparts reportedly tabled a counterproposal.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Friday, Zelensky insisted that any future peace arrangement with Moscow must be backed by sustained US military, financial and political support.\n\n“Discussions in London have focused on security guarantees from the United States. We hope them to be at least as robust as those provided to Israel. Additionally, we anticipate support from our European partners and are actively developing the infrastructure necessary for these guarantees,” Zelensky said.\n\nDeliberations about an “Israeli model” of support for Ukraine first emerged during the presidency of Joe Biden, when Western officials began to acknowledge that Kiev was unlikely to be granted NATO membership. In lieu of collective security guarantees, they sought ways to at least ensure a long-term, uninterrupted flow of Western arms.\n\nZelensky’s comments come amid increasing friction with Washington, as Trump pushes Kiev to accept what media outlets have described as his “final offer” to end the conflict. Reports indicate that Washington’s framework includes freezing the conflict along current front lines and recognizing Crimea as Russian territory – a condition Zelensky has firmly rejected.\n\nTrump stated that “Crimea will stay with Russia” in an interview with Time Magazine on Friday. He argued that Kiev would never have enough weapons or manpower to retake the peninsula, which “was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired.” Crimea officially joined the Russian Federation in 2014 after a referendum held following a Western-backed coup in Kiev.\n\n“Our position is unchanged,” Zelensky reiterated on Friday, despite acknowledging Kiev’s dependence on continued American support.\n\nTrump and other senior US officials have warned that if progress is not made soon, Washington may reconsider its role as a mediator and shift its focus to other global priorities. According to reports, Ukrainian officials are already bracing for the possibility of reduced American support should negotiations collapse.\n\nMoscow has consistently expressed willingness to engage in negotiations, conveying its gratitude for Trump’s peace initiatives. However, the Russian leadership has repeatedly stressed that it seeks a lasting solution to the crisis, saying a temporary halt in the hostilities would simply allow Ukraine’s Western backers to rearm its military. Any peace deal must acknowledge the territorial reality and address the root causes of the conflict, including Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, Russia has insisted.","summary":"Kiev expects Washington to provide long-term security assistance modeled on the US relationship with Israel, Vladimir Zelensky has claimed \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/616340-zelensky-israel-us-support/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/680c2c122030271f4a53dd49.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:49:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":314910212,"title":"Trump’s flouting of the law is piling up","text":"A brief selection, here, of revelations from the week.\n\nThe White House has no intention of returning a man who was confirmed, by the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court, to have been wrongly deported. Indeed, Trump officials are openly revelling in their defiance of court orders.\n\nFederal agents have admitted they did not bother to obtain a warrant before they detained Mahmoud Khalil, the student protester accused of being pro-Hamas, and another target of attempted deportation.\n\nWhen asked to provide proof of life for a gay asylum seeker it sent to that hellish jail in El Salvador, which was designed to house terrorists and gangsters, without any due process, on the basis of a tattoo which appears to be completely innocuous, the administration declined. No one has seen or heard from the guy in over a month.\n\nWe could keep going. The point is, this second Trump administration is proudly lawless. Proudly. That’s the key. Most US governments manage to violate the law at some point, in sometimes outrageous ways, but few do it so deliberately, or with such a smug, knowing smirk on their face.\n\nSo it’s not the immigration policies themselves that feel most unsettling, but rather the Trump officials’ collective attitude. It’s not the cruelty, so much as the undeniable impression you get that the folks in charge are very much enjoying that cruelty.\n\nIt crosses the line between bad policy, implemented incompetently, and malicious policy whose intent is to harm people.\n\nThat the targets of this behaviour are mostly unsympathetic is part of the design. Mr Khalil has some pretty damn objectionable views. Some of those sent to El Salvador are, presumably, genuine gang members – the administration surely can’t have been so incompetent as to only deport people who were innocent.\n\nWe’ve had a fair few days now of the White House trying to incinerate the reputation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the guy who was deported due to an apparent “administrative error” in defiance of a court order forbidding the government from sending him to El Salvador.\n\nDonald Trump shared a photo of tattoos on Mr Garcia’s left hand which he claimed – baselessly, as far as fact checkers can tell – proved the guy was a member of the gang MS-13. And the White House highlighted domestic violence allegations in his past.\n\nAll irrelevant. All immaterial to the question of whether or not the US government can detain someone, deport them to a foreign jail without judicial review, and then claim impotence when ordered to return them.\n\nDue process and the rule of law are not just for the obviously innocent, they apply to everyone. Even mass murderers benefit from them. As well they should, because the alternative is a system in which whatever the government claims, whether actually substantiated by evidence or not, is uncontestable.\n\nThat is the salient issue, and most of what we’ve heard from the administration since it sent those planes loaded with migrants to El Salvador has been shameless misdirection.\n\nMr Trump and co. want to point at critics of the deportations and shout, “Look! Our opponents are on the side of violent gangsters, while we are protecting Americans!” which I am sure has more than a little cynical, political merit. Their opponents’ actual position is, “If these people are gangsters, offer up proof and deport them the legal way.”\n\nThat is not pro-criminal, or even necessarily pro-immigrant. It is pro-law. And it’s pro-American. If you admire what that country professes to stand for, you should not be thrilled about its government behaving in ways that resemble tinpot authoritarianism.\n\nThe remorseleness with which the Trump administration is breezing past that whole debate is as troubling as anything else it has done since the President took office. It won’t hurt the rest of the world like, say, the tariffs, or Mr Trump’s favourable treatment of Russia.\n\nBut it gives us a more revealing insight into the character of the people in charge of the world’s most powerful country, and yes, that probably should matter to us.\n\nThe lawlessness is not limited to immigration policy.\n\nMr Trump has sought to seize powers that belong to Congress, an entirely different branch of the US government.\n\nHe tried to up-end the global trade system unilaterally, with the stroke of a pen, before a market freakout restrained him.\n\nHe has violated trade agreements he himself negotiated and signed.\n\nHe has issued orders directing the Department of Justice to target his political critics.\n\nHe has responded to unfavourable court judgments with intense personal attacks on judges – even those who are lifelong conservatives, and yes, even those he personally appointed.\n\nAll of this stuff adds up.to what should be seen, both in the US and abroad, as a bright red flashing alarm, because it suggests this is a President and administration who consider the law to be no obstacle. Who believe the only person with any authority to restrain Donald Trump’s power is Donald Trump himself. \n\nNot exactly what America’s founders intended when they rebelled against a king.","summary":"The evidence is mounting.

The New Orleans Saints selected Shough with the No. 40 pick in the draft. Shough is the third quarterback selected this draft, and the first selected in the second round. And Sanders? Nope. Not yet. And perhaps not for a little while yet. That, obviously, is not what anyone expected – certainly not even President Donald Trump. A Draft Lesson To Be Learned But we're probably going to have to use this as something of an NFL draft lesson. And here's the lesson: NFL teams don't care about the legacy a player brings to the draft process. So it obviously doesn't matter that Shedeur is the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. NFL teams don't care about media grades. And so those who had Sanders as the best or second-best quarterback prospect in this draft mattered not one bit. NFL teams also don't care about injuries and age as much as they do potential. That seems to be in effect when comparing Shough and Sanders. Shough is clearly the winner of the eye test. He's 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds. Sanders is 6-1 and 215-ish pounds. Shough ran a 4.6 at the NFL scouting combine. Sanders didn't run a 40 at the combine or his pro day but scouts believe he runs in the 4.8 range. Saints Unworried About Shough's Red Flags And, oh yeah, the knock about Shough's age disappeared for the Saints. The prospect will be 26 years old in September after he played seven years in college. That didn't matter to a team that needed to have an answer at quarterback, with Derek Carr facing uncertainty based on his mysterious shoulder injury the club has mostly declined to discuss. Shough, it should be noted, is a great athlete. He's mobile. He's fast. He's big. He's played both under center and in shotgun. But he had three injuries at three different schools, which is the reason he's older than other prospects. The Saints obviously got beyond the injury history and age. And now Shough is going to have Kellen Moore working with him.","summary":"As Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders continues to wait on his draft moment, Tyler Shough was selected by the New Orleans Saints to address the team&apos;s issues with Derek Carr.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/tyler-shough-third-qb-off-board-nfl-draft-still-no-shedeur-sanders","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/Tyler-Shough_Feature-scaled-e1661161984944.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:34:58","author":"Armando Salguero","authors":["Armando Salguero"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.09},{"id":314913674,"title":"A quiet, sacred ceremony in one of the last steps on Pope’s final journey","text":"More than 200,000 people are expected to crowd into St Peter’s Square and the surrounding streets, marking a massive outpouring of grief and reverence for the pontiff who, over his 12-year reign, transformed the papacy with a message of mercy, humility and inclusion.\n\nRoads surrounding the Vatican have been blocked off, while security forces from across Italy are on alert.

Ajay Banga was interviewed by AFP at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Spring Meetings, which have been held this year under a cloud of uncertainty about President Donald Trump's stop-start tariff rollout.The Bank has been advising developing countries to get a deal done quickly with the United States, and to then focus attention on cutting trade barriers and boosting regional flows of goods, Banga said. \"You need to negotiate trade systems with the US at the earliest possible,\" he said. \"If you delay, it hurts everyone.\"Trump's tariffs have roiled financial markets, sent volatility surging and spooked investors and consumers. Since returning to office in January, the US leader has imposed a \"baseline\" 10 percent tariff on most countries, with much higher duties on China, and 25 percent sector-specific levies on areas including steel, aluminum, and automobiles not manufactured in the United States. He also introduced much higher tariffs on dozens of countries -- which have since been temporarily paused -- accusing them of having an unfair trade balance with the United States. Banga also addressed the criticism levelled by new US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Bank earlier this week.Bessent criticized China's \"absurd\" developing country status and called on Banga and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to \"earn the confidence of the administration.\" \"I don't think he's wrong,\" Banga said of Bessent's comments on China. \"A country that is the size of China and the capability of China, at some point, should no longer be taking money from IBRD,\" he said, referring the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development -- an arm of the World Bank that lends largely to middle-income countries. China, he said, still borrowed around $750 million from the IBRD last year, while paying in billions of dollars to the Fund in repayments and donations. \"My view is, I've brought it down to 750 (million), and I'm trying to figure out a way to deal with China to bring it down further,\" he said. \"I want to get it done. And that's what I'm talking to the Chinese about.\" Banga said the Trump administration's broader criticisms of the World Bank were not unusual, citing newly-elected governments over the past year in countries including France, Japan, and Korea.\"I keep telling people this is a perfectly constructive request, to say, tell me and show me that you guys are the kind of people that advance the interests of my taxpayer, of my country,\" he said.\"I take it in that spirit,\" he said. \"There's nothing wrong with it.\"Since taking the helm of the Washington-based development lender in 2023, Banga has pushed to streamline its operations and encourage private sector participation, while focusing on job creation and electricity connectivity. Among the Bank's current priorities is a push with the African Development Bank to connect 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa to electricity by 2030 -- a process that will require a vast amount of new energy to be brought online.\"You should try and get (energy) in the best, accessible way and the lowest possible cost,\" Banga said, suggesting that in addition to renewable power, nuclear and gas could help provide a base load -- two energy sources the World Bank is currently hesitant to finance.The Bank's executive board is set to discuss its energy strategy in June, Banga said, adding that funding for both nuclear and gas would likely be on the agenda. Banga said the Bank is also pushing to encourage great private sector job creation in developing countries -- beyond simply outsourcing jobs from advanced economies.\"Because then you end up with challenges in (advanced economies), and you can see that people are speaking about them with their votes,\" he added.","summary":"Developing countries should strike swift trade deals with the United States at the \"earliest possible\" opportunity, the president of the World Bank told AFP Friday, after a busy week with global financial leaders in Washington.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/developing-countries-should-fast-track-us-trade-deals-world-bank-president-3771472","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4596694/banga-said-world-bank-was-supporting-countries-trade.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:00:20","author":"Daniel Avis And Erwan Lucas","authors":["Daniel Avis And Erwan Lucas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.041},{"id":314911332,"title":"Bangladesh’s new leader dreams big, with China’s backing","text":"Muhammad Yunus has worn many hats in his storied career: economist, Nobel laureate, pioneer of microfinance, and, more recently, nemesis of the now-deposed authoritarian Sheikh Hasina, who pursued him relentlessly through the courts.\nBut his latest role may be the most daunting yet: steward of a nation at a crossroads, tasked with rebuilding Bangladesh’s broken institutions, steering an anaemic economy hamstrung by corruption and mismanagement through a turbulent global trade environment and paving the way for elections he himself will not contest.\nYunus, 84, now serves as chief adviser to Bangladesh’s interim government. His mission? To undo the damage inflicted during Hasina’s 15-year reign and restore democratic norms.\nHer regime “destroyed all institutions”, Yunus told This Week in Asia. The goal now, he said, was nothing less than to “lock the door for future such governments ever to evolve [again]”.\nHasina’s rule ended abruptly on August 5 last year, closing the chapter on a dynastic regime notorious for its political repression, untold fortunes siphoned off through cronyism, and allegations of torture and enforced disappearances.\n\nYet even in self-exile, she remains a thorn in the interim government’s side, hurling vitriolic insults and plotting a potential comeback from the sanctuary of neighbouring India.\nJust this month, she accused Yunus of hatching a “foreign conspiracy” and using overseas funds to “destroy” the country. “Loan shark, power-hungry, money-hungry self-centred person,” she called him, virtually addressing a rally of her loyal Awami League.\nBut Yunus is undeterred. “Government must be about letting people come and help you dream things, do things, participate in it and feel comfortable with it,” he said, adding it must be “an assurance, an inspiration … so even if you don’t succeed, you feel comfortable that you tried together.”\nThe students who led demonstrations last July – which started in objection to a job quota scheme but snowballed into a nationwide revolt as Hasina’s security forces opened fire on peaceful protests – want elections as soon as possible. They also want justice.\nNine months after Hasina’s downfall, Bangladesh has a chance to dream again, Yunus told This Week in Asia. But the task ahead is gargantuan.\n\nThe interim government is working to enact reforms to curb corruption and dismantle entrenched patronage networks, as it also prepares for elections by next summer.\nBut the clamour and contention is already bubbling in a country born in the fires of a 1971 split from Pakistan – and where democracy has been curtailed by coups or autocrats.\nHasina’s downfall was both a reminder that nothing lasts forever in Bangladesh and a warning to its reformists not to underestimate the task at hand.\n“Elections don’t solve everything,” Yunus said, explaining the need for root-and-branch reforms that expunge “this fascist regime” and close the “gaps in the institutions” that allowed Hasina, once a reform-minded populist, to transform into an autocrat.\n‘He’s done well so far’\nThe euphoria of revolution has been diluted by anxiety over what lies ahead for South Asia’s third most populous nation – and its second largest economy.\nYunus’ supporters argue that the country is fortunate to have a statesman of his calibre at this critical crossroads.\nThey credit him with being a stabilising force in the dangerous days following Hasina’s ousting, taming runaway inflation, and energetically championing accountability and democracy at home, while promoting the nation’s economic potential abroad.\nThe genial US-educated Yunus, articulate and spry despite his age, has also won praise for his focus on Bangladesh’s youth – half of the nation’s 170 million people are under the age of 27.\n“I don’t have much education to judge political matters. But I can tell you this – during the last Ramadan, food prices didn’t go beyond our reach,” said Anwar Hossain, a 34-year-old driver of an electric three-wheeler who was injured by birdshot during last year’s protests.\n“To me, that’s a good sign the interim government might be working in our favour. I think he’s done well so far.”\n\nUnder Yunus, Dhaka has been striking trade deals, touting Bangladesh’s young, determined workforce and its strategic location – flanked by China and India, with access to the Bay of Bengal reaching down to Southeast Asia – as key reasons to invest in its ports and special economic zones.\nGrowth is forecast to reach about 3.8 per cent this year, even as Washington’s tariffs threaten to devastate the country’s crucial US$7 billion garment industry.\nAnd remittances hit a record US$3.3 billion last month – a sign, in part, of the diaspora’s faith in the country’s future.\n“I don’t know much about the elections. But as long as we have a government that keeps prices low, fights corruption and takes care of us, I don’t care who sits on the throne,” Hossain said.\nAs long as we have a government that … takes care of us, I don’t care who sits on the throne\nAnwar Hossain, Bangladeshi driver\nAnother narrative, espoused by allies of the former regime, paints the revolution as a catastrophe for the country.\nBangladesh, they claim, is now in slow-motion collapse, with chaotic and violent forces – including Islamism, communal tensions and crime – that Hasina had kept in check now running rampant.\nMeanwhile, Hasina herself is in India. Long-time supporter of her government, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, met her 10 times in the year before she was deposed.\nBangladeshi authorities want her to return to face trial and have asked Interpol to issue a red notice for her arrest – a sore point in Dhaka’s already mistrustful relationship with New Delhi.\nYunus met Modi in Bangkok during the BIMSTEC summit earlier this month, describing their 40-minute meeting as “very successful, very friendly” and saying he had pushed for Hasina’s repatriation\n“They [India] said, ‘Yes, we got it, she is still with us,’ and I said, ‘How can we make sure she doesn’t make statements that irritate the people?’”\n\nAll the while, Indian media continues to report often spurious allegations of communal attacks on Hindus and warnings of an imminent Islamist takeover in Bangladesh. Incendiary language in a region fraught with ethnic and religious tensions.\nDhaka’s interim government says these narratives are aimed at destabilising a vulnerable nation and giving Hasina’s Awami League an opening to return in some form.\nAccording to anti-corruption officials, billions of dollars were siphoned out of state coffers between 2009 and 2024, the years of Hasina’s reign. Her family, friends and allies were handed political patronage and state contracts, with vast sums funnelled into a political network that kept her in power as her associates lived in the lap of luxury in Dubai, London and New York.\nAmong those implicated in the corruption allegations is British Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, Hasina’s niece. Bangladesh’s anti-corruption watchdog accuses her of pressuring Hasina to allocate prime Dhaka real estate to her mother and siblings. Siddiq has denied any wrongdoing, describing the claims as a “politically motivated smear campaign”.\n\nStill, the interim government maintains that Hasina enabled corruption on a massive scale by deliberately skewing all state institutions, from the courts to anti-corruption bodies and even the boards of banks, which were stacked with regime loyalists.\n“The new board started issuing loans to their favourites – any amount that you want, literally using the bank as a kind of booty that you distribute among your friends and relatives,” Yunus said.\n“Now we have a broken banking system … unpaid loans piled up, we don’t know where to begin, our job is to reenergise the banking system, redesign the banking system,” he added. “That’s a big task for us.”\nChina to the rescue?\nIt’s not just the banks, either. The economy has been overheating, with inflation peaking at over 10 per cent in December.\nIn Dhaka’s markets, the price of onions has surged to 70 taka (60 US cents) per kilogram, up from 55 taka just a week ago. Rice prices have also climbed, while a litre of bottled soybean oil now costs 189 taka (US$1.54) after a recent 14 taka increase.\nA nation dependent on remittances and garment sales for foreign exchange is also feeling the squeeze of US tariffs, both threatened and enacted, as it braces for the broader economic body blow to global growth forecast from President Donald Trump ripping up the decades-old rules of international commerce.\nThe ripple effects are already being felt. Earlier this month, India abruptly cancelled a transshipment agreement that had allowed Bangladesh’s exports – predominantly from the garment industry – to be exported through Indian ports. Delhi cited “significant congestion” as the reason.\nIf the global economy contracts as forecast, it could mean fewer opportunities for Bangladesh’s estimated 10 million overseas workers – often called “remittance warriors” – and shrinking demand for its exports.\n\nYunus, however, remains unfazed by the disruptions to global trade caused by the White House, dismissing fears that they could derail Asia’s rise.\n“I’m not giving up on Asia’s ‘moment’. Asia is rising, because the population is rising and the businesses are flourishing,” Yunus said.\n“This is a good occasion to revisit and build a new thing,” he added. “We should take this as an opportunity to redesign it, make it better than it used to be.”\nThe trade turmoil has jolted to life BIMSTEC, a subregional economic grouping encompassing Bangladesh and its Bay of Bengal neighbours, potentially offering some insulation from the 37 per cent tariff Trump’s new tariff regime would impose on the country.\nThere is even talk of Bangladesh joining, or at least becoming a partner, of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nFor decades, such bold thinking has been a hallmark of Yunus’ career.\nIn the mid-1970s, he started giving small personal loans to Bangladeshi basketweavers, helping them at first survive and then thrive via injections of capital.\nThis laid the foundation for the Grameen Bank, a pioneering model of poverty alleviation through microloans that has since been replicated in over 100 countries. In 2006, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.\nNow, his interim government is looking to China for economic relief from US tariffs and as a diplomatic counterbalance to its uneasy relationship with India.\nDuring a visit to Beijing last month, Yunus secured commitments for US$2.1 billion in Chinese investments, loans and grants for Bangladesh, while dozens of Chinese companies pledged US$1 billion to the Chinese Industrial Economic Zone in Chattogram, which has been under construction since 2016.\n\nChina also promised US$400 million in loans to upgrade the deep-sea Mongla port and accelerate talks on a potential free-trade agreement – a deal that could boost Bangladesh’s modest US$1 billion in exports to China.\n“China is actively looking to reposition itself in the region, and Bangladesh is part of that recalibration,” said Dr Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh-born academic and political commentator currently based at the University of Oslo.\n“They’ve invested heavily in the previous regime – this is a strategic continuation.”\nFor a country that urgently needs new infrastructure and jobs for its burgeoning youth population, foreign investment is a welcome prospect.\n“If someone is willing to bring capital and create jobs, it’s a rational decision, not just a political one,” Hasan said, adding there was a calculated message to India behind Bangladesh’s deals with China: “We have options, and we’ll exercise them if you’re not ready to engage seriously.”\nChina is actively looking to reposition itself in the region, and Bangladesh is part of that recalibration\nDr Mubashar Hasan, political commentator\nThe idea behind the Chinese special economic zones is for firms to set up factories in Bangladesh and use its ports to reach markets across the Bay of Bengal.\nBangladesh has “a young, creative population. Hire our people,” Yunus said. “Relocate your industries to our country, bring your factory, produce here and serve the whole global market.”\nCritics caution that the economic and environmental costs of Chinese investments are rarely assessed until it’s too late.\n“The core issue with Chinese investments is their lack of proper social and environmental impact assessments, which are absolutely vital for a densely populated country like ours,” said Sharif Jamil, an environmental activist, member of the Waterkeeper Alliance’s board of directors and member secretary of DHORA, a civil society platform in Bangladesh.\n“Unfortunately, the environment often isn’t their priority.”\n“Bangladesh certainly needs investment and infrastructure development – but we must insist that these investments are inclusive, green and environmentally sustainable, and beneficial to our broader economy,” Jamil added.\n\nRestless revolutionaries\nFor the student protesters who braved bullets and beatings to overthrow Hasina, the winds of change feel frustratingly stagnant as the old guard clings to power.\nFaria Hossain, an economics student in Dhaka, acknowledges the progress made by the Yunus-led interim government but believes it has squandered a historic opportunity for deeper structural reforms.\n“It’s clear he couldn’t implement large-scale reforms – perhaps because of entrenched bureaucrats who’ve served under the old regime for over 15 years,” she said.\n“Some of them disguised themselves as pro-revolutionaries and secured powerful roles. In reality, they’ve obstructed several promising initiatives. The government may be aware, but rooting out civil servants is no easy task.”\nThe sense of unease runs deeper than bureaucratic inertia. Crime is on the rise and reports of communal tensions are adding to the uncertainty of daily life.\n\nThe clamour for quick elections to complete the nation’s reset are growing louder. Yunus, however, has resisted these demands, arguing that meaningful reforms require time to take root.\nBut as the months stretch on, Hasina and her loyalists are stirring up trouble from abroad, waiting for their moment to stage a political comeback.\n“I’d give Professor Yunus an ‘A’ for intent and effort.

However, the first China tariff war in 2018 took the Chinese by surprise,” Zhang said.\nIn 2018, Trump began imposing tariffs on more than US$300 billion worth of imported Chinese goods and pushed Beijing to strike a trade agreement.\nThe resulting phase one deal, signed in 2020, committed China to buy an additional US$200 billion of American goods and services over two years – although that did not happen as a result of the Covid outbreak.\nThe pandemic further soured relations as Trump blamed China for the outbreak. Meanwhile, his officials increasingly targeted Beijing over human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang with sanctions, prompting retaliatory measures against US politicians and officials that included the current secretary of state, Marco Rubio, a prominent China hawk.\n“Many believe that his administration in fact triggered a complete change in US-China relations and nudged it toward a new cold war,” Zhang said.\nHe added that the appointment of China hawks to key roles “led many in China to think that he will pursue a hardline policy” and this had “deterred” Beijing from engaging with him.\nSun Chenghao, head of the US-EU programme at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, said China now held no illusions about Trump and had been preparing for the worst.\n“Trump’s unpredictability is now a relatively more predictable factor,” Sun said. “Compared with his first term, China is more composed, especially on trade and tariffs … nothing will particularly surprise us or catch us off guard.”\nHe added that Beijing had shifted from passively reacting to Trump’s tariffs to fighting back this time, drawing on years of preparation to expand its policy toolkit and improve its economic resilience.\nThis month China has responded to each of Trump’s tariff announcements with its own measures.\nAt present, Beijing’s levies on US goods have risen to 125 per cent on top of previous tariffs.\nIt has also extended its use of non-tariff tools, including export controls on critical minerals that are essential to semiconductors and batteries, further sanctions targeting US firms and new restrictions on American film imports.\nMeanwhile, Trump has imposed tariffs totalling 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far this year, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent.\nAccording to a fact sheet released by the White House on April 15, China now faces tariffs of up to 245 per cent, when tariffs that were imposed before Trump’s second term in office began are included.\nChinese officials and media have also taken a more aggressive and confident tone, saying the economy can weather the storm, while the authorities have pledged further measures to boost domestic demand – a long-standing policy aim.\nAlong with this increasing reliance on the domestic economy, Xi has continued to promote his vision of a globalised, multipolar world – in contrast to US protectionism – and court regional partners, including during his recent tour of Southeast Asia.\nDespite slapping heavy tariffs on China, Trump has stressed that he is willing to negotiate directly with Xi, for whom he has often expressed admiration.\nThe pair spoke by phone before Trump returned to the White House, but since then there has been limited contact between the two sides.\nChina’s foreign policy chief, Wang Yi, and Rubio have also spoken by phone but did not meet when Wang visited New York in February for a United Nations meeting or at the Munich Security Conference that same month.\nAlthough Rubio is still under Chinese sanctions, many analysts believe this is not an insurmountable barrier and say the lack of contact is a matter of choice.\nIn the economic sphere, Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, who has been appointed to lead trade talks, only had an introductory call with US trade representative Jamieson Greer before Trump announced his first new tariffs.\nZhao Hai, director of the international politics studies department at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ National Institute for Global Strategy, said a leaders’ meeting was unlikely in the near term due to minimal working-level communications.\nHe added there was no clear channel for the two nations to begin trade talks since Beijing was unclear who could speak for Trump or represent the US position.\nTrump claimed this week that trade talks with China were already under way, but Beijing has denied this.\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS earlier this month that he was not engaging with China, and nor was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with contacts being left to the president to handle.\n\n“We don’t know whether Bessent, Greer or Lutnick are leading the conversation on the US side,” Zhao said. “Do they have authorisation [from Trump]? Can they start negotiations with China?”\nRyan Hass, director of the John L. Thornton China Centre at the Brookings Institution, said there was “significant jockeying among senior officials” for the role of lead negotiator with China during Trump’s first term but “nobody is lobbying to gain this role” now.\nHe added: “Trump is not asking anyone to take on this role. Trump wants to serve as his own lead negotiator.”\nHass, who recently led a delegation to China to meet academics and officials, said the lack of proper communications had left the relationship between the two countries as one marked by “enmity and grievance”.\nHe said: “Trump and Xi both are proud leaders. Neither wants to be perceived as giving in to pressure from the other. There likely will need to be an outside event or actor to bring the two leaders together. It is difficult to envision the two leaders coming together to meet on their own accord.”\nBut some analysts say now is the time for backchannels to play their part with Lutnick saying recently that there had been initial discussions “through intermediaries”.\nThe speed with which Xi’s visit to Mar-A-Largo was arranged in 2017 was in part due to the role of intermediaries such as Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, who used backchannels to speak to former ambassador Cui Tiankai.\n\nNeil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Centre for China Analysis, said backchannels had also been an “important ingredient” in reaching a trade deal in Trump’s first term.\n“If Beijing and Washington want to reach another deal, then both governments would be well served by encouraging such informal channels of communication,” he added.\nDavid Firestein, the chief executive of the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, said Trump’s second term may be characterised by “surrogate diplomacy”, where political allies unofficially deliver messages.\n“That’s certainly a tool that any president has in his or her – up to now, his – toolkit,” Firestein told the Post on the sidelines of the Harvard College China Forum earlier this month.\nSteve Daines, a Republican senator from Montana who is close to Trump, met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing last month, becoming the first American politician to visit China since Trump’s return to office.\nZhao said China would “welcome” such backchannels but warned that setting them up was harder than before.\nThe conservatives in Trump’s orbit had been avoiding contact with Chinese officials and scholars, which they see as “damaging to their political future”, Zhao said. “If Trump truly wants to cut a deal with China … he needs to actively open those channels, official or not.”\nAdditional reporting by Ziwen Zhao","summary":"Beijing has shown no signs it wants to make concessions after Trump’s behaviour in his first term soured relations.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307901/why-china-taking-much-tougher-stance-towards-donald-trump-time-round","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/25/ea3a071b-4839-4a18-895c-ed9acc1cdc41_8d1764a0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:00:08","author":"Kawala Xie","authors":["Kawala Xie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":314907496,"title":"Trump's second chance at first 100 days shows everything is a transaction","text":"The time referenced is taken as an indication of the direction of the presidency at a point where the incumbent is likely to be at his or her most powerful and most influential.\n\nOf course, in the case of Donald Trump, this is his second first 100 days. Only one other president in the history of the country, Grover Cleveland in 1893, has managed to win two non-consecutive terms.\n\nThe achievement of such a feat by Trump represents one of the greatest comebacks in modern political history. As a result, he began his second term on January 20 in a position of unparalleled power for a new president. So what has he done with that power?\n\nSince assuming office, on the most cursory level, he has followed the advice of his confederate, Steve Bannon, who coined the phrase: “Flood the zone with shit”.\n\nSo it was that, even before entering office this time around, he introduced the possibility of expansion in Greenland and an intervention in the Panama Canal.\n\nHe engaged in the silly stuff like renaming the Gulf of Mexico, along with the deadly serious business of whipping away the biggest aid agency in the world from under the tiny feet of the most vulnerable children on the planet.\n\nHe has signed a record 124 executive orders — yet only five bills from congress — leaning into his executive power and pulling away from the centuries-old checks and balance provided by congress.\n\nNo president over the last 75 years has signed less bills into law in their first 100 days. His executive orders have strayed into the work of individual states, and have included an order to seek out evidence of corruption against opponents.\n\n On the mad king front, he has signed an executive order to increase the pressure on showerheads — because he likes a good shower\n\nHe has completely changed the narrative of democracies siding with Ukraine in the war to protect their countries from Putin’s invasion. His positioning appears to be informed primarily by the fact that he likes how Putin governs, and he just doesn’t like Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThis week, he has made it plain he wants a quick win over the war.\n\nIf the sides don’t agree to his plan — which largely favours Russia — Trump has said he will throw his hat at it and move on.\n\nThe kudos of a quick win is what matters to him rather than any achievement to preserve human life or influence the tides of man in a positive manner.\n\nOn the slaughter in Gaza, he has proposed turning the territory into an Atlantic City on the Mediterranean Sea — a paradise for wealthy holidaymakers and gamblers, built on the blood of dispossessed Palestinians.\n\nLike much of his top-of-the-head notions, this one betrays his complete lack of understanding of history and what has to be a sociopathic inability for empathy.\n\nEverything is a transaction. Every individual or group is categorised as ally or opponent, their wants or needs assessed in terms of how it might benefit him.\n\nThe only real check on his global forays has been the market. He termed April 2 as ‘Liberation Day’, signing off on a series of tariffs against most of the US’s trading partners. This was, he said with typical hyperbole, “one of the most important days in American history”.\n\nHe was right on one front. Global markets tanked at the prospect of the economic chaos he has set off and, if he hadn’t backed down, ‘Liberation Day’ would have been noted by history as one in which a single person’s wanton incompetence had initiated a global recession.\n\nNot that the world is out of the woods yet. The uncertainty his tariff obsession has caused is continuing to be ripple across the globe. This week, he turned his guns on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe chair’s brief is to set interest rates according to the best available expertise in terms of what best serves the economy. Trump believes that he knows better, and has berated Powell for not cutting rates as the US economy slumps in the face of the king’s madness.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump warned that the US economy is heading for a slowdown “unless Mr Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates NOW,” the king posted on his Truth Social account.\n\nThe blatant grab for power makes no mention of the fact that any slowdown is directly attributable to Trump’s harebrained economic policies.\n\nInsulting the chair of the Fed for not doing as the president wishes is unprecedented, but is also of a piece with a whole series of actions that — more than anything else — have informed Trump’s first 100 days.\n\nThe over-riding objective in flooding the zone with shit is to dismantle a democracy that has been built up and maintained for over 200 years.\n\nDonald Trump’s whole ascent can be ascribed to the unwinding that is referenced by George Packer’s book quoted here.\n\nOver the last 40 years now — Packer’s book was published in 2013 — America has become unmoored from old certainties.\n\nThe social contract underpinning the American dream has frayed as corporate power came to dominate economic life, as the rich got richer, and those left behind grew desperate and disillusioned.\n\nGlobalisation played its part, but mainly by shifting wealth within US borders rather than from the country.\n\nIt didn’t matter who was in power. Nobody appeared to be serving the interests of the former hard-working family that had a home, a decent job, security, and the prospect of their children reaching a higher rung on the ladder. And into the breach stepped a TV personality who promised to bring back the old days — to make them great again.\n\nThe unwinding that opened doors for Trump has, since January 20, moved onto another plane. \n\n Now, a new unwinding is Trump’s direct assault on democracy in order to usher in a country ruled by autocratic diktat\n\nThe various pieces of scaffolding that support and maintain the strength of American democracy have endured a multi-pronged assault in the last three months. This began with the permanent government.\n\nIn the week he was inaugurated, Trump sent billionaire Elon Musk in to slash government spending and jobs — gifting them the makey-upy title: The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\n Musk, along with a team of twentysomething wannabe tech bros, behaved as if they had acquired some form of super power that enabled them to spot inefficiencies.\n\nThe US aid agency, USAid, was effectively dismantled, sending shockwaves through aid agencies across the world.\n\nExperts have warned that the move could lead to millions of deaths from malnutrition, Aids, TB, and malaria in the years ahead.\n\nIn South Sudan, from where the Irish Examiner’s Niamh Griffin recently reported, the cuts are already being felt. Children are forced to walk for hours in 40C heat to receive medical care.\n\nChristoper Nyamandi, the country director for British agency Save The Children, has suggested that the world is looking away.\n\n“There should be moral outrage that the decisions made by powerful people in other countries have led to child deaths in just a matter of weeks,” he said.\n\nIn the US, over 216,000 federal workers have been laid off and a whole host of programmes abandoned.\n\nRobert Rubin, who served as Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary, last month told Bloomberg that none of it makes sense on any level.\n\n“We balanced the budget in 1998, for the first time in 30 years,” he said. “We knew what we were doing. I think these people haven’t the foggiest idea what they’re doing.\n\n Doge is doing tremendous damage to government and the recipients of government services and activities\n\nFor Trump, the slash and burn works to both install people who are loyal to him, rather than the republic, and to provide leverage for tax cuts which will benefit the wealthy to the greatest extent.\n\nThe rule of law is under assault. The administration is blatantly ignoring the courts when it suits.\n\nOne judge ruled that deportations to Venezuela should cease because they were illegal. The justice department — now fully under Trump’s appointees — said the flights went ahead because Judge James Boasberg’s order was verbal rather than written.\n\nAnother judge has ordered the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was illegally deported to El Salvador, because he was mistakenly identified as a criminal. Trump has claimed there is nothing he can do about it — which is entirely false.\n\nThe judge, Paul Xinis, has threatened to hold officials in contempt of court. Trump’s people don’t seem to care, because they are confident that any such matter will go all the way to the Supreme Court — which has three Trump appointees and a majority of conservatives.\n\nElsewhere, the administration is targeting law firms that have represented people Trump considers opponents. Last month, investigations into 20 of the country’s top law firms were initiated.\n\nThe ostensible reason for the probe is to investigate whether these firms have used diversity employment practices to exclude white people from employment or promotion.\n\nThe premise may be ludicrous, but the investigation will cost a whole heap of time and money for the firms. After dealing with the judges, the autocratic playbook suggests nobbling the lawyers is the next priority.\n\nThen there is the media. In the early weeks of his term, Trump banned leading new agency Associated Press from White House briefings because the agency refused to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.\n\nAP went to the courts and a judge ruled in its favour.\n\nLast week, Trump’s people appealed the ruling. The issue is trivial, but the message imparted has a chilling effect: If you stray into territory uncomfortable for the president, expect to have cherished access whipped away.\n\nElsewhere, Trump has initiated legal actions against a number of media outlets which had reported on his various court actions.\n\n Ordinarily, he wouldn’t have a legal leg to stand on — but we don’t live in ordinary times\n\nTo complete the flooding of this zone, he has invited into press briefings various minor media personnel who have a strong record of supporting him and his politics.\n\nThese individuals are not there to hold power to account, but to deflect the media from doing so.\n\nHe has also turned his guns on academia, demanding that the government has unprecedented say over how universities are run.\n\nThe premise for this kind of overreach is that colleges have facilitated protests against the slaughter in Gaza which have been seen as antisemitic.\n\nHarvard, the wealthiest such institution, has responded to the freezing of €2bn in federal funds with a lawsuit, claiming Trump wants control over admissions and the hiring of staff.\n\nRecently, The Atlantic tracked the route Trump has taken to authoritarianism. It pointed out that he is following a playbook well worn by others such as Duterte in the Philippines, Orbán in Hungary, and Erdogan in Turkey.\n\n“First, the leader removes those with expertise and independent thinking from the government and replaces them with leaders who are arrogant, ignorant, and extremely loyal,” it reported.\n\nThis is precisely what Trump has done, most disastrously with defence secretary Pete Hegseth, right across his administration.\n\nThe piece goes on: “Next, he takes steps to centralise his power and claim unprecedented authority.\n\n“Along the way, he conducts all-out assault on the truth so that the truth-tellers are distrusted, corruption becomes the norm, and questioning him becomes impossible.”\n\nAmerica is not Hungary nor Turkey, but the long-standing democracy that — in the last century alone — was a bulwark against both fascism and communism.\n\nIn his first 100 days, Trump appears to be reshaping the country from within.\n\nWhether the US has the strength to resist this grab for autocratic power should become clear before we hit the mid-term elections in 2026.\n\nHang onto your hat. Donald Trump has only just begun.","summary":"Starting off his second term in a position of unparalleled power, the controversial US president has flooded the zone in order to usher in a country ruled by autocratic diktat, writes Mick Clifford","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41620084.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9193/4596529_7_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-1181924215_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Mick Clifford","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Mick Clifford"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.066},{"id":314911926,"title":"Rachel Reeves says EU more important to Britain in 'gaffe' that could harm her chances of securing a US trade deal to avoid Trump's punishing tariffs","text":"Rachel Reeves has been criticised for saying trade with the EU is more important than with the US.\n\nThe Chancellor met her American counterpart Scott Bessent last night as part of efforts to secure a deal to save UK businesses from Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.\n\nShe has suggested the UK could lower levies on American cars from 10 per cent to 2.5 per cent in an attempt to be spared the 25 per cent rate now being imposed by the President.\n\nBut she sparked anger in an interview broadcast ahead of the meeting in Washington yesterday by suggesting improving ties with Brussels is more of a priority.\n\nShe told the BBC: 'I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners.\n\n'Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week while I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.'\n\nTory business spokesman Andrew Griffith said: 'Going to Washington to get a trade deal only to say she views the EU as more important is a major gaffe by this foot-in-mouth Chancellor.\n\n'The US is our single largest trading partner and the one where exporters such as British carmakers are facing acute uncertainty right now. \n\n'Once again we see a Chancellor who is out of her depth and making bad choices which could cost the UK dear.'\n\nBut the Chancellor's comments were backed by Downing Street, with a spokesman saying: 'It's a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner.\n\n'You have the Prime Minister on record saying that it's a false choice between the EU and the US;

Reynolds then got up and the two shared a brief kiss, before Blake stood up to give her speech, as captured in a video shared by Page Six\n\nDuring her speech Blake also thanked 'every man, including my sweet husband [Ryan], who are kind and good when no one is watching'\nIn a video shared to social media, the actress — who sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly on the red carpet — publicly talked about her mother's, 77, experience as a survivor of an assault by a coworker.\n'I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum,' Lively said, hinting at her ongoing bitter court battle with Baldoni, whom she accused of sexual harassment, which he denied. \nInstead, she decided to speak about 'the feeling of being a woman who has a voice today.'\nLively shared that her life was 'influenced most' by her mother, Willie Elaine McAlpin, who, along with Lively's husband Ryan, accompanied her to the event.\nShe explained her mom was the 'survivor of the worst crime someone can commit against a woman.'\n'My mom never got justice from her work acquaintance who attempted to take her life when she was the mother of three young kids years before I was born,' she said.\nLively stated that her mother credited a woman who shared a 'similar circumstance' on the radio with saving her life.\n'The woman painfully and graphically shared how she escaped. And because of hearing that woman speak about her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today. She was saved by a woman whose name she'll never know.'\n\nShe hinted at her legal battle with Baldoni saying, 'I have so much to say about the last two years of my life, but tonight is not the forum,' adding that she was instead opting to speak about 'the feeling of being a woman who has a voice today'\n\nLively was later blasted for sharing her mother Elaine's experience as a survivor of an assault by a coworker during her speech, with fans calling it an 'obvious PR move'\n\nShe then called womanhood a 'pact that privately we must show others how to survive, literally or spiritually.'\n'We don't let our daughters know, but one day we break their hearts by letting them in on the secret that we kept from them as they pranced around in princess dresses that they are not and will likely never be safe at work, at home, in a parking lot in a medical office, online — in any space they inhabit physically, emotionally, professionally.'\nLively called the 'superpower of female triumph' a 'basic human right,' and added, 'Never underestimate a woman's ability to endure pain.'\nAfter thanking her husband towards the end of the speech, she added: 'And to all the communities across the gender, age, political, geographical, and racial spectrum who fight every day just to be safe, I see you.'\nMany fans criticized the star for discussing her mother's ordeal, pointing out her silence on domestic violence while promoting It Ends With Us — directed by and co-starring Baldoni — which portrayed an abusive relationship.\n'Oh so now she is using her Mother’s SA to be likable??? But in August she didn’t mention DV when promoting a movie about DV. Interesting…' one person wrote.\n'Blake Lively used her Time100 speech to reveal her mother is a rape survivor—an obvious PR move to align with SA victims. Yet, with that personal connection to trauma, she still couldn’t figure out how to market a movie about DV? What’s next for her, a Peace Nobel Prize?' another added.\n'Incredible how Blake Lively claims she’s not going to speak on her legal mess with Justin Baldoni—yet still manages to stain his name by casually tying him to a speech about rape and shame!'\n\nIn her December complaint, Lively claimed Baldoni had acted unprofessionally on the set of the domestic abuse movie It Ends With Us in which the pair starred and Baldoni also directed\n\n'Why wasn’t she having these speeches when she was promoting the movie?? Instead she was promoting alcohol and naming drinks after the characters. don’t understand why they keep giving her a platform.'\n'My mom is a victim so I know suffering too? What is the point in telling mom's story?' another person questioned.\nElsewhere in her speech, Lively also discussed being an honoree 'in a time where the most valuable currency seems to be anger, it feels like an act of defiance to commune and celebrate all the good that is alive in the world.'\nAs for being called influential, she said, 'How we use that matters. Who and what we stand up for, and what we stay silent about, what we monetize versus what we actually live, matters.'\nBlake arrived at the gala in a shimmering red off-the-shoulder gown that highlighted her cleavage and featured a modest train trailing behind her.\nHer mom looked elegant in a flapper-inspired black dress with chevrons of black sequins, along with a sheer black section covering her chest and sleeves.\nRyan favored classic men's style with a black tuxedo and bow tie.\nLively sparked a furious response from Megyn Kelly at the gala on Thursday, following the actress' controversial inclusion on the publication's Most Influential People list.\nThe 54-year-old conservative journalist blasted Blake and her ongoing lawsuit against Justin in an impassioned rant while speaking to DailyMail.com on the red carpet.\nAccording to Megyn, Blake — who left readers outraged over her TIME100 cover — 'shouldn't be here.'\nAt the TIME100 gala, Megyn ramped up her attack against the Gossip Girl star, accusing her of 'bastardiz[ing] Me Too allegations' in her quest to sue her It Ends With Us director and costar Justin for sexual harassment, which he has denied.\n'It's a ridiculous joke. She shouldn't be here,' she said of Blake.\n\nThe film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit \n\n'I think [Blake has] launched a fake Me Too allegation against [Justin], and she's lived to regret doing it, because virtually every allegation she has made has fallen apart,' Megyn added.\n'So for her to be honored for doing that, to try to ruin a man over absolutely nothing, is a scandal.'\nThe red carpet feud erupted amid a new lawsuit filing in Blake and Justin's legal battle in which his production company and his publicist for his film It Ends With Us, Jennifer Abel, accused his embattled former publicist, Stephanie Jones, of allegedly plotting with Blake to cover up efforts to leak Abel's sensitive text messages to the actress.\nBaldoni later followed up by launching a $400 million defamation lawsuit against Lively, her publicist and her husband Ryan — which all have denied as well — and he also filed a $250 million libel lawsuit against the New York Times for its reporting on her allegations.\nA trial is scheduled for March 2026.\nRyan ReynoldsMegyn KellyJustin Baldoni\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWhat Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds said during chat before her explosive speech alluding to Justin Baldoni\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

A good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. \n\n'They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to \"finish it off.\" \n\n'Most of the major points are agreed to. Stop the bloodshed, NOW. We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the END to this cruel and senseless war!'\n\nEarlier on Friday, the president had also demanded that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky 'immediately' sign an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraine's mineral resources. \n\nHis post comes after Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia and met with President Vladimir Putin to discuss a peace plan. \n\nTrump wants to broker a truce between Moscow and Kyiv, but has failed to extract any major concessions from Putin despite several rounds of negotiation. \n\nHe has threatened to walk away from talks if he does not see progress towards a ceasefire. \n\nRussia continued its bombardment of Ukraine on Friday, killing three people with a drone strike on an apartment building in a southeastern city.\n\nWitkoff and Putin's meeting came just hours after a car exploded in the Moscow region, killing Russian General Yaroslav Moskalik. \n\nNo one has yet claimed responsibility for what appears to have been a deliberate attack. \n\nOn Thursday Trump had criticized Putin for a deadly missile and drone attack on Kyiv. \n\nWhen asked how he would respond if Russia did not accept a deal, Trump said Thursday: 'I won't be happy, let me put it that way. Things will happen.'\n\nBut Trump also said there had been significant progress in peace talks.\n\n'This next few days is going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now,' Trump told reporters on Thursday. \n\n'I think we're going to make a deal. I think we're getting very close.'\n\nIn a interview published Friday Trump said that 'Crimea will stay with Russia', an example of how he has pressured Kyiv to make concessions to end the war. \n\n'Zelensky understands that,' he continued, referring to the Ukrainian president. 'And everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time.' \n\nTrump added: 'They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. \n\n'The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump.' \n\nUkraine has rejected ceding ground to Moscow, and says it will not accept Russian control of Crimea. \n\nWhen asked by reporters, Zelensky said he didn't want to comment on Trump's statement but repeated that recognizing occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian is a red line for his country.\n\nPlans drawn up by Witkoff call for US recognition of Russia's control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as the removal of sanctions currently in place.\n\nIt also proposes de facto recognition of Russia's hold on areas of southern and eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces control.\n\nThe document, which was presented to European officials last week before being passed onto their Ukrainian counterparts, also states Kyiv will have a 'robust security guarantee' with European and other friendly states acting as guarantors - but will not join NATO.\n\nThe American proposal was handed over last Thursday during talks in Paris, with the European counter-proposal presented at further negotiations in London on Wednesday.\n\nThe text prepared by European and Ukrainian officials defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.\n\nThere is no mention in the document of recognizing Russian control over any Ukrainian territory.\n\nTrump has been accusing Zelensky of prolonging the war by resisting negotiations with Putin. \n\nWestern European leaders, however, have accused Putin of dragging his feet in the negotiations and seeking to grab more Ukrainian land while his army has battlefield momentum.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday as he left the White House to attend the pope's funeral, Trump said there was no deadline for the conclusion of peace talks.\n\n'I just want to do it as fast as possible,' Trump said. Negotiators are 'pretty close' to a deal, he said.\n\nHe promised to meet with foreign leaders while in Rome, and said it was 'possible' he could meet with Zelensky. \n\nZelensky said late Friday, however, that he was not sure he would make it to Rome in time for the funeral.\n\nWitkoff's meeting with Putin on Friday was their second this month and the fourth since February.\n\nThe Kremlin released a short video of Putin and Witkoff greeting each other. 'How are you, Mr. President?' Witkoff could be heard saying. \n\n'Fine, just fine, thank you,' Putin responded in rare remarks in English, as the two shook hands.\n\nPutin's foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, who attended the talks, said the meeting lasted three hours and was 'constructive' and 'useful.' Further talks are expected.","summary":"In a post to his Truth Social on Friday, Trump called for 'high level talks' between the two warring nations after he touched down in Rome to attend the funeral of the late Pope Francis.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649471/Trump-offers-peace-proposal-Ukraine-Russia-deal-finish-cruel-war.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/00/97709185-0-image-m-16_1745623098782.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/25/8646275566245035041/1024x576_MP4_8646275566245035041.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:54:40","author":"Editor,Joe Hutchison","authors":["Editor","Joe Hutchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.463},{"id":314906594,"title":"Bezos-backed startup launches cheap, U.S.-made electric pickup","text":"Slate Auto plans to debut a small electric-powered, American-made pickup for less than $20,000 with federal subsidies.

Additionally, a bag containing coins and medals that were minted during his pontificate were placed in the coffin.\n\n \"The lid was then placed on the zinc coffin, along with Francis’ cross and coat of arms and a plaque with the Pope's name and the duration of his life and Petrine ministry, while psalms were sung,\" the Vatican said.\n\n Afterwards, Francis' casket was sealed.\n\n Before his death at age 88, the pontiff outlined different burial plans from previous popes including that he wanted to be buried \"in the ground, without particular decoration\" and with the inscription of his papal name in Latin — “Franciscus” — according to Reuters.\n\n Austen Ivereigh, Francis' biographer, told the BBC that coins minted during his papacy — one for each year of his 12-year tenure — will be placed in a bag in his coffin.\n\n Unlike previous popes who were buried in St. Peter's Basilica, Francis opted to break with tradition and be interred in St. Mary Major, his favorite church.\n\n Several world leaders who are set to attend the pope's funeral on Saturday, April 26, include U.S. President Donald Trump and Prince William, who will be making the journey on behalf of his father King Charles and the rest of the British royal family.\n\n Francis died on Monday, April 21, at 7:35 a.m., according to the Vatican. His official cause of death was later confirmed to be a cerebral stroke that led to a coma and irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse.\n\n The pontiff was also affected by a \"previous episode of acute respiratory failure in bilateral multimicrobial pneumonia, multiple bronchiectasis, arterial hypertension, and type II diabetes,\" the church said.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In the final hours before his death, Francis delivered his yearly blessing for Easter as well as an address through Cardinal Angelo Comastri, who led Mass at Saint Peter’s Square. Additionally, he met with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and had \"a quiet dinner\" before his health deteriorated quickly on Monday morning. An hour after the \"first signs of the sudden illness\" appeared about 5:30 a.m., he fell into a coma.\n\n \"According to those who were with him in his final moments, he did not suffer. It all happened quickly,\" the Vatican continued, describing Francis' death as \"discreet ... almost sudden, without long suffering or public alarm.\"\n\n As for his final words, the Vatican said that saying \"thank you\" to his longtime health aide, Massimiliano Strappetti, was among his last messages.","summary":"Pope Francis' casket was sealed in St. Peter’s Basilica ahead of his funeral on Saturday, April 26","url":"https://people.com/pope-francis-coffin-sealed-before-funeral-11720780","image":"https://people.com/thmb/7f0tPApPNV_zGsAhPyImVWPgGF8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Pope-francis-coffin-sealed--8_04252025-a2cca7d631d0496892645a023b042e22.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:47:02","author":"Kimberlee Speakman","authors":["Kimberlee Speakman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.097},{"id":314909152,"title":"Tiana Lowe Doescher calls on Congress to take power from district judges","text":"“As Stephen Miller has said, in the Supreme Court, you need a majority of these five judges, whereas you could just have one district judge shut down everything?

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy ALESIA STANFORD FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:02 BST, 26 April 2025 |Updated:00:44 BST, 26 April 2025 \n\nGeorge Lucas has finally revealed the answer to a question Star Wars fans have had for decades. \nThe filmmaker, 80, whose Lucasfilm has confirmed a new Star Wars adventure starring Ryan Gosling, 44, was celebrating the 45th anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back in Los Angeles on the opening night of the 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival. \nIn his conversation with TCM's Ben Mankowitz, Lucas finally revealed the mystery behind Yoda's backward speech. \n'Because if you speak regular English, people won’t listen that much,' the director told the per Variety. \n'But if he had an accent, or it’s really hard to understand what he’s saying, they focus on what he’s saying.'\nDescribing the challenge he was facing, Lucas said Yoda 'was basically the philosopher of the movie. I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen — especially 12-year-olds.'\nThat appeared to have solved the problem. Since it's debut in 1980, The Empire Strikes Back has earned more than $550 million worldwide. \n\nGeorge Lucas, 80, revealed the answer to a question Star Wars fans have had for decades Thursday night at the 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival in Los Angeles\n\nWhen asked why Yoda spoke backwards, Lucas revealed 'Because if you speak regular English, people won’t listen that much,' according to Variety '\nFurther revealing his creative process, the director said, 'I write like a blueprint. It’s not got a lot of detail on it.'\n'And when I got the script [for ‘Star Wars’] done, there was a 130 to 180 pages,' he explained. \n\n George Lucas sports Star Wars tee in St. Barts despite selling rights to Disney in 2012 \n'So I cut it into three parts and said, \"I’ll focus on the first one, because we’ll never get enough money to make the whole thing.\"'\nLucas settle for what would today be seen as an astronomically small fee for making the original film, but he had a reason for doing so. \n'I said, \"I’ll do it for $50,000, to write and direct and produce… But I do want the sequels.\" And I wanted the rights because I’m going to make those movies no matter what happens to this one.'\nAnother unusual condition of the contract would end up changing his life, and the film industry. \n'I said, \"besides that, I’d like licensing.\" They went, \"What’s licensing?\"' and gave in to his terms. \n'They talked to themselves, and they went, \"He’s never going to be able to do that.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump called the effort to force a change \"ridiculous\" and \"an affront to our great Indian population.\" He added that he had directed his education secretary to \"fight for the people of Massapequa on this very important issue.\" The Department of Education's announcement Friday prominently included Trump's statement.What to KnowThe Massapequa School District is at the center of a heated controversy over its longtime \"Chiefs\" mascot after New York state education officials ordered districts to retire Native American-themed logos or risk losing funding. The directive, based on 2023 regulations aimed at ending the use of Indigenous names and imagery in public schools, prompted Massapequa to challenge the mandate in court—a challenge it ultimately lost.Supporters of the Massapequa Chiefs, including the Native American Guardian's Association, argue that preserving Native-themed mascots honors cultural heritage and is a matter of civil rights, while opponents maintain that such imagery is outdated and disrespectful.The investigation, initiated by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, stems from a complaint filed by the Native American Guardian's Association, a nonprofit advocating for the preservation of Native American imagery in sports and public life. The organization argues that the state's actions violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.New York's Department of Education declined to comment to the Associated Press Friday but previously defended its position. Spokesperson JP O'Hare pointed to the state Board of Regents' 2023 regulations aimed at ending \"demeaning Indigenous names and mascots\" in public schools, citing evidence that such imagery perpetuates harmful stereotypes.In 2021, following his first presidential term, Trump slammed Cleveland's Major League Baseball team for changing its name from the Indians to the Guardians, arguing it's a \"disgrace\" against Native Americans.\"Can anybody believe that the Cleveland Indians, a storied and cherished baseball franchise since taking the name in 1915, are changing their name to the Guardians? Such a disgrace, and I guarantee that the people who are most angry about it are the many Indians of our Country,\" Trump said in a statement.He continued, \"Wouldn't it be an honor to have a team named the Cleveland Indians, and wouldn't it be disrespectful to rip that name and logo off of those jerseys?\"What People Are SayingMcMahon accused New York officials of attempting to \"erase\" Native American history rather than honoring it, \"It is not lost on the Department that the state has chosen to target Native American imagery while allowing other mascots, such as the Vikings, Fighting Irish, and Cowboys, to remain,\" she said. \"We will investigate this matter fully.\"She also stated, \"The U.S. Department of Education will not stand by as the state of New York attempts to rewrite history and deny the town of Massapequa the right to celebrate its heritage in its schools.\"O'Hare said told AP, \"Disrespecting entire groups of people is wrong in any context, but especially in our schools, where all students should feel welcome and supported.He also noted that Massapequa did not engage with Indigenous leaders during the rulemaking process and instead challenged the regulations in court — and lost: \"It is ironic that the federal government now seeks to intervene on an issue that is squarely reserved to the States.\"Frank Blackcloud, vice president of the Native American Guardian's Association, welcomed the federal investigation, telling AP, \"The preservation of Native themes and imagery in New York public schools is not only a matter of cultural dignity but a fundamental civil right for all students.\"Kerry Wachter, president of the Massapequa Board of Education, thanked the Trump administration for its support in a statement to AP, \"We appreciate the administration standing with Massapequa in our effort to preserve the Chiefs name and honor our community's proud history.\"What Happens NextThe June deadline for complying with the mascot mandate looms. Under state rules, schools that refuse to comply face the loss of state funding and possible removal of district leadership.Reporting by the Associated Press contributed to this story.","summary":"The move comes just after President Trump weighed in on the dispute surrounding Massapequa High School's longtime \"Chiefs\" logo.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-investigating-new-york-school-native-american-mascot-fight-2064466","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2633675/chiefs-mascot.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:40:48","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":314908052,"title":"Where will Trump sit during Pope Francis’ funeral? It’s complicated","text":"They may be the most powerful people on earth, but for the seating arrangement at Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday, all foreign leaders will play second fiddle to the Argentines and Italians and surrender to the whims of the French alphabet.\nAbout 130 foreign delegations had so far expressed their desire to attend the funeral, the Vatican said on Friday, and more were expected to do so throughout the day. Those include around 50 heads of state who have been confirmed as attending, among them US President Donald Trump and 10 reigning monarchs.\nApart from the VIPs, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend the funeral in St. Peter’s Square, which starts at 10am on Saturday. Italian police have laid on one of the most complex security operations in decades.\nThe official delegations will sit at a section to the right of the altar at the top of the steps leading toward St. Peter’s Basilica. Pride of place goes to Argentina, Francis’ native country, whose president, Javier Milei, will sit in the front row.\nMilei, a maverick right-wing libertarian, had heaped insults on Francis while he was campaigning in 2023, calling him an “imbecile who defends social justice”. But the president shifted his tone after he took office that year.\n\nNext comes Italy, the country that surrounds the Vatican and which agreed in 1929 to recognise its sovereignty as the world’s smallest state. It gets the second-best seats in the VIP section also because the pope is bishop of Rome and primate of the Catholic bishops of Italy.\nThat is when the alphabet in French – still considered the language of diplomacy – kicks in for the other delegations. The countries following Italy are ordered according to their names in French and not in their native languages.\nSo, it is États-Unis and not United States, Allemagne instead of Deutschland (Germany), and Pays-Bas instead of Nederland (the Netherlands).\nRoyalty will take precedence.

The new spending will push the Baltic country to an average defence spending of 5.4% of GDP through to 2029, up from previous levels of around 3.4%.“We made a historic decision from the point of view of Estonian national defence. We have never allocated so much additional money to national defence in one year in Estonia,” said Hanno Pevkur, Estonian Defence Minister.“Already next year, defence spending will rise to about 5.4% of GDP, or over 2% in one year, and it will stay there for quite a long time,” noted Pevkur.“The four-year average is also 5.4%, and this will give us the opportunity to meet the military capability goals that we have agreed on in NATO,” he added.The government’s decision to raise defence spending will result in a substantial increase in the number of military capabilities, equipment and stockpiles as well as more ammunition for the Estonian Defence Forces (EDF).More medium-range air defence, additional engineers, long-range reconnaissance battalions, long-range strike capabilities, modern communications systems, increased naval capabilities, additional personal, among others, are all to be included in the new bill.EDF chief, General Andrus Merilo said that the need to strengthen Estonia's defence stems from a deteriorating security environment caused by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He also cited Russia building up its operational capabilities as another threat to Estonia.According to Merilo, Estonia must not only catch up to the enemy's capability development but even outpace it. The additional funding approved by the government decision will be used for precisely that purpose.“Our security policy situation simply puts us in this position, and in order to be ready for our tasks, we must not only keep up with the military development of our adversary, but if possible, at least take a step forward together with our allies in the coming years,” said Merilo.Estonia’s new plans come just weeks before the upcoming NATO summit, set to take place in The Hague on 24-25 June. They also come after US President Donald Trump threatened to shake up the alliance if his demands of a revised 5% figure are not met.Trump had previously called out NATO members for “piggy-backing” on Washington for their security. The 47th US president had claimed that European allies were not investing into their defence, leaving their defence to NATO, and more broadly the US.He also called the 2% targets agreed upon by members under former Secretary General of the alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, ‘pathetic’, threatening to withdraw the US from NATO if members do not achieve defence spending of at least 5% of GDP.","summary":"Estonia’s government approved the multi-billion Euro plans that will see the Baltic country boost its defence investments to over 5% of GDP, in line with Trump’s demands for NATO members.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/26/estonian-government-approves-additional-funding-to-raise-defence-spending-to-54-of-gdp","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/23/55/64/1440x810_cmsv2_4f58f58a-9839-5b45-af53-91678e6171aa-9235564.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:34:38","author":"Malek Fouda","authors":["Malek Fouda"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.048},{"id":314906428,"title":"Trump demands ‘high level’ Moscow-Kyiv meeting as Russian general killed by car bomb","text":"US president Donald Trump has urged Kremlin and Kyiv to meet to “finish” a deal to end the Ukraine War, declaring major points had now been agreed to in a day of peace talks that coincided with the bombing of a Russian general.\n\nTrump said a deal was “very close” and demanded both sides “stop the bloodshed, NOW” in a late night post on his Truth Social platform on Friday following a meeting between Russian president Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nThe meeting occurred after Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy chief in the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, was killed by an explosive device that was placed in his car and rigged with shrapel in Balashikha, a city just 13 miles east of Moscow.\n\n“A good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine. They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to “finish it off.” Most of the major points are agreed to. Stop the bloodshed, NOW. We will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the END to this cruel and senseless war!” Trump posted.\n\nRussian media ran videos of a vehicle burning in the courtyard of an apartment building, and the Kremlin blamed the explosion death on Ukraine.\n\nSpokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “The Kyiv regime once again simply shows its true nature. The Kyiv regime continues to be involved in terrorist activity on the territory of our country.”\n\nIt was the second such killing of a top general in Moscow, following the death of Russia’s chemical weapons chief Igor Kirillov in December. Kyiv took responsibility for Kirillov’s death, accusing him of involvement in war crimes.\n\nThe bombing, which was reported by the Kommersant newspaper to have also killed a second person, came as property mogul-turned-Trump envoy Steve Witkoff was meeting the Russian president in Moscow to discuss Washington’s peace proposals.\n\nKremlin footage showed Mr Witkoff and Mr Putin shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries before sitting down on opposite sides of a white oval table, in what was their fourth lengthy meeting since February.\n\nMr Witkoff – who has alarmed Kyiv’s allies by praising Putin as “super-smart” and “not a bad guy” while also parroting Kremlin propaganda – was seen strolling through central Moscow with senior Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev before the three-hour meeting.\n\nAfterwards, the Kremlin said the meeting had been constructive and had helped to narrow the differences over ending Russia’s war, with the possibility of direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow also discussed.\n\nDetails of Washington’s “final offer” – and Kyiv’s counterproposals – emerged on Friday, as Mr Trump ramped up pressure on Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky to accept territorial concessions.\n\nAccusing Mr Zelensky of prolonging the “killing field” by refusing to cede Crimea to Putin, the US president insisted this week that the territory illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 has been lost for good and was not up for discussion.\n\nIn a Time interview published on Friday, Mr Trump said the peninsula would remain with Moscow – suggesting that would be the case under a US-brokered peace deal.\n\nMr Trump claimed that Mr Zelensky understood that “Crimea will stay with Russia”, adding: “Everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time.”\n\n“They’ve had their submarines there for long before any period that we’re talking about – for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea,” said Mr Trump. “But this was given by Obama. This wasn’t given by Trump.”\n\nBut Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky hit back, insisting the Crimean peninsula belonged to his country, citing both the constitution and international law.\n\n“Our position is unchanged: only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian,” he said.\n\nMr Zelensky has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine will not recognise Russia’s occupation of Crimea under any agreement.\n\nThe US proposals, published by Reuters on Friday, do not call on Ukraine to recognise Crimea as Russian, but state that Washington will legally recognise Russia’s control over the peninsula.\n\nIt will also recognise the de facto Russian control over the occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, and parts of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Kherson. Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which is the largest such facility in Europe, will be returned to Ukraine – but kept under US control and administration.\n\nEuropean and Ukrainian officials responded to the proposals, which have been shared by Washington during meetings in Paris and Russia over the past two weeks.\n\nThe European and Ukrainian proposal states that territorial issues will be discussed and resolved after a full and unconditional ceasefire, while territorial negotiations will start from the basis of the line of control.\n\nThere is no mention in the European document of recognising Russian control over any Ukrainian territory. There are also differences over the lifting of sanctions on Russia, the shape of security guarantees for Ukraine, and the size of the Ukrainian military.\n\nAs details of the proposals emerged on Friday, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, suggested that Ukraine might have to cede land to achieve peace.\n\n“One of the scenarios is ... to give up territory. It’s not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporarily,” Mr Klitschko told the BBC.\n\nBut the former world champion heavyweight boxer emphasised that the Ukrainian people would “never accept occupation” by Russia.\n\nSerhi Leshchenko, an adviser to Mr Zelensky, hit back at Mr Klitschko soon afterwards, telling the BBC World Service’s Newsday programme: “I think it’s counterproductive to make any comments on this topic, since we have no official proposal on the table regarding this.\n\n“Any discussion of this violates the Ukrainian constitution, because Ukraine’s constitution states the territorial integrity of Ukraine,” the presidential aide said, adding that it was “very important” that Ukrainian politicians abide by the constitution.\n\nFormer British prime minister Boris Johnson was among those to condemn Mr Trump’s proposals. Warning that Ukraine would “get nothing” under the US plans, Mr Johnson accused Washington of rewarding Putin for “indiscriminately butchering” more civilians in attacks on Kyiv this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump again slated Mr Zelensky, this time blaming him for not having signed an agreement on rare earths with the US.\n\nThe US president wrote on social media that it was at least three weeks late.\n\nIn fact, just last week Ukrainian officials announced they had signed an outline of a minerals deal with the US and said a final accord could be reached by the end of this week.\n\nIt came as the UN’s refugee agency warned it was being forced to reduce support for newly displaced people in Ukraine as frontline attacks intensify – blaming the Trump administration’s suspension of US aid along with broader cuts in funding from donors.\n\n“Some of the programmes that we previously used to implement with the generous support of US funding are on hold,” said Karolina Lindholm Billing, the UNHCR’s representative in Ukraine.\n\nThe suspended programmes include psychosocial support – which is needed on a huge scale – along with emergency shelter material and cash assistance, the agency said.\n\nSince January, nearly 9,000 people fleeing heavy shelling in Ukraine have passed through the UNHCR’s transit centres in Pavlohrad and Sumy, where the agency is providing clothes, hygiene kits, and legal and psychosocial support.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russian-general-killed-bomb-near-210921556.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/aed7bbb121100df0f7aeebdc759c6623","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:32:43","author":"Andy Gregory And Alex Croft","authors":["Andy Gregory And Alex Croft"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":314905408,"title":"Huge crowds pack Vatican for last day of Pope's lying in state","text":"Some 250,000 people paid their respects to Pope Francis during a three-day lying in state at St Peter's Basilica, the Vatican said on Friday, as public viewing ended and world leaders began gathering for his funeral.French President Emmanuel Macron was among the last to pay his respects, with the overall crowds exceeding the estimated 195,000 who came to see Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI after his death in 2022.\"What a great man! He loved everyone, every religion,\" said 53-year-old Italian Igho Felici after viewing Francis's open coffin, adding: \"I had to be here.\"Throughout the day, vast crowds of people had packed Via della Conciliazione, the wide avenue leading to the basilica, pilgrims and tourists mingling with Italians enjoying the 25 April public holiday.Francis's body — wearing a red chasuble, white mitre and black shoes, with a rosary laced around his fingers — was closed in his wooden coffin in a private ceremony at 8:00 pm. As per tradition, a white silk veil was placed on his face and a bag with coins and medals minted during his 12-year pontificate was placed in the coffin.US President Donald Trump is among 50 heads of state and over a dozen royals expected to attend Saturday's funeral, alongside around 200,000 mourners.Italian and Vatican authorities have placed the area around St Peter's under tight security with drones blocked, snipers on roofs and fighter jets on standby.Further checkpoints will be activated on Friday night, police said. Global tributesThe Catholic Church's first Latin American pope died on Monday aged 88, less than a month after his release from hospital where he spent weeks fighting severe pneumonia.\"It was like saying goodbye to a father\" who \"loved me and will continue to love me as and more than before,\" said Filipa Castronovo, 76, an Italian nun.The pontiff, who had long suffered failing health, defied doctors' orders by making a public appearance on Easter Sunday, the most important moment in the Catholic calendar.It was his last public appearance.Condolences have flooded in from around the world for the Jesuit, an energetic reformer who championed those on the fringes of society as head of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.He used his last speech to rail against those who stir up \"contempt... towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants\".\"It's impressive to see all these people,\" French cardinal Francois-Xavier Bustillo said of the queueing crowds, describing Francis as \"a man of the people. \"It's a beautiful response, a beautiful embrace of his ministry, of his pontificate,\" he added.The Vatican has said more than 130 foreign delegations are confirmed for the funeral, including Argentina's President Javier Milei and Britain's Prince William, many of whom began arriving early on Friday morning.Trump is expected to arrive on Friday evening for a visit of less than 24 hours, his first foreign trip of his second term.Accompanied by his wife Melania, Trump will face many foreign leaders but no meetings have been announced.The presence of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky was in doubt after he said he may miss the funeral due to important \"military meetings\" following a deadly Russian strike on Kyiv. Selfie banOn Thursday the Vatican banned people from taking photos inside the basilica, a move that eased the queue. It came after some mourners took selfies with the coffin.After the funeral, Francis's coffin will be driven at a walking pace for burial at his favourite church, Rome's papal basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.The hearse will pass down Rome's Fori Imperiali — where the city's ancient temples lie — and past the Colosseum, according to officials.Big screens will be set up along the route on which to watch the ceremony, according to Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who estimated the crowds at around 200,000.Francis was a champion of the underdog, and a group of \"poor and needy\" will be at Santa Maria Maggiore to welcome the coffin, the Vatican said.Francis will be interred in the ground, his simple tomb marked with just one word: Franciscus.People will be able to visit the tomb from Sunday morning, as all eyes turn to the process of choosing Francis's successor. Eyeing the conclaveCardinals from around the world have been returning to Rome for the funeral and the election of a new pope.They have been meeting every day to agree the next steps, but have yet to announce a date for the conclave.Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Hollerich, a Jesuit who was a close adviser to Francis, said the conclave would likely begin on 5 or 6 May.This is right after the nine days of mourning declared by the Holy See, which ends on 4 May.Only those under the age of 80 -- currently some 135 cardinals -- are eligible to vote.Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who was number two to Francis, is the favourite, according to British bookmakers William Hill.They put him ahead of Filipino Luis Antonio Tagle, the Metropolitan Archbishop emeritus of Manila, followed by Ghana's Cardinal Peter Turkson, and Matteo Zuppi, the Archbishop of Bologna.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/25/huge-crowds-pack-vatican-for-last-day-of-popes-lying-in-state","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-23/wzo0v8bi/00043877EQ.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:32:25","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.164},{"id":314908664,"title":"Letters: Trump crypto coins and dinner continue the grift","text":"Trump coins, dinner\ncontinue the grift\n\nI’ve been reading about Donald Trump’s crypto riches after checking out his official $TRUMP coin website.

For over 200 years, Americans have understood and kept the promise, not needing the threat of legal consequences, and we have kept our democracy.\n\nEither this current administration and those who support it are ignorant of the responsibility and maturity required to be an American, or they are scam artists who have looked for all the loopholes and now gleefully use them to destroy us. They may be correct that they are not breaking the law. Worse, they’re literally breaking the promise.\n\nNow is the time to fight for America and the promise. Don’t back down. Find a demonstration.

His actions were destined to bring the national economy to its knees and needlessly infuriate the entire world against America.\n\nTo be truly great, you need not hobble the competition, just outrun and outthink it, much like China is currently doing. Project 2025 doesn’t address China’s dominance in AI and other technologies, so Trump has no game plan. Thus, he thrashes about wildly as is typical of his brand of leadership by whipsaw chaos.\n\nWe can only hope that our weak judiciary can slow his roll until midterms.

Under the two-step deal, Skydance is set to acquire Redstone’s National Amusements holding company, which controls 77.4% of the Paramount Class A common stock outstanding, before merging with the Hollywood studio.\n\nCharles E. Phillips, Jr., who led the board’s special committee that reached the Skydance deal, received $478,009 in total compensation.His package included $266,000 in fees, $198,227 in stock awards and $13,782 reflecting a change in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings. Phillips exited the board in October to focus more of his time on Recognize, an investment firm he co-founded and launched back in 2020.\n\nIn addition, four other board members stepped down in the midst of merger talks with Skydance: Frederick Terrell, Nicole Seligman, Dawn Ostroff and Robert Klieger. Terrell received a package of $226,020 in 2024, while Seligman took in $208,000, Ostroff was paid $157,500; and Klieger received $50,039.\n\nThe other remaining board members include Barbara Byrne, who was paid $537,227; Linda Griego, who received $527,077; Judith McHale, who was given $544,738; and Susan Schuman, who was paid $516,227. \n\nThe Skydance deal, which was brokered in July, has been stuck in limbo due to regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses.\n\nSeveral parties have filed petitions to the agency in connection with the deal, including investor Mario Gabelli, who is seeking to pause the review as he investigates “potential fiduciary and/or federal securities violations,” Hollywood’s Teamsters Union, LiveVideoAi.Corp, Fuse Media, conservative law firm The Center for American Rights, which has accused the company of “news distortion,” and Project Rise Partners, which has made an alternative $13.5 billion offer to acquire Paramount. Skydance has asked the FCC to dismiss the objections. It also blasted PRP’s bid as “belated” and “unserious” and said it contains “overwhelming evidence of fraud.”\n\nOther Paramount shareholders who have called out the deal include The Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, who the Delaware Court ordered the media giant to turn documents over to for a similar investigation into potential corporate wrongdoing, Scott Baker, who has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit arguing the Skydance deal could cost shareholders $1.65 billion in damages, as well as the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), which believes the damages could exceed that figure.\n\nSeparately, President Donald Trump has called for CBS News’ broadcast license to be revoked and is suing the network for $20 billion over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS and Trump are in settlement talks and have reportedly agreed to a mediator.\n\nThe Skydance deal triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close on April 7. \n\nIf the deal is not closed by July 6, the deadline will be automatically pushed another 90 days to Oct. 4. After that, if the deal is still not closed, or if a regulator blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal. \n\nExercising that option would leave Paramount on the hook to pay Skydance a $400 million breakup fee.","summary":"The media giant's board of directors raked in a combined $3.8 million in compensation for the year\n\n\nThe post Paramount&#8217;s Shari Redstone Was Paid $523,000 in 2024 appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/shari-redstone-paramount-2024-salary/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shari-redstone.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:29:13","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":314909320,"title":"San Diego immigration attorney and legal rep among U.S. citizens told to self-deport","text":"Two San Diegans who represent immigrants in court are among a number of other U.S. citizens nationwide who have recently reported receiving emails from the government telling them they must leave the country.\n\n“It’s time for you to leave the United States,” reads the first line of emails sent by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to at least two legal experts who work for a San Diego nonprofit that helps immigrants. Both emails were sent within minutes of each other on the night of April 10.\n\nImmigration attorneys in Massachusetts and Los Angeles, as well as a doctor in Connecticut, have also received immigration parole termination emails, despite being U.S. citizens, according to news reports around the country.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of DHS, has acknowledged that some notices “may have been sent to unintended recipients.” But the notices have nonetheless stirred confusion and concern amid the Trump administration’s continuing crackdown on immigration.\n\n“I thought it was weird,” said San Diego attorney Adam Peña, considering he was born in El Paso, Texas. He said his family immigrated to the U.S. more than a century ago. “I was a little stunned by it. Like, ‘Why would I get this?’”\n\nCBP started issuing notices terminating parole to individuals who do not have permanent lawful status to remain in the country, including but not limited to asylum seekers who entered through the CBP One app process, a spokesperson said.\n\nThose who followed the process, which was introduced under the Biden administration, were generally paroled into the United States while their cases were pending. More than 900,000 people secured an appointment through that process since it was put in place in January 2023.\n\n“CBP used the known email addresses of the alien to send notifications,” the agency spokesperson said. “If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients. CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nPeña said he wasn’t overly concerned that he was in actual danger. “Because I know what I am — I’m a U.S. citizen,” he said.\n\nBut still, some doubt crept into his mind. Could he somehow be swept up in an immigration raid? Could he be detained?\n\n“But I was just more frustrated by the recklessness, the carelessness, the disregard this government has for people,” Peña said.\n\nPeña said he’s considering carrying his birth certificate and passport with him in the future, something his mother has urged him and his older brother to do.\n\n“Now is probably a good time to start doing that, with more stories of U.S. citizens getting swept up without due process,” he said, citing the immigration arrest and detention of a U.S. citizen in Florida and President Donald Trump’s recent comments expressing a desire to deport U.S. citizens to Salvadoran prisons.\n\nAnd he worries that because he received the email, he may be on some sort of government list or database now, particularly because his work puts him in frequent contact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies, and because he describes himself as an outspoken advocate for immigrant rights.\n\n‘I don’t want to be another error’\n\nAldo Martínez Gómez, an accredited representative in immigration court, was born in National City. Still, he received an email encouraging him to leave the country on his own because his supposed parole had expired.\n\n“Do not attempt to remain in the United States — the federal government will find you. Please depart the United States immediately,” the email reads.\n\nEven though he is a U.S. citizen, Martínez Gómez admitted that he had some concerns, given the current immigration climate. In Arizona and Florida, there have been some reported cases of American citizens being wrongfully detained.\n\n“I don’t want to be another error,” he said.\n\nBut the first thing he asked when he read the notice was: “How did they get my email?”\n\nHe said that none of his clients asked for his email address to complete their paperwork. He also noted that while he helped clients who entered the country through CBP One, he met with them later, once they were already in the U.S. and after an email address had already been provided as part of the application.\n\nHe said it was worrying to see that the same thing had happened to others who shared his profession. Martínez Gómez considered it an act of intimidation.\n\nThe email appeared to be an automated message, and Martínez Gómez said he was confused and couldn’t respond to it to ask for clarification.\n\nAs a border resident, Martínez Gómez usually carries his U.S. passport card in case he needs to cross the border into Tijuana. Now, he also takes his birth certificate with him.","summary":"The government has acknowledged that some notices \"may have been sent to unintended recipients\"","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/25/san-diego-immigration-attorney-and-legal-rep-among-u-s-citizens-told-to-self-deport/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SUT-L-LAWYER-LETTERS-0426x002-1.jpg?w=1024&h=753","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:27:44","author":"Alex Riggins,Alexandra Mendoza","authors":["Alex Riggins","Alexandra Mendoza"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.02},{"id":314904548,"title":"Weezer bassist's 'attempted murderer' wife totes GUN in wild bodycam footage before being shot by cops","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Apr 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack P Shepherd WINS Celebrity Big Brother with Danny Beard finishing as runner-up\n\nDonald Trump lands in Italy for Pope Francis' funeral: US president looks solemn as he steps off of Air Force One with wife Melania\n\nWoman who stabbed man, 61, to death in racist attack after calling herself the 'Charles Bronson of Bristol' told care worker she was going to 'get the Jamaican drug dealer' minutes earlier\n\nThe truth behind the dramatic rise in autism - and why the consequences could be catastrophic: DR LISA WILLIAMS\n\nI'm proof you DON'T need to be on Ozempic for life to keep the weight off - but you have to follow these seven rules doctors don't tell you if you really want to stay slim for good\n\nI can't bear to say my one-year-old's name out loud because it's so embarrassing\n\nIoan Gruffudd and Bianca Wallace are MARRIED!

after shadow finance minister Jane Hume’s speech to a friendly think tank revealed the Coalition wanted to end working from home for public servants, phones in Peter Dutton’s office and Liberal HQ ran hot.\n\nCabinet colleagues were blindsided by Hume’s announcement, and some now say they would have tried to bat it off had the policy been canvassed more widely internally.\n\nBoth MPs and Liberal insiders say they wanted to warn how poorly the plan would be received by the voters they’re trying to win over well before Labor started talking about the issue.\n\nAnd those fears were thrown to the fore as door-knocking began.\n\nThe issue was being raised by people across the country with even Labor insiders saying they didn’t anticipate how much cut-through it would have.\n\nBut it took a month for the Liberal leadership to act.\n\nThe work-from-home debacle, an imposing Donald Trump presidency and a perceived flimsy policy agenda have all been cited repeatedly in conversations this week with almost 20 Coalition insiders — in Parliament and outside of it.\n\nThose conversations poured over how the party squandered its months-long leading position in the polls.\n\nWhile Australians have been inclined to give governments a second term in every election since 1931, this would be the first time in more than two decades the same prime minister has won two elections in a row.\n\nAnd any post-election review, one senior Liberal source believes, must be frank: “We have no idea how to develop policy and no campaign machinery”.\n\nEveryone has a different answer on the question of who is to blame for the lack of yeast in the Opposition’s numbers ahead of polling day, but it’s widely agreed there is a disconnect between the leader’s office and party headquarters.\n\nSome say it is the campaign which is letting Dutton down, others say there’s too much freelancing by the leader without heeding the overarching strategy.\n\nYet others say both elements need to change.\n\n“When things go wrong, it’s often a chain reaction,” Redbridge pollster and former Liberal strategist Tony Barry says. “There’s seldom one particular policy or personality or event. It’s a combination of things that have gone wrong.”\n\nUnlike Anthony Albanese or Scott Morrison, who travelled with consiglieres and kept in close contact with their party bosses, Dutton runs his own game.\n\nHe has called in frontbenchers as needed — Michael Sukkar to talk housing and eventually Andrew Hastie for defence policies — but there is no coterie of cabinet confidantes travelling with him constantly.\n\nHe has his staffers — the top adviser in his travelling party is chief of staff Alex Dalgleish, who has been with him since the Coalition won government in 2013, and his director of communications, Nicole Chant — but they stay largely out of the limelight.\n\nBut Dutton has also added a more personal touch to his travelling party — where possible he brings his wife Kirilly and children Harry, Tom and Rebecca along. Though his decision to thrust 20-year-old Harry into the national spotlight by letting him be quizzed at press conference had political observers scratching their heads.\n\nDespite that, the leader’s office has largely “bunkered down”, according to one source, and was overly guarded even before the campaign. That meant it could be out of step with the approach from party HQ — never a good thing in a tight election race.\n\nAnother source says the national campaign led by Dutton is yet to get out of first gear, something that has been echoed by media pundits around the country.\n\nWith one week before polls close, however, no one is writing off the Coalition yet.\n\nThe many faces of Dutton\n\nThe best and worst thing about Dutton, a senior Liberal laments, is that when he walks into a room people hate him and by the time he leaves, they love him.\n\n“He has a great sense of humour,” people often say of Dutton, with more than a tinge of surprise.\n\nIf only it was possible for a leader to meet every voter and convert them one-by-one.\n\nDutton has opened up in recent years about how his pre-politics career on the Queensland police force, including with the sex offenders squad, has shaped him.\n\n“I think my time as a police officer, where you see some truly horrible things, you’re dealing with victims of crime who are in the worst moment in their lives… I do think you become hardened,” he said this week. “I’ve always been serious in my public life as a police officer, and since I’ve been in Parliament, in protecting people. And I’m very genuine about that.”\n\nThis “hard man” persona has been cultivated over years, driven by his black-and-white view of the world, compounded by holding the immigration, home affairs and defence portfolios.\n\nIt makes a campaign strategy of presenting the “warm and cuddly” side, to soften people’s view of him, feel disingenuous. The approach also collides with the three years of attacks on Albanese, calling him too “weak” and saying a tough leader is what the nation needs.\n\nOne Liberal source said the campaign should abandon the softer approach in the final week and let Dutton be the version of himself that put the Coalition in a competitive place ahead of the election.\n\nIf the public were being told the times suited a “tough bastard”, why offer up anything but?\n\nWinning polls or winning seats?\n\nThe cautionary tale of Scott Morrison’s “miracle” victory and Bill Shorten’s shock loss in 2019 is repeatedly raised on both sides of the aisle.\n\nIt offers hope to the Coalition and a warning to the Labor camp on the dangers of over-confidence and relying on polls.\n\nA comparison of the poll trends ahead of that campaign and this one show very different pictures. The increased vote for minor parties and subsequent rise in the number of seats expected to go down to preferences means this election feels more like 150 individual by-elections.\n\nMultiple sources say the national trend doesn’t necessarily reflect what’s happening on the ground in key seats with unexpected results foreshadowed right across the country.\n\n“I think there’s a big disparity you’re seeing in some of the published polls to what we’re seeing,” Dutton said last weekend.\n\nSome Liberals are confident their message is being heard in those key seats. Others fear they are being out-campaigned by the Labor machine, led by marginal seat-specialist Paul Erickson.\n\nPolicy tank running on empty\n\nAlready starting the election on the backfoot, not knowing when it would be called, was compounded by what multiple opposition MPs feel was a lack of policies to speak to voters about — especially on the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nHow were they meant to convince people they would be better off under the Coalition without being able to explain why, many wondered.\n\nDutton spent much of the first official campaign week fielding questions about how his broad-brush policies would work. It was difficult to discern the pattern in where he was campaigning and why.\n\nHis key policy is saving people money at the fuel bowser by giving them back 25c a litre, but he failed to visit a petrol station in week one. He has perhaps overcorrected for this since.\n\nThen, a Melbourne rail funding announcement was made at a winery, miles from where the train line would be built, which shadow infrastructure minister Bridget McKenzie said they had been told was what the media wanted.\n\nOppositions need to make two cases: one against the government and another of why people should switch to them.\n\nThe Coalition has been successful on the first, but too slow on the second. It has left people unhappy with Labor, but not really seeing a reason to change.\n\nIt was the “one thing clearly missing”, a source says.\n\nAnother senior party figure says it seemed the shadow cabinet hadn’t done the work to formulate policies or shape the narrative about why their answers were better.\n\nThis was exemplified in health, where the Coalition swiftly adopted almost every Labor announcement despite Dutton and shadow minister Anne Ruston insisting they had worked on their own solutions.\n\nOn this front, Barry says Labor’s “brutal Mediscare campaign” had been incredibly effective, driving down the Liberals’ primary vote.\n\n“That scare campaign was so effective in part because the Liberal Party left the policy releases too late or without sufficient detail,” he says.\n\nThe party was well-prepared for a March election but not for a May poll, another source says: “Tactically, we ended up being a bit listless.”\n\nAnother problem is policy development has been siloed with ideas developed in the leader’s office — or between Dutton and select shadow ministers — without using the traditional backbench policy committees as a sounding board.\n\nMultiple sources say Sukkar only got housing announcements over the internal line 24 hours before Dutton announced them at the Coalition’s campaign launch.\n\nANU political analyst Mark Kenny says Dutton’s big claim he has unity had been “purchased” by not having any fights in policy or personnel.\n\n“Those two things, they gave him the illusion of a very unified team. But they’re unified around just beating the government, rather than unified around a policy vision,” he says.\n\n“And I think that’s showing. It’s one of the big weaknesses they have. They don’t look ready for government.”\n\nThe 12-month fuel tax cut has given MPs something to talk about, but holding it back to the budget reply on the eve of the election mean it hasn’t landed as strongly as they hoped.\n\nSeveral insiders also lament the party is not prosecuting its one big idea — nuclear power — with any vigour.\n\nOn top of this, the stop-start nature of this campaign — with consecutive public holidays and the death of the Pontif — has made it difficult to gain momentum. Senior sources conceded this has been worse for the Coalition after a “choppy” start meant it already had ground to make up.\n\nThe Trump card\n\nOne of the biggest, uncontrollable influences on the campaign has been Donald Trump.\n\nThe US President’s antics were bubbling along as mildly worrying background noise for most people. That was until his Oval Office confrontation with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. Then came the “Liberation Day” tariffs.\n\nPractically overnight, Dutton’s previously smart-looking cosying up to further-right elements of the Trump agenda turned into one big negative.\n\n“When the Coalition goes back and reviews the election, they’ll see internal polling for both sides — the tariffs were just a massive turning point,” Barry says.\n\n“Not to say Dutton was cruising for a majority victory before that, but that was the point it became incredibly difficult. Because you’re asking the electorate to take on more risk in a time of great uncertainty.”\n\nLabor’s focus-group research has also pointed to the tariffs as a sliding-door moment for the Coalition.\n\nEconomic uncertainty and global instability meant the party was left holding a basket full of Trump-lite policies, such as public service cuts and ending work from home — all of which were suddenly liabilities.\n\n“Trump is kryptonite,” one Liberal says, with MPs and candidates on both sides reporting the figure was coming up unprompted when speaking with voters.\n\nOther Liberals are concerned conservatives like Tony Abbott — who has been prominent on the campaign trail this election — and his former chief of staff turned Sky News host Peta Credlin held too much sway with Dutton and had convinced him the party needed to lean more to the right.\n\nFlipping and flopping\n\nDutton reportedly told a state Liberal Party conference last year he had no intention of doing somersaults to win back teal voters. His focus was solely on appealing to mortgage-holders in outer suburbs.\n\nBut it was these very voters — who face long commutes and poor services — who heard the announcement about potentially bringing an end to public servants working from home and feared it would ripple out to the private sector.\n\nWith so many pieces of the Trump agenda dotted throughout the Coalition’s platform at the time, people saw the work-from-home issue as a symbolic policy that would empower their own bosses to enforce office attendance.\n\nSo, after staunchly backing his the policy, Dutton and Hume performed a very public backflip at the start of week two. But the damage had already been done.\n\nAnd it also handed Labor another potent attack line: voters can’t trust Dutton to keep his word when he can’t even keep a policy for a month.\n\nFurther confusion in other policy areas, including immigration and electric vehicle tax breaks, fed into the same lines of attack.\n\nSo, can Dutton’s campaign be recovered? \n\nDespite the air of gloominess about the state of the campaign, barely anyone within camp Coalition is giving up.\n\nAlbanese’s big campaign machine is expected to keep churning without pulling any punches, but an Anzac Day reset that saw Dutton downing beers and enjoying a game of two-up, might be just what the Opposition leader needs.\n\nClawing back “soft voters” who might not make up their minds until they walk into the polling booth needs to happen in this final week to give the Liberals life in the new-look parliament.\n\nYaron Finkelstein, who was Morrison’s chief political adviser, says those are the voters the Opposition must focus on.\n\n“It will need to be a clear message on how the last three years of Labor is the proof they need that Albanese won’t be able to give them the change they want and need over the next three years,” he says.\n\n“They almost need to say to voters that if you think Albanese did a bad job over the last couple of years, don’t reward him with your vote.\n\n“This last week has to be very much about giving a voter some direction on what their vote can be used for. Use it to stop something, use it to get something. That’s how the last week needs to be framed.”\n\nLiberal MPs are so far feeling buoyed by the reception on pre-poll booths since they opened on Tuesday. Although the savvier among them note early voters are typically more favourable to the Coalition and that Australians are generally polite.\n\nWinning a majority government is increasingly unlikely, but there is still hope that a grab-bag of unexpected results on May 3 could still get the party in a close enough position to negotiate some kind of minority rule.\n\nMany Liberal insiders are not getting ahead of themselves either way.\n\n“Save the post-mortems for afterwards,” was the message from more than one.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ellen Ransley, Caitlyn Rintoul and Nicola Smith.","summary":"Everyone has a different answer to the question of who is to blame for a campaign that hasn’t gotten out of first gear, but no one is willing to write the Coalition off completely with a week still to go.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/federal-election-2025/federal-election-2025-inside-peter-duttons-campaign-of-a-hard-man-with-a-soft-heart-c-18481032","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18481032/29cd0f1e46dc9830e0b956ccf469e4ec05c3ada2-16x9-x0y31w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:26:54","author":"Ellen Ransley,Katina Curtis","authors":["Ellen Ransley","Katina Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":314902250,"title":"Donald Trump claims his pledge to end the Ukraine war within a day of becoming president was 'said in jest' as US envoy flies to Moscow and tells Putin: 'So good to see you'","text":"Donald Trump has claimed his promise to end the Ukraine war within a day of becoming President was made 'in jest'.\n\nThe US leader's astonishing climbdown from one of his central campaign promises came as his special envoy was welcomed with open arms by Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday.\n\nSteve Witkoff, who has yet to travel to Kyiv, touched down for his fourth meeting with the Russian dictator.\n\nHe beamed as he shook hands with Putin and told the dictator it was 'so good to see you' before they sat down for three hours of talks.\n\nBut efforts to secure a ceasefire were still stalled last night, with the Kremlin only remarking the meeting had been 'constructive'.\n\nPutin's aide, Yuri Ushakov, said the conversation 'made it possible to bring the parties' positions closer together not only on the Ukrainian issue, but also on a number of other international topics'.\n\nThe meeting took place as Time magazine published an interview with Mr Trump which included his U-turn on the previous promise to end the war within a day of entering the White House.\n\n'I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point.' he said. 'Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.'\n\nHe appeared irritated when asked why negotiations were taking so long, adding: 'Well, I don't think it's long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago.\n\n'This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It's not my war.'\n\nHe also suggested Kyiv was to blame for Russia's invasion in 2022. Ukraine's desire to join Nato 'caused the war to start', he said. 'If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn't have started,' he added.\n\nMr Trump also repeated his assertion that 'Crimea will stay with Russia'.\n\nHis remarks came as the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday laid flowers at the site of a residential building that had been destroyed by a Russian missile strike.\n\nThursday's attack on a residential neighborhood in Kyiv killed at least 12 people in one of the deadliest missile assaults on the beleaguered country's capital. The event was attended by representatives of more than 50 diplomatic missions.\n\nMr Zelensky thanked rescuers of the state emergency service and police officers. 'This is a real service – the protection of Ukrainian life,' he told them.\n\nAnd responding to Mr Trump's comments last night, Mr Zelensky said: 'Our position is unchanged – only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian.'\n\nHe added: 'The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories... belong to Ukraine, to the Ukrainian people.'\n\nMr Zelensky said conversations about 'territorial issues' could take place after 'a full and unconditional ceasefire'.\n\n'What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,' he added.\n\nThe US President yesterday claimed all sides were 'pretty close' to a deal but said there was 'no deadline' and admitted talks were 'fragile'.\n\nWashington is desperately pushing to gain some form of ceasefire to mark Mr Trump's first 100 days as US President on April 30, while Putin wants to celebrate his military prowess in time for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Hitler's Germany on May 9.\n\nIn a sign of the changing political mood, the Nato secretary general's report for 2024 does not contain any wording to suggest that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance in the future.\n\nThe previous year's report said membership was still being considered.\n\nYesterday British and European MPs called on President Trump not to 'repeat the mistakes of Munich in 1938' and called for an end to the US 'policy of appeasement'.\n\nA joint statement by the foreign affairs committee chairmen of seven European parliaments rebuffed US proposals to grant formal recognition of Moscow's control of Crimea. 'There can be no compromise and no external pressure on Ukraine regarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity,' the statement said.\n\nAmong the signatories were Emily Thornberry, the Labour MP, and the foreign affairs committee chairmen of Ukraine, France, the Czech Republic and the three Baltic states.","summary":"The US leader's (pictured) astonishing climbdown from one of his central campaign promises came as his special envoy was welcomed with open arms by Vladimir Putin in Moscow yesterday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649519/Donald-Trump-pledge-end-Ukraine-war-day-president-jest-US-envoy-Moscow-Putin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/00/97709225-0-image-m-42_1745622926962.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:21:46","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":314902268,"title":"Trump urges Kiev and Moscow to ‘finish off’ peace deal","text":"President Donald Trump has claimed that “most of the major points” in an agreement to end the Ukraine conflict have been resolved, even as Vladimir Zelensky once again publicly rejected a reported key clause in the proposed US peace framework.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin held lengthy talks with US special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday, described by Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov as “constructive and very useful.” Trump also expressed satisfaction with the negotiations, praising a “good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine.”\n\n“They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to ‘finish it off.’ Most of the major points are agreed to,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social late Friday, adding that “SUCCESS seems to be in the future!”\n\nThe agreement proposed by Washington reportedly includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, a “freezing” of the conflict along the current front line, and acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia.\n\n“Crimea will stay with Russia” under a final settlement of the Ukraine conflict, Trump said in an interview with Time Magazine published on Friday.\n\nHowever, in direct contradiction to Trump, Zelensky reiterated on Friday that Kiev will not even discuss formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory.\n\n“Our position is unchanged: only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian,” Zelensky told reporters in Kiev, arguing that “the constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories... belong to Ukraine.”\n\nTrump has previously blamed Zelensky’s position on Crimea for harming the negotiation process and warned that he risks losing the entire country if he continues to stall talks with Moscow.\n\nThe US-proposed deal would also reportedly prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, an ambition enshrined in Ukraine’s constitution. Kiev’s intention to join the US-led bloc likely “caused the war to start,” Trump acknowledged in his interview with Time.\n\nThe Kremlin has consistently said it remains open to diplomacy and has expressed gratitude for Trump’s peace efforts. Ushakov confirmed that Friday’s talks touched on the possibility of resuming direct bilateral negotiations between Moscow and Kiev, but offered no details. No direct talks between the two sides have taken place since Ukraine pulled out of the Istanbul negotiations in 2022.\n\nAccording to Putin, Zelensky – who has banned himself from engaging in talks with Moscow – is actively sabotaging any peace process, as it would require lifting martial law, which currently allows him to remain in power. Moscow maintains that without martial law, Zelensky would be compelled under the Ukrainian constitution to either hold elections or transfer presidential authority to the current speaker of Ukraine’s parliament.","summary":"President Donald Trump has claimed that “most of the major points” in an agreement to end the Ukraine conflict have been resolved \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/616339-trump-finish-off-ukraine-talks/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/680c16b22030272903269342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:20:51","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":314904994,"title":"Trump warns Putin 'STOP!' but history says that's not enough – just ask Reagan","text":"\"Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the peace deal DONE,\" Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday. Oh, the frustration of negotiating with Russia. But this sounded like the cry of a hoop-skirted heroine tied to the railroad tracks. President Donald J. Trump is a master communicator, but with the single-word plea, he brought back bad memories of one of the low points of President Joe Biden’s foreign policy. That came Sep. 16, 2022, when 60 Minutes asked then-President Joe Biden what he would say if Putin threatened to use nuclear or chemical weapons. TRUMP TELLS PUTIN ‘STOP’ AFTER DEADLY RUSSIAN STRIKE ON KYIV \"Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,\" Biden replied. About then came the tragic freeze in strategic planning that frittered away momentum for a battlefield victory for Ukraine. So here we are, with negotiations at an intense phase of swapping Crimea for the huge Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and trying to make sure Ukraine has a viable economic path. \"Vladimir, STOP\" won’t get the job done. Can this be the same President Donald J. Trump who threatened Hamas there would be \"all hell to pay,\" which resulted in a ceasefire and a hostage deal? Trump has come down like a ton of bricks on Ayatollah Khamenei. He’s said multiple times he will strike Iran if need be to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb. \"If we don’t make a deal, I’ll be leading the pack,\" Trump said on Friday. Perhaps Trump needs to say something like this next: \"My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed legislation which will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in 5 minutes.\" So joked President Ronald Reagan on August 11, 1984, during a sound check before a speech. You can hear the laughter in the background. Was it a meaningless slip-up? Not on your life. This Hollywood veteran with five decades of experience before the camera and boundless media savvy knew quite well there was no true \"off the record\" moment. Reagan had already accelerated production of B-1 and B-2 bombers, introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative, and put the Soviet Union on notice. I bring up Reagan in part because he was not afraid of Russia. Part of the problem shared by Trump and Biden in dealing with the Ukraine war is placing too much stock in Putin’s nuclear threats. As many have pointed out, use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would blow radiation back into Russia itself. Don’t forget that China told Putin in late 2022 to cool off the nuclear threats. Russia is an economic vassal state of China. Putin can’t risk losing China’s oil money and sneaky microelectronics, and Xi Jinping has made it clear that tactical nuclear weapons are bad for business. Reagan did not hesitate to play hardball with General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to get the Soviets to agree to arms control. Reagan also avoided the one-word trap, either using humor to send a message, or pointing out a wider path, most famously in his Berlin speech from June 12, 1987. \"If you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\" Like Reagan, Trump is very close to a deal, and now is the moment to be firm. Trump has done well luring Putin with reminiscences about the U.S. alliance with the Russians during World War II, an event still vivid in Putin’s mind. (Putin’s mother Maria survived the siege of Leningrad but lost her two-year-old son Viktor to diptheria and starvation in 1942 during the siege.) Trump ought to tell Putin there will be \"all hell to pay\" if Special Envoy Steve Witkoff doesn’t leave Moscow with a smile on his face. Then, of course, Trump would have to back it up, but that’s easy.

Or how about a Truth Social post granting Ukraine immediate NATO membership, followed by the deployment of nuclear-capable F-35s to Ukraine for \"exercises.\" Putin’s backside would be twitching like a bunny rabbit’s nose.

He continues to launch attacks on civilians in Ukraine to show off his second-rate military, scare European allies, and impress the Russian people who know he’s a crook but support him anyway.

The Biden Administration did the same thing. (See Thread.\"Pence then shared an article calling out the Biden administration in October for their role in approving the abortion pill and not disclosing internal communications that led to that decision.While speaking at the Semafor World Economy Summit on Thursday, Makary said the FDA has \"no plans to take action\" against the pill but added that \"There is an ongoing set of data that is coming into the FDA on mifepristone.\"\"So if the data suggests something or tells us that there's a real signal, we can't promise we're not going to act on that data.\"Republican Senator Josh Hawley rebuked the remarks of Makary, too, saying on X on Thursday, \"This is exceptionally disappointing, to say the least.

The FDA needs to change the Biden policy.\"Perkins continued, \"Mifepristone has never been subject to a thorough review—even during the approval process.

The bereaved family he phoned 100 times. The lowly nuns he honoured. And the kiosk seller who served his favourite marshmallow ice cream...","text":"Had he remained with us a little longer, Pope Francis would have been creating the first Gen Z saint at the Vatican this weekend.\n\nEver the modernist (and no doubt aware the high-profile occasion would attract many more young people to Catholicism) he had intended to canonise Carlo Acutis, a British-born teenager who built a website to spread the Gospel before dying from leukaemia at 15.\n\nInstead, the eyes of the world will be on St Peter’s Basilica this morning as the pontiff who did so much to restore the Church’s scandal-torn reputation is laid to rest.\n\nThough Francis was revered in Britain, as in the wider world, he will be buried beside the 17th-century pope whose effigy is mocked and burnt at Lewes, in Sussex, every Bonfire Night.\n\nLike Paul V, whose ill-concealed approval of the Gunpowder Plot makes him an enduring symbol of treachery on our shores, and six other popes, this unconventional man chose to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore (or St Mary Major) rather than the Vatican.\n\nThere, however, the similarities between the 233rd pontiff and the 266th abruptly end.\n\nPompous and hubristic, Paul instructed Rome’s finest architect, Flaminio Ponzio, to design his self-glorifying sepulchre fully ten years before his death in 1621.\n\nFinding the statue of him that forms its centrepiece to be insufficiently flattering, this vain theocrat ordered it to be sledgehammered and re-sculpted (a decree that came too late, for he died before it could be carried out).\n\nIts plinth was etched with a list of his vainglorious achievements.\n\nWhen Francis’s unadorned grave is juxtaposed with this grandiose conceit it will look like something from a village cemetery.\n\nThat is precisely the way ‘the People’s Pope’, who eschewed the trappings and privileges afforded to him as the figurehead of the Christian world, wanted it to be.\n\nAs anyone who has watched the recent movie Conclave will understand, 2,000 years of papal tradition dictates that Francis’s funeral ceremony must be a vast-scale spectacular replete with ritual pomp and pageantry.\n\nSt Peter’s Square and its surrounding streets will be a sea of 500,000 mourners overlooked by the planet’s most powerful statespeople, and an expected global TV and streaming audience in excess of one billion. Yet when the religious theatre ends, the simplicity that defined Francis’s reign will return.\n\nTravelling slowly enough for people lining the streets to see it, his coffin will be driven 3.4 miles to the 5th-century basilica where a band of 40 marginalised people whom Francis called ‘the Last Ones’ – migrants, the homeless, transsexuals and inmates he befriended on a visit to Rome’s most notorious prison – will be waiting on the steps, holding white roses.\n\nTo show the compassion and respect the Pope afforded these societal pariahs, they will be the last ones again today – but this time it will be a privilege. For they will be last to bid him farewell.\n\nThe casket, unleaded and made from sustainable cypress wood (in accordance with his ecological conscience as well as his desire for plainness) will be lowered into a 6ft tomb built from stone hewn from a quarry in Liguria, the north-western region of Italy from where his father’s parents emigrated to Argentina almost a century ago. It will be inscribed with a crucifix and just one word: ‘Franciscus’, his Latin papal name. Given his penchant for spontaneity and informality, it somehow seemed fitting that on Thursday morning, just 48 hours before the funeral, blue uniformed workmen were still scrambling to finish the grave.\n\nAlong with thousands of international visitors to Santa Maria Maggiore (where security was so alarmingly lax that my metal knee replacement failed to set off the scanner and my rucksack wasn’t searched) I was able to watch them completing the task.\n\nThe Argentinian Pope was renowned for his impish sense of humour, and had he been looking down as the final touches were applied – under the direction of a youthful female civil engineer – he would surely have chuckled.\n\nSince many people seemed to regard the burial site as the backdrop for a cool photo-op, it was surrounded by a makeshift screen high enough to thwart the longest selfie-stick.\n\nSilhouetted against the wall, however, we could see the shadows of the labourers’ arms moving vigorously to and fro as they sandpapered the grave walls; and every so often one of their heads would pop up, marionette-like, from behind the screen.\n\nWandering through the echoing chambers inside the basilica and talking to the people – clerical and lay – who live and work within its numinous 5th-century walls, I began to understand why many consider Francis to have been a Pope like no other. And why he was so universally loved.\n\nAs those who followed his story will know, after his appointment in 2013 he became enamoured with Santa Maria Maggiore, said to have been founded on a hill where snow miraculously fell at the height of a stifling Rome summer. Before and after every apostolic journey, he would pray before a Byzantine icon of the Madonna and Child Jesus in the basilica’s Pauline chapel [named for the aforementioned Paul V who had it built].\n\nAnd, before his health failed, he is said to have driven himself there from the Vatican, four miles away, forsaking the armoured ‘popemobile’ for a Ford Focus.\n\nWearing an unelaborate robe (in contrast to the gold embroidered chasubles and palliums encased in the basilica’s museum) he would park behind the building, like everyone else, then walk through to the chapel, putting anyone he met at ease with his disarming smile, kind words and quips.\n\nA cleaner, a security guard, a young souvenir shop assistant, a novice Nigerian monk, the kiosk seller who served him a four euro ‘snowfall’ ice-cream (vanilla with orange syrup and white marshmallows for the flakes)... they all cherish memories of these personal encounters.\n\nLaura Bosetti, who runs a perfume boutique in an alcove at the basilica, told me how a painful event in her life had made her abandon her Catholic faith, but the Pope’s utter ‘normality’ had somehow restored it. Her shop displays a letter from Francis, thanking her for the box of fragrances she made for him.\n\nThen there are the four Mexican nuns who each day arrange the basilica’s magnificently intricate flower displays. When Francis met one of the lowly sisters in Rome, he was so impressed by her artistry that he promptly offered her the prestigious job of decorating the city’s largest and most significant church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nTold that in Mexico she worked with three equally gifted nuns, Francis insisted they be flown over to join her – brushing aside the protests of their Mother Superior, who felt they weren’t qualified for such an important mission.\n\nThat they have repaid his faith is there for all to see. This week, visitors marvelled at their weaves of sunflowers and philadelphus – a white flower, much liked by the Pope, whose brief spring bloom happens to have coincided with his passing.\n\nIt is fitting, then, that the Holy Father’s handpicked Mexican nuns will have the honour of bringing a touch of floral splendour to the basilica as he goes to his grave.\n\nRather regrettably, only a chosen few clerics will get to admire their handiwork, for the interment will be carried out behind closed doors, with live TV coverage ending as the casket is carried through the central archway.\n\nEven for less religious viewers, the funeral promises to be quite some watch. It will be attended by Prince William, Sir Keir Starmer, Donald and Melania Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky and an array of A-listers, possibly including Leonardo DiCaprio (who praised Francis’s leadership on climate change and met him at the Vatican in 2016) and Argentinian football star Lionel Messi.\n\nThe seating plan for the 150-plus state delegations in St Peter’s Square has placed William, who will not be accompanied by the Princess of Wales, next to Prince Haakon Magnus of Norway and his wife. Sir Keir will be squeezed between the Qatari sheikh whose brother owns Manchester City football club and Serbian prime minister Djuro Macut.\n\nAs for these leaders’ opinions of the Pope, they were decidedly mixed. While Messi thanked Francis on Instagram ‘for making the world a better place’, and many of the VIP guests admired him for championing the cause of migrants, feminists, environmentalists, prisoners and people of diverse genders and sexual orientation, others loathed his supposed wokery.\n\nProminent among them was Trump, and the disapproval between the two men was mutual. When the US President unveiled plans for a border wall with Mexico, the Pope went so far as to call him ‘un-Christian’; so, if he carries a mournful air this morning, it might well be faked.\n\nThe same goes for Argentina’s alt-Right president Javier Milei, who infamously berated his fellow countryman as ‘the representative of evil on Earth’ and ‘a preacher of Communism’, but now claims their differences were ‘minor’ and says it was an ‘honour’ to have known the Pope.\n\nAs the Left-wing enemies of the ‘chainsaw president’ have noted this week, his belated admiration for the pontiff has not extended to funding the travel costs of Francis’s nephew, Mauro Bergoglio, perhaps the only papal family member who will be at the funeral.\n\nA poorly paid massage therapist, Bergoglio, son of the Pope’s late brother Oscar, revealed in a TV interview that he couldn’t afford the £2,600 airfare from Buenos Aires to Rome. Thankfully a tour company heard of his plight and offered him a free ticket. He will take his place among countless similarly humble admirers whose lives were touched, and often transformed, by this paradoxically earthy yet awe-inspiring man.\n\nHearing on the nightly news that someone had suffered a personal tragedy, Francis would sometimes phone them directly – a habit that saw him parodied on Italian satire shows and earned him another soubriquet: ‘The Call-Me Pope.’\n\nAfter learning about the murder of Andrea Ferri, the owner of several petrol stations who was gunned down by a robber in 2013, he bade aides to find a number for his mother, Rosalba, and rang her to offer words of comfort.\n\nAs Andrea’s 54-year-old brother, Michael, told me this week, the calls continued until the Pope’s health failed, and he rang for reassuring chats on no fewer than 102 occasions. ‘Sometimes he’d cheer us up with a joke. He loved being close to his people,’ says Michael.\n\nIf he had a fault – and he admitted many – it was that he could be rather too forgiving.\n\nAn uncomfortable reminder of his refusal to judge or condemn, even in the most seemingly damning circumstances, surfaced at a pre-funeral Press briefing at the Vatican on Wednesday.\n\nA reporter demanded to know who had allowed disgraced former Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony to play a leading part in the ceremony.\n\nNow aged 89, Mahony was barred from public ministry in 2013 for helping to cover up a sexual abuse scandal in his diocese (unwittingly he claims). Yet he was among 11 senior clergymen chosen to perform the rite of sealing the papal coffin last night.\n\nWrong-footed, the usually unflappable Holy See Press officer Matteo Bruni said he would try to find out who entrusted Mahony with this honour. However, as Francis left detailed instructions for his send-off, it seems unlikely he was not consulted.\n\nSince the great ceremony begins at 9am UK time (10am in Italy) and is scheduled to last less than two hours, you might be reading this despatch when it is under way, or even at an end.\n\nAssuming it all goes swimmingly, the man who will win plaudits is Dr Fabio Ciciliano, 54, a crisis-management whizz tasked with overseeing every aspect of the organisation barring security, which falls to the police and military. Equally, should anything go wrong, his whiskery neck is on the line.\n\nPremier Giorgia Meloni’s top troubleshooter has handled every type of natural disaster and is making emergency plans for the possible eruption of three volcanoes while tackling a murder epidemic by young Mafiosi in the Naples area.\n\nHowever, he told me, compared with organising logistics for this mega-funeral, facing down machine guns and molten lava flows is a relative cakewalk.\n\nWhen I found him on patrol, hours before the biggest event in Italy since the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005, he still had no idea how big the crowd would be, for it will be swelled by 100,000 pilgrims already in Rome for the cancelled jubilee celebrations and the Gen Z canonisation ceremony.\n\nSo how was he coping with the stress? He showed me his phone screen saver – a curved red animal’s horn which Italians believe wards off ill-fortune. ‘I just keep tapping this,’ he smiled, omitting to mention, at this holiest juncture, that his totem owes its origins to ancient Latin pagans.\n\nIt is an irony that would doubtless have delighted the avowedly ecumenical Francis, who scorned the elitism of his predecessors and angered traditionalists by declaring that ‘all religions are pathways to reach God’.\n\nFor the world’s 1.4billion Catholics, his departure will bring fresh uncertainty and division. For it sets the stage for the denouement to this religious drama – the arcane process of choosing his successor.\n\nSoon after the Novendial, a nine-day mourning period following the funeral, cardinals from every continent will travel to the Vatican to vote for their preferred candidate at the secretive conclave.\n\nWith at least six contenders vying for the papal throne, one from Asia and another from Africa, and the very future of this great institution at stake, the gathering promises to be every bit as intriguing as the Conclave film enthralling millions on Amazon Prime.\n\nWithout wishing to spoil anyone’s enjoyment, the movie lays bare the self-interest and deceit that still alienates sections of the Catholic hierarchy from its flock.\n\nAs its hero is an outsider and it ends with an uplifting twist of humanity, however, the People’s Pope would surely give it a five-star review.","summary":"Instead, the eyes of the world will be on St Peter's Basilica this morning as the pontiff who did so much to restore the Church's scandal-torn reputation is laid to rest.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14649477/Pope-Francis-Peoples-Pope.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/25/23/97708829-0-image-m-67_1745621118661.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/25/4831782088639561408/1024x576_MP4_4831782088639561408.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-25 23:06:46","author":"David Jones,Editor","authors":["David Jones","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.125},{"id":314905750,"title":"Trading card hobby in Canada impacted by mounting trade war centred around U.S.","text":"The international trade war started by U.S. President Donald Trump has complicated collecting trading cards in Canada.\n\nSeveral facets of the hobby have been impacted by the shifting web of tariffs between Canada, China, and the United States, with distributors, retailers, resellers, auction houses and collectors riding the highs and lows. \n\nJeff MacDougall, the general manager of 401 Games in Toronto and Vaughan, Ont., said that virtually every aspect of his business has been affected.\n\n“There’s a lot of things that it’s getting tagged on to, primarily Pokémon cards, Magic (the Gathering) cards, sports cards, Yu-gi-oh cards are the big ones,” said MacDougall, adding that he has written to several members of federal and provincial parliament about Canada’s reciprocal tariffs. “Konami, who makes Yu-gi-oh cards, they’re absorbing quite a bit of the tariff themselves, but that’s not the case with anything else.\n\n“We’re seeing a 25 per cent increase on all that stuff from our suppliers.” \n\nThe issue is twofold for retailers. \n\nGetting new packs of hockey, baseball, Pokémon or Magic: The Gathering cards into Canada is more expensive because they are printed in the U.S. and subject to retaliatory tariffs. Supplies to protect and display cards, like thin plastic sleeves, are becoming harder to find because they are subject to two sets of duties — one as they enter the U.S. from China and then again when they are sent north into Canada from American distributors.\n\n“Any board games we carry are printed in China and so much of the supplies like sleeves and supplies that people use to put their hot trading cards in, that’s all China stuff, right?” said MacDougall. “From what I understand, in most cases, if anybody’s got a project that’s ready to ship, they’re not shipping it. They’re storing it in China right now.”\n\nIt was a widely discussed topic at the Sport Card Expo Toronto on Friday. Thousands of collectors are expected to visit the show at the International Centre in Mississauga, Ont., near Toronto’s Pearson Airport, over the weekend.\n\nElliott Frankl, president of SRM Sports & Entertainment, is a Canadian distributor for BCW Supplies, an American company whose line of storage boxes, sleeves and hard cases are produced in China. He said that the tariffs and duties on the supplies made them so expensive that he’d have to sell them at a loss.\n\n“We had to cancel our last couple orders, so now there’s a shortage of all this stuff,” said Frankl, gesturing toward his remaining stock. “It’s not only us that’s affected. There’s a few other companies that make supplies for the hobby as well and it’s the same problem. \n\n“We were talking with (BCW) about possibly having the stuff shipped directly from China to Canada, to avoid all the tariffs, but we couldn’t do that in time for the show. But who knows in the future.”\n\nGrading — a process where a third-party business examines a card, evaluates its blemishes, then seals it in a hard plastic shell with a certification — has also been directly impacted by the mounting trade barriers.\n\nProfessional Sports Authenticator is the world’s largest grading company. The U.S.-based business issued a statement on April 2 that it would no longer be directly accepting cards from Canadian collectors. Instead, it would only accept submissions from authorized representatives in Canada.\n\nThis has been a boon for Canadian PSA dealers like N.D. Sports Cards in Vaughan.\n\n“We’ve been in business for three years, and last year was a record year for us,” said Eric Maggiacomo, co-owner of N.D. Sports Cards, in his booth at the Sport Card Expo. “In four months this year, we’ve already matched last year.”\n\nCanadian-based grading companies have also been impacted, for better and for worse.\n\n“We’ve definitely had more (Canadians) not willing to send stuff cross-border, which is obviously beneficial for us and but at the same time, we’ve had some U.S. customers that have been a little more skeptical because there’s a big ‘what if.’ Especially when you’re dealing with the type of value of some of these items,” said Nathan Barnai, president and CEO of KSA Grading and Authentication Services. “There’s just so much uncertainty that they’re not willing to send it this way either. \n\n“It’s definitely having an impact both ways.”\n\nTony Piacente, co-owner of iCert Certification Services, said that his business wasn’t seriously impacted by the tariffs on goods manufactured in China, but that the uncertainty of how duties will be enforced in the future has caused a lot of angst for his clients.\n\n“We did have customers trying to rush orders, to try to squeeze orders in prior to to the tariffs taking place,” said Piacente. “We’re getting a lot of questions coming at us about how it will affect things going forward.\n\n“There’s so much uncertainty, but we don’t know from one day to the next what changes will happen.”\n\nSeveral resellers — small businesses that sell prized individual cards at conventions or through online auctions like eBay — said they weren’t overly concerned with the tariffs, although they were feeling the pinch from the more expensive supplies. \n\nAsking to remain off the record, one reseller said they would find “the least expensive way” to get cards to customers in the U.S. One reseller noted that trading cards “are very small” and another laughed and said he had been sending a lot of birthday cards lately.","summary":"The international trade war started by U.S. President Donald Trump has complicated collecting trading cards in Canada.
