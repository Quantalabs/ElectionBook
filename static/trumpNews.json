A 33-year-old man of Indian origin won the Democratic Party nomination to run for mayor of the city. The nomination is a sort of semi-final match, but because New York is a very Democratic Party-leaning city, he is the frontrunner and the likely winner of the election, which is later this year.\n\nZohran Mamdani is from a Gujarati Muslim family, and his father is a university academic who wrote a famous text after 11 September, 2001, titled ‘Good Muslim Bad Muslim’. Zohran’s mother is Mira Nair, the director of such movies as ‘Monsoon Wedding’ and ‘Salaam Bombay’. But his background is not the important part of Zohran’s story: it is the way in which he competed against and defeated a stalwart of his party, Andrew Cuomo, who was governor of New York state.\n\nThe development is important because New York’s mayor has serious powers. He oversees a budget of over $100 billion which is more than that of most countries. He appoints judges, the police commissioner, and heads of more than 40 city agencies and members of boards and commissions. The reason figures like Rudy Giuliani are famous is that they were in this position.\n\nZohran’s platform was socialism and he refers to himself as a democratic socialist. This, as many readers will know, is a term that is almost derogatory in the United States because of its history against communism. But Zohran owns the term socialist proudly and says he is there to represent the working class, blue collar and immigrant New Yorkers and not the wealthy. He said he would as mayor freeze rent on 20 lakh homes; he would make city buses free; he would make child care free (a sort of anganwadi programme); and he would experiment with state-run grocery shops, starting with one in each of New York’s five boroughs. This would be like our ration shops, aimed at subsidising food. He says he will pay for this by marginally raising income taxes, but only on those New Yorkers who have an income of more than $1 million (over Rs 8 crore) per year.\n\nThe second important thing was the quality of Zohran’s campaign, which was conducted mostly on social media outlets TikTok and Instagram. Short videos of Zohran, who is a most attractive individual, himself going around the city and talking to New Yorkers about their concerns. These videos are also available on YouTube and they are worth watching for what a low-cost, effective and fresh campaign looks like.\n\nZohran speaks excellent Hindi, Spanish and Bengali in some of these videos to directly address those from South Asian and Latino backgrounds. He has no problem being comfortable with his identity as a South Asian, compared to other political figures in the US who are of Indian origin. The campaign has a very Bollywood touch to it, including the typefaces used and the editing of the videos.\n\nThe third striking thing about Zohran is that he speaks out for the rights of Palestinians and criticises the actions of the Israeli state. This is a most unusual position, because it opens him up to attack from what scholars like John Mearsheimer have called the Israel Lobby. Zohran’s courage shows from his refusal to back down or soften his stand even when running for an election with such high stakes. This is not how politicians behave. The US is the only nation whose democratic candidates are expected to show enthusiastic loyalty to another country.\n\nThe fact that he achieved a thumping victory despite having the media including the New York Times attack him viciously and unfairly shows that this courage was respected and admired and rewarded by New York’s residents. His own Democratic Party offered him little support and few endorsements even after he won the nomination. There is no Clinton, Biden or Obama today by his side, because of their fear of association with Zohran and what he says and does. In the past, Democrats who have promoted socialist policies, such as Bernie Sanders, have been seen as likeable but marginal figures. Zohran is different.\n\nHis victory means that his party will have to learn from him, because after the rise of Donald Trump, the Democrats have been in disarray. Currently, the Republicans control all three branches of government, the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats have had no real answer to the Trump phenomenon and Zohran, with his emphatic and clear policies aimed at working-class Americans, offers them a national path for a return. It is a fact, among other things, that the position of most Americans on the issue of Palestine has shifted because of the ongoing genocide in Gaza. It is Zohran who represents this majority which is voiceless in his party.\n\nIf he is able to win the general election later this year and is then able to deliver on the substance of his policies over the short term, his party will come to him. The US goes into its crucial mid-term elections late next year and the Democrats now have a desi hero to teach them how to contest and on which issues.\n\nBy Aakar Patel","summary":"One of the most remarkable democratic developments of recent times came from New York City this month.

Trump said \"nobody cares about\" Epstein, and that more time or energy must not be wasted on his case, as he tried to unite his base of supporters in a nearly 400-word post on Truth Social. \"What's going on with my \"boys\" and, in some cases, \"gals?\" They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening,\" Trump said. In a joint memo released on Monday, the FBI and Justice Department said there was no evidence to support a number of long-held conspiracy theories about Epstein's death in federal custody in 2019 and his alleged clientele. Conservative influencers from Laura Loomer to Elon Musk have criticized Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel for their findings, which came months after Bondi pledged to reveal major revelations about Epstein, including \"a lot of names\" and \"a lot of flight logs.\"Live Events U.S. media, including Fox News and NBC News, have reported that FBI deputy director Dan Bongino has clashed with Bondi over the issue and is considering stepping down. Patel and Bongino, a former conservative podcaster, both previously made statements before working at the FBI about a so-called client list and often suggested that the government was hiding information about Epstein from the American public. Monday's memo on Epstein concluded that after reviewing more than 300 gigabytes of data, there was \"no incriminating client list\" nor was there any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people. The memo also confirmed prior findings by the FBI which concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell while awaiting trial, and not as a result of a criminal act such as murder. Epstein's death while imprisoned in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center has ignited controversy for years. Expectations for key revelations in his case grew when, in February, Fox News asked Bondi whether the Justice Department would be releasing Epstein's client list, and she said, \"It's sitting on my desk right now to review.\" On Tuesday at the White House, Bondi walked that comment back, telling reporters that she was referring to the entire Epstein \"file\" along with other files pertaining to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. \"That's what I meant by that,\" she said.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onJeffrey EpsteinTrumpPam BondiFBIJustice DepartmentEpstein client listElon MuskbondiEpstein files\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Two. Three if you count a temporary de-escalation agreement with China.The 90-day deadline was due on July 9, with dozens of economies including the European Union, India and Japan facing tariff hikes without a deal.But days before it arrived, Trump issued a delay to August 1.Live EventsIt was his second extension since unveiling the tariffs in April -- reigniting the \"TACO Theory\" that has gained traction among some Wall Street traders.The acronym coined by a Financial Times writer stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out,\" highlighting the president's inclination to roll back policies if markets turn sour.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, part of Trump's multi-leader trade team, has reportedly been a key advocate for the pauses.But the label has irked Trump and he insisted Tuesday that the deadline had always been in August.\"I didn't make a change. A clarification, maybe,\" Trump said at a cabinet meeting.This week, he published more than 20 letters dictating tariff rates to world leaders including in Japan, South Korea and Indonesia.\"We invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States, the Number One Market in the World, by far,\" Trump wrote.He also issued letters to the EU, Canada, Mexico and Brazil -- although Brazil was not previously targeted by the steeper \"reciprocal\" tariffs and Canada and Mexico face a separate tariff regime.The documents \"appear to be Trump's way of combatting the TACO label,\" said Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.\"He wants to show that he's not just kicking the can down the road on the deadline, but that he means business,\" she told AFP.\"He's likely frustrated that there isn't a parade of deals coming in.\" 'Politically complicated' \"The shift in his rhetoric from 'there is no cost -- the foreigners pay the tariffs' to 'there is a short term cost, but there will be a long term gain' has put him in a more politically complicated position,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Trump has repeatedly claimed that foreign countries foot the bill for tariffs, although the reality is more complicated with US companies generally paying them.\"In the public's mind, the tariffs are the pain, and the agreements will be the gain,\" said Reinsch, a former US commerce official.He warned that without trade agreements, Americans could conclude Trump's strategy was flawed and deem his tactics a failure.While the 90-deal goal was probably unrealistic, Reinsch said, \"it's clear that three (UK, China, Vietnam) with only one actual text made public (UK) is too small.\"Deflecting attentionMeanwhile, Trump has announced a 50 percent levy on copper imports starting August 1.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said officials would also conclude investigations into semiconductors and pharmaceuticals -- which could lead to tariffs -- at month-end.\"That timing is not coincidental -- it lines up with the new deadline of August 1, adding more pressure and deflecting attention from any lack of deals that get made in that time frame,\" Manak said.Analysts believe Trump's supporters will likely not pay much attention to trade talks unless the tariffs fuel inflation.\"Trade policy is not top-of-mind for the average voter,\" said Emily Benson, head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures.She expects the Trump administration's focus on boosting US manufacturing and reinvigorating the defense industrial base means it could be willing to bear some political heat to achieve those objectives.But it's a delicate balance.Voters will likely pay more attention if Trump follows through on his August tariff threats, Manak said.\"And we could see a negative market reaction as well, which would not go unnoticed.\"(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump tariff talkstrade agreementstrade policypolitical impact of tariffstariff hikesTrump administration tariffsEuropean Uniontrumptrump tariffs\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

And when he grows up a little bit that will serve him well.\n'There are things I don't like about him and there are things about me he doesn't like. Freddy will be OK, I don't know if he looks up to me, but I look up to him in many ways, but he's a good boy.'\n It is reported that the brother's father Jeff, 46, has set up a court date to stop Freddy seeing his maternal grandmother Jackiet Budden, 68, amid rising concerns over his well being. \n\nBobby Brazier has said his younger brother Freddy needs to 'grow up' as he opened up about the 'things he doesn't like' about him\n\nThe EastEnders star, 22, has opened up about his brother, 20, who is currently in the midst of a family legal battle over his welfare\nFreddy has admitted he 'misses the bond' he shared with older brother Bobby in a heartbreaking Instagram last month.\nThe Race Across The World star posted throwback videos as he reminisced about the good times he and Bobby shared during the coronavirus.\nOne video Freddy posted saw the Brazier brothers bashing their heads against a pumpkin on a farm.\nHe wrote: 'Only thing I miss about Covid is the amount of time I had with my brother to bond and make memories and have a laugh.'\nIn another post, Freddy and Bobby larked around in the kitchen in a video while dad Jeff cooked dinner.\nBobby, who has immersed himself in the movement at the Hare Krishna HQ, has been enjoying the religion's peaceful outlook at Soho's Hare Krishna HQ.\nThe Mail revealed that Bobby has turned to the organisation – which follows a branch of the Hindu faith – after relations became strained between him and his father, TV presenter Jeff.\nSo difficult did things become between the pair that Bobby moved out of Jeff's Essex home into his own Soho apartment, which is near to the Hare Krishna temple.\n\nHe told The Sun that he is a sensitive personal and is 'a good boy' but growing up 'will serve him well'\n\nIt is reported that the brother's father Jeff, 46, has set up a court date to stop Freddy seeing his maternal grandmother Jackiet Budden, 68, amid rising concerns over his well being\n\nBobby brotherly bond has been difficult over the years as Freddy has recently revealed he misses his bond with the actor \n\nThe Race Across The World star posted throwback videos as he reminisced about the good times he and Bobby shared during the coronavirus\nJeff, resident parental expert on ITV's This Morning, had cheered on his son for all his worth every week at Strictly. He also told Strictly viewers how strong their relationship was. But in truth, communication between the two has been scant.\nMeanwhile Freddy's difficulties with his father were apparently heightened when he tried to deepen his relationship with his grandmother, Jade's mum Jackiey Budden.\nFreddy, who starred with his dad on BBC1 show Celebrity Race Across The World, currently lives with his grandmother, despite his father's objections. The 20-year-old also admitted to smoking cannabis with his grandmother.\nWhile Freddy's rebellion is public, noisy and erratic, Bobby's is the polar opposite – yet perhaps no less hurtful for his father. \nFriends revealed to the Mail that Bobby, although no wild child, has been just as happy to push away his relatives as Freddy. \nThose relatives include Jeff's wife Kate Dwyer – who both boys have had 'ups and downs' with, according to those who know the family. \nAnd while Bobby may not be trading insults with his dad publicly, like his younger brother, he is also seeking to distance himself from Jeff, who Freddy accused of being controlling.\nA source close to the family said: 'Bobby's always had a spiritual side, but this is intentional. It's clear he's trying to leave all the fighting and noise behind. \n'Freddy's rebellion is loud – drugs, public slanging matches and legal battles about his nana – while Bobby's is quiet. But actually it's just as defiant. \n\nIt comes after a new twist in the Brazier family feud saw it revealed that relations between Bobby and his dad Jeff had become strained (Seen together in 2023) \n'He's turning his back on the life his Dad created for them in Essex and following his own path.'\nBobby's Hare Krishna practice appears to be no fad. A volunteer said: 'He's here every Saturday without fail, he joins our kitchen session, learns the prayers – this isn't a gimmick.'\nFreddy lost his mother Jade Goody when he was just four years old after she died from cervical cancer in 2009, and has since been raised by his dad Jeff.\nJackiey and Jeff have clashed multiple times over the years, and it was revealed earlier this year that the TV star is taking action in an attempt to legally block contact between his son and his grandmother, 'to keep him safe'.\nMail On Sunday revealed that Freddy, who was restricted from seeing Jackiey by his dad after he filed court paperwork, spent time last month at her home in Bermondsey, after reuniting despite his father's efforts to keep his son away.\nFamily friends say the duo remain 'extremely close,' explaining: 'Jeff was never going to keep Freddy away from his Nanny for very long – they've always had a strong bond Jeff may hate her for all sorts of reasons going back many years, but Freddy loves her very much...\n'They had a great time together, playing with her dog and catching up at her flat – where he has often stayed over the years...\n'Whatever Jeff hoped to achieve with his legal efforts, it hasn't worked.'\nEastendersBobby Brazier\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBobby Brazier breaks his silence on his brother Freddy's feud with their dad Jeff as he opens up about the 'things he doesn't like' about him\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Seeming to bolster the United States' and Israel's friendship is what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the \"partnership\" of \"mutual respect\" and \"open discussion\" between leaders. Netanyahu explained how his partnership with Trump is \"different\" than prior relations during an appearance that aired Saturday on \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\" \"It's not an equal partnership, because America is the leader of the free world, and Israel is the bastion of the free world in the Middle East, but it is one of mutual respect [and] open discussion,\" Netanyahu told Fox News host Mark Levin, noting there is a \"very clear unity of purpose\" between Trump and him that has enabled them \"to achieve things that were not achievable before that.\" \"Remember, I've been around many presidents. I've appreciated them. I respected them a lot, but this is different.\" TRUMP SAYS ‘VERY CLOSE’ TO SECURING ISRAEL, HAMAS CEASEFIRE, RETURNING HOSTAGES Netanyahu praised Trump's \"refreshing view\" on the current tensions and future outlook for the Middle East as well as the administration's support for Israel. The Israeli leader also defended his nomination of Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, pointing to his leadership in the Middle East and his efforts to broker peace in \"every single corner of the earth.\" While \"deeply appreciative\" of the federal government's support, Netanyahu outlined his concerns with America's mainstream media \"disinformation campaign.\" \"We had a seven-front war, and we won on all fronts, and winning on all fronts, but this is the eighth front. The disinformation campaign is among us,\" he explained. \"It takes a second for a lie to circulate the world, and then you have to battle it with the only weapon you have, which is the truth.\" Since the war with Hamas broke out following the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has faced growing scrutiny throughout the globe regarding its handling of the situation in Gaza and escalating strikes from mainstream outlets and social media users.

In a heated post on Truth Social, Trump labeled the comedian and frequent critic as a ‘threat to humanity.’\n\n“Due to the fact that Rosie O’Donnell does not serve the best interests of our Great Country, I am seriously considering revoking her Citizenship,” the 79-year-old Trump announced earlier that day.\n\n‘She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!’\n\nUnder US law, a president cannot revoke the citizenship of an American born in the United States. O’Donnell was born in New York state. \n\nOver the course of almost a dozen posts the comedian and former chat show host laid into Trump and any association he may have had with Epstein, but some focused squarely on the president himself.\n\n‘Thirty-plus years of sexual abuse’ – The known victims,’ O’Donnell posted along with a profile shot of Trump and a list of women who have accused him of sexual abuse dating back to the 1980s.\n\nAnother posting showcased a photo montage showcasing Trump meeting Epstein and his convicted sex trafficker girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. In the center was a Truth Social from Trump pleading for people to ‘STOP TALKING ABOUT EPSTEIN!!!!!’.\n\nOther posts designed to irk the president further saw a photoshopped picture of Trump wearing one of his signature red MAGA caps only with the words changed to read: ‘I’m on the list’ referring to the supposed client list Epstein kept.\n\nEarlier this week the White House has said that there is in fact no ‘client list,’ a narrative that some question. \n\nO’Donnell then posted a message aimed squarely in response to Trump’s suggestion to revoke her citizenship.\n\n‘Hey Donald – you’re rattled again? 18 years later and I still live rent-free in that collapsing brain of yours. you call me a threat to humanity – but I’m everything you fear: a loud woman a queer woman. a mother who tells the truth an American who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze,’ O’Donnell began. \n\n‘You crave loyalty – I teach my children to question power you sell fear on golf courses – I make art about surviving trauma you lie, you steal, you degrade – I nurture, I create, I persist,’ she went on.\n\n‘You are everything that is wrong with America – and I’m everything you hate about what’s still right with it. You want to revoke my citizenship? Go ahead and try, king Joffrey with a tangerine spray tan\n\n‘i’m not yours to silence i never was – Rosie.’\n\nResponding directly to Trump’s threat she wrote how the president opposes her because she ‘stands in direct opposition with all he represents.’ \n\n‘The president of the USA has always hated the fact that i see him for who he is – a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself – this is why i moved to Ireland,’ O’Donnell wrote in another posting on Saturday.\n\n‘He is a dangerous old soulless man with dementia who lacks empathy compassion and basic humanity- i stand in direct opposition all he represents … ur a bad joke who cant form a coherent sentence.’ \n\nIn other blatant attacks on Trump, O’Donnell posted artwork of the president stating ‘He rapes’, while in another she posted a tweet stating: ‘Damn, I wish Trump would go after the Epstein list pedophiles the way he’s going at Rosie O’Donnell rn.’\n\n‘Let’s not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,’ Trump concluded, casting the controversy as a ploy to derail his political momentum.\n\nO’Donnell, a longtime target of Trump’s insults and jabs, moved to Ireland earlier this year with her 12-year-old son after the start of the president’s second term. \n\nShe has said she’s in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.\n\nO’Donnell, said in a March TikTok video that she would return to the US ‘when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America.’\n\nTrump’s outburst followed O’Donnell’s July 7 HuffPost interview, in which she discussed her decades-long feud with him and her 2024 move to Ireland, made ahead of Trump’s reelection.\n\nTrump’s disdain for O’Donnell dates back to 2006 when O’Donnell, a comedian and host on The View at the time, mocked Trump over his handling of a controversy concerning a winner of the Miss USA pageant, which Trump had owned. \n\n‘I look at America and I feel overwhelmingly depressed,’ O’Donnell, 63, said, citing her need to protect her mental health and care for her 12-year-old son, who has autism. \n\n‘I knew what [the Trump administration] was planning to do, because I read Project 2025. I know what he’s capable of. And I didn’t want to put myself through another four years of him being in charge.’\n\nWatching Trump’s second term from abroad, O’Donnell added: ‘I think it’s as bad as everyone worried it would be. I believe fascism has taken a foothold in the United States.’\n\nShe also criticized a new bill she claims grants Trump his own ‘secret police,’ with a budget ‘greater than the money we give to Israel, which is already unbelievably high.’\n\n‘I look at America, and it feels tragic,’ she said. ‘I feel sad. I feel overwhelmingly depressed. I don’t understand how we got here.’\n\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly brought up O’Donnell, including during the first Republican primary debate in August 2015. \n\nWhen moderator Megyn Kelly questioned his use of terms like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ and ‘slobs’ to describe women, he replied, ‘Only Rosie O’Donnell.’\n\nHer name eventually resurfaced during a debate with Hillary Clinton, when Trump said, ‘Rosie O’Donnell has been very vicious to me. I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree she deserves it.’\n\nO’Donnell responded in a now-deleted post on X, calling him an ‘orange anus.’\n\nAfter Trump’s first election, O’Donnell told W Magazine in October 2017 that she struggled to cope with his presidency, saying it took her a year to regain emotional balance. \n\n‘I seriously worry whether I personally will be able to live through [his presidency] and whether the nation will be able to survive,’ she said. ‘It’s a terrifying concept, on the brink of nuclear war with a madman in charge.’\n\nTrump’s latest jab at O’Donnell seemed to be in response to a TikTok video she posted this month mourning the 119 deaths in the July 4 floods in Texas and blaming Trump’s widespread cuts to environmental and science agencies involved in forecasting major natural disasters.\n\n‘What a horror story in Texas,’ O’Donnell said in the video. ‘And you know, when the president guts all the early warning systems and the weathering forecast abilities of the government, these are the results that we’re gonna start to see on a daily basis.’\n\nThe Trump administration, as well as local and state officials, have faced mounting questions over whether more could have been done to protect and warn residents ahead of the Texas flooding, which struck with astonishing speed in the pre-dawn hours of July 4 and killed at least 120, including dozens of children.\n\nOn Friday, Trump visited Texas and defended the government’s response to the disaster, saying his agencies ‘did an incredible job under the circumstances.’\n\nIn a sprawling social media post on Saturday evening, Trump once again lashed out at the renewed attention on Jeffrey Epstein, dismissing the disgraced financier as a distraction orchestrated by his political enemies and insisting the so-called ‘Epstein Files’ are part of a smear campaign aimed at undermining his administration.\n\n‘All over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,’ Trump wrote, complaining that ‘selfish people’ were damaging his ‘perfect’ administration by focusing on the late sex offender. \n\nHe accused figures like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, John Brennan, and ‘the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration’ of fabricating the Epstein documents – likening them to the ‘FAKE’ Steele dossier used in the Russia probe.\n\nTrump went further, suggesting that if the Epstein files actually contained anything damaging to the MAGA movement, his critics would have already weaponized them.\n\n‘Why didn’t these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files?’ he asked. ‘If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn’t they use it?’\n\nHe also criticized the FBI for spending ‘month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein,’ and urged the agency to refocus on voter fraud and political corruption.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRosie O&#8217;Donnell launched a fierce attack on Donald Trump on Saturday, accusing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Rosie O&#8217;Donnell Responds Strongly to Trump&#8217;s Citizenship Threat first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/rosie-odonnell-responds-strongly-to-trumps-citizenship-threat/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rosie-ODonnell-hits-back-after-Trump-threatens-to-revoke-citizenship.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-13 00:51:36","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":341033120,"title":"Junior Andre, 20, reveals his parents' reaction to his relationship with girlfriend Jasmine Orr, 24, as she recalls first meeting","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret Harry peace summit: King Charles and Duke of Sussex's senior aides meet for talks near royal palace in first step towards reconciliation and strongest sign yet both sides want to resolve bitter family feud\n\nI was overjoyed to marry the handsome love of my life Paul but after 22 years he dropped a bombshell that shattered our family - he was living a double life as a trans woman named Elizabeth... this is what happened next\n\nPolice 'arrest EastEnders actor on suspicion of indecent assault on set in front of shocked BBC soap opera stars'\n\nUltimate guide to having your best sex EVER in middle-age: Top doctor's medically-backed advice for women on how to treat the hurdles stopping you having an incredible love life\n\nSo why DID Adele miss her best friend's 50th?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy LAURA PARKIN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:43 BST, 13 July 2025 |Updated:01:50 BST, 13 July 2025 \n\nJunior Andre has revealed how his parents reacted to his relationship with girlfriend Jasmine Orr, as she recalled the moment they met for the first time. \nThe 20-year-old son of Peter Andre and Katie Price has been dating Jasmine, 24, since April 2024 after the pair met through events while she was working in PR.\nSpeaking in a joint interview after moving in together to a flat in Surrey, the couple gave an update as they take the next big step in their relationship. \nJunior told The Mirror: 'They were really happy for us and supportive. My parents were both there if we needed anything while moving, and we’re still going to be going for barbecues at Dad’s, or to my mum’s for movie nights.'\nRecalling the moment she first met Junior's parent's, Jasmine admitted: 'I was nervous but I feel like it’s always nerve-wracking when you’re meeting the family of the person you’re dating! \n'But I had met Princess before, which made it easier. It was just the nerves of wanting to make a good impression.' \n\nJunior Andre has revealed how his parents reacted to his relationship with girlfriend Jasmine Orr as she recalled their first meeting\n\nThe 20-year-old son of Peter Andre and Katie Price has been dating Jasmine, 24, since April 2024 after the pair met through events while she was working in PR\nJunior appeared more smitten than ever with Jasmine as the couple packed on the PDA in a string of new loved-up snaps.\nThe singer took to Instagram to share photos from a glamorous outing together at the weekend, both dressed to the nines for the occasion.\nJunior looked positively besotted as he wrapped an arm around Jasmine and planted a kiss on her head, before the couple shared a passionate smooch.\nHe cut a dapper figure in a charcoal grey suit over a black turtleneck jumper and a chunky silver chain, while the pair sipped on glasses of fizz.\nMeanwhile, Jasmine flaunted her incredible curves in a figure-hugging one-shouldered dress with a daring thigh-high slit, while toting a small white handbag.\nCaptioning the stunning shots with her boyfriend, she simple wrote: 'Yesterday' followed by champagne glass emojis and a heart.\nJunior, who is following in his popstar dad's footsteps by pursuing a singing career, first revealed he had a 'secret' girlfriend in April last year, claiming he would even turn down Dua Lipa for her.\nAnd in July they took the next step in their relationship by setting up a new joint TikTok profile to share videos of themselves together.\n\nRecalling the moment she first met Junior's parent's, Jasmine admitted: 'I was nervous but I feel like it’s always nerve-wracking' (L-R Katie, JJ Slater, Junior and Jasmine)\n\nIt comes after Junior appeared more smitten than ever with Jasmine as the couple packed on the PDA in a string of new loved-up snaps\n\nJunior, who is following in his popstar dad's footsteps by pursuing a singing career, first revealed he had a 'secret' girlfriend last year (pictured together in November)\nLike Junior, Jasmine also made appearances on reality TV, previously starring on Celebs Go Dating, where she had a short dalliance with Adam Collard and famously exposed the reality star's brutal comments towards his former flame Lottie Moss.\nWhile she counts a number of Love Island stars as friends on Instagram including Tom Clare, Curtis Pritchard, Jack Fincham and Coco Lodge.\nJunior's mother Katie, 46, also gave Jasmine her seal of approval, ahead of meeting her for the first time.\nSpeaking on her Katie Price Show podcast with her sister Sophie in May, she defended the couple's age gap and said she 'can't wait' to meet Jasmine.\nThe former glamour model gushed: 'She's so pretty! I remember watching her on Celebs Go Dating.'\nInsisting she isn't worried about Jasmine being five years older, she added: 'Isn't it funny when your kids get older and they get in relationships and you meet their girlfriends and boyfriends as they're adults, she's an adult. They're not like young kids at school.'\nWhile last month, the Mail reported that Jasmine has become the key to strengthening Katie and Junior's once-fractious relationship, with the teenager living with his dad and step-mother Emily MacDonagh in Surrey.\nHe is said to have started building bridges with his mother since he started dating Jasmine, with the two women now becoming almost inseparable.\n\nThe Mail revealed last month that Jasmine has become the key to strengthening Katie and Junior's once-fractious relationship (pictured together in 2023)\n\n Junior Andre, 19, looks more loved-up than ever as he packs on PDA with girlfriend Jasmine Orr, 24 \nThe young couple are now regular visitors to Katie's house instead of Peter's, as the pop star has stricter rules at his home and won't allow Junior or his younger sister Princess to have partners stay over.\nA source close to Jasmine told the Mail: 'Jasmine is obsessed with Katie and can't believe that she's now part of the family. They have struck up quite a friendship, Jasmine has become like a daughter to Katie which is very sweet.\n'They hit it off pretty much straight away. Katie sees a lot of her younger self in Jasmine and loves how she dresses. Jasmine really looks up to Katie but Katie also loves the way Jasmine does her hair and make-up, and her outfits.\n'There's a real mutual obsession between the pair but the most lovely thing about it all is that it has brought Katie and Junior together and they are now much closer and see far more of one another.'\nThe source added that 'the way Katie lives her life' means neither Junior nor Princess, 17, have seen her much.\nBut they went on: 'Things have been tricky at times but now things are lovely between them. Many a young woman would be terrified of Katie but Jasmine just adores her.'\nYet, while it would seem that Jasmine has helped build bridges between mother and son, some close to the family find the whole situation rather unnerving.\n'It's like they want to be each other and it's weird,' a source tells me. 'A few of their friends have noticed what's been going on but Junior is completely besotted with Jasmine.\n'You only have to look at some of their recent pictures to see that Katie has been copying Jasmine's looks and vice-versa.\n'After all 'imitation is the sincerest form of flattery' and that's exactly what the pair are doing.'\nJunior AndrePeter AndreKatie Price\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJunior Andre, 20, reveals his parents' reaction to his relationship with girlfriend Jasmine Orr, 24, as she recalls first meeting\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

In a lengthy post on Truth Social, Trump appealed for unity within the MAGA movement and criticized the renewed controversy over Jeffrey Epstein’s files, which has sparked deepening clashes between the FBI and the department of justice.\"Let Pam Bondi do her job — she's great!\" Trump wrote, making a direct plea as tensions reportedly rose within federal law enforcement. According to media reports, speculation has been growing that FBI director Kash Patel may be considering resigning from his post after much anticipation that FBI deputy director Dan Bongino may also step down amid the turmoil over handling of Epstein-related documents.Addressing his supporters directly, Trump questioned why so many were targeting Bondi despite her record. He called for Republicans to remain united instead of fighting among themselves. “What’s going on with my ‘boys’ and, in some cases, ‘gals?’ They’re all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a fantastic job! We’re on one Team, MAGA, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he wrote.Trump claimed that his administration is highly successful and well-regarded globally but argued that “selfish people” are undermining it by stirring up controversy about Epstein. He accused prominent political opponents including former US President Barack Obama, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA director John Brennan and officials from the former US President Joe Biden administration of manufacturing the drama over the so-called “Epstein Files.”“For years, it’s Epstein, over and over again,” Trump said, suggesting the focus on Epstein is a political distraction. He questioned why, if any damaging evidence existed in the Epstein files, his opponents did not release it to hurt the MAGA movement. He also linked this controversy to past disputes over unreleased government records such as the John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr files.Trump further accused his rivals of using similar tactics in the past, pointing to the Steele Dossier and the “Russia Hoax,” and claimed his critics were trying to divide his supporters. He argued that despite his administration’s successes which included border security, deportations of criminals, economic growth, energy dominance and efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons some people are never satisfied.“No matter how much success we have had … it’s never enough for some people,” he wrote. He further added that he expects his administration to achieve more in six months than any other administration has in a century.Trump called on his allies to stay focused on what he described as key priorities: investigating voter fraud, political corruption, ActBlue, and what he continues to claim was a “rigged and stolen” 2020 election. He argued that Bondi’s work on these issues is vital and should not be disrupted by internal fighting or the renewed attention on Epstein.He concluded by urging his supporters to stop wasting time and energy on Epstein, whom he claimed “nobody cares about,” and to focus instead on what he described as the ongoing mission to save the country and make America great again.","summary":"Donald Trump has defended Attorney General Pam Bondi amidst attacks from his supporters, urging unity within the MAGA movement.

While he promised during the 2024 campaign to bring down the cost of living, his trade policies now may rock the global economy and push up inflation. \n\nRoughly one in four Trump voters said in the poll that the tariffs are damaging the ability of the U.S. to negotiate trade deals with other countries. The president’s supporters are also evenly split on whether Trump should have the power to impose tariffs, with 44 percent saying he should have Congress’s approval versus 45 percent who say he should have the authority to put in place the levies. \n\nTrump has said that he may put in place yet another round of tariffs on August 1, threatening a 30 percent tariff on goods from Mexico and the European Union. The tariffs, which Trump has claimed will bring in “big money” to the U.S., are paid by the importer, and many companies pass those costs on to the customer. \n\nForty-six percent of Trump voters said they back tariffs on China “even if it increases prices at home.” Meanwhile, 32 percent say they only support tariffs if it doesn’t raise prices, and nine percent said they oppose tariffs. Twenty-five percent of Trump voters said the tariffs on China hurt U.S. companies. \n\nHowever, 55 percent said that while it will be challenging to get a deal with China, they expect that the president “will be able to do it.” Eighteen percent said it won’t be difficult to reach an agreement.

Officials have faced questions over the timing of ‘Code Red’ alerts and whether they acted swiftly enough to warn residents. Trump has defended the federal response, insisting that his agencies “did an incredible job under the circumstances.”\n\nIn a TikTok video posted last Sunday, O’Donnell, who was born in New York state, blamed the rising death toll on what she described as Trump’s “horrible decisions,” alleging that his administration had weakened the government’s ability to protect the public.\n\n“What a horror story in Texas,” O’Donnell said. “And you know, when the president guts all the early warning systems and the weather forecasting abilities of the government, these are the results that we’re gonna start to see on a daily basis.”\n\nTrump responded on Saturday with a post on Truth Social, suggesting that O’Donnell should stay in Ireland, where she moved earlier this year after the start of his second term.\n\n“Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” he wrote. “She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nHowever, the US Supreme Court has ruled that citizenship granted by birth cannot be revoked by presidential decree.\n\nTrump’s feud with O’Donnell dates back to the mid-2000s, when the comedian mocked him during television appearances and labeled him a “snake oil salesman.” Trump retaliated with personal insults, calling her “a very unattractive person” and “a mentally sick woman.”\n\nOver the years, the pair have continued to trade barbs in media interviews and online. More recently, O’Donnell has criticized Trump’s tax policies and described his government as “a horror show.”\n\nTrump has made similar threats in the past, including against South African-born tech billionaire Elon Musk, suggesting that his residency status could be revoked.","summary":"President Donald Trump threatens to revoke Rosie O’Donnell’s US citizenship \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/621398-trump-threatens-to-strip-rosie/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.07/article/6872ff9e20302759aa37bd01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-13 00:39:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":341032246,"title":"World News | IDF, Shin Bet Eliminate Senior Terror Operative in Lebanon","text":"Tel Aviv [Israel], July 13 (ANI/TPS): On Friday, a terrorist operative involved in advancing attacks against Israel in the northern arena was eliminated in a targeted Israeli airstrike.

They need to leave and they need to leave right now because this is unacceptable.'\n\nFootage also showed her being criticized by anti-ICE protesters, some of whom shouted insults at her for her handling of the violent response to Donald Trump's migrant crackdown in the city in recent weeks. \n\nAfterwards she condemned the presence of agents in the park as 'outrageous and un-American', and took to X to share footage of the operation.\n\n'Minutes before, there were more than 20 kids playing - then, the MILITARY comes through,' Bass posted.\n\n'The SECOND I heard about this, I went to the park to speak to the person in charge to tell them it needed to end NOW. Absolutely outrageous.'\n\nDuring a televised press conference the same day she fumed: 'In my opinion, it's a political agenda of invoking fear and terror. No plan other than fear, chaos, and politics.'\n\nNo arrests or detainments were made at the park and Harris, still trim following years of military service, described the appearance of ICE as more like a 'show of force.'\n\nHe described the mayor's comments regarding the incident as typical political 'spin.'\n\nBass, asserted Harris, 'would have served herself better if she had focused on the serious drug and homeless infestation' in the area.\n\n'There's drug dealers here,' he said, there's homeless… it's crazy here, with a lot of mental illness.'\n\nMoney spent by Bass and other city officials has merely disappeared into a 'big sinkhole.'\n\nOriginally called Westlake Park, its name was changed in 1942 to honor of World Ward II army general Douglas MacArthur, according to the LA Conservancy website. \n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, it had become a 'well-known cruising site within the LGBTQ community.' \n\nWithout satire, the non-profit calls the park a 'vibrant place of music, art, and community.'\n\nCity Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who represents the area, said: 'MacArthur Park is the Ellis Island of the West Coast.\n\n'It was chosen as this administration's latest target precisely because of who lives there and what it represents: resilience, diversity and the American dream.'\n\nMakeshift signs posted around the park read: 'Reports say la migra/ICE is raiding MacArthur Park July 7. Avoid the area if possible.' \n\nThe day following the immigration raid, the park's playgrounds were deserted. \n\n'I've seen tweakers in the park…but I've never personally seen children,' Dominic Palmer told the Daily Mail, referring to addicts under the influence of methamphetamine.\n\nThe 25-year-old was at the entrance to the park across from the Department of Public Social Services, with it's long line of people seeking services, at the corner of Park View Avenue and 6th Street when the agents moved in. \n\nHe said people who weren't typically at the park showed up to 'live stream on TikTok and yell at police.'\n\nPalmer was stationed at the park to help to low-income individuals on government assistance to sign up for free free smartphones and wireless service.\n\n'It's a humbling experience,' he added, surveying the homeless and addicts laying a few feet away. \n\n'You wake up every day thinking you've got problems - then you see people who've got problems. It helps to help them.'\n\nTwo Los Angeles Police Department officers in a patrol car on park grounds, who wished to remain anonymous, advised the Daily Mail to avoid the eastern end that skirts South Alvarado Street, where the most intense drug-related activity takes place.\n\nLast week, they responded to a shooting that occurred when a man was shot and injured during a drug deal.\n\n'Please be careful so you don't get hurt,' advised one of the officers. 'They'll take your headphones, your phone and your shoes.'\n\nRosalio Santos, 54, a groundskeeper for the city's Department of Recreation and Parks confirmed to the Daily Mail that areas of the park are 'dangerous' due to the proliferation of drug users.\n\nAnd grandfather Sergio Carno, 53, who works in the area, said the addicts 'make this place look bad.'\n\nHe was in the park when the ICE operation began and said 'people were scared and started running when that s**t happened.'\n\nHe moved to the U.S. in 1987 and described himself as a 'resident alien' with a Green Card but regrets not previously applying for citizenship. \n\n'It's too bad that I waited this long to make a decision,' he told the Daily Mail. 'Now I can't because they are denying the applications.'\n\nHe added of Trump's raids: 'People are scared. They don't even want to come outside and work. They can't go to the grocery store to get what they need.'\n\nMarla, 49, a warehouse machine operator who didn't want to reveal her last name, was visiting the park with her 16-year-old son Vladimir and mother Soledad, 81, who emigrated to America from Mexico decades ago. \n\nShe said fewer people visit the park and there are less street vendors out since the city-wide raids began, sparking protests and violent clashes with law enforcement. \n\nToday, the family always keeps their immigration documents on their person when they venture outside. The trio were visiting the park, said Marla, because her son was experiencing 'cabin fever.'\n\n'Usually my friends are outside but right now they're not going outside at all,' he said.\n\nWitnessing the raids has made Soledad 'nervous' and given her headaches. 'This is a beautiful country,' she said, 'but right now, there's no freedom of speech because of the politicians.'\n\nSteve, a 44-year-old computer programmer said the park, overlooked by the Mexican Consulate's office, has 'a dark side and is full of drug addicts.'\n\nHe also warned of human-trafficking in the area. \n\n'It's scary because there's human trafficking going on,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I know people that have been taken. They're gone.\n\n'This is close to Mexico so it's super, super dangerous.'\n\nHe was at the park with two friends - a young immigrant mother and her seven-year-old daughter - who were homeless before he helped them find shelter and food.\n\nHe described the appearance of immigration agents at MacArthur Park as 'some sort of publicity thing.'\n\nThose impacted by the recent raids are 'hard-working people' but are now 'terrified to leave their house but they're hungry have rent due, and so then they have to go out.\n\n'They need to be able to go out to sustain their way of living, work, food, everything.' \n\nReferring to the Jewish teen diarist who was forced to hide out in an attic with her family from Nazi oppressors in the Netherlands before finally being sent to die in a gas chamber in 1945 aged 15, Steve said the U.S. had turned into 'a whole country of Anne Franks.'\n\nHe added: 'There's a lot of fear going on, because the rules are being broken all the time by ICE. It's really messed up and scary.\n\n'For the longest time, it seemed so dramatic to say this is like the Nazis but I hate it. My family and I are disgusted by the administration and what our country is now. \n\n'People in masks are showing up with body armor and guns - it's scary s**t.' The Daily Mail has reached out to Mayor Bass's office for comment.","summary":"When Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass decried the presence of ICE in the city's downtown MacArthur Park this week, she gave the impression that agents had overrun an urban idyll.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14888095/LA-Mayor-Karen-Bass-caught-outrageous-LIE-sums-Democrat-run-cities-hellholes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/10/20/100199007-0-image-m-9_1752177591494.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/10/8049939054736656804/1024x576_MP4_8049939054736656804.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-13 00:36:15","author":"David Thompson,Editor","authors":["David Thompson","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":341030540,"title":"Chelsea out to stop PSG completing clean sweep in Club World Cup final","text":"EAST RUTHERFORD: Chelsea must somehow try to stop an irresistible Paris St Germain side from adding the Club World Cup trophy to their UEFA Champions League title as the final of the first edition of FIFA’s expanded competition takes place on Sunday. \n\nPSG travelled to the United States fresh from becoming European champions with a stunning 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan in Munich in late May, and they have lived up to their favourites tag at the Club World Cup. \n\nLuis Enrique’s side put four goals past Atletico Madrid in the group stage, four more past Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami in the last 16, and then proved too strong for Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. \n\nThey appeared to hit new heights as they tore apart Kylian Mbappe’s Real Madrid in the last four, when their 4-0 winning margin could have been far greater. \n\nThe Parisians now stand on the verge of an extraordinary achievement, as they look to complete a clean sweep of trophies in this marathon 2024/25 season and add the world title to their French and European crowns. \n\n“We want to finish this historic season in the best possible way,” Luis Enrique told reporters on Friday at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium. “Now we must open the next chapter, win more major trophies. We want to make more history by winning on Sunday. \n\n“But we have to win this game to round things off. However, in a final there is always a winner and a loser, and that doesn’t mean the loser has necessarily done anything wrong. We will lose again at some point, because that is what happens in top-level football, but I think the path is clear for everyone.” \n\nLuis Enrique has overseen a significant transformation at PSG, replacing departing stars Neymar, Lionel Messi, and Mbappe with a dynamic, youthful squad that embodies his total football philosophy. \n\nThe Spaniard downplayed suggestions that he is the teams central figure, instead crediting the players’ shared commitment to a common goal. \n\n“I’m not a star... I like the work I do. I enjoy my career, especially during difficult times,” Luis Enrique said. “When things aren’t going well, I feel better. It’s nice when everything works out because the best thing about winning is making the people who follow us happy. I’ve been much better when I’ve been criticised than when I’ve been praised.” \n\nPSG are therefore overwhelming favourites for the game which will be played at the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium — with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop — and which is set to be attended by Donald Trump. \n\nThis is the first edition of the 32-team Club World Cup, and whoever wins on Sunday will be world champions for four years, with the next tournament scheduled to take place in 2029. \n\n“We are aware of the importance of this match, that it is a golden opportunity to be in a World Cup final,” said PSG captain Marquinhos. “This only happens every four years, and we don’t know where we will be in four years.” \n\nChelsea have plenty of reason to believe too, with Sunday’s game finally wrapping up a campaign in which they won the UEFA Conference League and also finished fourth in the Premier League to qualify for the Champions League. \n\nWhile PSG lost to Botafogo during the group stage, Chelsea were also beaten by Brazilian opposition in Flamengo. \n\nHowever, they have gone on to defeat Benfica as well as two other Brazilian teams, Palmeiras and Fluminense, to reach the final. \n\nPSG’s record against English opposition in 2025 shows the size of task facing Chelsea — the French club faced four Premier League teams in the Champions League and beat them all, from Manchester City and Liverpool, to Aston Villa and then Arsenal. \n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday at the MetLife Stadium, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca emphasised the tactical nature of the showdown, likening it to a game of chess. \n\n“I really love chess and I see many similarities between chess and football,” Maresca said. “At a tactical level, I don’t believe in chess moves during matches but the manager must react when another manager reacts. Of course, this will be a tough chess match against Luis Enrique but we will try to enjoy it, for sure.” \n\nMaresca, who has guided Chelsea into the final with a mix of defensive solidity and attacking flair, was full of admiration for his opposite number. \n\n“For sure, PSG and their manager, Luis Enrique, are a reference not only for me but for many people who love football. I believe they have an incredible team, and their coach is, along with Pep Guardiola, the best in the world right now,” he said. “This is a team composed of incredible players. It will be a difficult and great challenge but we have our style. We’ve shown the way we want to do things.” \n\nThe match brings down the curtain on a month-long competition that FIFA is already hailing as a huge success. \n\nBut concerns over the heat of an American summer have plagued the tournament, with Chelsea’s Enzo Fernandez saying Friday that playing in the middle of the afternoon was “very dangerous” — Sunday’s game will kick off at 3:00 pm local time (1900 GMT). \n\nSoaring temperatures in several cities hosting the Club World Cup have been a focal point in the tournament, which is seen as a dry run for next year’s men’s World Cup. \n\n“Honestly, the heat is incredible.

Although few details are known, these initiatives in Africa mark an expansion in U.S. efforts to deport people to countries other than their own.

While proponents see such programs as a way of deterring what they describe as unmanageable levels of migration, human rights advocates have raised concerns over sending migrants to countries where they have no ties or that may have a history of rights violations. Last year, U.K. Supreme Court ruled that a similar plan to deport rejected asylum-seekers to Rwanda was illegal.

Trump meets with West African leaders Earlier this week, Trump held a summit with five West African leaders in the White House, which highlighted the new transactional U.S. policy towards the continent. Trump discussed migration with the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon, including the need for countries to accept the return of their nationals who do not have the right to stay in the U.S., as well as the possibility of accepting deported nationals of third countries. U.S. border tsar Tom Homan told the media Friday that the Trump administration hopes to forge deals with “many countries” to accept deported migrants. “If there is a significant public threat or national security threat — there's one thing for sure — they're not walking the streets of this country. We'll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we're doing it,\" he said. What African leaders are saying Liberian President Joseph Boakai told media in Liberia on Friday that third-country nationals were discussed but that Trump had not directly asked Liberia to accept such deportees. “They're not forcing anybody, but they want us to know that this is the concern they have, and they are asking how can we contribute, how can we help?” he said. President Umaro Sissoco Embaló of Guinea Bissau said Trump discussed the topic during the summit, but did not specifically ask for the African nations to agree to accept deportees. Other West African governments did not reply to a request for comment. Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yussuf Tuggar, meanwhile, said such conversations were being held between U.S. representatives and several African countries, though he declined provide details. He said late Thursday that Nigeria would not bow to what he described as pressure to accept third-country deportees, saying the country had enough problems of its own. What's in it for African countries Experts say some African countries may seek to facilitate U.S. deportation programs in order to earn good will in negotiations over tariffs, cuts in U.S. aid or visa restrictions that have hit several African countries in recent months. Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at the security consulting firm Control Risks, said countries may want to reach a migrant deal to avoid a situation \"where they lose access to the U.S. economy or economic initiatives and bilateral relations.' Those factors are especially important, “in light of the withdrawal of developmental aid,” Ochieng told The Associated Press. What has been done so far So far, the only African country to accept third-country deportees from the U.S. has been South Sudan, which accepted eight deportees with criminal convictions, only one of whom was from South Sudan. It is unclear what deal may have been struck between the two countries. The South Sudanese Foreign Ministry has declined to answer questions. Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa program director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said the South Sudan would have “a number of reasons to want to placate a Trump administration, be that avoiding visa bans, warding off more sanctions against its elite, or generally trying to curry favor.” The decision has drawn criticism from South Sudanese civil society and some members of government. “South Sudan is not a dumping ground for criminals,” said Edmund Yakani, a prominent civil society leader in the country. Homan, the U.S. border tsar, said Friday he was unsure of the situation of the eight men, saying they were no longer in U.S. custody. Lawyers and advocates are concerned about that kind of uncertainty over the legal status and safety of such migrants, said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for Migration Policy Institute. “There's a lot of confusion and lack of clarity over who actually has control of these individuals when they're deported to a third country,” Mittelstadt said. Rwanda's foreign minister told the AP last month that talks were under way with the U.S. about a potential agreement to host deported migrants, without providing details. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on a potential deal. Rights groups have long criticized Rwanda for their human rights record, especially the deaths in Rwandan custody of some perceived government critics. The U.K. struck a deal with Rwanda in 2022 to send migrants who arrive in the U.K. as stowaways or in boats to the East African country, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay. But the plan was stalled by legal challenges and criticized by human rights groups.

The decision aligns with the administration's embrace of vaccine skepticism and could set a precedent for how federal authorities handle similar cases moving forward.The move intensifies scrutiny of Bondi's leadership at the Justice Department, following recent firings of senior officials who worked on Trump-related investigations, raising questions about potential political influence in prosecutorial decisions.What To KnowMoore, 58, from Salt Lake County, Utah, was indicted by a federal grand jury in January 2023 alongside his medical corporation and three co-defendants, including his neighbor.Acting U.S. Attorney for Utah Felice John Viti filed the dismissal motion Saturday, stating \"such dismissal is in the interests of justice.\" The trial had begun Monday with jury selection in Salt Lake City and was expected to last 15 days before Bondi's intervention ended the prosecution.According to the 2023 federal indictment, Moore and his co-defendants faced up to 35 years in prison on charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to convert government property, and aiding and abetting those efforts. The charges were brought during former President Joe Biden's administration after an investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, Homeland Security Investigations, and the FBI.The government alleged that Moore's Plastic Surgery Institute of Utah destroyed at least $28,028.50 worth of government-provided COVID-19 vaccines and distributed fraudulently completed vaccination record cards for 1,937 doses in exchange for cash payments or required \"donations\" to a specified charitable organization. Most significantly, the scheme allegedly involved administering saline shots to minors at their parents' request, allowing children to believe they were receiving actual COVID-19 vaccines while their parents obtained fraudulent vaccination certificates.Bondi justified dropping the charges by arguing on social media that Moore \"gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so\" and stated he \"did not deserve the years in prison he was facing.\"The co-defendants included Kari Dee Burgoyne, 52, Kristin Jackson Andersen, 59, and Sandra Flores, 31, who worked alongside Moore in the alleged scheme.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic who refused during confirmation hearings to acknowledge scientific consensus on vaccine safety, has publicly supported Moore since April.What People Are SayingAttorney General Pam Bondi's X post on Saturday: \"Dr. Moore gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so. He did not deserve the years in prison he was facing. It ends today.\"Bondi thanked Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor: \"This would not have been possible without @RepMTG who brought this case to my attention. She has been a warrior for Dr. Moore and for ending the weaponization of government.\"Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s X post in April: \"Dr. Moore deserves a medal for his courage and his commitment to healing!\"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Moore a hero on X and said: \"We can never again allow our government to turn tyrannical under our watch.\"Curt L. Muller, Special Agent in Charge, HHS Office of Inspector General (from 2023): \"By allegedly falsifying vaccine cards and administering saline shots to children instead of COVID-19 vaccines, not only did this provider endanger the health and well-being of a vulnerable population but also undermined public trust and the integrity of federal health care programs.\"Acting Special Agent in Charge Chris Miller, HSI Las Vegas (from 2023): \"This defendant allegedly used his medical profession to administer bogus vaccines to unsuspecting people, to include children falsifying a sense of security.\"What Happens NextThe dismissal effectively ends Moore's federal prosecution, though questions remain about whether similar cases nationwide might face similar treatment under Bondi's leadership.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.","summary":"Attorney General Pam Bondi dropped federal charges against a Utah doctor accused of faking COVID-19 vaccine cards and giving saline shots.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-drops-covid-vaccine-fraud-charges-against-utah-doctor-2098262","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2682108/doj.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-13 00:09:21","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":341029256,"title":"The Office producer Ash Atalla admits he 'sold a bit of himself' when he let Ricky Gervais joke about his disability","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret Harry peace summit: King Charles and Duke of Sussex's senior aides meet for talks near royal palace in first step towards reconciliation and strongest sign yet both sides want to resolve bitter family feud\n\nI was overjoyed to marry the handsome love of my life Paul but after 22 years he dropped a bombshell that shattered our family - he was living a double life as a trans woman named Elizabeth... this is what happened next\n\nPolice 'arrest EastEnders actor on suspicion of indecent assault on set in front of shocked BBC soap opera stars'\n\nUltimate guide to having your best sex EVER in middle-age: Top doctor's medically-backed advice for women on how to treat the hurdles stopping you having an incredible love life\n\nSo why DID Adele miss her best friend's 50th?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy LAURA PARKIN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:56 BST, 13 July 2025 |Updated:01:08 BST, 13 July 2025 \n\nAsh Atalla has admitted that he 'sold a bit of himself' when he let Ricky Gervais joke about his disability at the British Comedy Awards in 2001.\nThe producer, 53, who worked alongside the comedian on hit series The Office, 64, shared his regret explaining how he now questions if he was 'right to do that.' \nWhile accepting an award for The Office on stage together at the event, Ricky joked that Ash, who uses a wheelchair, was the show's runner.\nHe also referred to him as 'my little wheelchair friend' and quipped that he was 'just the same as Stephen Hawking, but without all the clever stuff'.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Ash, recalled how he had suggested the joke but has since reconsidered the skit. \nHe explained: 'People in wheelchairs weren't on stages back then. That started the double act of that material on stage.'\n\nAsh Atalla has admitted that he 'sold a bit of himself' when he let Ricky Gervais joke about his disability at the British Comedy Awards in 2001\n\nThe producer, 53, who worked alongside the comedian on hit series The Office, 64, shared his regret explaining how he now questions if he was 'right to do that' (L-R Ricky, Mackenzie Crook, Ash, Stephen Merchant and Martin Freeman in 2004)\nAsh continued: 'I think when I look back on it, maybe I realise, or I feel I sold a bit of myself in that moment. \n'I put the wheelchair front and centre, because I knew it was something that would set me apart, in that instance, set me apart in a good way. \n'And just in recent years, as I've thought about it, it's made me consider whether I was sort of right to do that.'\nSpeaking on stage at the time, Ricky joked: 'That's Ash, the producer. He wanted me to tell you that so you didn't think he'd won a competition.\n'Thanks very much for this to the British Comedy Awards. You've done a wonderful thing - not for me, but look at his little face.'\nAsh responded with a rude gesture and Ricky added: 'He can't help that.' \nPreviously, Ash admitted Ricky's repeated jokes about disability made him feel 'a little bit uncomfortable'.\nIn a 2021 interview with The Times, Ash said that he 'wasn't bothered' by Ricky's comments at the time, but feels different many years later.\nHe said: 'I felt a little bit uncomfortable. There was a period of late Nineties comedy with the likes of Ricky Gervais, Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle where the game was – see what you could get away with and then reverse intellectualise it.\n\nWhile accepting an award for The Office on stage together at the event, Ricky joked that Ash, who uses a wheelchair, was the show's runner (pictured in 2004)\n\nAsh continued: 'I think when I look back on it, maybe I realise, or I feel I sold a bit of myself in that moment... it's made me consider whether I was sort of right to do that' (pictured in 2023)\nAsh added: 'Those jokes didn't bother me at the time, but they would if they happened now. \n'I wouldn't allow so many jokes to be made about my wheelchair, I wouldn't want to be defined by that.'\nThe Office, the hit mockumentary sitcom created by comedians Ricky and Stephen Merchant, famously stars Ricky as paper company boss David Brent. \nLast month, the BBC has slapped the beloved sitcom with trigger warnings as five episodes were flagged for 'discriminatory language'. \nBoth series of the noughties programme were already labelled with a G symbol on BBC iPlayer, which flags parental guidance for younger viewers. \nBut nearly half of the BBC series' 14 episodes, following life at Wernham Hogg's Slough office, now also carry the additional content notice. \nIn series one, which aired in 2001, the first and last episodes - Downsize and Judgement - bear the alert. \nMeanwhile, a whopping half of the second series, released in 2002, has been hit with trigger warnings - episodes one, three and five, named Merger, Party and Charity. \n\nThe Office, the hit mockumentary sitcom created by comedians Ricky and Stephen Merchant , famously stars Ricky as paper company boss David Brent \n\nThe Office, now considered one of the best British sitcoms of all time, took home a whole host of awards when it first hit our screens\nThe Office, now considered one of the best British sitcoms of all time, took home a whole host of awards when it first hit our screens. \nIt won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy in 2004, making it the first ever British comedy to take home a gong at the ceremony. \nRicky also received the Golden Globe for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in the same year. \nIts success lead to an American spin-off version in 2005, starring Steve Carell in the equivalent of Ricky's role. \nThe US programme ran to an impressive nine series and just over 200 episodes, ending in 2013.\nRicky Gervais\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Office producer Ash Atalla admits he 'sold a bit of himself' when he let Ricky Gervais joke about his disability\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Lavrov, who arrived in North Korea on Friday for a three-day visit, also held talks with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui on Saturday.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Announces 30% Import Tariffs on European Union and Mexico Over Trade and Border Issues From August 1.\n\"We exchanged views on the situation surrounding the Ukrainian crisis,\" Lavrov said at a press conference following the meeting, as quoted by the Russian state media agency TASS. \"Our Korean friends confirmed their firm support for all the objectives of the special military operation, as well as for the actions of the Russian leadership and armed forces.\"\nCNN reported that Lavrov's visit marks the second round of strategic dialogue between the countries, following the first round of talks in Moscow in November 2024, when Choe Son Hui visited Russia. At that time, Lavrov praised what he described as \"very close contacts\" with North Korea's military and intelligence services.\nAlso Read | India To Begin Rare Earth Magnet Production in Hyderabad To Counter China's Supply Curbs: Union Minister of Coal and Mines G Kishan Reddy.\nThe trip comes at a crucial moment, with Pyongyang reportedly preparing to deploy an additional 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers to aid Russia's escalated offensive in Ukraine, CNN said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. These forces would add to the estimated 11,000 North Korean soldiers sent to Russia last year.\nCNN also reported that North Korean troops have been living and fighting in dugouts alongside Russian forces in the border region of Kursk, where they helped repel Ukrainian advances last year. Western officials estimate that around 4,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in the conflict.\nAmid increasing integration, CNN noted that training manuals for North Korean artillery have been translated into Russian, reflecting growing interoperability between the two militaries. Additionally, a report from 11 UN member states revealed that Pyongyang sent at least 100 ballistic missiles and nine million artillery shells to Russia in 2024.\nAs Russia faces frontline shortages despite round-the-clock domestic production, it has grown more reliant on North Korea for arms and ammunition. Satellite images obtained by CNN showed troop transport ships and cargo planes moving between North Korea and Russia, suggesting extensive military logistics underway.\nMeanwhile, Russia has stepped up its aerial campaign in Ukraine, launching a record 728 drones and 13 missiles on Wednesday, followed by an all-direction drone attack on Kyiv Thursday -- a new tactic testing Ukraine's strained defenses.

This is what the reports were stating. Now they didn't say that explicitly, but from reading the findings, it tells me that it wasn't a Pilot error. What the report seems to be suggesting is the error with the chip,\" the former pilot told Reuters in an interview.\n\"What the report seems to be suggesting is the error with the chip. It's as simple as one chip not working properly, losing contact,\" he added.\nA former pilot has shed light on the possible cause of the AI171 crash, stating that a technical issue may have been responsible for the incident. According to the former pilot, once contact is lost, the system can fail, much like a laptop experiencing a blue screen of death.\nHe explained that the thermal cycle being in a warm condition could have caused the signal to not be contacted properly. \"Once you lose contact, it's kind of like how electricity works; the signal is not contacted properly. It's because the thermal cycle is in a warm condition,\" Chan said.\nThe former pilot further elaborated that the system may have stopped functioning due to excessive workload, similar to a laptop shutting down. \"It's been working very hard, like your laptop stops working, basically giving you the blue screen of death and Windows,\" the former pilot added.\nDuring the interview with Reuters, the former pilot pointed out that the fuel control unit (FU) failed to receive a command to stay in a run position, resulting in a brief interruption in fuel supply. \"It doesn't command the FU to be in a run position even for a split second. The fuel stopped for a couple of seconds, and the engine will start decelerating,\" the former pilot explained.\nRaising key questions about the Air India AI171 crash, highlighting two main areas of investigation. Chan said the investigation should focus on whether Air India carried out necessary maintenance and replacement of certain chips in accordance with the Service Bulletin.\n\"I would say now this spotlight would be on, first of all, whether Air India has carried out the necessary maintenance and replacement of those chips according to the Service Bulletin,\" Marco Chan added. The former pilot further emphasised the need to investigate the nature of the bulletin issued by GE Aviation (previously known as General Electric) and its partner, Bowen. \"The second question will likely be for Bowen and General Electric together, why it was issued as a surface bulletin rather than an airworthiness kind of mandate, where a directive or call that you must carry out those actions,\" he added.

He later served as chief of the Buffalo Township Fire Department — continuing his passion of public service and selflessness that never wavered, several participants told Newsweek on the scene.Steve Magoc, a veteran firefighter in Sarver, said he was blown away by the massive display of solidarity for Comperatore, his former friend of 15 years, as well as his widow, Helen, and two daughters, Kaylee and Allyson Comperatore, who led the lengthy procession in a white Ford Mustang convertible.\"Just coming out to show the family support,\" Magoc, 41, said. \"It's big. I've done a couple big rides and this is the biggest I've ever seen.\"The huge turnout proves Comperatore's impact throughout Butler County and beyond remains as intense as ever, Magoc said. Some riders hailed from as far away as West Virginia, other attendees told Newsweek.Karen Walker, 70, of Saxonburg, participated in Saturday's ride from Sarver to Russellton with her brother and his dog. She didn't know Comperatore personally, but withstood Saturday's summer heat to pay her respects to the fallen father of two.\"The tragedy of his death and with our president, his resilience, has caused a wave of support and national pride,\" Walker told Newsweek. \"He'd be overwhelmed.\"Jerry and Karen Bowser, of Grove City, said they weren't surprised by the droves of men, women and children who descended upon western Pennsylvania for the memorial ride.\"It was great,\" Karen Bowser said afterward. \"Corey was fantastic. He was my neighbor at one point in my life and he was just a great man.\"Dave Smith, 57, of Peters Township, south of Pittsburgh, said he decided to pay respect to Comperatore by getting back on his motorcycle for the just the second time following recent leg surgery.\"I thought it was a real good cause,\" Smith said. \"The respect for the man that's being honored today, Corey. He had a lot of hometown backing, so it just seemed like a good thing to do.\"Smith said Comperatore would \"absolutely\" be astounded by the sizeable crowd, including bikers who traveled from out of state.\"A lot of strangers, people that didn't know him,\" Smith continued. \"I talked to people who came from the Poconos, from deep West Virginia, to take part in this ride. It seems like the word got around and a lot of people thought it was a good cause and a good reason to get out and spend a day on the bike with fellow riders.\"Comperatore, a devout Christian who adored his family and two Dobermans, died while shielding his wife and daughters from bullets fired by would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who had been perched atop the rooftop of a building adjacent to the rally stage last July 13.The eight shots fired by Crooks roughly 150 yards away also wounded then-candidate Trump, as well as David Dutch, 58, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver.A Celebration of SongA daylong concert in Russellton followed Saturday's memorial ride, featuring country musician Gary Burk III, a Butler County native who penned \"Until We Meet Again\" in honor of Comperatore.\"And through that process, we ended up putting together the cruise, the concert and everything else to honor the life and legacy of Corey Comperatore,\" Burk told Newsweek prior to his Saturday evening set. \"Over the last year, I've got to know Helen and the girls pretty well and what an amazing family.\"Riders paid $30 to register each bike and $20 per passenger. Burk said all proceeds from the celebration of Comperatore's life will support causes he cherished, including first responders, churches and Doberman rescue organizations.\"We're honoring America's hero,\" Burk said. \"And we're doing that through the means of a memorial ride followed by a day of unity with music and live entertainment. The ultimate goal here is keeping his legacy alive and that Corey's never forgotten for the sacrifices he made — not only on July 13 but throughout his entire life being a volunteer fireman.\"'Still Too Difficult'Comperatore's mother, Karen Schafer Bird, and sisters, Kelly Comperatore Meeder and Dawn Comperatore Schafer, did not attend Saturday's events. The agony of his absence remains too overwhelming, Comperatore Meeder told Newsweek.\"This is all, still, too difficult for my mother,\" she said. \"She buried her only son. The 'baby' of our family. She's really not up to 'celebrating' anything, especially in crowds of people. In fact, she struggles daily with his death. It's really taken a visible toll on her.\"Comperatore Meeder, who has been outspoken in her frustration over the lack of answers about the Secret Service response that day, said the trio honored Corey's \"lifesaving legacy\" during a two-day blood drive in April.\"We simply wanted people to save another person in his honor,\" she said. \"Nothing big or flashy, no real fanfare. Just a humble plea to save someone's life. Not by reaching into your pocket and giving anyone money, but giving the very thing that will save someone's life.\"More than 190 units were donated as part of the blood drive in Freeport, Pennsylvania, organizers told Newsweek. Comperatore Meeder said she hopes to make the event an annual push with national reach.\"We know that my brother would be so proud of that,\" she said. \"People who are very moved by what happened to my brother and want to feel like they can somehow contribute — they can make a difference. Blood donors are everyday heroes.\"Corey, in contrast, didn't consider himself to be especially courageous, despite protecting his family from gunfire during his final moments, Comperatore Meeder said.\"I know my brother,\" she said. \"He was humble. He lived a quiet life. He would tell you that he is not a hero. He would tell you that he did what any good father would have done. He took that bullet for his little girl. And if he had to do it again, he would. He'd do it again and again.

Meanwhile, the PTI has warned against any attempts to topple the provincial government, even through constitutional means.\nFazl said he preferred internal change within PTI rather than an effort by the opposition to bring down the government. \"The majority of the province was 'fake' and a product of rigging,\" he said, according to Dawn.

He criticized the committee formed to bring reforms to ex-Fata for lacking KP representation. \"From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven't given our representatives,\" he said, adding that the party would consult a grand tribal jirga scheduled for Sunday before making a decision.\nFazl also questioned the government's motives behind revisiting the merger. \"Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?\" he asked, Dawn reported.\nThe JUI-F chief further stated, \"If I was content with the federal government's decisions, then I would have joined them. Both the federal and the provincial governments were a result of electoral rigging,\" Dawn added.\nMeanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi clarified that the committee on ex-Fata was not intended to reverse the merger. \"The committee was formed when the prime minister and Field Marshal [Asim] Munir visited and a jirga was held,\" he said at a press conference in Peshawar.\nDawn reported that Kundi explained, \"The provincial government said that the jirga system that had ended in the merged districts should be revived, and this is what the committee was formed for.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

It's an issue all over the world… We have stadiums as well, which are covered. So, we'll definitely use these stadiums more in the day,\" added Infantino.\n\nThe FIFA president also said the idea that European spectators and clubs were particularly critical was not founded.\n\n\"We shouldn't say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it's not true.

Sara Jacobs, D-San Diego, has introduced a bill to fund affordable child care. \n\nThe Leveraging Estate Gains for America’s Children and Youth Act, or LEGACY, would cut the recent Republican spending bill’s federal estate tax exemption by $7 million and allot 15% of the generated revenue for child care. \n\nThe bill, authored by Jacobs – whose 51st congressional district includes central and eastern San Diego, along with La Mesa and El Cajon — would essentially reverse course on the estate tax exemptions outlined in what President Donald Trump has referred to as the “big, beautiful bill.” \n\n “Wealthy families like mine didn’t build our wealth alone, and we shouldn’t hoard the benefits of success that’s not only ours,” said Jacobs in a statement. “I believe it’s our responsibility to fix the systems that worked for us – but leave too many people in poverty or on the edges of poverty while corporate profits and income inequality skyrocket.”\n\nChildcare costs vary significantly across jurisdictions. According to a Department of Labor estimate in 2018, in any given county, the median cost per child for paid care was anywhere from 8.0% to 19.3% of the median household income in that county. \n\nThe LEGACY Act also would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to create an Early Childhood Education Trust Fund through the allotment of 15% of revenue from estate taxes. A quarter of the trust will be used for “stabilization” grants to address the supply-side of child care, according to a statement by Jacob’s office. \n\nIf the bill passes, the current estate tax threshold will be lowered to almost half of what was passed in the recent Republican budget bill. \n\n“Using revenues from estate taxes to stabilize and bolster our child care system – and to make it possible to pay child care workers living wages – would strengthen the child care workforce, allow more moms and parents to hold jobs, help kids thrive and make it possible for more of us to contribute to our communities,” said Executive Director and CEO Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner of MomsRising, which supports Jacobs’ bill.","summary":"The Leveraging Estate Gains for America’s Children and Youth Act, or LEGACY, would cut the recent spending bill’s federal estate tax exemption. ","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/07/12/san-diego-rep-sara-jacobs-introduces-bill-to-fund-child-care/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childcare-Facility-Construction-04-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:57:31","author":"Swasti Singhai • Times of San Diego","authors":["Swasti Singhai • Times of San Diego"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":341036746,"title":"Infantino isytihar Piala Dunia Kelab satu kejayaan","text":"NEW YORK: Menjelang final Piala Dunia Kelab, Presiden FIFA Gianni Infantino mengisytiharkan kejohanan itu sebagai satu kejayaan, sambil mengambil pengajaran daripada kritikan yang dilemparkan termasuk isu cuaca panas melampau dan stadium yang hanya separuh penuh bagi sesetengah perlawanan.\n\nInfantino berkata beliau lebih gemar melihat lebih ramai peminat di stadium yang besar walaupun tidak penuh, dan mencadangkan stadium berbumbung diberi keutamaan bagi perlawanan siang hari ketika Piala Dunia tahun depan yang turut dianjurkan oleh Amerika Syarikat, Kanada dan Mexico.\n\n\"Sudah tentu, setiap kritikan yang kami terima adalah satu sumber untuk kami kaji dan analisis demi melihat apa yang boleh kami perbaiki,\" kata Infantino dalam satu acara media di Trump Tower, New York semalam.\n\n\"Saya lebih suka, contohnya, meletakkan 35,000 orang di stadium berkapasiti 80,000 tempat duduk berbanding 20,000 orang di stadium yang hanya boleh memuatkan 20,000 tempat duduk,\" katanya.\n\n\"Cuaca panas memang satu isu.

In a lengthy post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump threw his support behind Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has attracted most of the flak from MAGA supporters over the Epstein Files memo, and suggested that these files were written by people working for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, James Comey, and John Brennan. \"Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration...... They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called “friends” are playing right into their hands,\" Trump posted. Trump has shut down reporters asking questions on the Epstein Files memo and berated them for focusing on this subject rather than talking about what he thinks are topics of more importance, like the Texas floods. His latest post, suggesting that the Epstein Files were written by Democrats, sparked more backlash for the President, with one user on X writing, \"This is so embarrassingly insulting. At some point, we must stop using Bondi, Bongino, or Kash as scapegoats and demand answers from Trump himself.\" Also read: Epstein Files Fallout: Charlie Kirk Reveals Email Evidence, Defends Bondi Amid Resignation Calls \"In an unforeseen and demented twist, Trump is now claiming the Epstein files are a creation of Obama, Hillary and the Democrats.

While on the campaign trail in 2024, the 79-year-old stated that he would release the Epstein Files as soon as he won the Oval Office. However, his recent actions, as well as the suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein is \"somebody that nobody cares about,\" are in contrast with the views of many inside Trump's support base, including Laura Loomer, Steve Bannon, Liz Wheeler, and Tucker Carlson.

GOD BLESS AMERICA!'\n\nUnder US law, a president cannot revoke the citizenship of an American born in the United States. O'Donnell was born in New York state. \n\nOver the course of almost a dozen posts the comedian and former chat show host laid into Trump and any association he may have had with Epstein, but some focused squarely on the president himself.\n\n'Thirty-plus years of sexual abuse' - The known victims,' O'Donnell posted along with a profile shot of Trump and a list of women who have accused him of sexual abuse dating back to the 1980s.\n\nAnother posting showcased a photo montage showcasing Trump meeting Epstein and his convicted sex trafficker girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. In the center was a Truth Social from Trump pleading for people to 'STOP TALKING ABOUT EPSTEIN!!!!!'.\n\nOther posts designed to irk the president further saw a photoshopped picture of Trump wearing one of his signature red MAGA caps only with the words changed to read: 'I'm on the list' referring to the supposed client list Epstein kept.\n\nEarlier this week the White House has said that there is in fact no 'client list,' a narrative that some question. \n\nO'Donnell then posted a message aimed squarely in response to Trump's suggestion to revoke her citizenship.\n\n'Hey Donald - you're rattled again? 18 years later and I still live rent-free in that collapsing brain of yours. you call me a threat to humanity - but I'm everything you fear: a loud woman a queer woman. a mother who tells the truth an American who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze,' O'Donnell began. \n\n'You crave loyalty - I teach my children to question power you sell fear on golf courses - I make art about surviving trauma you lie, you steal, you degrade - I nurture, I create, I persist,' she went on.\n\n'You are everything that is wrong with America - and I'm everything you hate about what's still right with it. You want to revoke my citizenship? Go ahead and try, king Joffrey with a tangerine spray tan\n\n'i'm not yours to silence i never was - Rosie.'\n\nResponding directly to Trump's threat she wrote how the president opposes her because she 'stands in direct opposition with all he represents.' \n\n'The president of the USA has always hated the fact that i see him for who he is - a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself - this is why i moved to Ireland,' O'Donnell wrote in another posting on Saturday.\n\n'He is a dangerous old soulless man with dementia who lacks empathy compassion and basic humanity- i stand in direct opposition all he represents ... ur a bad joke who cant form a coherent sentence.' \n\nIn other blatant attacks on Trump, O'Donnell posted artwork of the president stating 'He rapes', while in another she posted a tweet stating: 'Damn, I wish Trump would go after the Epstein list pedophiles the way he's going at Rosie O'Donnell rn.'\n\n'Let's not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,' Trump concluded, casting the controversy as a ploy to derail his political momentum.\n\nO'Donnell, a longtime target of Trump's insults and jabs, moved to Ireland earlier this year with her 12-year-old son after the start of the president's second term. \n\nShe has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.\n\nO'Donnell, said in a March TikTok video that she would return to the US 'when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America.'\n\nTrump's outburst followed O'Donnell's July 7 HuffPost interview, in which she discussed her decades-long feud with him and her 2024 move to Ireland, made ahead of Trump's reelection.\n\nTrump's disdain for O'Donnell dates back to 2006 when O'Donnell, a comedian and host on The View at the time, mocked Trump over his handling of a controversy concerning a winner of the Miss USA pageant, which Trump had owned. \n\n'I look at America and I feel overwhelmingly depressed,' O'Donnell, 63, said, citing her need to protect her mental health and care for her 12-year-old son, who has autism. \n\n'I knew what [the Trump administration] was planning to do, because I read Project 2025. I know what he's capable of. And I didn't want to put myself through another four years of him being in charge.'\n\nWatching Trump's second term from abroad, O'Donnell added: 'I think it's as bad as everyone worried it would be. I believe fascism has taken a foothold in the United States.'\n\nShe also criticized a new bill she claims grants Trump his own 'secret police,' with a budget 'greater than the money we give to Israel, which is already unbelievably high.'\n\n'I look at America, and it feels tragic,' she said. 'I feel sad. I feel overwhelmingly depressed. I don't understand how we got here.'\n\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly brought up O'Donnell, including during the first Republican primary debate in August 2015. \n\nWhen moderator Megyn Kelly questioned his use of terms like 'fat pigs,' 'dogs,' and 'slobs' to describe women, he replied, 'Only Rosie O'Donnell.'\n\nHer name eventually resurfaced during a debate with Hillary Clinton, when Trump said, 'Rosie O'Donnell has been very vicious to me. I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree she deserves it.'\n\nO'Donnell responded in a now-deleted post on X, calling him an 'orange anus.'\n\nAfter Trump's first election, O'Donnell told W Magazine in October 2017 that she struggled to cope with his presidency, saying it took her a year to regain emotional balance. \n\n'I seriously worry whether I personally will be able to live through [his presidency] and whether the nation will be able to survive,' she said. 'It's a terrifying concept, on the brink of nuclear war with a madman in charge.'\n\nTrump's latest jab at O'Donnell seemed to be in response to a TikTok video she posted this month mourning the 119 deaths in the July 4 floods in Texas and blaming Trump's widespread cuts to environmental and science agencies involved in forecasting major natural disasters.\n\n'What a horror story in Texas,' O'Donnell said in the video. 'And you know, when the president guts all the early warning systems and the weathering forecast abilities of the government, these are the results that we're gonna start to see on a daily basis.'\n\nThe Trump administration, as well as local and state officials, have faced mounting questions over whether more could have been done to protect and warn residents ahead of the Texas flooding, which struck with astonishing speed in the pre-dawn hours of July 4 and killed at least 120, including dozens of children.\n\nOn Friday, Trump visited Texas and defended the government's response to the disaster, saying his agencies 'did an incredible job under the circumstances.'\n\nIn a sprawling social media post on Saturday evening, Trump once again lashed out at the renewed attention on Jeffrey Epstein, dismissing the disgraced financier as a distraction orchestrated by his political enemies and insisting the so-called 'Epstein Files' are part of a smear campaign aimed at undermining his administration.\n\n'All over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein,' Trump wrote, complaining that 'selfish people' were damaging his 'perfect' administration by focusing on the late sex offender. \n\nHe accused figures like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, John Brennan, and 'the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration' of fabricating the Epstein documents - likening them to the 'FAKE' Steele dossier used in the Russia probe.\n\nTrump went further, suggesting that if the Epstein files actually contained anything damaging to the MAGA movement, his critics would have already weaponized them.\n\n'Why didn't these Radical Left Lunatics release the Epstein Files?' he asked. 'If there was ANYTHING in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it?'\n\nHe also criticized the FBI for spending 'month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein,' and urged the agency to refocus on voter fraud and political corruption.","summary":"Rosie O'Donnell reignited her decades-long feud with Donald Trump in a blistering online barrage, accusing him of abuse, corruption, and unfitness for office.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14900321/Rosie-ODonnell-goes-scorched-earth-Trump-threatens-revoke-citizenship.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/12/23/100258511-0-image-a-8_1752360446883.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:51:07","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":341032230,"title":"Trump Announces 30% Tariffs on EU Goods as Trade Talks Stall","text":"The announcement follows failed attempts in recent weeks to strike a trade deal between the US and EU. Top EU leaders said negotiations would continue but have vowed to protect the bloc's interests.The United States is set to impose a 30% tariff on all goods from the European Union from August 1, US President Donald Trump said on his Truth Social platform Saturday.\nAlso Read | Balasore Student Self-Immolation Case: Girl Student Sets Herself on Fire Over Harassment by Professor, Principal Suspended in Odisha; Disturbing Video Surfaces.\nThe EU had been prepared for such a move, which comes a day after Trump told Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney that he would impose a 35% tariffs on Canadian imports.\nAlso Read | Maharashtra Bandh on July 14: Bars and Permit Rooms To Remain Shut As Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association Calls for Strike Over Tax Hike, Check Their Key Demands and Other Details.\nThe 27-member bloc and the US failed to reach an agreement to strike a comprehensive trade deal, including zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods. In addition to the tariffs on EU goods, Trump posted another letter to his platform, declaring a 30% tariff rate on goods from Mexico beginning August 1 as well. What did Trump say in his letter to the EU? The US president said the trade relationship with the EU has been \"unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.\" As such, \"we will charge the European Uniona Tariff of only 30%,\" he said. Trump has frequently described tariffs as charges on other countries. However, the burden falls on consumers within the US, as tariffs make imported goods more expensive and thus less competitive.\n\"Please understand that the 30% number is far less than what is needed to eliminate the Trade Deficit disparity we have with the EU,\" he added, referring to the difference in goods imported from the EU and goods exported to the EU. Trump invited the bloc to negotiate further, writing in his letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that high tariff rates would be dropped if \"the European Union, or countries within the EU, decide to build or manufacture within the United States.\" Trump has spent the week sending letters to trading partners, announcing new rates for a number of countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil. Trump's tariff on EU goods: Where do things stand? Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the US has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, Trump put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets and allow time for negotiations. But the president expressed frustration at talks with the EU. In May, he threatened to impose a tariff rate of 50% on EU goods into the US. That would cause a price hike on everything from Italian leather goods to French cheese to German electronics in the US. Then Trump announced that universal tariffs that were due to kick in July 9 would be delayed until at least the beginning of August. The EU currently faces 50% US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports, 25% on cars and car parts and 10% on most other products. How has the EU reacted? Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is prepared to take the necessary steps to safeguard its economic interests if the US proceeds with the 30% tariff rate. In a statement, the European Commission President said that the bloc remained ready \"to continue working towards an agreement by August 1.\" \"We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,\" she added. French President Emmanuel Macron said his government shares the European Commission's \"very strong disapproval\" of Trump's announcement, which came despite \"weeks of intense engagement.\" \"France fully supports the European Commission in the negotiations, which will now intensify,\" Macron posted on X, adding that he still hopes \"a mutually acceptable agreement\" will be reached before August 1. The French president added that the bloc would need to speed up \"the preparation of credible countermeasures\" if no agreement is reached before the new tariffs take effect. The EU has the ability to enact the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) which allows it to retaliate against countries seeking to pressure its members. It has been repeatedly brought up as a possible response to Trump's threats. The ACI can limit access to companies from those countries to public procurement tenders and target services trade or investment. Germany's Economy Minister Katherina Reiche, meanwhile, warned that the US tariffs \"would hit European exporting companies hard.\" She also said that they would have a \"strong impact\" on the US economy and consumers, as she urged for a \"pragmatic outcome\" to be reached \"quickly.\" Edited by: Alex Berry and Louis Oelofse","summary":"The announcement follows failed attempts in recent weeks to strike a trade deal between the US and EU.","url":"https://www.latestly.com/india/news/trump-announces-30-tariffs-on-eu-goods-as-trade-talks-stall-6992157.html","image":"https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/73253759_403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:50:08","author":"Deutsche Welle","authors":["Deutsche Welle"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":341026806,"title":"Huge American film star 'is tipped to be the next Bond girl as she's a pal of 007 director Denis Villeneuve AND has the backing of Jeff Bezos'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret Harry peace summit: King Charles and Duke of Sussex's senior aides meet for talks near royal palace in first step towards reconciliation and strongest sign yet both sides want to resolve bitter family feud\n\nI was overjoyed to marry the handsome love of my life Paul but after 22 years he dropped a bombshell that shattered our family - he was living a double life as a trans woman named Elizabeth... this is what happened next\n\nPolice 'arrest EastEnders actor on suspicion of indecent assault on set in front of shocked BBC soap opera stars'\n\nUltimate guide to having your best sex EVER in middle-age: Top doctor's medically-backed advice for women on how to treat the hurdles stopping you having an incredible love life\n\nSo why DID Adele miss her best friend's 50th?

Although other names have been linked with the role in recent weeks.\n'The British actor remains the man punters are backing to replace Daniel Craig'.\nHowever, it is believe to not be possible for Spiderman star Tom to bag the role of 007 as he begins filming Spider Man 4 - which has the reported working name Spider-Man: Brand New Day - in the coming months. \n\nSupporters have been eagerly waiting to find out who will be the next star with a 'license to kill' after Daniel Craig relinquished the part with the 2021 film No Time To Die (pictured as Bond) \n\nTom isn't likely going to bag the role of 007 as he begins filming Spider Man 4 - which has the reported working name Spider-Man: Brand New Day - in the coming months (seen last year)\nThe studio announced on Wednesday that Denis Villeneuve - best known for directing Warner Bros.' two-part Dune adaptation - has signed on to direct the untitled film Bond film, via Amazon press release. \nThe French-Canadian filmmaker, 57, will also serve as executive producer of the project alongside Tanya Lapointe. \nAmazon had previously announced Amy Pascal and David Heyman as the film's producers, after the studio parted ways with longtime 007 caretakers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. \nThe news comes just over three years after Amazon completed its massive $8.5billion acquisition of MGM Studios that included the James Bond franchise.\n\nBookmaker Coral have reported seeing a strong wave of support also behind Netflix star Theo James, 40, and Dunkirk actor Jack Lowden, 35 (Jack pictured in January) \n\nAaron is currently the top favourite at 9-4 for the role while Theo (pictured in 2024) is second best in the betting at 4-1, while Jack can be backed at 5-1\n\nEXCLUSIVE Iconic Bond girl, 70, is unrecognizable in rare LA sighting... can you guess who? \nThere hasn't been a Bond film since 2021's No Time to Die, the final instalment with Daniel Craig as the beloved secret agent. \nThe director said in a statement, 'Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr. No with Sean Connery.' \nHe added, 'I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come.'\nThe filmmaker admitted: 'This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.'\nHe also went on to thank Bond producers Amy and David, adding they, 'are absolutely thrilled to bring him back to the screen. Thank you to Amazon MGM Studios for their trust'.\nAmy and David added, 'Denis Villeneuve has been in love with James Bond movies since he was a little boy.\n'It was always his dream to make this movie, and now it's ours, too. We are lucky to be in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker.'\nAfter Amazon acquired MGM in 2022, they obtained full creative control of the 007 franchise with a deal they struck with Barbara and Michael, the offspring of original James Bond producer, Albert R. Broccoli.\n\nElsewhere the betting site have Superman star Henry Cavill, 42, with odds of 10-1\n\nBarbara and Michael had been overseeing the franchise since 1995, when their father ceded control of his Eon Productions company to them. \n\nAmazon reached an agreement with Barbara and Michael in March 2025, and while financial terms were not disclosed, it was rumored to be upwards of $1 billion.\nVilleneuve made his directorial debut in 1998 with August 32nd on Earth, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival that year.\nHe followed that up with Maelstrom (2000), Polytechnique (2009) and Incendies (2010), the latter of which was nominated for Best International Film at the Academy Awards.\nThe filmmaker broke through in Hollywood with 2013's Prisoners, a dark drama starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nHe continued to win acclaim for 2013's Enemy, 2015's Sicario, 2016's Arrival, 2017's Blade Runner 2049 and, most recently, 2021's Dune: Part One and 2024's Dune: Part Two. \nSpeculation has continued to grow over who will be the next big-screen Bond and the Bond franchise also prompted a flurry of guesses as to where they might take the franchise next. \nBond has been spoiled with video game adaptations since the 1980s, with early adaptations taking the form of shooting games or text adventures in which players typed in what they wanted the super-spy to do.\n\nThe studio announced that Denis Villeneuve - best known for directing Warner Bros.' two-part Dune adaptation - has signed on to direct the untitled film\nAmazon bosses are currently said to be considering locations in which to set the much-anticipated new film, which experts predicted is likely to be released at the end of next year or in 2027. \nDue to a filming ban being imposed in Central London next year, new locations are reportedly being considered - with Liverpool a frontrunner, according to The Sun.\nAn insider told the publication: 'This will no doubt irk Bond purists who already fear Amazon taking over the 007 franchise may lead to them making big changes.\n'But Liverpool is a well-known alternative to London for film-makers.\n'It has appeared in everything from The Batman to Captain America and Harry Potter movies, doubling up as international cities.'\nThe source added that it doesn't necessarily mean the story will be set in Liverpool - though eagle-eyed Merseysiders will no doubt spot their city centre in the background.\nJames BondAmazonJeff Bezos\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHuge American film star 'is tipped to be the next Bond girl as she's a pal of 007 director Denis Villeneuve AND has the backing of Jeff Bezos'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

US president's heavily armed shock troops behind raids on illegal migrants will soon outnumber the FBI","text":"Clad head to toe in combat gear, including body armour, helmets and face masks, and backed by armoured personnel carriers, a helicopter, 90 National Guard soldiers and a line of horsemen, dozens of heavily armed federal immigration agents descended on Los Angeles last week in an intimidating show of force.\n\nThe military cavalcade advanced menacingly through the city’s MacArthur Park – dubbed the ‘Ellis Island of the West Coast’ after New York’s historic migrant processing centre – on Monday, in a so-called ‘immigration enforcement operation’ codenamed Operation Excalibur.\n\nUS border tsar Tom Homan said federal agents from Immigration And Customs Enforcement, better known as ‘ICE’, targeted the park because it is a hotbed of human-trafficking activity and a place migrants go when they’re trying to obtain fake Green Cards or social security numbers.\n\nSadly, the drug dealers, criminal gangs and addicts – many in the US illegally – who often hang around the park had known for days that the feds were coming and were nowhere to be seen. \n\nOnly some children playing football at a summer camp were hurriedly rushed indoors as the force marched across their pitch.\n\nHoman said no arrests resulted from the operation, because plans were leaked in advance: indeed, the area had been plastered for days with flyers warning about it. \n\nLocal Democrat leaders were furious at the intrusion, saying the operation was a political stunt intended to ‘spread fear’.\n\n‘What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,’ said Left-wing LA mayor Karen Bass, who as a US Congress member regularly visited conflict zones. ‘It’s the way a city looks before a coup.’\n\nThat powerful observation will resonate with Donald Trump critics who increasingly accuse the President of effectively creating his own personal army out of ICE. An army that, say opponents, is free to behave as it likes and which is flouting the US constitution.\n\nEstimated to be home to 900,000 undocumented immigrants, LA has so far been the focus of the ICE crackdown. In June the city was racked by days of violent clashes as Trump ordered in thousands of US Marines and National Guardsmen to contend with anti-deportation protests.\n\nBut ICE is continuing to make tens of thousands of arrests across the US, its rifle-toting agents suddenly descending on a neighbourhood, bursting out of unmarked cars in plain clothes bearing no identifiable police insignia, and snatching migrants off the street, in their homes and workplaces.\n\n They are then held in what civil rights campaigners call ‘dungeon-like’ facilities.\n\nWitnesses say arrests are sometimes so aggressive that they look like kidnappings, and there have been reports of criminals impersonating ICE agents.\n\nBut Trump administration officials insist they need to get tough against what the President calls an invasion of illegal aliens. \n\nHowever, for a nation that prides itself on existing under ‘the rule of law, not the rule of kings’, it is noteworthy that due process has been suspended for ICE’s activities. It is the only law-enforcement agency that can detain people without charge or even a hearing, then deport them.\n\nICE did this in March, when it sent several plane-loads of alleged gang members back to Central America. \n\nFamily members insist innocent people have been mixed up in such raids. Some suspects have allegedly been arrested simply for having a suspicious-looking tattoo. \n\nOthers have reportedly been targeted for speaking out against Trump’s foreign policy – a clear breach of the US constitution’s protection of free speech.\n\nAs Mayor Bass complained, it’s all disconcertingly ‘un-American’ but, as Trump repeatedly makes clear, the terror that ICE is spreading across the country is entirely intentional: it sends a sharp and effective deterrent message to those considering trying to enter the US illegally.\n\nNow ICE is about to get vastly more powerful after Trump’s new budget dramatically increased spending on the agency.\n\nAround £125 billion has been set aside for immigration enforcement and border security, of which £55 billion will go to ICE over the next four years. \n\nThis lifts the agency’s annual budget to an estimated £28 billion – higher than the defence spending of most countries. Not for nothing have some spoken of the agency as the ‘shock troops’ and even his ‘personal Gestapo’ of this presidency. \n\nMuch of that money will go on expanding ICE’s network of about 100 detention centres where migrants – sometimes entire families – are held while officials arrange their deportation. The White House envisages a system that can accommodate 116,000 deportees at a time and process one million people per year – an industrial quantity in a country estimated to have at least 12 million undocumented migrants.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Homeland Security, which controls ICE, intends to hire 10,000 new ICE agents, bringing the total to 30,000.\n\nThat will make it by far the biggest law-enforcement agency in the US, dwarfing even the FBI.\n\nHoman, a former ICE boss, calls the new investment a game-changer. He boasts: ‘This funding is going to give us thousands more beds, which means we arrest thousands more people.’\n\nThose beds include 3,000 placed inside cages in a remote, temporary ICE camp in the Florida Everglades, which has been dubbed Alligator Alcatraz because the surrounding wilderness is teeming with deadly reptiles, also including pythons.\n\nTrump visited recently and chuckled: ‘We’re going to teach them how to run away from an alligator if they escape prison.’\n\nVice President JD Vance said that when it came to government spending, everything else paled beside the importance of the ICE money. \n\nThere is a political imperative here: polling shows that along with the economy, immigration mattered more to US voters – especially Trump supporters – than any other issue at last year’s election. \n\nTrump was elected on bold promises to deport illegal immigrants. And drastically reducing the flow of migrants over the Mexican border – which soared to record numbers during Joe Biden’s administration – has been one of the biggest successes of his presidency.\n\nA recent YouGov poll shows many Americans still support Trump’s immigration policy – 45 per cent of all voters and 87 per cent of Republicans.\n\nHaving said that, it appears many Americans chiefly wanted to see drug dealers, gang members and violent criminals – the illegal migrants Trump has called animals and the ‘worst of the worst’ – expelled, not the millions of migrants who wash their cars for them, pack their groceries and pick the fruit they buy.\n\nHowever, spurred by immigration zealots like his deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, Trump has ordered ICE to arrest 3,000 undocumented migrants per day.\n\nExperts scoff that such a target is almost impossible (a month ago, ICE was managing only about a third of that figure) but it has necessitated ICE targeting whoever it can to make arrests.\n\nAgents no longer have to produce target lists of suspects: they now simply raid places where they think illegals might be. That has meant sweeping up street taco sellers, construction workers, car-wash workers and migrants who gather in the car parks of DIY stores to find day labour.\n\nICE’s supporters say it hasn’t helped that Democrat-controlled states and cities, such as New York and California, continue to stop the agency from accessing jails – the easiest places to pick up undocumented migrants who have committed crimes. As a result, a majority of those who’ve been detained by ICE don’t have criminal records.\n\nBut the desperation to keep up the arrest numbers has led to ICE officers turning up at courts to arrest migrants coming for hearings on their asylum application.\n\nMeanwhile, ICE’s critics have been incensed by what they see as its growing lack of accountability – vital, of course, to any leader’s personal army.\n\nThe conservative-dominated Supreme Court last month quashed the ability of lower court judges to block Trump’s initiatives. ICE’s in-house watchdog has been scrapped and it has refused to obey a law allowing members of Congress to visit its detention centres at will.\n\nOut on the streets, making individual ICE agents answerable for their behaviour is an immense challenge when their faces are hidden behind masks, while they carry no visible ID.\n\nThe Rev Tania Lopez said an ICE agent pointed a gun at her after she remonstrated with a group of them who came on to the grounds of her LA church to make an arrest.\n\n‘When we said we don’t want this on our property, this man just shouted, “The whole country is our property!” ’ she claimed.\n\nICE bosses and law enforcement unions counter that masking protects agents, who have sometimes been assaulted and whose faces have been posted on social media.\n\nICE’s recruitment and vetting standards are already lower than for other law enforcement agencies. Morale is so low that many agents may leave. Critics fear\n\nthe new hiring drive will make it more likely that extremists or MAGA (Make American Great Again) fanatics will be able to join – and that when Trump wants any ‘dirty work’ done, they will be happy to oblige.\n\nLeft-wing commentators warn that Americans had better get used to ICE becoming an intrusive presence in everyday life, and forecast it will damage the US economy: it’s estimated that up to one in ten workers in California alone is an illegal migrant.\n\n‘The impact will be utterly unfathomable,’ says Daniel Costa of the Economic Policy Institute think-tank. ‘We’re heading straight into becoming a surveillance state and a police state. You’re going to see ICE agents at schools, parks, hospitals, car washes, grocery stores – just about everywhere that immigrants work.’\n\nThe MAGA world will no doubt counter that only illegal migrants will need to worry.\n\nDavid Biers, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, a prominent libertarian think-tank, told The Mail on Sunday it was ‘undisputable’ that ICE was already behaving like Trump’s personal army and being used to clamp down on those expressing opinions he dislikes.\n\nBiers cited the case of Turkish PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, a former Fulbright scholar who ICE arrested without charge in March after her visa was revoked for writing a pro-Palestinian article in a student newspaper.\n\nHe added that Trump had also made clear he was ‘going after the Democrat cities’ with ICE, saying: ‘It’s political, it’s a spectacle and they want to create fear in the political opposition.’","summary":"Clad head to toe in combat  gear, dozens of heavily armed federal immigration agents descended on Los Angeles last week in an intimidating show of force.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14899951/Trumps-personal-Gestapo-America-police-state-US.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/12/19/100253521-0-image-m-22_1752343941717.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:42:02","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":341026002,"title":"Donald Trump Gives Pam Bondi Verdict Amid Reports of Clash With FBI","text":"President Donald Trump broke his silence one day after reports of a clash between U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino about the release of a memo regarding Jeffrey Epstein, which prompted conservatives on social media to call for the president to fire her.In a lengthy Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump stressed that Bondi is \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB!\" and that he has a \"PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD.\"Why It MattersEpstein, the financier and sex offender who died in prison six years ago, socialized with some of the world's most powerful people. While his death was ruled a suicide, conspiracy theories persist that he was instead killed due to his purported \"client list,\" which many have speculated to contain the names of politicians including Trump, former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew.Billionaire Elon Musk last month said the government had not released records related to the case because Trump \"is in the Epstein files.\" While the president has dismissed Musk's claim, it has sparked further interest in the government's records.During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he would release files related to Epstein, with a first batch publicized in February by Bondi. However, earlier this week, Trump and Bondi said they found \"no incriminating 'client list'\" related to Epstein, triggering major backlash among Democrats and the president's \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) supporters.Earlier this week, NewsNation reported that Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel wanted to unseal evidence months ago and release \"every single piece of evidence they could, while protecting victims.\" Bongino has denied the allegation, but on Friday CNN reported that he was considering quitting his post over the dispute.What To KnowTensions within the Trump administration escalated after a heated exchange earlier in the week between Bongino and Bondi regarding management of the Epstein case, CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported Friday. Multiple sources told the outlet that Bongino did not turn up to work on Friday, increasing speculation that he is eyeing an exit.Far-right political activist Laura Loomer stirred up conservatives on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday after news broke that Bongino's reported decision to stay or leave was contingent on whether Bondi quit as attorney general.Loomer wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that Bongino may quit unless Bondi left, and that \"the MAGA base would like to see Trump FIRE Blondi [sic]. She is a massive liability to this otherwise great administration.\"Other conservatives, including Charlie Kirk, Megyn Kelly, and former Representative George Santos, called for Trump to fire Bondi and back Bongino.However, on Saturday, Trump made clear that he backed his attorney general, writing, \"LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE'S GREAT!\"\"What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'\" Trump asked. \"They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening. We have a PERFECT Administration, THE TALK OF THE WORLD, and 'selfish people' are trying to hurt it, all over a guy who never dies, Jeffrey Epstein. For years, it's Epstein, over and over again.\"Trump then criticized coverage of the Epstein files, which he wrote were created by \"Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration, who conned the World with the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, 51 'Intelligence' Agents, 'THE LAPTOP FROM HELL,' and more.\"He continued: \"No matter how much success we have had, securing the Border, deporting Criminals, fixing the Economy, Energy Dominance, a Safer World where Iran will not have Nuclear Weapons, it's never enough for some people. We are about to achieve more in 6 months than any other Administration has achieved in over 100 years, and we have so much more to do.\"Later in the post, Trump wrote that \"Kash Patel, and the FBI, must be focused on investigating Voter Fraud, Political Corruption, ActBlue, The Rigged and Stolen Election of 2020, and arresting Thugs and Criminals, instead of spending month after month looking at nothing but the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.\"Trump then said he had tasked Bondi with looking into the 2020 and 2024 elections, once again saying the former had been \"rigged and stolen,\" before touting the U.S. is now the \"HOTTEST\" country \"anywhere in the world.\"\"Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about,\" he concluded.What People Are SayingFBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X on Saturday afternoon: \"The conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been. It's an honor to serve the President of the United States @realDonaldTrump — and I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.\"Far-right political activist Laura Loomer on Saturday wrote on X: \"President Trump says he thinks Blondi [sic] is 'doing a Fantastic job' as AG in a post he posted on Truth Social today....\"Fox News host Mark Levin wrote on X: \"President Trump has had enough of the Epsteinian kooks. Here's his just released statement.\"Charlie Kirk, conservative founder and president of Turning Point USA, wrote on X: \"President Trump on the Epstein Files, says he supports Pam Bondi at AG, the files are untrustworthy and created by Comey and Brennan. He wants his Justice Department focused on the voter fraud, the rigged election, ActBlue, and arresting thugs and criminals.\"","summary":"The Trump administration is facing significant blowback from Democrats and MAGA supporters over its handling of the Epstein files.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-gives-pam-bondi-verdict-clash-fbi-epstein-files-2098255","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2682101/donald-trump-epstein-files-fbi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:35:52","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":341026808,"title":"Beyonce makes MAJOR tour change after terrifying stunt left her hanging and screaming midair","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jul 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe secret Harry peace summit: King Charles and Duke of Sussex's senior aides meet for talks near royal palace in first step towards reconciliation and strongest sign yet both sides want to resolve bitter family feud\n\nI was overjoyed to marry the handsome love of my life Paul but after 22 years he dropped a bombshell that shattered our family - he was living a double life as a trans woman named Elizabeth... this is what happened next\n\nPolice 'arrest EastEnders actor on suspicion of indecent assault on set in front of shocked BBC soap opera stars'\n\nUltimate guide to having your best sex EVER in middle-age: Top doctor's medically-backed advice for women on how to treat the hurdles stopping you having an incredible love life\n\nSo why DID Adele miss her best friend's 50th?

If ever I fall, I know y'all will catch me.'\nThe incident, which occurred in her hometown of Houston, is not the first time she has suffered from a mechanical issue during her Cowboy Carter tour.\n\nThe incident, which occurred in her hometown of Houston, is not the first time she has suffered from a mechanical issue during her Cowboy Carter tour; seen earlier this month in Maryland \nIn May, the songstress was captured in fan video on the final show of her five-night run in Los Angeles as a robot on stage failed to hit its mark.\nDuring one section of the concert at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, Beyonce took a break to sit on a large gold thrown as a robotic arm that wouldn't have been out of place in a factory attempted to pour a bottle of liquor into her glass on one of the throne's arms.\nBut the robot upended the bottle just an inch or two away from the drink, and instead poured the liquid all over the golden chair she was sitting in.\nShe was supposed to follow up the over-the-top display by taking a sip of her drinking and grabbing a remote control on the other arm rest as if to turn on the TV before vegging out.\nBut the Texas Hold 'Em singer — who was dressed in a busty white Western suit covered in sequins and tassels — looked surprised and embarrassed as she briefly picked up her glass and realized that it was empty.\nHer mouth started to curl into a smile as she quickly returned the empty glass to its spot on her arm rest.\nBut Beyonce managed to tamp down her smile and continued with the act as she picked up the remote and flicked it as if to turn on a television.\nAnd in June, Beyonce lost her chaps on stage during a show in London. The diva from Texas was walking while singing as the fringed chaps fell to the ground as she looked astonished, according to TMZ. \n\nIt's an all-stadium tour, featuring 32 stadium shows in the U.S. and Europe - and will conclude on July 26 in Nevada; seen in June in Paris \nHer look was a gold plunging bodysuit under gold fringed chaps with high heels and sunglasses as her accessories.\nThe site claimed that she 'effortlessly performed' during the embarrassing incident as she slid down to pull the chaps back on.\nThe Cowboy Carter Tour, officially titled Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, is Beyonce's ongoing concert tour in support of her album Cowboy Carter.\nIt's an all-stadium tour, featuring 32 stadium shows in the U.S. and Europe - and will conclude on July 26 in Nevada. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBeyonce makes MAJOR tour change after terrifying stunt left her hanging and screaming midair\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He promises to expel millions of migrants in the largest deportation program in American history to protect law-abiding citizens from the violent threats he says they pose.\n\nThere has been an increase of arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Trump began his second term, with reports of ICE raids across the country. \n\nBut data collected on the ongoing detentions show that most who have been targeted lack criminal convictions, and of those who have them, relatively few have been convicted of high-level crimes.\n\nThat’s in stark contrast to the chilling nightmare Trump describes to support his border security agenda.\n\n“There’s a deep disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy. “This administration, and also in the prior Trump administration, they consistently claim to be going after the worst of the worst and just talk about immigration enforcement as though it is all about going after violent, dangerous people with extensive criminal histories. And yet overwhelmingly, it’s people they’re targeting for arrest who have no criminal history of any kind.”\n\nA look at the numbers\n\nThe latest ICE numbers show that as of June 29, there were 57,861 people detained by ICE, 41,495 — 71.7% — of whom had no criminal convictions. \n\nThat includes 14,318 people with pending criminal charges and 27,177 who are subject to immigration enforcement, but have no known criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.\n\nEach detainee is assigned a threat level by ICE on a scale of 1 to 3, with one being the highest. Those without a criminal record are classified as having “no ICE threat level.” \n\nAs of June 23, the latest data available, 84% of people detained at 201 facilities nationwide were not given a threat level. Another 7% had been graded as a level 1 threat, 4% were level 2 and 5% were level 3.\n\n“President Trump has justified this immigration agenda in part by making false claims that migrants are driving violent crime in the United States, and that’s just simply not true,” Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice, said of the numbers “There’s no research and evidence that supports his claims.”\n\nTricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, called the assessment that ICE isn’t targeting immigrants with a criminal record “false” and said that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has directed ICE “to target the worst of the worst—including gang members, murderers, and rapists.” She counted detainees with convictions, as well as those with pending charges, as “criminal illegal aliens.”\n\nYet nonpublic data obtained by the Cato Institute shows that as of June 14, 65% of the more than 204,000 people processed into the system by ICE since the start of fiscal year 2025, which began Oct. 1, 2024, had no criminal convictions. \n\nOf those with convictions, only 6.9% had committed a violent crime, while 53% had committed nonviolent crimes that fell into three main categories — immigration, traffic or vice crimes.\n\nThe total numbers of ICE arrests shot up at the end of May after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller gave the agency a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term. \n\nICE arrested nearly 30% more people in May than in April, according to the Transactional Records Clearinghouse, or TRAC. That number rose again in June, by another 28%.\n\nThe Cato Institute found that between Feb. 8 and May 17, the daily average of “noncriminals” processed into the system ranged from 421 to 454. In the following two weeks at the end of May, the numbers jumped to 678 and then again to 927 in the period from June 1 through 14.\n\n“What you’re seeing is this huge increase in funding to detain people, remove people, enforce immigration laws,” Eisen said. “And what we’re seeing is that a lot of these people, back to sort of the original question you asked, these are not people who are dangerous.”\n\nAdministration: focus is on dangerous criminals\n\nAbigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said the administration is intensely focused on rooting out unvetted criminals who are in the country illegally.\n\n“Just this week, the Administration conducted a successful operation rescuing children from labor exploitation at a marijuana facility in California, and continued arresting the worst of the worst – including murderers, pedophiles, gang members and rapists,” she wrote in an email. “Any suggestion that the Administration is not laser focused on these dangerous criminals is flat out wrong.”\n\nWhile the majority of ICE detainees are not convicted criminals, there are detainees who have committed serious crimes. On Friday, the administration focused on five high-level offenders culled from the tens of thousands of overall arrests.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump highlighted several cases where immigrants in the country illegally were arrested for horrific crimes, among them the killing of 22-year-old Laken Riley, a Georgia nursing student who was slain last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. \n\nJose Ibarra was found guilty of murder and other crimes in Riley’s February 2024 killing and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ibarra is seeking a new trial.\n\nTrump in January signed into law the Laken Riley Act, which requires the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes.\n\nStudies: Immigrants not driving violent crime in US\n\nResearch has consistently found, however, that immigrants are not driving violent crime in the U.S. and that they actually commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. \n\nA 2023 working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, reported that immigrants for 150 years have had lower incarceration rates than those born in the U.S. In fact, the rates have declined since 1960 — according to the paper, immigrants were 60% less likely to be incarcerated.\n\nExperts say the false rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration creates real harm.\n\n“It makes people in immigrant communities feel targeted and marginalized,” Arulanantham said. “It creates more political and social space for hate in all its forms, including hate crime against immigrant communities.”\n\nEisen noted that the impact extends to other communities as well.\n\n“All Americans should want safe and thriving communities and this idea that the president of the United States is making misleading statements about the truth and distorting reality is not the way to deliver public safety,” she said.","summary":"The numbers show that most targets lack criminal convictions, and of those who have them, relatively few were convicted of high-level crimes.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/07/12/trump-claims-deporting-worst-numbers-dont-back-him-up/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/0.AP25185019658898.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 23:34:19","author":"Associated Press,Damian Dovarganes","authors":["Associated Press","Damian Dovarganes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213}]}
