The Trump administration argues it is in a war with narcoterrorist groups from Venezuela, making the strikes legitimate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump disclosed that he had authorised the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nHolsey is the latest in a series of flag officers to leave their positions since Hegseth took over the Pentagon. Some firings have been abrupt, including those of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CQ Brown, who was black, and the top naval officer, Lisa Franchetti, who was the first woman to hold the position.\n\n\"The Department thanks Admiral Holsey for his decades of service to our country, and we wish him and his family continued success and fulfilment in the years ahead,\" Hegseth said on X.\n\nLess than a week ago, the Pentagon announced its counter-narcotics operations in the region would not be led by the Miami-based Southern Command, but by II Marine Expeditionary Force, a unit capable of rapid overseas operations that is based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.\n\nThat decision came as a surprise to US military-watchers, since a combatant command like Southern Command would normally lead any high-profile operations.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/in-surprise-move-head-us-military-latin-america-step-down-5407621","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--JGjNBJRS--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-10-16T195916Z_1_LYNXNPEL9F111_RTROPTP_3_ARGENTINA-SECURITY.JPG?itok","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 00:28:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":0.056},{"id":369966362,"title":"Cheap oil, high stakes: Can India do without Russia?","text":"First came the tariffs in August - 50% duties on Indian goods, dressed up as punishment for buying Russian oil. \n\nThen came US President Donald Trump's claim on Wednesday that Indian PM Narendra Modi had privately agreed to end those purchases \"within a short period of time\". \n\nNext day, Russia responded cautiously, while India distanced itself from his comments. \n\nRussia's envoy in Delhi, Denis Alipov, said its oil was \"very beneficial for the Indian economy and for the welfare of Indian people\". The Indian government said its import policy was \"guided by the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario\", and later a spokesperson added he was unaware of \"any conversation yesterday\" between Modi and Trump.\n\nCaught between an old ally in Moscow and mounting pressure from Washington, India's energy policy has become a delicate balancing act. But just how critical is Russian oil to the Indian economy? \n\nLast year, India, the world's third-largest oil importer, bought $52.7bn of Russian crude - 37% of its oil bill - followed by Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Nigeria, and the US.\n\nBut how did India's energy mix come to look like this?\n\nBefore the Russian imports surged, India's top 10 crude suppliers in 2021-22 were Russia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the US, Brazil, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria, and Oman. The remaining 31 countries formed a long tail of smaller, opportunistic deals that ebb and flow with global prices.\n\nDespite some popular perception that India relies solely on Russian oil, it also imports significant volumes from the US. In 2024, India bought $7.7bn of American petroleum products - including $4.8bn of crude - but still ran a $3.2bn petroleum trade deficit with Washington, according to Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.\n\nBetween 2018-19 and 2021-22, India's oil basket underwent its first major shift. \n\nImports from Iran and Venezuela - once 17% of the total or 41 million tonnes - were phased out, their place largely filled by traditional suppliers such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, according to a study by Partha Mukhopadhyay of the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi-based think tank. Both countries faced heavy sanctions, making it difficult for India to continue importing oil from them.\n\nThe second transition came with the Ukraine war. \n\nIndia's imports of Russian oil soared from 4 million tonnes in 2021-22 to over 87 million tonnes in 2024-25. The surge was driven by discounts offered by Russia after Western sanctions, making its crude more attractive to Indian refiners. \n\nAfter 2021-22, Russian oil averaged a 14.1% discount in 2022-23 and 10.4% in 2023-24, saving India roughly $5bn a year- or 3–4% of its crude import bill.\n\nWhile the Gulf trio - Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - saw their share fall by 11 percentage points, their actual volumes held steady as India's overall imports rose from 196 million to 244  million tonnes. \n\nThe adjustment fell largely on others: imports from the US, Brazil, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria and Oman more than halved, and the \"rest\" of 31 smaller suppliers also declined. A few, like Angola and South Korea, bucked the trend, and even Venezuela made a modest return.\n\n\"Thus, the increase in imports from Russia has been accompanied by a decrease in imports from many countries, some of whom saw a drastic fall in their exports to India,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. In other words, Russia's rise came at the expense of nearly everyone else.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e3786p01qo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4fdf/live/ae467a90-aa77-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-17 00:25:12","author":"Soutik Biswas","authors":["Soutik Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":369969032,"title":"Ignoble thoughts","text":"IN a fair world, Donald Trump should have won not only the Nobel Peace Prize, for ending seven wars, but also the one for literature for his brilliant tweets on Truth Social. But once again the Nobel Committee played politics and awarded the prizes to complete unknowns, at least to us here who know very little.\n\nShortly after, I read a lament that if the prize for literature was to be awarded to an unknown why couldn’t he/ she be from Pakistan which is full of known unknowns. Surprisingly, the account attributed the omission to the decline of reading which was never much to write of anyway. True, the print run of serious books is 500, in a country of 250 million, but it was not more than 1,000 at the best of times.\n\nIf at all one were concerned about this (and who is?) one could better direct attention to the language policy that insists on English as the medium of instruction and considers it a superior language to any other. As a result, the washerman’s dog is stranded, so to say, between the home and the laundry. People rarely get good enough in English and lose whatever they knew of their own language to write anything decent, let alone creative.\n\nI am sure there must be excellent literature in local languages but there is no one with near-native competence in two languages to achieve any kind of decent translations. Otherwise, there is no reason why Faiz should not have been a serious candidate in his time. As it is, he is barely known outside the Urdu-speaking world.\n\nTreating all languages with respect matters. This can be seen in India from where two novels, in Hindi and in Kannada, have won global recognition through translation and awarded the International Booker Prize within the last five years. By and large, individuals reach this kind of excellence by writing in their native languages as was the case for Tagore who is the only winner of the Nobel Literature Prize from South Asia. Such was also the case for Orhan Pamuk and Han Kang. Even Iceland, with a population of less than half a million, uses Icelandic for higher education and has claimed in 1955 a Nobel Literature Prize for fiction in that language.\n\n Individual brilliance can’t make up for uninspired leadership.\n\nLet me not even get started on Nobel prizes for science. It was bemusing to hear our academic leading lights opine that the way to discover one was to search widely and find the diamond in the rough. Nowhere in the world is excellence nurtured in this manner. We should reflect rather that just the Government College Lahore of the British era produced two Nobel Laureates. So what has happened to the institution once liberated from the clutches of the notorious colonialists?\n\nTo look at the deleterious impact of alien languages from another dimension, consider the fact that cricketers of world renown emerge from Burewala, Landi Kotal and other such places but never any physicist or chemist or biologist. Why? Because cricket talent escapes the stifling constraint of miseducation.\n\nBut, as we should know, no amount of individual brilliance can make up for uninspired leadership. And, it is here that the education system comes back to cripple. I was struck by the comment of one of our many revolving foreign coaches that the Pakistani team was full of talent and all they had to do was to learn to think on their feet. Right on the mark but alas if it were that simple. A school education designed to crush thinking cannot produce captains who can think on their feet. Just looking at Pakistani captains gives away the truth that in every situation they are trying to recall what the coach told them before the match. Teaching in an alien language is an invitation to rote learning.\n\nThe good thing about cricket, or any sport, is that one has to deal with objective facts and set aside myths and delusions of greatness. The recent performances of the men’s and especially the women’s teams against India show the huge gap that has opened up. If only we could send in the Chinese in green uniforms we might have something to celebrate if, that is, we wish to continue to deceive ourselves.\n\nIndia and Pakistan are similar in many ways, petty and petulant behaviour sadly being one of them. In others, however, the differences have become stark, the performance of women being one of them. From no representation at all at the time of their first Asian Games, they won 42 (out of a total of 107) medals at the latest ones in 2022. The Pakistan tally was three of which none was a gold. Not surprising given that women who used to cycle to college in the 1960s are now preferably restrained from head to toe.\n\nIn any case, Trump need not worry. Our strategic geniuses have started another war — so much for strategic depth — and will no doubt nominate the Great Leader again next year. \n\nThe writer is the author of Pakistan: Clash of Ideas and Thinking with Ghalib.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2025","summary":"IN a fair world, Donald Trump should have won not only the Nobel Peace Prize, for ending seven wars, but also the one for literature for his brilliant tweets on Truth Social.

Congress can only block these operations through legislation or by cutting funding.\n\nIn practice, the authorisation could be as focused – or as broad – as the president deems necessary.\n\n“The parameters of the authorities are laid out in the finding,” explained Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and deputy under secretary of defence. \n\n“But there really isn’t any limitations, and it does not need congressional approval.”\n\nAny restrictions imposed on the CIA’s activities are executive orders, which Mr Mulroy said “means the president can simply write a new executive order and change it.”\n\nOnce approved by the president, CIA actions could take the form of targeted killings, covert influence operations, shaping local politics or helping set up and equip armed rebel movements fighting foreign governments.\n\nIn December 1979, for example, a presidential finding from Jimmy Carter allowed the CIA to deliver lethal aid to Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet invasion of the country.\n\nJust a few years later, another finding – this time from the President Ronald Reagan administration – allowed the CIA to extend covert aid to the Contras, rebel groups that were trying to unseat the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\n\nMore recent findings led to worldwide operations against al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks, as well as Operation Timber Sycamore, a CIA-run operation to train and supply Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime.\n\nIn other countries across Latin America – including Guatemala, Chile and Brazil – the US helped overthrow governments in the name of fighting communism, or helped bolster regimes that were harsh oppressors of human rights.\n\n“We just don’t have a great track record,” said Dexter Ingram, the former director for combating violent extremism at the State Department and now an advisory council member at the International Spy Museum in Washington.\n\n“There’s a long history, and it’s not always positive,” Mr Ingram added. “I think we have to look at our history….it’s a slippery slope.”\n\nIt remains unclear whether the CIA is already conducting covert actions in Venezuela, is planning to, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies.\n\nTrump earlier this week justified the CIA authorisation and US airstrikes against vessels in the Caribbean by saying that “a lot of drugs” are flowing from Venezuela to the US.\n\nHis disclosure about the CIA authorisation comes as US long-range B-52 bombers were seen circling near the Venezuelan coast.\n\nCIA operations, though, would be covert and could take various different forms against an array of targets.\n\nSuspected members of Tren de Aragua and the Cartel of the Suns, both of which the US has designated terrorist organisations, could be struck in paramilitary operations or by drones.\n\nMarc Polymeropoulos, a 26-year veteran of the CIA who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan and oversaw clandestine missions around the world, told the BBC that the methodology of “find, fix and finish” the agency developed during the “global war on terror” could be readily applied to criminal networks.\n\n“It’s going after certain individuals, networks, or supply chains,” he said. “It’s manhunting, and there’s nobody better on the planet at that than the CIA.”\n\nThe primary difference between striking criminals in Venezuela and striking Al Qaeda or other militant targets in places like Syria, Yemen or tribal areas of Pakistan, he added, is that the latter targets mostly operated in “ungoverned” spaces.\n\n“Conceptually, it would be a little different. Those were really lawless countries,” he said. “This would obviously be done without the cooperation of the Venezuelan [government].”\n\nAlternatively – or additionally – sabotage operations could be conducted against targets aligned to Maduro’s government, “influence operations” could be used to shift public opinion through media and money, training and weapons could be provided to anti-Maduro groups – all operations with historical precedent for the CIA in Latin America and elsewhere.\n\n“Nobody knows what this [authorisation] is,” Mr Polymeropoulos added. “There’s a million different questions.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela &#8211; a highly unusual admission of what is normally a highly sensitive and tightly guarded state secret.

They are described as 'cruel' people with 'long beards' and 'orange-coloured turbans'.\n\nStudents of the course in Nottingham will also learn to 'repopulate' the literary canon of British folklore, The Telegraph reports.\n\nDr Nubia provided articles which stated medieval England had diverse populations but that ethnic chauvinism was evident in literature, including Milton's Paradise Lost, and that the theme persisted in the works of Tolkien and Lewis.\n\nHe also claims in the core module text that Shakespeare's work helped to promote a vision of a 'fictional, mono-ethnic English past'. \n\nHis plays are said to be problematic for failing to include direct references to Africans living in England, creating the 'illusion' of racial homogeneity in England.\n\nThis isn't the only time universities have face controversy over so-called 'woke' decisions recently.\n\nJust days ago, students were reportedly told that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher shared a similar leadership style to Adolf Hitler during a lecture at Leicester University.\n\nThe claims were allegedly made in a business management class on Monday, where slides also described Donald Trump as a 'terrorist leader' type of business chief.\n\nAccording to the lecture material, the Iron Lady was compared to both the Nazi dictator and Russian President Vladimir Putin for having 'dictated policies and procedures' while demanding obedience from others.\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, was reportedly grouped with figures such as Osama Bin Laden - the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks - and Elliot Rodger, the London-born killer who murdered six people before taking his own life in California in 2014.\n\nThe Sun reported one student said: 'No one understands why they are going out of their way to make these comparisons.'\n\nLeicester University later defended the lecture, saying it was intended to explore 'how theoretical frameworks relate to a range of well-known people'.\n\nResponding to the lecture, former Conservative Education Secretary Sir Gavin Williamson told GB News: 'It is completely out of order and a shocking comparison.\n\n'Margaret Thatcher has been one of our greatest leaders and it is shocking that this lecturer has said this and should immediately withdraw the remarks and apologise.","summary":"A history module uses a text that says orcs and other dark-skinned characters in the best-selling trilogy are the victims of 'ethnic chauvinism'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15200365/Now-Lord-Rings-racist-Woke-university-says.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/17/00/103061845-0-image-a-12_1760656902893.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:57:13","author":"Editor,Olivia Allhusen","authors":["Editor","Olivia Allhusen"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.137},{"id":369966324,"title":"US Chamber of Commerce sues Trump administration over $100,000 H-1B visa fee, citing  harmful impact on American businesses","text":"The lawsuit frames the fee as a roadblock that threatens the competitiveness and expansion of American companies \n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the recently imposed $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers for specialized roles. The fee, introduced by President Donald Trump last month via an executive order, drastically increases the cost of obtaining H-1B visas from previous fees of $2,000 to $5,000 to an unprecedented $100,000, igniting fierce opposition from business groups.In a statement, Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer of the Chamber, described the new fee as \"unlawful\" because it overrides the Immigration and Nationality Act provisions that regulate the H-1B program, including the fundamental requirement that visa fees reflect the government's processing costs. Bradley emphasized that the exorbitant fee will make it prohibitively expensive for US employers—especially startups and small to mid-sized businesses—to utilize the program intended to help them access global talent essential for growth in sectors like technology, engineering, and science.The lawsuit frames the fee as a roadblock that threatens the competitiveness and expansion of American companies. It warns the move may push skilled talent toward economic rivals abroad, diminishing the United States' advantage in attracting top international experts. Live EventsThe Chamber acknowledges supporting many Trump administration initiatives, such as pro-growth tax reforms and deregulation, but calls for a balanced approach that sustains the country's ability to attract and retain the \"world's best and brightest\" workforce.The administration defends the fee as part of a broader strategy to reform the H-1B program to root out abuse and prioritize American workers. Trump described misuse of the program as a \"national security threat,\" citing visa fraud and low-wage replacement of domestic employees by foreign labor. Yet, the sweeping fee hike has sparked immediate legal challenges, including this high-profile lawsuit by the Chamber and others filed by healthcare staffing companies and labor unions.The H-1B program, established by Congress in 1990, caps visas at 65,000 per year, plus an additional 20,000 for advanced degree holders. Visas are valid for three years and can extend to six. The program has long been vital to US innovation and economic growth, particularly in Silicon Valley and other tech hubs. The drastic fee increase risks crippling many firms’ ability to secure crucial foreign expertise.This lawsuit marks the most significant legal pushback by the US Chamber since Donald Trump began his second term. The outcome will be closely watched as it represents a key clash between the business community and the current administration’s immigration and labor policies.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onUS Chamber of CommerceTrump administrationAmerican businessesimmigration and nationality actdonald trumpcongress\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The Collective’s tools create a world of digital secrecy where leftists boast about violent attacks, encourage insurrection and publish “doxxing” materials with individuals’ home addresses. (RELATED: Portland Residents Planning Laser Attack On Federal Aircraft Have Nice Cozy Cell Waiting For Them, Feds Warn)\n\nBy agreeing to A/I Collective’s policies and its far-left “principles,” one may request email accounts, a blogging page, private messaging and more, all designed to leave no digital trail leading back to a person, according to the group’s website. Its email server, for example, does not track senders’ location like others do, and its blogging platform — NoBlogs — does not store identifying data, the organization says. A/I Collective recommends its email server for anyone looking to “do something nasty without being caught.”\n\n NEW: The Portland anarchist site “Rose City Counter-Info” openly announced plans for protesters to shine lasers at federal aircraft — a federal crime that officials say can create extreme danger for pilots. “It won’t take many of us to ground the helicopters!” Read more 👇 pic.twitter.com/MSMsgq9PtD — Hudson Crozier 🇺🇸 (@Hudson_Crozier) October 9, 2025 \n\nThe A/I Collective did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF.\n\nOne prominent user of NoBlogs is “Rose City Counter-Info,” (RCCI) an Antifa-aligned site blasted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over a post that called on people to fill the streets and illegally shine laser pointers at federal helicopters in Portland. No reports have emerged of Portlanders following through with the planned Oct. 11 attack.\n\n“Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is a federal crime, and we have seen multiple attempts to use them to temporarily blind the pilots,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told the DCNF. “This is incredibly dangerous for the aircraft personnel and for the public’s safety. Antifa domestic terrorists will not overrun our cities.”\n\nDHS also threatened criminal charges in July over RCCI’s post “doxxing” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents’ home addresses. “No peace for ICE agents,” the title reads.\n\nRCCI’s website says it is powered by A/I Collective’s “R*” plan, which hosts the site on multiple servers so that there are backups if one is “compromised,” according to the collective.\n\nA/I was founded in 2001 in Italy and functions as a nonprofit, requiring anyone using its free programs to profess “anti-fascism,” “anti-racism,” “anti-transphobia” and other values, according to its website. The group’s name refers to its use of “autism with invention.”\n\nAssociazione AI ODV, an entity with a listed address in San Giuliano Terme in Italy, manages the website’s servers. “ODV” means “organismo di vigilanza” or “supervisory body,” an entity that helps another avoid liability for crimes under Italian law. Associazione AI ODV’s website names no staff. \n\n“After 2005 we have been constantly pestered by prosecutors and security forces … asking us to hand over users’ data and identities and we are proud to say we were always able to answer: we are sorry, but we do not have them,” the A/I Collective says on its “history” page.\n\nA/I Collective’s NoBlogs also hosts “Abolition Media,” a pro-terrorism forum that was part of the FBI’s investigation into left-wing arsonist Casey Goonan. He was sentenced in September for a series of attacks in California.\n\nA June 2024 post on Abolition Media showed pictures of a police car firebombed by Goonan and an anonymous message decrying “genocide” in Gaza, the FBI said in a criminal complaint, naming Goonan as the likely author. The FBI mentioned that Abolition Media “is hosted on a server run by an organization based in Europe,” alluding to the A/I Collective.\n\nAbolition Media did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.\n\nGoonan’s arson attack reflects a broader playbook by which NoBlogs users brag about their crimes shortly after committing them in an anonymous post, sometimes called a “communique,” while leaving out incriminating details. Pro-abortion group Jane’s Revenge posted similar communiques via NoBlogs in 2022 describing how it vandalized and burned pro-life facilities after the leak of a Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“We are forced to adopt the minimum military requirement for a political struggle,” Jane’s Revenge wrote in a May 2022 post taking credit for arson at the pro-life Wisconsin Family Action’s headquarters. “Again, this was only a warning. Next time the infrastructure of the enslavers will not survive.”\n\nJane’s Revenge uses the A/I Collective’s R* plan, its website says. The DCNF could not reach the group for comment. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Pro-Life Pregnancy Centers Still Awaiting Justice 3 Years After Firebombing, Vandalism Spree)\n\nOther blogs the A/I Collective hosted include “Scenes from the Atlanta Forest,” where anonymous authors took credit for torching a New York police vehicle and damaging other property in multiple states starting in 2023, archived webpages show. It also hosted “Against Beltway Fascism,” a blog that posted the purported home addresses of staff from the conservative Heritage Foundation in 2024, according to archived posts. Both blogs have been deleted.\n\n“Scenes from the Atlanta Forest” said in October 2023 that it received a complaint from the A/I Collective about its own doxxing practices, adding that only legally obtained information about someone should be published, an archived post shows. Rose City Counter-Info’s content doxxing ICE agents, however, is still online.\n\nA/I Collective is not the only group of its kind on the extreme left, according to terrorism expert Kyle Shideler, a senior analyst at the Center for Security Policy.\n\n“This is part of a larger effort by anarchists to create their own online spaces that do not rely upon the usual corporate providers,” Shideler told the DCNF. Shideler testified to Congress about the inner workings of Antifa in 2020.\n\nThe A/I Collective has an online list of a dozen “radical tech collectives” offering similar digital security tools.\n\nPresident Donald Trump directed law enforcement to aggressively target leftist extremism after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk’s Sept. 10 murder. After declaring Antifa a “domestic terrorist organization,” the president said at an Oct. 8 White House event that he also wants the State Department to designate Antifa a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). That method is likely the only way the A/I Collective could come under serious legal scrutiny, Shideler told the DCNF.\n\n“If the Trump administration achieves an FTO designation for Antifa or even for some of these [Antifa] groups, going after organizations like this that provide material support would be job one,” Shideler said. “It’s the primary value of a designation. But short of a designation, they would probably really struggle to go after these kinds of entities, since the services they provide are otherwise lawful.”\n\nTrump officials have not described what steps they may take toward the designation.\n\n“The United States has a variety of options available to target terrorists and terrorist organizations, and the State Department will use all available tools to keep Americans safe,” a State Department spokesperson told the DCNF.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

This development unfolded after Bolton, who served as a National Security Advisor, found himself at the center of controversy over allegedly sending sensitive information via his personal AOL account. If convicted, Bolton could face a decade in prison.\n\nReacting to the charges, Bolton described them as a retaliatory move, asserting that they stem from his outspoken criticisms of Trump after his stint in the administration. He argued that the legal actions were more about silencing dissent than about justice.\n\n“Trump’s actions remind me of Stalin’s notorious secret police chief, who famously said, ‘Show me the man, and I’ll show you the crime,'” Bolton remarked, drawing a parallel to Stalin’s oppressive regime known for its brutal suppression of dissent through mass arrests, torture, and executions.\n\nBolton expressed that the charges are not merely focused on him or his diaries but represent a broader campaign to intimidate opponents and control narratives about Trump’s behavior. This, he suggests, is an attempt to monopolize the discourse surrounding his presidency.\n\nUnder Joseph Stalin’s brutal rule of the Soviet Regime, his notorious secret police agency were responsible for mass arrests, torture, and execution of his critics. \n\n‘These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,’ Bolton said.\n\n‘Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom.’\n\nBolton has vowed to defend his ‘lawful conduct and to expose his [Trump’s] abuse of power.’\n\nAccording to the indictment, Bolton is alleged to have sent out diary notes via email about his daily activities while he was national security adviser. Two of the people who received those emails did not have security clearance, and the emails contained ‘national defense information’ and details classified as ‘top secret.’\n\nBolton’s emails were later hacked by someone with links to the Iranian government, according to the indictment. Bolton reported the hack to the FBI.\n\nThe indictment comes two months after FBI agents raided Bolton’s Washington, D.C. office and suburban Maryland home.\n\nThe FBI was looking for possible violations of the Espionage Act, a law that dates back to 1917 and makes unauthorized possession of national security documents illegal. \n\nAt Bolton’s D.C. office, federal agents discovered documents marked ‘confidential’ that referenced weapons of mass destruction, according to unsealed court records.\n\nAt his Maryland home, agents seized two cell phones, documents in folders labeled ‘Trump I-IV’ and a binder labeled ‘statements and reflections to Allied Strikes,’ the court records also showed. \n\nDespite Bolton blaming Trump, the president claimed on Thursday he was unaware of the grand jury indictment until it happened.\n\n‘I didn’t know that, you’re telling me for the first time, but I think he’s a bad person,’ Trump told a reporter who asked a question about the indictment in the Oval Office. \n\n‘I think he’s a bad guy, yeah, he’s a bad guy. Too bad, but that’s the way it goes.’\n\nBolton was tapped as Trump’s third national security adviser during his first term after previously serving as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations. \n\nAfter leaving the Trump White House, Bolton became a prominent critic of the president, calling him ‘stunningly uninformed’ in his memoir, which the administration had tried to block. \n\nTrump indicated early on in his second term that Bolton would be a top target in his vengeance campaign. \n\nJust a day after his swearing-in, Trump had Bolton’s Secret Service detail pulled. \n\nBolton said in his Thursday statement he devoted ‘four decades’ of his life ‘to America’s foreign policy and national security.’\n\n‘I would never compromise those goals. I tried to do that during my tenure in the first Trump Administration but resigned when it became impossible to do so. \n\n‘Donald Trump’s retribution against me began then.’\n\nBolton said he was merely ‘the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies.’\n\nLast month Trump appeared to publicly order Attorney General Pam Bondi to ramp up prosecution of his political enemies, naming former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Democratic Sen.

Here’s why that might not be a great idea","text":"When Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese meets US President Donald Trump on Monday, the visit is expected to seal major big tech investment deals on artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres.\n\nIn the lead-up, Atlassian cofounder Scott Farquhar (in his role as chair of the Tech Council of Australia) has been pitching a plan to make Australia a “regional AI hub”.\n\nIn July, Farquhar unveiled his vision in a speech at the National Press Club of Australia in which he held up Singapore and Estonia as proof that nimble regulation to attract foreign capital can turn nations into digital powerhouses. \n\nBut based on my research on the geopolitics of data-centre markets, these examples don’t quite hold up – and following them risks narrowing the debate about Australia’s tech future at a crucial moment.\n\nHowever, as Australia advances its AI agenda, these examples can offer important lessons if read more carefully.\n\nThe Estonian data embassy\n\nFarquhar proposes Australia should host “digital embassies”. These would be datacentres on Australian soil owned by foreign companies and exempt from Australian law. He cites as a precedent Estonia’s data embassy in Luxembourg.\n\nEstonia’s case, though, is quite different from what Farquhar proposes. After a series of Russian cyberattacks in 2007, Estonia sought to guarantee the continuity of government if its domestic systems were ever disabled. \n\nThe result was a bilateral treaty with Luxembourg. The treaty allows encrypted copies of critical state registries – citizenship, land and business records – to be stored under Estonian jurisdiction abroad. \n\nIt was an act of defensive statecraft built on the Vienna Convention. This agreement grants diplomatic immunity to state functions but explicitly excludes commercial activity. \n\nBy contrast, the digital embassies proposed by Farquhar would cater both to states and to foreign corporates. It would allow them to operate under their own law but draw on Australian resources. \n\nFarquhar himself concedes this would necessitate revising the Vienna Convention. But this would undermine six decades of established diplomatic practice and further destabilise an already fragile international system.\n\nWithout the diplomatic costume, Farquhar’s digital embassies look more like special economic zones. These are areas designed to attract investment through the strategic loosening of laws.\n\nWhat really transformed Singapore\n\nFarquhar’s reading of Singapore’s example similarly overlooks its deeper economic and political foundations.\n\nSingapore is often romanticised by neoliberal thinkers as a haven of free enterprise. But Singapore’s success in using its natural strengths and foreign direct investment has rested on massive state-led investment and equity in infrastructure and firms. \n\nThrough its sovereign wealth funds, Temasek and GIC, Singapore retains dominant stakes in its airlines, banks, ports and telecoms. That same strategic state investment produced Changi Airport and the Jurong Industrial Estate, cornerstones of Singapore’s regional hub status. \n\nAustralia has taken a different path.\n\nFor example, recent Australian Tax Office data shows major technology firms – such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google – have secured billions in government contracts while contributing relatively little in tax. \n\nIn 2024, Microsoft reported $8.63 billion in Australian revenue, but only $118 million – about 1.4% – was payable in tax. Amazon Web Services earned $3.4 billion locally yet paid just $61 million after deductions reduced its taxable income to $204 million.\n\nMuch of this is explained by profit-shifting arrangements. Most revenue is booked in tax havens such as Ireland through inter-company “service fees”.\n\nUS tech companies have undoubtedly captured significant domestic value. However, local benefits, such as jobs, exportable digital industries and global competitiveness, remain largely hypothetical. \n\nA cloudy memory\n\nAustralia has chased the dream of jurisdictional deregulation before. \n\nMore than a decade ago, Google and Microsoft told then prime minister Julia Gillard they could build a “Silicon Beach” here. This echoed Ireland’s “Silicon Docks” – a digital growth strategy of creating a deregulated haven for big tech. \n\nFarquhar’s AI-hub vision appeals to the same logic. However, it has even thinner appreciation for the statecraft and public investment required.\n\nWithout it, Australia is unlikely to achieve AI hub status. \n\nSome will argue Australia’s minerals and favorable relations with the US make it an inevitable frontier of data-centre expansion. Yet that position also gives Australia leverage to define sovereign growth on its own terms.\n\nAs economist Alison Pennington has asked, “is a shift from foreign-owned mining to foreign-owned data mining with even less control the best we can do?”\n\nIf Australia wants to build a resilient and credible AI sector, it won’t find its edge by joining the global race to the bottom – puncturing its territory with legal carve-outs and filling them with foreign-owned and unfettered direct investment.\n\nInstead, Australia could build a model of sovereign control by investing in public infrastructure, skills and governance frameworks that secure national forms of ownership and accountability.","summary":"As Australia builds an AI plan, it can learn from Estonia and Singapore - but not exactly in the way tech companies want.","url":"https://theconversation.com/australias-tech-lobby-wants-deregulated-digital-embassies-for-offshore-clients-heres-why-that-might-not-be-a-great-idea-266769","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/696617/original/file-20251016-56-3timbw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C630%2C7552%2C3776&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:40:46","author":"Angus Dowell,PhD Candidate,University of Auckland,Waipapa Taumata Rau","authors":["Angus Dowell","PhD Candidate","University of Auckland","Waipapa Taumata Rau"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.036},{"id":369961430,"title":"KISS guitarist and co-founder Ace Frehley dead at 74","text":"Oct. 16 (UPI) -- KISS co-founder and former guitarist Paul Daniel \"Ace\" Frehley died on Thursday at age 74 after being hospitalized for several weeks to treat injuries that he sustained in a fall.\n\nFrehley suffered a serious head injury that led to a brain bleed when he fell while inside a recording studio in September, and his family confirmed his death in a prepared statement, Deadline reported.\n\n\"We are completely devastated and heartbroken.

Frey died in January 2016 at age 67 and the Kennedy Center included him when the group was honored that December.\n\nLesh died on Oct. 25, 2024 at age 84, just six weeks before the ceremony, where the group (including Lesh) was honored. The award also went to Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bobby Weir, but lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry Garcia, who had died in 1995, was not honored.\n\nIn 2008, The Who became the first group to receive a Kennedy Center Honor, but only the two living members – Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey – were honored. The two members who had died – Keith Moon and John Entwistle – were not.\n\nIn 2012, Led Zeppelin became the second group to be honored, but again only the living members (John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant) were honored. There was no award for drummer John Bonham, who had died in 1980.\n\nEven Maurice White, universally acknowledged as the mastermind behind Earth, Wind & Fire, was not included when that group was honored in 2019. The only members who were awarded were Philip Bailey, Verdine White and Ralph Johnson.\n\nKISS is only the seventh group to receive a Kennedy Center Honor. And the award to KISS, following last year’s award to Grateful Dead, marks the first time two groups have been honored in back-to-back years. The other groups to be honored are The Who (2008), Led Zeppelin (2012), Eagles (2016), Earth, Wind & Fire (2019) and U2 (2022).\n\nThis year’s Kennedy Center Honors ceremony is set to air on Tuesday, Dec. 23, from 8-10:30 p.m. ET/PT. In addition to KISS, this year’s recipients are Grammy-winning country music icon George Strait, Tony-winning stage and screen star Michael Crawford, Grammy-winning disco pioneer Gloria Gaynor and film icon Sylvester Stallone.\n\nIn announcing this year’s honorees on Aug. 13, President Trump said he would host the program. If he follows through on that, it will mark the first time an elected official, much less a president, has hosted the program.","summary":"The Kennedy Center has a policy that its honorees must be living.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/ace-frehley-kiss-kennedy-center-honors-posthumous-awards-1236091542/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ace-frehley-2021-billboard-1800.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:36:34","author":"Paul Grein","authors":["Paul Grein"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.149},{"id":369968002,"title":"CIA deployment gives Trump no ‘limitations’ on Venezuela action","text":"US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela - a highly unusual admission of what is normally a highly sensitive and tightly guarded state secret.\n\nThe authorisation - more typically known as a presidential finding - could give the agency broad leeway to conduct operations in the region, including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or broader operations aimed at destabilising or toppling the regime of Nicolas Maduro.\n\nPrevious presidential findings have ultimately led to drone strikes on militants overseas, money and weapons funnelled to insurgencies, and even efforts at full regime change.\n\nMost, however, remain classified.\n\nAccording to US law, presidents may authorise covert actions if they determine that these operations are \"necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives...[and] important to the national security of the United States.\"\n\nOnce that determination is made, it must be shared with the House and Senate intelligence committees, and, in some sensitive cases, the \"gang of eight\" composed of leaders in both parties and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees.\n\nBut that notification - which is expected to be detailed and outline legal risks - does not mean congressional approval is necessary. Congress can only block these operations through legislation or by cutting funding.\n\nIn practice, the authorisation could be as focused - or as broad - as the president deems necessary.\n\n\"The parameters of the authorities are laid out in the finding,\" explained Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and deputy under secretary of defence. \n\n\"But there really isn't any limitations, and it does not need congressional approval.\"\n\nAny restrictions imposed on the CIA's activities are executive orders, which Mr Mulroy said \"means the president can simply write a new executive order and change it.\"\n\nOnce approved by the president, CIA actions could take the form of targeted killings, covert influence operations, shaping local politics or helping set up and equip armed rebel movements fighting foreign governments.\n\nIn December 1979, for example, a presidential finding from Jimmy Carter allowed the CIA to deliver lethal aid to Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet invasion of the country.\n\nJust a few years later, another finding - this time from the President Ronald Reagan administration - allowed the CIA to extend covert aid to the Contras, rebel groups that were trying to unseat the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.\n\nMore recent findings led to worldwide operations against al-Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks, as well as Operation Timber Sycamore, a CIA-run operation to train and supply Syrian rebels fighting the Assad regime.\n\nIn other countries across Latin America - including Guatemala, Chile and Brazil - the US helped overthrow governments in the name of fighting communism, or helped bolster regimes that were harsh oppressors of human rights.\n\n\"We just don't have a great track record,\" said Dexter Ingram, the former director for combating violent extremism at the State Department and now an advisory council member at the International Spy Museum in Washington.\n\n\"There's a long history, and it's not always positive,\" Mr Ingram added. \"I think we have to look at our history....it's a slippery slope.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether the CIA is already conducting covert actions in Venezuela, is planning to, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies.\n\nTrump earlier this week justified the CIA authorisation and US airstrikes against vessels in the Caribbean by saying that \"a lot of drugs\" are flowing from Venezuela to the US.\n\nHis disclosure about the CIA authorisation comes as US long-range B-52 bombers were seen circling near the Venezuelan coast.\n\nCIA operations, though, would be covert and could take various different forms against an array of targets.\n\nSuspected members of Tren de Aragua and the Cartel of the Suns, both of which the US has designated terrorist organisations, could be struck in paramilitary operations or by drones.\n\nMarc Polymeropoulos, a 26-year veteran of the CIA who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan and oversaw clandestine missions around the world, told the BBC that the methodology of \"find, fix and finish\" the agency developed during the \"global war on terror\" could be readily applied to criminal networks.\n\n\"It's going after certain individuals, networks, or supply chains,\" he said. \"It's manhunting, and there's nobody better on the planet at that than the CIA.\"\n\nThe primary difference between striking criminals in Venezuela and striking Al Qaeda or other militant targets in places like Syria, Yemen or tribal areas of Pakistan, he added, is that the latter targets mostly operated in \"ungoverned\" spaces.\n\n\"Conceptually, it would be a little different. Those were really lawless countries,\" he said. \"This would obviously be done without the cooperation of the Venezuelan [government].\"\n\nAlternatively - or additionally - sabotage operations could be conducted against targets aligned to Maduro's government, \"influence operations\" could be used to shift public opinion through media and money, training and weapons could be provided to anti-Maduro groups - all operations with historical precedent for the CIA in Latin America and elsewhere.\n\n\"Nobody knows what this [authorisation] is,\" Mr Polymeropoulos added. \"There's a million different questions.\"","summary":"US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that he has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela - a highly unusual admission of what is normally a highly sensitive and tightly guarded state secret.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/cia-deployment-gives-trump-no-limitations-on-venezuela-action/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1594.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:36:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 36pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 36pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":369961492,"title":"Democrat Jay Jones Pivots To Jan. 6, Abortion When Called Out On His Death Threat Texts","text":"Democratic Virginia Attorney General nominee Jay Jones, when called to task for 2022 text messages that appeared to hint at the death of a political opponent’s children, responded by immediately mentioning President Donald Trump as well as left-wing talking points.\n\nRepublican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares tore into Jones during a Thursday debate between the two men, with Miyares saying the Democrat had “three years to say you’re sorry.” When Jones was given 30 seconds to respond, he instantly tried to change the subject to Trump and appeared to refer to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol and what he called Miyares’ “extreme position on abortion.”\n\n“And the reality, Jay, is that your text messages that advocated for violence against innocent children — Jay, if you were to apply to be a line prosecutor in not just my office, any attorney general office in the country, you would not pass a background check,” Miyares said during the debate. (RELATED: ‘He Should Step Out’: Former Biden Official Meghan Hays Torches Jay Jones Over Disgusting Texts)\n\n“And right now you may say that you are sorry, but look back at what happened,” the Republican attorney general added. “You had three years to say you’re sorry, Jay, and you didn’t. Three years to actually recognize what you did was horrific. You chose to stay silent.”\n\n“And when this became public, we now know your first statement wasn’t saying ‘I’m sorry.’ The words, ‘I’m sorry’ wasn’t even in your statement. It was to say we all send text messages we regret. You attacked the president, and you attacked me. It wasn’t until 12 hours after you were first notified that you then decide to say ‘I’m sorry.’ Because at the end of the day, Jay, you’re a politician and not a prosecutor, and you certainly can’t be the top prosecutor in the state of Virginia.”\n\n“I want to say one thing, Jason Miyares can’t prosecute a case against Donald Trump, that’s for sure,” Jones said in reply as soon as it was his turn to speak. “And I will also say this. I was held accountable by my party and I deeply, deeply respect that.”\n\n“But what about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?” Jones added, appearing to refer to Jan 6.\n\n“What about when, [Republican Virginia gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears] used violent language about people who disagree with you and her and your extreme position on abortion?” he asked the pro-life Miyares.\n\nJones told a Republican state lawmaker in an August 2022 text conversation that he would give then Republican Virginia House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert “two bullets to the head” over murderous dictators Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot.\n\n“Spoiler: put Gilbert in the crew with the two worst people you know and he receives both bullets every time,” Jones wrote in a text message, first reported by National Review.\n\n“You were talking about hopping [sic] jennifer Gilbert’s children would die,” the GOP lawmaker, Virginia Del. Carrie Coyner, told Jones in another text message. Coyner maintained that the message was sent to her after the two politicians spoke on the phone during which Jones brought up the prospect of the Gilberts’ children dying, according to The New York Times.\n\n“Yes, I’ve told you this before. Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy,” Jones told Coyner during the conversation. “I mean do I think Todd and Jennifer are evil? And that they’re breeding little fascists? Yes.”\n\nOn Oct. 3, Jones eventually apologized for his messages, after they were widely reported by the national press.\n\n“I take full responsibility for my actions, and I want to issue my deepest apology to Speaker Gilbert and his family,” the Democrat wrote. “Reading back those words made me sick to my stomach. I am embarrassed, ashamed and sorry.”\n\n“I have reached out to Speaker Gilbert to apologize directly to him, his wife Jennifer and their children. I cannot take back what I said; I can only take full accountability and offer my sincere apology,” Jones added.\n\nDemocratic Virginia gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger dodged a yes-or-no-question on whether she would revoke her support for Jones’ candidacy during an Oct. 9 debate against her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nMiyares was elected in 2021, narrowly unseating then-incumbent and two-term Democratic Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. Herring had defeated Jones in the Democratic primary that same year.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Navy turned that age on Oct. 13.\n\nThe celebration will occur on the same day that the No Kings day of protest against the Trump administration unfolds across San Diego County and the rest of the nation. In light of Vance’s visit, protesters are also planning to gather at Camp Pendleton’s main gate Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe amphibious assault plan drew a harsh response from Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said Wednesday night on the social media site X, “Donald Trump and JD Vance think that shutting down the I-5 to shoot out missiles from ships is how you respect the military.”\n\nRep. Mike Levin, a Democrat whose district includes part of North County, issued a statement saying the birthday of the Navy and Marines “deserves to be celebrated in a way worthy of their legacy and consistent with their values: honor, courage, and commitment.\n\n“That’s why I am concerned by reports that portions of Interstate 5 could be closed for several hours in both directions on Friday and Saturday to accommodate events tied to anything partisan or political,” he said. “Even on a normal weekend, traffic along the I-5 corridor is heavy.”\n\nCaltrans said in a statement Thursday, “Although the White House has scaled back this event to limit disruption to major roadways, we stand ready to ensure public safety should it be needed.” Drivers were encouraged to visit quickmap.dot.ca.gov/ for real-time traffic information before traveling in the area Friday and Saturday.\n\nI-5 parallels a large stretch of the coastline at Camp Pendleton, an area regularly used for large training exercises, including amphibious assaults.\n\nThe base, under the command of Brig. Gen. Nick I. Brown, did not respond to a question from the Union-Tribune about whether Saturday’s exercise will involve the use of missiles.\n\nThe operation will be hosted by the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, the Marine Corps’ largest air-ground warfighting task force. It is composed of roughly 53,000 Marines and Navy sailors stationed in Southern California and Arizona, all of whom take direction from 1st MEF headquarters at Pendleton. The task force uses a variety of aircraft, ranging from F-35 fighter jets to CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor transport planes. Its chief areas of responsibility are the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East.\n\nWhen on deployment, 1st MEF personnel are typically part of an amphibious ready group, or ARG, a rapid-response force usually composed of an amphibious assault ship — widely known as a “mini” aircraft carrier — a transport dock ship and a similar vessel called a dock landing ship.\n\nOn average, a three-ship ARG carries about 4,500 Marines and sailors.\n\nThe ARGs transport and deploy Marines globally. Some Marines move by helicopter. But a full-on assault would involve other vessels, including Landing Craft, Air Cushion hovercraft. The Marines are also shifting to the widespread use of new amphibious combat vehicles to get troops ashore.\n\nSaturday’s staged assault is large in nature, so all of these ships, aircraft and landing vessels are likely to be used.\n\nAmphibious assaults are not new. The Marines performed their first one in 1776 in Nassau, Bahamas, when troops seized British gunpowder for use by the Continental Army.\n\nThe last large-scale Marine beach assault occurred in 1950 when troops went ashore during the Battle of Inchon in Korea. Members of Pendleton’s 1st Marine Division led the invasion, helping U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur turn the course of the war in favor of allied forces.\n\nStaff writer Teri Figueroa contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Vance and Defense Secretary Hegseth will attend the Marines' amphibious assault landing drill.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/10/16/camp-pendleton-says-interstate-5-wont-be-closed-during-saturdays-live-fire-exercise/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-ACV-0311-02-MS.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:32:02","author":"Gary Robbins","authors":["Gary Robbins"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.163},{"id":369968190,"title":"Bay Area organizers of Saturday’s “No Kings” protests expect biggest crowds yet","text":"“Blind submission to authority,” or “favoring a concentration of power in a leader or an elite not constitutionally responsible to the people” is Merriam-Webster’s definition of “authoritarian.”\n\nIt’s also the threat organizers say is fueling the “No Kings” protests that are expected to draw tens of thousands of people into Bay Area streets Saturday, Oct. 18 – part of a mass movement planned across all 50 states to speak out against President Donald Trump’s policies that participants see as attacking American freedoms, including his aggressive immigration enforcement push, as well as ongoing threats to health care, election integrity and education funding.\n\nIn the South Bay, organizers with San Jose’s Indivisible chapter will lead a rally at North 2nd Street & East Saint James Street from 12–2 p.m. Contra Costa County organizers expect about 5,000 people to join the 90-minute rally in Walnut Creek’s Broadway Plaza, and have also set up events in Pleasant Hill, Pittsburg, Antioch, Brentwood and several West County locations.\n\nThe No Kings coalition in Oakland will be donning yellow on their noontime march to Lake Merritt. An estimated 10,000 people will meet at Wilma Chan Park, located at 810 Jackson St., across the street from the Lake Merritt BART Station, before arriving at the amphitheater bordering the lake, between 12th Street and 1st Avenue. Mayor Barbara Lee, Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Oakland and other community members are planning to speak by 2 p.m., followed by performances from local dancers, poets and musicians.\n\nSaturday’s demonstrations come less than four months after the first “No Kings” rallies held this summer, which drew more than 5 million people, according to counts from the American Civil Liberties Union, which co-sponsored the protest — recorded among the largest single-day mobilizations in US history.\n\nThat included more than 140,000 protesters who took part in 50 protests in the Bay Area during the “nationwide day of defiance” on June 14, according to a Bay Area News Group survey of local organizers.\n\nEven bigger crowds are expected this weekend for No Kings 2.0.\n\nAn estimated 12,000 to 13,000 people hit San Jose’s streets for the No Kings protest in June, said Rebecca Elliott, with Indivisible San Jose, who helped plan the march and rally at St. James Park. She’s one of several organizers who said the bigger numbers projected this around are likely related to the Trump administration showing no sign of backing down from critics of its policies.\n\n“I think more people are aware, and more people are afraid,” Elliott said. “I think more people have been impacted financially.”\n\nThey expect participants to voice opposition to ICE crackdowns on immigrants and Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities, Elliott said.\n\nOn other specific issues, participants also are likely to voice support for Democrats to press for the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies being part of a deal to reopen the federal government. Still more protesters will be there to drum up support for Proposition 50, the ballot measure that could reshape the state’s congressional map and deliver up to five new Democratic seats in the US House.\n\nOn social media, longtime Berkeley resident Robert Reich, former Clinton labor secretary and UC Berkeley professor emeritus, said mass movements like No Kings play an important role in the groundswell of opposition to Trump.\n\n“As we resist Trump’s tyranny through protest, as we gain in solidarity, we feel more courageous,” Reich said in a TikTok this week, linking to the No Kings website that lists more than 2,500 locations where protesters will be participating nationwide. “As we feel more courageous and stand up to Trump, we weaken him and his regime.”\n\nAs with the June No Kings protest, and the weekly protests taking place across the Bay Area over the past eight months, Saturday’s event is designed to be peaceful and uplifting, organizers say.\n\nOn a nationwide Zoom planning meeting Thursday before more than 5,000 people, Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin said, “We want this to be joyful.”\n\nHe and his wife Leah Greenberg suggested protestors incorporate American flag iconography into their signs and outfits — or even dress up in inflatable-animal costumes, a trend started by Portland protesters.\n\nLevin said there’s power in millions of people coming together “to say collectively: no kings ever in America.”\n\nKathryn Durham-Hammer, who leads the Indivisible Resisters chapter in Contra Costa County, said that these protests allow people “to build community around shared values.”\n\n“Every time we come out and protest together, we build bonds with each other and we let new people know that we are here and that we care about liberty and justice for all,” she said.\n\nFor April Verrett, president of the Service Employees International Union, No Kings Day is about claiming what communities across the U.S. have already built.\n\n“Working people built this country, not billionaires,” Verrett said. “We’re protecting what we’ve built, and we’re building what’s next. Let’s go get it.”","summary":"More than 140,000 protesters took part in protests in the Bay Area in June.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/16/bay-area-organizers-of-saturdays-no-kings-protests-expect-biggest-crowds-yet/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SJM-L-NOKINGS-0615-61.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:30:50","author":"Katie Lauer,Martha Ross","authors":["Katie Lauer","Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.183},{"id":369958008,"title":"NYC mayoral candidates pledge to work with Trump as Cuomo, Mamdani and Sliwa face off in debate","text":"The New York City mayoral candidates have pledged to work with President Donald Trump as Democratic nominee Zohran Mamandi, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa faced off in a Thursday night debate. \n\nThe candidates were asked what they would say in their first official call with Trump “to set the tone for your relationship” if they were elected. \n\nMamdani, who has publicly feuded with Trump, said, “I would make it clear to the President that I am willing to not only speak to him, but to work with him, if it means delivering on lowering the cost of living for New Yorkers.”\n\nCuomo, who is running as an independent and has also had a rocky relationship with the president, said, “I would say to the president in the first conversation, ‘Look, we have had many, many battles. We fought together every day during Covid...I'd like to avoid them.’”\n\nSliwa said he’d negotiate with Trump over New York City infrastructure projects. \n\n“I've had a love-hate relationship with Donald Trump that goes back over 30 years, but I know one thing...you can be tough, but you can't be tough if it's going to cost people desperately needed federal funds,” Sliwa said. \n\nOn November 4, New Yorkers from the five boroughs will flock to the polls to cast their ballot for the city’s new mayor. \n\nMamdani, a democratic socialist, has run on a platform of affordability with promises of rent freezes and free buses. Cuomo has also campaigned on affordability, but has focused on public safety as well. He wants to add 5,000 more police officers to the streets of New York City. \n\nAs the founder of the Guardian Angels, a community safety group, Sliwa is also big on law and order. He wants to hire an extra 7,000 police officers. Mamdani says he wants to keep the police force the same size.\n\nMamdani is leading in the polls. A recent Quinnipiac University poll found Mamdani with 46 percent of support from likely voters, Cuomo with 33 percent and Sliwa with 15 percent. And another survey from Fox News saw Mamdani leading with 47 percent of likely voters and Cuomo trailing with 29 percent. Sliwa had only 11 percent of voter support.","summary":"The candidates were asked what they would say in their first official call with Trump ‘to set the tone for your relationship’ if they were elected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-tonight-mamdani-cuomo-sliwa-b2847022.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/23/01/GettyImages-2241065433.jpg?crop=3507,2338,x1.5,y0&trim=0,2,0,1&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZmXv0Z3j-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:30:30","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.119},{"id":369959006,"title":"‘No Kings’ anti-Trump rallies planned across Minnesota Saturday","text":"Protests against the administration of President Donald Trump are planned in cities across Minnesota this Saturday as part of thousands of events scheduled around the U.S.\n\nA rally at the Commons, a park in downtown Minneapolis near U.S. Bank Stadium, and others across the state are part of the second round of “No Kings” protests in response to what organizers call “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Minneapolis No Kings event is one of dozens scheduled across Minnesota and is set to begin at 1 p.m. It will include a march along a planned but unannounced route and is expected to end around 4 p.m. Scheduled speakers at the event include Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham and Monique Cullars-Doty with Black Lives Matter Minnesota.\n\nOrganizers say there will be two rallies from noon to 2 p.m. in St. Paul — at Lexington Parkway South & W. Seventh Street and near St. Catherine University at 525 Fairview Ave. S.\n\nOrganizers with Indivisible Twin Cities, Women’s March Minnesota and Minnesota 50501, another anti-Trump protest movement, said the Minneapolis speakers will focus on “actions Minnesotans can take to stand together against the abuses of power, cruelty, and corruption and protect our communities, especially our immigrant communities as ICE and the National Guard invade American cities.”\n\nIt’s unclear how many will attend the rally in Minneapolis, though around 25,000 people attended the first No Kings Rally at the state Capitol in St. Paul on June 14, according to the Minnesota State Patrol. Organizers with Indivisible claimed 80,000 attended.\n\nThat turnout came even as dozens of “No Kings” events were canceled in Minnesota amid an ongoing manhunt for the alleged assassin of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her Husband, Mark, at their home in Brooklyn Park earlier that morning. The Minnesota State Patrol had urged people to avoid the events until the suspected killer had been apprehended.\n\nOrganizers expect millions to attend the roughly 2,500 events planned in all 50 states this weekend.\n\nBesides Minneapolis and St. Paul, activists have events planned Saturday in numerous Twin Cities suburbs, Duluth, Rochester, St. Cloud, Fargo-Moorhead, International Falls, and other communities across the state.\n\nWhat likely will be Minnesota’s largest “No Kings” rally is happening in downtown Minneapolis rather than the state Capitol because of a booking conflict for the space, according to Heather Friedli with 50501.\n\nIn anticipation of a rally downtown, the Minneapolis Police Department said it is partnering with other law enforcement agencies and that residents can expect a visible police presence through the weekend. A department spokesman said he did not anticipate any road closures.\n\nActivists held the June “No Kings” rallies as counterprograming for a military parade in Washington, D.C., ordered by President Donald Trump.\n\nA second round of “No Kings” protests comes amid an ongoing immigration crackdown and deployment of National Guard troops to Democratic-controlled cities by the Trump administration and a government shutdown.\n\nAs of Thursday members of Congress had not reached a deal to fund the government, meaning many federal services remain in limbo.\n\nThe shutdown started Oct. 1 after Congressional Democrats refused to approve Republican spending plans unless they preserved soon-to-expire health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Republican representing Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional District, drew criticism from Democrats this week for calling “No Kings” protesters the “terrorist wing” of their party.\n\n“This is one thing and one thing only,” Emmer said of the ongoing shutdown. “To score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold … a ‘hate America’ rally in D.C. next week.”\n\nIn response, Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, sent Emmer a letter expressing concern over his remarks, calling them “careless and inflammatory” in the wake of recent political violence in Minnesota.\n\n“Your comments were out of character, out of line, and represent the worst in our politics; language that threatens people’s safety,” said Murphy, who served in the Legislature with Emmer. “We can speak clearly and firmly to our differences without throwing gas on an already dangerous fire.”","summary":"A rally at the Commons, a park in downtown Minneapolis near

Trump meet","text":"The Opposition Leader wrote to Mr Albanese this week outlining “clear measurers of success” for his upcoming White House meeting with Donald Trump.\n\n“We wish the Prime Minister every success in his first formal meeting with the President,” Ms Ley said on Friday. \n\n“When it comes to the Prime Minister stepping into the Oval Office, there is only Team Australia.\n\n“But this must be more than a photo opportunity, Australians are relying on the PM to deliver.”\n\nShe said the meeting “occurs at a pivotal moment for our alliance” and the Prime Minister must “secure assurances on AUKUS, tariffs, international partnerships and national security”.\n\n“The Prime Minister should not seek to avoid tough conversations on these issues, and it is important he stands up for our national interest,” Ms Ley said.\n\nShe listed five key areas: AUKUS Pillar I, AUKUS Pillar II, tariffs, Quad and the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance – Australia’s advanced weapons program.\n\nAs AUKUS is the centrepiece for Australia’s 21st century defence strategy, Ms Ley demanded “assurance” on the review being carried out by the Trump administration.\n\nAnnounced in June, it was meant to take just 30 days but has dragged on for months.\n\n“If raised by the US, the Coalition believes Australia should be open to expanding the AUKUS pact where it is in our national interest, particularly in relation to Australia obtaining an enduring nuclear submarine capability,” Ms Ley said.\n\nShe also wanted “real commitments on Pillar II”, which covers advanced defence and security technologies beyond arming Australia with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nOn tariffs, Ms Ley called on Mr Albanese to lock in a carve out “to protect Australia from future tariff increases on our medical manufacturing, film, steel, agriculture and resources sectors”.\n\nSpecifically, she set Mr Albanese the challenge of cutting steel and aluminium levies from 50 per cent to 25 per cent “in line with what the UK Prime Minister … was able to secure”.\n\nMs Ley was especially firm on Quad – a four-way partnership between Australia, Japan, India and the US broadly seen as a check on China’s economic and military might.\n\nMr Trump has signalled containing China’s growing power in the Indo-Pacific will be a key foreign policy focus of his second term.\n\nBut it is unclear how crucial he considers the Quad to that task, with an annual leaders’ meeting still up in the air and his top diplomat, Marco Rubio, saying members must turn “meetings and gatherings … into a vehicle for action”.\n\n“The Coalition expects the Prime Minister to raise the status of the Quad with the President to secure certainty about the timing and agenda of the next Quad leaders’ meeting,” Ms Ley said.\n\n“We cannot allow the Quad to fail.”\n\nShe also said advancing the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance “must become an urgent priority matched with urgent action”.\n\nDefence Industry Minister Pat Conroy has spent much of this week doing exactly that.\n\nRubbing shoulders with senior US officials and major weapon makers in Washington, Mr Conroy on Tuesday (AEDT) inked a statement of intent with the US Department of War and Lockheed Martin to start building advanced missiles in Australia by Christmas.\n\nMs Ley said the announcement was “too little, too late”.\n\nWrapping up her demands, she said that if Mr Albanese returned from Washington “with tangible progress in these key areas he will receive our congratulations”.\n\n“Should he fall short, we will hold the government to account for failing to rise to the requirements of Australia’s national interests,” Ms Ley vowed.","summary":"Sussan Ley has written Anthony Albanese a stern letter as the Prime Minister

Lai, 77, is the former publisher of the now-closed Apple Daily newspaper, which criticized Beijing and supported Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. He was jailed five years ago along with six colleagues under Hong Kong’s national security law on charges of sedition and colluding with foreign adversaries for allegedly promoting “anti-China, destabilizing activities” promoting Hong Kong separatism from China, according to Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu.\n\nCanadian human rights groups have called for Lai’s release for years, including a recent June 18 joint statement put out by the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China and the Toronto Association for Democracy in China calling for Lai to be given honourary Canadian citizenship and let out of jail.

It’s a similar process with China. We are restarting broad engagement with China.”Carney Talks About Meeting Chinese PremierSpeaking Oct. 16, Carney also referenced his meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Sept. 23 at the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, saying it was a productive opportunity to look at the dependencies and exposures Canada has with China as its second-largest trading partner.\n\nChina put 100 percent levies on Canadian canola oil, oil cakes, and peas in March, along with 25 percent tariffs on Canadian seafood and pork, seemingly in retaliation for 100 percent tariffs Ottawa applied on Chinese electric vehicles last year. China has agreed to drop the tariffs if Canada gets rid of the EV levies.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Anita Anand is visiting China Oct. 16 and 17 as part of a broader trip that includes visits to Singapore and India.\n\nIn addition to Carney’s call for Lai to be released, U.S. President Donald Trump said in August that he plans to “do everything I can to save him.” The Freedom for Gao Zhisheng Act, introduced in September by Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey, also seeks the release of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and Lai. The bill is currently being reviewed by several House committees and is still in the introductory phase.\n\n“Prime Minister Carney met with Premier of China Li Qiang today.

The flurry of action came as a top US military leader in the region announced his sudden retirement.\n\nNicolás Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested, has appealed for peace with the US.\n\nHe addressed the \"people of the United States\" in the television address, saying \"no war, yes peace\".\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump said he believed the military had sea drug operations under control but was now looking at land.\n\nThe increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. There are reportedly about 10,000 US forces built up in the Caribbean, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, a US territory.\n\nUN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".\n\nBBC Verify confirmed that three B-52 bomber planes - the likes of which have been used during conflicts in Iraq and Syria - took off from Barksdale Air Force base in the Gulf State of Louisiana.\n\nA Global Strike Command spokesperson also confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US media partner, that the three aircraft had flown missions near Venezuela.\n\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, the commander of US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), Navy Admiral Alvin Holsey, announced on social media that he would retire by the end of the year. His purview includes the Caribbean Sea, where the US has conducted strikes against alleged drug boats at Trump's behest.\n\n\"The SOUTHCOM team has made lasting contributions to the defence of our nation, and will continue to do so,\" he said. \"I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe.\"\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth praised Holsey's career and wrote on social media that the admiral \"demonstrated unwavering commitment to mission, people, and nation\".\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation of the CIA would allow the agency to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity.\n\nIt remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\n\n\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\n\n\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\"\n\nHe added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"\n\nVenezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said.\n\nIn the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.\n\nOn Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO [drug-trafficking organisation] drug-trafficking route\".\n\nAs has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard.\n\nMaduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\n\n\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader.\n\n\"No to CIA-orchestrated coups d'état.\"\n\nHe added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"\n\nEarlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday.\n\nIn a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.\n\nForeign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\n\n\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.\n\nTrump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.\n\nIn a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.\n\nUS officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defence, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorising it, with specific actions identified.\"\n\nMulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organisations.\n\n\"Perhaps a real-life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leader.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-says-he-authorised-cia-in-venezuela-as-maduro-says-no-to-regime-change-2/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1595.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:25:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 25pm","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 25pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.152},{"id":369967642,"title":"US admiral overseeing strikes against boats off Venezuela to step down","text":"The admiral who leads US military forces in Latin America will step down at the end of this year, two years ahead of schedule, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Thursday, in a surprise move amid escalating tensions with Venezuela.\nA source familiar with the matter said there had been tension between Admiral Alvin Holsey and Hegseth over operations in the Caribbean and questions about whether he would be fired in the days leading up to the announcement.\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Jack Reed, called Holsey’s unexpected resignation troubling given mounting fears of a potential US confrontation with Venezuela.\n“Admiral Holsey’s resignation only deepens my concern that this administration is ignoring the hard-earned lessons of previous US military campaigns and the advice of our most experienced warfighters,” Reed said in a statement.\nHegseth, in a social media post, did not disclose the reason for the departure of Holsey, who is one of two black four-star officers leading a US combatant command.\nOn social media, Holsey said he would retire on December 12, but did not give a reason.\n\n“It’s been an honor to serve our nation, the American people and support and defend the Constitution for over 37 years,” he said.\nHolsey’s departure comes against the backdrop of an American military build-up in the Caribbean that includes guided missile destroyers, F-35 fighter aircraft, a nuclear submarine and around 6,500 troops as US President Donald Trump escalates a stand-off with the Venezuelan government.\nUS military strikes against suspected drug boats off Venezuela have killed at least 27 people, raising alarms among some legal experts and mostly Democratic lawmakers, who question whether they adhere to the laws of war.\nThe Trump administration argues it is in a war with narcoterrorist groups from Venezuela, making the strikes legitimate.\nOn Wednesday, Trump disclosed that he had authorised the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, adding to speculation in Caracas that the United States is attempting to topple President Nicolas Maduro.\nHolsey is the latest in a series of flag officers to leave their positions since Hegseth took over the Pentagon.

General Employees’ Union (BCGEU) strike.\n\nUnion members went on strike Sept. 2 and started picketing to halt alcohol distribution a few weeks later.\n\nEntrepreneurs who own restaurants or private liquor stores are still able to operate because they have much inventory on hand, and in the case of restaurants also sell food.\n\nAlcohol importers in B.C., in contrast, have seen business dry up because they cannot access their own products to get them delivered.\n\nAll their products are stuck in warehouses, legally unable to be moved.\n\nIndustry insiders say this situation is an example of how B.C. has an archaic system of distributing alcohol.\n\nHow alcohol is imported in B.C.\n\nAll alcohol imported into B.C. must first go to a private bonded warehouse, such as one in Richmond run by ContainerWorld Forwarding Services Inc.\n\nEven alcohol that the government itself imports for its own stores must first go to a private bonded warehouse, Import Vintners and Spirits Association executive director Stacy Kyle told BIV.\n\nImporters must then send that alcohol to a government warehouse, such as one in Delta. Only then may the importers ship the booze to the end buyer — a restaurant, private liquor store or government retail store, she said.\n\nShe would like the system to change so alcohol could bypass the government warehouse and be sent directly to customers from the private bonded warehouse.\n\nThis bureaucratic two-warehouse shuttle run for booze has been in place for decades, and was highlighted as something needing to change by a panel that now-Premier David Eby created in 2017.\n\nThat panel, known as the Business Technical Advisory Panel (Liquor Policy), or BTAP, recommended in its 2018 report that government streamline this system.\n\nMark Hicken, who chaired BTAP, made a new appeal in a blog post last month, urging the B.C. government to change its system.\n\n“The forced requirement for a government ‘middle-man’ is neither efficient nor environmentally sustainable,” Hicken wrote.\n\n“It increases costs and causes a complete breakdown in distribution whenever there is a strike (or any other disruption to the operation of the government warehouse). There is simply no reason for this system to continue.”\n\nBIV asked the B.C. government for a response and was told that the British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food were working on a response. No reply arrived by deadline to explain why the change has not yet been made or even if any work is being done to implement the change.\n\nThe BCLDB told BIV in an email that it \"continues to work closely\" with BTAP to identify and address areas of concern raised by industry, including the distribution of non-stocked wholesale products. \n\n\"We are committed to collaborating with the liquor industry on wider policy matters, but it is important that any reforms and changes are carefully considered to ensure the needs of all sectors of the industry are addressed and balanced with public interest concerns, including the revenues required to support public health and safety services,\" it said.\n\nBTAP in 2018 made 23 recommendations, with the government later acting on many of them.\n\nOne of BTAP’s recommendations that also met inaction in Victoria was the one to allow restaurants to buy alcohol from private retailers and resell those products to diners.\n\nThe BCLDB told BIV in an email earlier this month that the recommendation was not enacted on “given policy, labour, financial and trade implications, and lack of consensus among stakeholders.”\n\nHere is a link to the BTAP's final report. \n\nImporters face dire situation\n\n“It's absolutely devastating,” Vintage West Wine and Spirits owner Matt Thirlwell told BIV on Wednesday.\n\n“The entire revenue stream for an import wine and spirits agency, like mine, has been completely shut down. We cannot sell a single case into the market because the distribution centres are closed.”\n\nThirlwell told BIV that his agency, which operates across Western Canada, had 20 staff earlier this year. Including himself, eight workers are in B.C. and he has so far swallowed steep losses to keep everyone employed with no layoffs.\n\n“I'm hearing throughout the industry that layoffs are starting this week,” he said. “Some of the larger companies started layoffs over two weeks ago.”\n\nHe said he is “getting close” to having to lay off staff. \n\nWhat makes matters worse for him is that he could soon face new costs and damaged merchandise he is not able to sell.\n\nContainerWorld is nearing if not already at capacity, meaning that it would soon not be able to accept any new shipments. That could mean charges for the importers for the rejected shipments and demurrage fees.\n\nNot having a safe warehouse to store wine or beer may also put those products at risk of freezing in cold temperatures, Thirlwell said.\n\nHe estimated that his B.C. sales have tended to be about $300,000 per week, and that this revenue has gone to zero.\n\nHis business’ losses each week are in the tens of thousands of dollars, he said.\n\nBefore the strike, Thirlwell was also adjusting to the B.C. government's March decree that it would not allow any new U.S. alcohol shipments to enter B.C., as retaliation for tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has levied. \n\nOther importers are also enduring business losses in the province.\n\nCalgary-based Black Stallion Spirits director of sales for B.C. and Alberta, Adam Baptie, told BIV that his company’s B.C. business has also ground to a halt.\n\n“We are fortunate that we have diversity through other provinces that we can weather the storm,” said Baptie, whose company does most of its business in Alberta and has one B.C. employee.\n\n“I feel for the ones that are headquartered in B.C.”\n\nHe praised the Alberta alcohol-import system, which requires alcohol to flow through the private company Connect Logistics Services Inc.\n\nThe Alberta government does not play a role in warehousing or distribution.\n\n“There are a lot of positives from the Alberta system that people would like to see in B.C.,” he said.\n\n“Restaurants and liquor stores can all order directly from Connect. There are thresholds to meet minimum case requirements and that kind of thing, but it does allow a pretty quick system, and a flat tier for all products.”\n\nKyle similarly said the Alberta system could be one that B.C. emulate.\n\n“They're super efficient,” she said of Connect Logistics. “Turnaround times, order times are a couple of days. It goes from just outside of Edmonton to every corner of Alberta in 48 hours.”\n\nB.C.’s process takes much longer even when there is no strike, she said.","summary":"Alcohol importers typically work in the background and do not deal directly with the general public - something that makes it easy for consumers to take them for granted.

Katie Britt, R-Ala., called this “the most pro-IVF thing” a president has done in history, some pro-lifers are relieved that the plan includes coverage for root-cause treatments for infertility and that coverage of IVF remains voluntary for employers.\n\n“I welcome the Admin’s commitment to making groundbreaking advancements in treating root causes of infertility more accessible & available,” March for Life President Jennie Lichter wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nMembers of the Make America Healthy Again and pro-life movements have lobbied the Trump administration to prioritize root-cause treatments as an alternative to IVF.\n\nThe pro-life group Live Action issued a memo in June urging the Trump administration to focus on treating infertility as a chronic disease. Live Action also met with the administration several times to discuss IVF policy.\n\nHeritage Foundation family policy expert Emma Waters and former Ethics of Public Policy Center researcher Natalie Dodson issued a report highlighting restorative reproductive medicine as a way to treat the underlying causes of infertility, rather than circumventing the causes through IVF.\n\nOn Thursday, Health and Human Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the plan is in line with the Make America Healthy Again movement to address root causes of chronic diseases.\n\n“President Trump is stressing the root causes through his MAHA agenda of reducing endocrine disruptors, the exposure chemicals that decrease fertility,” Kennedy said.\n\nThe Daily Signal asked Trump if the administration would provide equal access to root-cause treatments as to IVF.\n\n“I think we’re going to be doing that,” the president said.\n\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said her department is prioritizing delivering all types of health care coverage to Americans.\n\n“The Department of Labor is issuing their intent today to open up the rulemaking process again for more flexibility,” she said in response to The Daily Signal. “Anytime that you have a president who’s leading, when you can offer more access to health care at a lower rate, [it] is a benefit to the American people and to the end user.”\n\nThe plan lets employers choose a stand-alone fertility benefit that matches their values.\n\n“This new benefit option simultaneously represents the greatest opportunity to expand coverage of IVF that the federal government has ever taken, while also improving the care delivered,” Overton said. “Additionally and very importantly, it gives employers maximum flexibility to design benefits that are consistent with their values.”\n\nOverton said employers are best situated to know what their employees will want to contribute to in relationship to their benefits. \n\n“Employers are going to be able to decide how to cover the root causes of infertility, things like obesity and metabolic health and other things that are impacting infertility,” she said. “Also, if they want to encourage their employer, their employees, to see certain types of doctors, and they can work with providers that are identifying the highest-quality fertility providers. And so it puts them in the driver’s seat.”\n\n“Our view is that we want employers to be the ones that can make those decisions, notthe government,” she continued.\n\nStill, some, like Live Action President Lila Rose, remain skeptical. \n\n“Trump encourages employers to add insurance coverage for IVF—enabling the commodification of children,” she wrote on X. “Babies won’t be healthier. IVF kids face higher risks of lifelong health issues, & the process itself discards countless embryos—real human lives—deemed ‘unfit.’ Reverse this.”\n\nLichter, the president of March of Life, said she will continue to call for federal government policymaking on IVF that prioritizes protecting human life in its earliest stages.\n\nBut she said she can “appreciate that President Trump hears and is responding to so many Americans who dream of becoming parents.”\n\nRestorative reproductive medicine “aims to resolve, rather than ignore, underlying medical issues, to increase health & wellness while also restoring fertility, and to respond to the beautiful desire for children while avoiding any collateral loss of human life. It’s totally MAHA, and it has a great track record. More babies + healthier mamas = wins all around!”\n\n“I hope this new approach to insurance coverage for fertility treatments results in more women finding healing and having babies through RRM,” Lichter said.","summary":"President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a new plan to lower the costs of in vitro fertilization to create “healthier pregnancies, healthier babies, and many...

That’s in Australia’s national economic interest.”\n\n“There is so much that we do together and so much more that we can do together, including in areas like critical minerals.\n\n“It’s possible for us to engage on both of those fronts, but more than possible, it’s necessary and important that we do that, because that’s in Australia’s national economic interest.”\n\nBeijing mandated that exporters of products which contain more than 0.1 per cent of minerals mined or processed in China must seek approval from the Chinese Government before trading it. It also banned their use in foreign military technology.\n\nWith critical minerals needed for smartphones, cars, household appliances and defence equipment — US trade representative Jamieson Greer claimed Beijing’s controls was part of “a broader plan by China to control the world’s supply chains”.\n\n“If China wants to be an unreliable partner to the world, then the world will have to decouple,” Mr Bessent had declared.\n\n“The world does not want to decouple. We want to de-risk. But signals like this are signs of decoupling, which we don’t believe China wants. I don’t believe that China wants to be an agent of chaos.”\n\nDr Chalmers pledged he would discuss Australia’s abundance of critical minerals with the director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett while in Washington.\n\n“When it comes to critical minerals, Australia has so much to offer the world,” Dr Chalmers said.\n\n“This will be an important part of the discussions that I have with Kevin Hassett tonight.\n\n“We know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need.\n\n“We will engage with our partners to make sure that we can be a very reliable supplier to meet the critical minerals needs.”\n\nDr Chalmers also said he had no doubts it would be raised by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during his first formal bilateral with US President Donald Trump when the pair sit down in the White House on October 20.\n\n“Obviously, we don’t pre-empt the specific nature of the discussions that Prime Minister Albanese will have with President Trump next week,” he said.\n\n“But clearly, the Americans have an interest in Australian critical minerals\n\n“We had a number of discussions with the Americans in recent months.\n\n“We will make sure that we make the most of this absolutely golden opportunity for Australia.”","summary":"Treasurer Jim Chalmers has dismissed US officials’ push to ‘decouple’ from China, calling critical minerals an ‘absolutely golden opportunity’ for Australia.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/australian-treasurer-jim-chalmers-rejects-top-us-officials-calls-to-decouple-from-china-c-20378342","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20378342/a6cda8ad17927f67212f5285b550b64e79901364-16x9-x0y0w3840h2160.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:11:08","author":"Caitlyn Rintoul,Prime Minister Anthony","authors":["Caitlyn Rintoul","Prime Minister Anthony"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":369963148,"title":"2 arrested in Texas immigration detention center shooting now face terrorism-related charges - AP News","text":"DALLAS (AP) — Two people arrested in a July shooting outside an immigration detention center in Texas are facing new charges that follow President Donald Trump’s order last month to designate a decentralized movement known as antifa as a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nAutumn Hill and Zachary Evetts were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Fort Worth on charges that include providing material support to terrorists and attempting to murder officers and employees of the U.S. government. Federal prosecutors accuse them of being members of an antifa cell that planned the shooting.\n\nHill and Evetts were already among 11 people facing attempted murder charges related to the July 4 shooting outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, that injured a police officer. \n\nIn a post on X on Thursday about the new charges, Attorney General Pam Bondi called antifa “a left-wing terrorist organization,” and said, “they will be prosecuted as such.”\n\nShort for “anti-fascists,” antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.\n\nThe indictment said the attack began when a group of people clad in black and wearing masks, some carrying firearms and wearing body armor, shot fireworks toward the center and vandalized vehicles and a guard shed. Then, as officers responded, one person yelled, “get to the rifles” and opened fire, striking an officer, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment said that the group brought 10 firearms to the July 4 attack.\n\nCody Cofer, an attorney for Hill, said in an emailed statement that the new terrorism-related charge “could be understood by some as an attempt to appeal to a mob mentality rather than relying on the evidence and the law.” \n\nPatrick McLain, an attorney for Evetts, said that so far he’s seen “zero basis” for any of the charges against his client.\n\nThe original charges filed over the summer say searches related to the attack found items including anti-government materials and flyers with political messages, but those documents did not mention antifa. \n\nAntifa is a domestic entity and, as such, is not a candidate for inclusion on the State Department’s list of foreign terror organizations. There is no domestic equivalent to that list in part because of broad First Amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States.\n\nThe July 4 shooting took place as Trump ’s administration has ramped up deportations. Days after that shooting, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen near the Mexico border, injuring a police officer. Authorities shot and killed the attacker.","summary":"2 arrested in Texas immigration detention center shooting now face terrorism-related charges  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/texas-immigration-detention-center-shooting-antifa-4222ea274b47345d2124d450df5bbe30","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e982426/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1c%2F01%2F3f48bea1c494c2ce49cf6114abb5%2F072e657db4934c97a2c364d080c62623","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:11:00","author":"Jamie Stengle","authors":["Jamie Stengle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":369953714,"title":"Did JB Pritzker Hit the Jackpot in Las Vegas? Tax Filing Reveals Surprising Details","text":"Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, one of the wealthiest politicians in the United States, reported more than $10 million in income for 2024, including over $1 million in gambling winnings from Las Vegas, according to new tax filings released by his campaign. Documents made public on October 14 show the Democratic governor and his wife, MK Pritzker, reported an adjusted gross income of about $10.7 million, outlets including the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and NBC News reported. Of that, roughly $1.4 million came from blackjack winnings at a Las Vegas casino. \"The Governor had winnings and losses from a casino during the year and those amounts are reported on his tax return,\" a Pritzker campaign spokesperson told the Tribune. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Pritzker acknowledged the reports, saying he had been \"incredibly lucky\" during a vacation in Las Vegas. \"I went on vacation with my wife, with some friends,\" he said. \"I was incredibly lucky. You have to be to end up ahead, frankly, going to a casino anywhere — it was in Las Vegas — and I like to play cards.\" Also Read: Illinois Governor Pritzker Blasts Trump Over Move To Federalise National Guard His campaign confirmed that Pritzker plans to donate the winnings to charity. The Sun-Times noted that the couple’s reported income for 2024 is more than triple the $2.8 million they declared in 2023. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, has an estimated net worth of $3.9 billion and does not draw a salary as governor. Pritzker was first elected in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. In June, he announced his bid for a third term. He has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, particularly over federal interventions in Chicago. Earlier this month, a judge temporarily blocked Trump’s plan to deploy National Guard troops in the city. \"The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,\" Pritzker said, according to the Associated Press. Trump later wrote on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson \"should be in jail for failing to protect ICE officers.\" Pritzker responded in an interview with ABC News on 12 October: \"Come and get me. They’re making things up to go after people. I’m going to stand up for the people of my state… all of us, Democrats and Republicans, need to speak out about it.\" Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, has an estimated net worth of $3.9 billion","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-gambling-las-vegas-casino-winnings-tax-filings-net-worth-article-153012491","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153012492,thumbsize-50698,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153012492.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-16 23:10:58","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.117},{"id":369968316,"title":"FDA unveils drugs to receive expedited review in support of ‘national priorities’","text":"By MATTHEW PERRONE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced the first round of experimental drugs that will receive drastically expedited reviews at the agency, part of an effort to prioritize medicines the Trump administration deems as “supporting U.S. national interests.”\n\nThe nine medicines announced by the FDA include potential treatments for vaping addiction, deafness, pancreatic cancer and other conditions.\n\nSeveral of the drugs would compete with higher-priced drugs already on the U.S. market.\n\nAt the White House, President Donald Trump highlighted the injectable infertility drug, Pergoveris, which is currently sold in Europe for patients going through IVF treatments.
