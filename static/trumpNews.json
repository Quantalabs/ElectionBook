There will be a 25 per cent tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.” \n\nMeanwhile, Mexico and Canada, too, evaded the new 10 per cent levy given Mr Trump’s move to hit the two major economies with 25 per cent tariffs on auto imports, as well as steel and aluminium. \n\nIn announcing the move, Mr Trump argued that “reciprocal” tariffs were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on US goods and designed to boost manufacturing jobs at home. \n\nDespite cancelling its remaining tariffs on imports ahead of the President’s announcement, Israel was still included on the otherwise exhaustive list. \n\nMr Trump’s higher rates will hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy.\n\nHow Trump’s tariffs will impact China\n\nAmong the most punishing tariffs were the 34 per cent slapped on imports of Chinese goods, on top of an existing 20 per cent levy – deepening a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. \n\nBeijing has vowed countermeasures in response and warned the new tariffs, which bring levies on Chinese goods to 54 per cent, will cripple global supply chains – and Washington’s own interests. \n\n“China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement following Thursday’s announcement. \n\n“There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism.” \n\nAccording to Beijing’s customs data, sales of Chinese goods to the US last year totalled more than $US500 billion – 16.4 per cent of the country’s exports. \n\nUS duties also threaten to harm China’s fragile economic recovery as it struggles with a long-running debt crisis in the property sector and persistently low consumption – a downturn Beijing had sought to slow with broad fiscal stimulus last year. \n\nBut an intensified trade war will likely mean China cannot peg its hopes for strong economic growth this year on its exports, which reached record highs in 2024. \n\n“The US tariffs on Chinese imports announced so far this year could fully negate the lift from the fiscal stimulus measures announced so far,” HSBC chief Asia economist, Frederic Neumann, told AFP. \n\nWhile he said the impact on export competition may be slightly mitigated by the fact that all countries are hit by levies, he stressed “the drag on Chinese growth is nevertheless significant”. \n\nAnalysts also warned that because of the crucial role Chinese goods play in supplying US firms, the tariffs may also have major knock-on effects.\n\n“US imports from China are dominated by capital goods and industrial materials instead of consumer goods,” Head of China Research at the Institute of International Finance, Gene Ma, told AFP.\n\n“The tariff will hurt US manufacturers as well as consumers.” \n\n“This trade war not only has a destructive impact on China but also on the global trade system,” Chen Wenling, Chief Economist at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, said.","summary":"The White House has clarified its eyebrow-raising decision to keep Russia off President Donald Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs list.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/what-donald-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-mean-for-russia-china/news-story/f55de694d7830963cd853b3bbfcb9da8?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4d7eb25a1b6986626eaf9bdb0969b0f5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 01:03:57","author":"The New York","authors":["The New York"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.088},{"id":307454178,"title":"Staggering $2.4 trillion erased on Trump tariffs","text":"The local ASX 200 was not immune to the global sell-off as about $50bn was wiped as the market dropped 137.50 points or 1.75 per cent to 7,722.20 points during early trading. \n\nIn the US, all three indexes had their worst day since 2020. The Dow and S&P500 dropped 4 and 4.8 per cent respectively while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite plunged 6 per cent. \n\nThe S&P 500 fell back into a correction on Thursday, as it is now down more than 10 per cent from its February all-time high.\n\nIG market analyst Tony Sycamore said the global market sell-off came off the back fears US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, dubbed Liberation Day, could lead to a recession. \n\n“A staggering $2.4 trillion was erased from the value of the S&P 500 companies, the heaviest drop since the dark days of the Covid crash, he said. \n\n“Overnight, JPMorgan revised higher to 60 per cent the chance of a global recession this year, up from 40 per cent. \n\n“As we have consistently noted this week, US equity markets are priced for a modest slowdown in growth and earnings but not for a recession. Should a recession occur in the US, US stock markets could easily fall a total of 30 per cent from their February highs.”\n\nCapital.com senior financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said global markets cratered overnight as the fallout from the Trump tariffs continue. \n\n“Market participants see the tariffs as little more than economic vandalism and self-harm, with the higher than expected aggregate level of tariffs and the uncertainty generated by a hawkish and wanton approach to global trade raising fears of a US recession.”\n\nThe global market is continuing its sell off after US President Donald Trump said all countries will face a baseline 10 per cent tariff with around 60 nations also facing reciprocal tariffs.\n\nSo far Australia has a 10 per cent tariff but our largest trading partner China, was slapped with another 34 per cent in tariffs, taking the total to 64 per cent while the European Union and Japan will have a 20 and 24 per cent tariff respectively.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said tariffs placed on Australia are unfair.\n\nThe US President singled out Aussie beef producers, saying Australia had an unfair advantage. \n\n“Australia bans – and they’re wonderful people, and wonderful everything – but they ban American beef,” President Trump said.\n\n“Yet we imported $3bn of Australian beef from them just last year alone.\n\n “They won’t take any of our beef. They don’t want it because they don’t want it to affect their farmers. And you know, I don’t blame them, but we’re doing the same thing right now starting at midnight tonight.\n\nMr Rodda said the market was hoping for clarity after the US President’s tariff plan.\n\n“Instead, it compounded it as the markets came to expect greater protectionist policy from the Trump administration,” he said.\n\n“President Trump dismissed the market reaction to his tariffs, saying it was going “very well”, while suggesting a “phenomenal” deal would need to be done to lower them. \n\nMembers of his administration also threatened aggressive counter tariffs to any retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, which are all but certain to arrive in some form.”\n\nVanEck Asia Pacific managing director and chief executive Arian Neiron agreed there has been a seismic shift to global trade.\n\n“Uncertainty will most likely prevail in the near term, and Australia is not immune, with the federal government being put to vote in the coming quarter and interest rates appearing to be stuck in a holding pattern,” Mr Nerion said. \n\n“One thing investors can be sure of is the fundamental principle for navigating uncertainty, which is diversification. \n\n“In this environment, we think there are distinct opportunities for diversification into the under-owned, unloved corners of the capital markets.”","summary":"Australia’s sharemarket has plunged again after global markets continued to sell-off overnight on fears the US tariff policy could be the start of a recession.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/markets/australian-markets/recession-fears-sink-wall-street-overnight/news-story/66be1bf0e45fe7c2fb97a1e4c1c56b0d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2b8e04260578d469e320a620a74fedeb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 01:03:57","author":"Saul Loeb","authors":["Saul Loeb"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.447},{"id":307453810,"title":"How will the EU respond to Donald Trump's tariffs?","text":"The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels.

It makes up 25% of global GDP. \n\nBut the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP. \n\nSo, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.\n\nBut that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.\n\nIf you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think. \n\nTake energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \n\nTricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US. \n\nThink of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine.

Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who has clashed with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over his opposition to the measure.\n\nAsked where he stands on the matter, Trump sided with Luna.\n\n“If you’re having a baby, I think you should be able to call in and vote. I’m in favor of that,” Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon on Air Force One. “I don’t know why it’s controversial.”\n\nTrump said he spoke with Luna on Wednesday, adding that while he understands the perspective of those against the proposed rule change, he agrees with her and others who feel “strongly about it.”\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nLuna said Wednesday night on Newsmax that Trump had assured her “that this would get resolved.”\n\nTrump’s support for the proposal puts him at direct odds with Johnson, who has called proxy voting unconstitutional. He tried this week to stymie Luna’s effort to force a vote on a proxy voting measure.\n\nWhile Trump said Thursday that he would ultimately defer to Johnson, his public backing of Luna could further drive support for the effort after Johnson previously discouraged rank-and-file Republicans from supporting the proxy voting push.\n\nFollowing Trump’s comments, Luna said on X that Johnson had just called her and proposed limiting her proxy voting measure “to just new moms who cannot physically travel in event of emergency,” an idea she called “smart.”\n\nA representative for Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a now-deleted post on X, Johnson indicated Thursday night that Luna could be endangering the Republican agenda after House floor proceedings stalled this week.\n\nLuna indicated earlier Thursday evening that Trump’s support would help get her measure across the finish line.\n\n“I’m confident that with President Trump’s support, my proxy voting resolution will pass and new moms and dads in Congress will be able to vote for the America First agenda we promised,” she said on X. “Thank you to the Members of Congress who stood with me when it wasn’t easy.”\n\nNine Republicans in the House joined Democrats in blocking the House GOP from advancing a package of bills Tuesday after Johnson included language that would kill the proxy-voting push.\n\nLuna had tried to force a floor vote on the resolution through a discharge petition, a procedural tool that allows any House member who gathers 218 signatures to bring a measure to the floor. She reached that threshold, signaling bipartisan support from the majority of House members.\n\nJohnson committed Wednesday to redouble his efforts to block the remote voting push from succeeding.\n\n“I don’t concede on something that I believe to be unconstitutional. I can’t,” Johnson said. “I took an oath to uphold the Constitution. So we’re going to find a path through this.”\n\nJohnson has signaled an interest in accommodations for new parents, including a room for nursing mothers.\n\nLuna gave notice Tuesday of her intention to call a floor vote. If the House has votes Monday and Tuesday, as planned, Johnson must allow the bill to come to the floor for a vote by Tuesday unless he can think of another procedural mechanism to subvert it.\n\nThe measure, sponsored in part by Luna and Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., would allow new parents to vote by proxy for 12 weeks following the birth of a child and would also allow pregnant lawmakers to vote by proxy if doctors determine they cannot travel safely.\n\nA similar bill was introduced last year after Luna was told she could not vote following the birth of her child in August 2023 if she didn’t travel to Washington.\n\nRepublicans have fiercely opposed proxy voting since the Covid pandemic, when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., authorized the practice as a safety precaution. Republicans for years accused members of taking advantage of the rule change. Kevin McCarthy, of California, the House Republican leader at the time, challenged the practice in court.\n\nJohnson said in January that he, too, filed a brief with the Supreme Court asserting that proxy voting is unconstitutional.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump backed an effort Thursday to allow remote voting by&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Supports Remote Voting for New Parents Amidst House GOP Stalemate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-supports-remote-voting-for-new-parents-amidst-house-gop-stalemate/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-04/250403-Anna-Paulina-Luna-ew-622p-729656.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 01:03:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":307454518,"title":"Trump Administration Halts $500 Million in Federal Funding to Brown University","text":"WASHINGTON – The Trump administration is planning to halt more than half a billion dollars in contracts and grants awarded to Brown University, adding to a list of Ivy League colleges that have had their federal money threatened as a result of their responses to antisemitism, a White House official said.\n\nNearly $510 million in federal contracts and grants are on the line, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn an email Thursday to campus leaders, Brown Provost Frank Doyle said the university was aware of “troubling rumors” about government action on its research money. “At this moment, we have no information to substantiate any of these rumors,” Doyle said.\n\nIt comes two days after President Donald Trump’s administration halted research grants at Princeton University.

Reuters quoted two US officials as saying that Witkoff invited Dmitriev to the United States last week.\n\nDmitriev is the high-ranking Russian official to visit Washington on state business since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed the visit, but the officials quoted by Reuters said the White House directed the State Department to issue a short-term license for Dmitriev to enter to the country. The envoy would otherwise not have been allowed in because he is under US sanctions, the officials said.\n\n\"Whatever your politics -- dialogue between the US and Russia matters. It’s about building a more secure, more prosperous world for everyone,\" Dmitriev said on X in a post that included an image of a jetliner reaching the US East Coast.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed earlier reports by Reuters and CNN that Dmitriev's visit might occur this week.\n\n\"Yes, I confirm. This visit may be possible. We are continuing to talk to the Americans. I will not give more concrete [details],\" Peskov said.\n\nDmitriev is to discuss strengthening relations between the United States and Russia during his talks with Witkoff, according to CNN.\n\nTrump, who recently expressed frustration with the pace of cease-fire talks and with Russian President Vladimir Putin, mentioned the war on April 2 at the end of a speech announcing sweeping tariffs against EU countries, Canada, Mexico, and other US trading partners.\n\nTrump again vowed to bring an end to the war and said he believes the United States is \"being given good cooperation by Russia and by Ukraine” in the negotiation process.\n\nDmitriev may be key in repairing relations between Moscow and Washington, which have sunk to the lowest level since the depths of the Cold War. The Russian envoy played a role in early contacts with the United States when Trump was elected president the first time in 2016.\n\nDmitriev recently has mentioned a host of initiatives that Russia and the United States could work on together, including rare earth mineral mining, energy, the Arctic, and space.\n\nProminent Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza noted that Dmitriev is not a diplomat and said his arrival in Washington and apparent talks with Witkoff were “very illustrative” of the direction that the negotiations are taking.\n\n“Judging by the personalities of these two interlocutors they are not going to talk about people. They are not going to talk about peace. The are not going to talk about the future of Ukraine,” Kara-Murza said on CNN on April 2.\n\n“They are going to talk about money. They are going to talk about profits.

Keputusan AS mengenakan tarif itu, berpotensi menjejaskan daya saing Malaysia di pasaran global, memandangkan tarif baharu ini akan meningkatkan kos produk dieksport.\n\n Kesan tindakan tarif ini terhadap Malaysia mungkin memberi impak negatif kepada pertumbuhan ekonomi. Malah ada ahli ekonomi meramalkan pertumbuhan Keluaran Dalam Negara Kasar (KDNK) Malaysia pada 2025 mungkin akan berada di bawah 5 peratus, dengan paras sokongan sekitar 4.5 peratus.\n\n Ini menunjukkan Malaysia mungkin berdepan dengan pelbagai cabaran dalam mengimbangi ketidaktentuan ekonomi global.\n\n Dalam hal ini, kerajaan mengambil pelbagai langkah untuk menyusun semula perbelanjaan dan memperkenalkan program bantuan tunai seperti Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah (STR) serta Sumbangan Asas Rahmah (SARA) bagi mengurangkan beban rakyat.\n\n Ini diharap dapat merangsang perbelanjaan pengguna, walaupun pengguna mungkin akan lebih berhati-hati dalam berbelanja disebabkan kos sara hidup semakin meningkat akibat kesan tarif ini.\n\n Pada pihak Bank Negara (BNM) pula, ia mempunyai ruang untuk bertindak dengan melonggarkan kadar faedah bagi merangsang ekonomi domestik.\n\n Walaupun Kadar Dasar Semalaman (OPR) mungkin diturunkan, keputusan lanjut akan lebih jelas selepas mesyuarat Jawatankuasa Dasar Monetari (MPC) pada 8 Mei ini.\n\n Pelonggaran dasar monetari ini dapat membantu dalam menyokong pertumbuhan ekonomi, terutama apabila ekonomi global semakin melambat.\n\n Dalam jangka pendek, nilai ringgit diramalkan akan terus lemah berbanding dolar AS. Ini disebabkan ketidaktentuan ditimbulkan tarif balas berkenaan yang menyebabkan pelabur beralih kepada aset lebih selamat seperti dolar AS.\n\n Kadar pertukaran dolar AS/ringgit kini berada sekitar RM4.4390 hingga RM4.5790 dan dijangka terus berada dalam julat ini pada suku kedua tahun ini.\n\n Walaupun ringgit dijangka kekal lemah dalam jangka pendek, terdapat kemungkinan untuk pemulihan pada separuh kedua tahun ini, terutama jika terdapat kejelasan mengenai pelaksanaan tarif dan pengecualian tertentu.\n\n Ringgit mungkin kembali pulih\n\n Penganalisis menjangkakan nilai ringgit mungkin kembali pulih menjelang akhir 2025 dengan unjuran kadar pertukaran sekitar RM4.30.\n\n Tarif dikenakan AS ini berpotensi mencetuskan ketegangan perdagangan lebih besar. Negara terkesan mungkin mengambil langkah balas, seterusnya akan merosakkan kestabilan perdagangan antarabangsa.\n\n Jika keadaan ini berlanjutan, ia boleh membawa kepada kemerosotan pertumbuhan ekonomi global, yang tentunya akan memberi kesan buruk kepada Malaysia.\n\n Dalam keadaan ketidaktentuan ini, perniagaan di negara ini dijangka lebih berhati-hati dalam perbelanjaan dan pelaburan. Kenaikan kos akibat tarif ini mungkin menyebabkan syarikat besar dan kecil menghadapi tekanan dalam menjalankan operasi mereka. Ini juga berisiko memberi kesan kepada penciptaan pekerjaan dan pengurusan kos dalam sektor swasta.\n\n Syarikat yang bergantung kepada pasaran eksport, terutama ke AS, kini menghadapi cabaran lebih besar. Kenaikan kos disebabkan tarif baharu ini boleh mengurangkan daya saing produk Malaysia di pasaran antarabangsa.\n\n Bagi mengatasi kesan ini, syarikat Malaysia perlu mencari alternatif pasaran lain seperti negara ASEAN, China dan India, selain meningkatkan daya saing dalam teknologi serta inovasi.\n\n Tindakan tarif ini menimbulkan persoalan sama ada langkah unilateral AS ini boleh diterima dalam sistem perdagangan antarabangsa.\n\n Sebagai penyelesaian, pertikaian perdagangan ini seharusnya diselesaikan melalui Pertubuhan Perdagangan Dunia (WTO) yang lebih mengutamakan ketelusan dan peraturan antarabangsa.\n\n Malaysia perlu menggalakkan penyelesaian secara multilateral untuk mengelakkan ketegangan perdagangan lebih besar.\n\n Dalam menghadapi cabaran ini, Malaysia perlu memperkukuh ketahanan ekonomi domestik dengan meningkatkan daya saing dalam pelbagai sektor.\n\n Ini termasuk meningkatkan kualiti produk, memperbaiki produktiviti pekerja dan menggalakkan inovasi dalam sektor teknologi serta industri hijau.\n\n Kerajaan juga perlu terus memberi tumpuan kepada pengukuhan sektor penting seperti perkilangan, pertanian dan perkhidmatan.\n\n Walaupun tindakan tarif AS memberi cabaran, ia juga membuka peluang untuk Malaysia memperluas pasaran eksport di luar AS. Negara yang terlepas daripada tarif ini, seperti negara ASEAN dan Asia Barat, boleh menjadi destinasi eksport alternatif yang berpotensi bagi produk Malaysia.\n\n Malaysia juga boleh memanfaatkan hubungan ekonomi serantau melalui kerjasama lebih erat dengan negara ASEAN. Menyertai perjanjian perdagangan bebas lebih luas dapat membuka peluang baharu bagi perniagaan Malaysia untuk berkembang tanpa terkesan dengan tindakan unilateral negara besar seperti AS.\n\n Kerajaan perlu terus menilai semula dasar perdagangan luar negara dan memastikan ia berorientasikan kepada kepentingan nasional.\n\n Kebijakan ini seharusnya lebih fleksibel dan responsif terhadap perubahan dinamik pasaran antarabangsa serta dapat melindungi sektor penting negara daripada kesan buruk tarif.\n\n Tindakan tarif oleh AS ini memberikan cabaran besar bagi Malaysia, namun dengan pendekatan tepat, negara ini mampu menyesuaikan diri dan mengatasi kesan negatif berkenaan.\n\n Kerajaan, sektor swasta dan rakyat perlu berganding bahu dalam memastikan ekonomi Malaysia terus berkembang serta berdaya saing dalam dunia perdagangan semakin kompetitif.\n\n Penulis adalah Pengarang Ekonomi BH","summary":"PENGUMUMAN langkah tarif balas terhadap beberapa negara, termasuk Malaysia yang dibuat Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, mungkin memberi kesan besar kepada ekonomi negara.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/rencana/komentar/2025/04/1380179/perkukuh-ekonomi-domestik-cari-pasaran-baharu-hadapi-tarif","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/perkukuheko_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1743727432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:43:58","author":"Kamarulzaidi Kamis","authors":["Kamarulzaidi Kamis"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.496},{"id":307454276,"title":"Bitcoin Takes A Beating As Tariff Announcement Roils Global Markets","text":"Bitcoin prices fell over 7% in less than 24 hours in the last few days.

With the recent shakeup in financial markets and tariff news, it seems that most risk-on assets are being sold across the board,” he wrote via email.\n\n“This can be confirmed by seeing the deep correction in large cap tech stocks represented by the Nasdaq,” Sifling added.\n\n“Investors are worried about slowing growth and a potential recession, which causes them to sell risky investments like Bitcoin and take a flight to safety in more conservative asset classes,” he concluded.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nOne analyst, the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O, offered a different take on the situation.\n\nWhen asked whether Trump’s latest announcement fueled bitcoin’s recent decline, she answered via email that “Yes I do agree to an extent that the decline in Bitcoin price is due to tariffs. However there could be some other factors contributing to Bitcoin price decline,” she emphasized.\n\n“With technical analysis we can see a steady decline from $109,000 since 1/20/2025.

The trial poses a threat to undo Meta’s high-profile acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp — deals the FTC claims were overpaid to squash budding competition.\n\nAs stated in The Straits Times, Meta’s spokesperson confirmed, “We regularly meet with policymakers to discuss issues impacting competitiveness, national security, and economic growth.”\n\nBackground on the FTC’s Charges\n\nThe FTC’s antitrust charges against Meta date back to Trump’s first term, stemming from allegations that Meta, then Facebook, unlawfully maintained a social network monopoly. The tension escalates as the FTC, under its Chairman Andrew Ferguson, continues to pursue its hard-line stance against tech giants.\n\nMeta’s Defense Strategy\n\nMeta rebuffs the FTC’s argument, insisting that their acquisitions enhanced market competition and customer experience. They argue that the FTC’s focus is overly narrow, ignoring substantial competition emanating from players like TikTok, Google, and LinkedIn.\n\nA Broader Context of Legal Battles\n\nThe current legal action against Meta is part of a larger antitrust wave impacting other tech behemoths.

Our top stories and themes and this is the day after the Liberation Day, which is the day President Donald Trump announced tariffs on a host of countries and more on that shortly. The top stories now- Indian markets battle tariff headwinds even as global markets sinkGold prices hit fresh highs on tariff announcements and fresh bouts of uncertainty Oil prices fall below $70 a barrel and output is to go up further, good news for IndiaAnd decoding the impact of tariffs on India and piecing together what India's strategy should be going forward. The Markets Hold OutIt cheers up a strong domestic economy, which is not to say we should not be integrated with a global economy, but there are times you have to thank ourselves for being a large domestic economy. Indian stock markets stood strong against a tariff onslaught on Thursday, even as policymakers and businesses tried to make sense of the impact of U.S. tariffs on Indian exports and where it could go from here as bilateral trade discussions started. The Trump administration has indicated that this is really the starting point at the bottom and India and other countries can now arrive at some meeting point.They've also indicated that if you were to retaliate, then they could take up tariffs further. Remember, India has been hit by a 27% sweeping tariff with some exceptions, of course, and we'll come to that. Pharmaceutical and textile stocks did well for different reasons, which also highlights the intricacies of trade policy.Then that's something we don't think about or encounter on a daily basis unless we're part of that industry that is facing it. So the pharmaceutical industry is relieved because they are exempt from tariffs and textiles is relieved because India has a competitive advantage now because tariffs on India are lower than rivals like Bangladesh and Vietnam and more on that shortly. So on the last day, the Sensex and Nifty were down and they closed lower with a 30 share Sensex closing down 322 points at 76,295 and the Nifty 50 closing down 82 points at 23,250.IT stocks did badly because of fear of recession in the United States while pharmaceutical stocks, as we said, did well. Indian markets or rather their performance have to be seen in the context of markets elsewhere. Global markets broadly sank on Thursday, including China, Thailand and Vietnam because most of them and Vietnam were much lower.But the biggest hit in some ways, at least when it comes to stock markets, were to the US markets themselves. The US futures were trading sharply all through Thursday, India time and towards evening, the Dow Jones opened with more than a thousand point fall at start of trade. Bloomberg pointed out that some $1.7 trillion was erased from the Standard & Poor's 500 index at the start of trading, thanks to worries that President Donald Trump's sweeping new round of tariffs could plunge the economy into recession, adding that the hit was hardest on companies whose supply chains were most dependent on overseas manufacturing.

They are as follows:\n\n1. Increase food sovereignty\n\nSheinbaum outlined the government’s domestic production targets for corn, beans, milk and rice. Her administration is aiming to substantially increase production of the four staples between now and 2030, the president’s final year in office.\n\nSheinbaum said that the government will present the programs aimed at achieving the food production targets at her Friday morning press conference.\n\n2. Increase energy sovereignty \n\nSheinbaum said that Mexico’s production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel will increase by at least 30% by 2030. She also said that natural gas production will increase over the next five years, allowing Mexico to reduce reliance on imports.\n\nSheinbaum said that the government will “accelerate” investment in the state-owned Federal Electricity Commission in order to increase its electricity generation capacity, including its capacity to generate renewable energy.\n\n“We will accelerate the permits for the generation of renewable energy, always guaranteeing that 54% of electricity generation is public as the recently approved laws establish,” she added.\n\nSheinbaum said that further details on the government’s energy sector plans will be announced at her morning press conference next Wednesday.\n\n3. Accelerate public infrastructure projects\n\nSheinbaum said that the government will this year “accelerate” a range of public infrastructure projects, including highway projects, water projects, rail projects, port projects and airport projects.\n\nShe said that the draft “Public Works Law,” which is currently under consideration by Congress, will allow “all” the processes related to the construction of the infrastructure projects to be expedited.\n\nSheinbaum said that the various public infrastructure projects will generate between 500,000 and 1 million “direct jobs just in 2025.”\n\nShe said that more information about the government infrastructure projects will be presented on Monday April 14.\n\n4. Accelerate the construction of homes and access to loans \n\nSheinbaum said that the government is now aiming to build 180,000 new homes this year, 50,000 higher than a previously announced target.\n\n“It’s part of the project [to build] one million homes in the six-year period of government,” she said.\n\nThe Institute of the National Housing Fund for Workers (Infonavit) and the National Housing Commission (Conavi) are involved in the ambitious project.\n\nSheinbaum also said the government will expedite access to more than half a million loans to help Mexicans purchase homes. She said that the government’s housing projects will create at least 400,000 “direct jobs” this year.\n\nFurther details on the government’s housing schemes will be presented next Wednesday.\n\n5. Strengthen various sectors of the economy \n\nSheinbaum said that her government will strengthen various sectors of the Mexican economy so that they can ramp up production of goods “for the internal market.”\n\nThe sectors she cited were textiles, footwear, furniture, steel and aluminum, semiconductors, solar panels, batteries and the “creative industry.”\n\nDecrees to support the government’s objective that include “a range of actions and measures” will be published on May 5, Sheinbaum said.\n\n6. Increase production of vehicles \n\nSheinbaum said that the government has a plan to increase the production of vehicles in Mexico for sale in the domestic market. Innovation, research and development and energy efficiency in the auto sector will be strengthened as a result of the plan, she said.\n\n“The objective is that the majority of vehicles used in Mexico are manufactured in our country,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“Decrees for this program, which are also associated with dialogue with the United States, will be published on May 16,” she said.\n\n7. Increase production of pharmaceuticals and medical devices \n\nSheinbaum said this will be achieved through measures such as “the administrative simplification” of national health regulator Cofepris.\n\nShe also said that the government, starting in 2026, will increase purchases of medicines and medical equipment from companies that have at least one plant in Mexico.\n\nDecrees to support the objectives will be published later this month.\n\n8. Increase production of petrochemicals and fertilizers \n\nSheinbaum said this will be achieved through public-private and private-only projects. She said that agreements for the public-private projects will be signed in the first half of this year.\n\n9. Increase government purchases of Mexican goods \n\nSheinbaum said the new Acquisitions Law, currently being considered by the Senate, will facilitate this objective. It states that Mexican goods should account for 65% of total government purchases.\n\n10. Increase sales of Mexican products in supermarkets and department stores \n\nSheinbaum said this will be achieved through “voluntary agreements” with the retailers. She said these agreements would be published by May 12.\n\nIt appears the government wants supermarkets and department stores to increase the range of Mexican goods they stock, and perhaps reduce their offerings of foreign products.\n\n11. Digital platform for investors to be ready this month \n\nSheinbaum said that a new digital platform that investors can use to complete municipal, state and federal applications and other forms will be ready on April 21.\n\nThe platform is called “La ventanilla única,” a kind of digital one-stop shop for companies seeking permits and the like in order to legally commence projects in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum noted that Mexico currently has an “investment portfolio” of planned projects totaling more than US $200 billion. A slide she displayed during her speech showed more than US $298 billion in the investment pipeline.\n\n“There is enormous enthusiasm for investing in our country,” she said.\n\n12. Tendering process for 15 ‘well-being hubs’ will start by mid-May \n\nSheinbaum said that the tendering processes for the construction of 15 “well-being hubs” — industrial zones or corridors — will start by May 19 at the latest. She noted that these hubs will offer a range of tax incentives to the companies that invest in them.\n\n13. The creation of new jobs \n\nPlan México aims to create 1.5 million jobs during Sheinbaum’s six-year term.\n\nThe president said on Thursday that 100,000 jobs will be on offer at job fairs and via online job search sites in the near future. She said that the government has been working with the private sector on the initiative.\n\nJobs will be on offer at 300 jobs fairs across all 32 federal entities starting April 23.\n\n14. Increase access to credit for small businesses \n\nAccording to a slide the president displayed, the government’s aim is to increase the percentage of small businesses that have access to credit ever year this six-year period of government to reach 30% in 2030.\n\nSheinbaum said that details on the government’s program to achieve this objective will be presented at a banking sector event on May 7.\n\n15. Increase investment in science and technology research \n\nSheinbaum said that the increased investment will be focused on the development of electric vehicles, semiconductors and satellites, and go toward the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and various other programs.\n\nThe government is also aiming to simplify the process to obtain patents. This objective will be supported by the draft Mexican Institute of Industrial Property law, which Sheinbaum said will be submitted to Congress on April 14.\n\n16. ‘Permanently’ extend the validity of the government’s anti-inflation plan\n\nSheinbaum said that the government-private sector agreement aimed at keeping the cost of basic foodstuffs down will be “permanently” extended.\n\n17. Continue minimum wage increases \n\nSheinbaum committed her government to increasing Mexico’s minimum wage on an annual basis.\n\nThe minimum wage increased 12% on Jan. 1 to 278.80 pesos (about US $14) per day in most of the country.\n\n18. Guarantee and expand welfare programs \n\nSheinbaum highlighted that all of the government’s welfare programs are “guaranteed as social rights” in the Mexican Constitution.\n\nShe said that 1 million women aged 63 and 64 now receive a government pension, and highlighted that women aged 60-62 will be able to enroll in the scheme from August.\n\nSheinbaum said that all public secondary school students are already eligible to receive a government education scholarship, and noted that the scheme will be extended to public primary school students in 2026.\n\nSheinbaum: Plan México ‘is the path’ to prosperity\n\nAt the conclusion of her address, Sheinbaum said she was certain that Plan México “is the path” that “will take us to a Mexico with more well-paid employment, less poverty and inequality, greater investment and production, more innovation [and] lower carbon content.”\n\nThe president said that the plan also ensures respect for the environment and will allow Mexico to increase its “self-sufficiency and sovereignty.”\n\nMexico News Daily","summary":"Sheinbaum said the projects she announced as part of Plan México will bring about more well-paid employment, less poverty and inequality, greater investment and production and more innovation.\n\n\nThe post Sheinbaum unveils an even more ambitious version of her transformative Plan México appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/sheinbaum-plan-mexico-projects/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1026436_Plan-Mexico-Claudia-Sheinbaum_web-Graciela-Lopez-Cuartoscuro-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:39:36","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.141},{"id":307454184,"title":"So is Starmer tough enough to hit back? Prime Minister sets May deadline for a UK-US trade deal... or tariffs on our own","text":"Keir Starmer last night signalled he is ready to impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States as soon as next month unless he can secure a trade deal with Donald Trump.\n\nThe Prime Minister said he was still focused on getting a deal with President Trump that could spare British firms the worst impacts of the US tariff blitz.\n\nBut, in a toughening of the UK’s stance, he set a May 1 deadline for a consultation on launching a tit-for-tat response – and published a 417-page dossier of US goods that could be hit.\n\nSir Keir said he would not ‘jump into retaliatory action with both feet at the get go’.\n\nBut, in the wake of Wednesday night’s bombshell announcement from the White House, he added: ‘I accept that we need to go further. I accept that we need to preserve our options, which is why all options are on the table.’\n\nMr Trump’s decision to levy 10 per cent tariffs on British imports – with 25 per cent levies on cars and steel – threatens to derail Labour’s economic plans, and increases the risk that Rachel Reeves will have to raise taxes or cut spending at the autumn Budget to meet her fiscal rules.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility warned this week that the Chancellor’s fiscal headroom would be ‘knocked out’ in the event of a trade war.\n\nIn a downbeat assessment yesterday, the PM said there would ‘clearly be an economic impact from the decisions the US has taken both here and globally’.\n\nHe said ‘big progress’ had been made on a trade deal, which ministers had hoped to agree before Mr Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ announcement on tariffs.\n\nMinisters fear the US President could even announce further tariffs in the coming days, with the pharmaceuticals sector a likely target. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the launch of a consultation on retaliatory tariffs was a ‘formal step, necessary for us to keep all options on the table’.\n\nHe said businesses would have until May 1 to ‘have their say and influence the design of any possible UK action’ including ‘products that could potentially be included in any UK tariff response’.\n\nHe added: ‘If we are in a position to agree an economic deal with the US that lifts the tariffs that have been placed on our industries, this request for input will be paused, and any measures flowing from that will be lifted.’\n\nDowning Street declined to set out the likely impact of Mr Trump’s tariff package on UK exports. But economists have suggested they could affect around 70 per cent of the UK’s £60billion annual exports to the US.\n\nThe European Commission yesterday said it expected tariffs to impact 70 per cent of its own US exports, worth £320billion. Tory peer Lord Hannan described the tariffs as ‘bats*** crazy’, adding: ‘They will cause a recession.’\n\nShadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith urged ministers to find other ways of easing pressure on British business, including ditching the controversial Employment Rights Bill.\n\nHe told Mr Reynolds to ‘put ideology aside, put the unions on hold and put the Government on the side of British business’.\n\nLib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper urged ministers to work with the EU on others on a massive retaliatory package. ‘If the Government give in to Trump’s threats, it will only encourage him to use the same bullying tactics again and again,’ she said.\n\nMr Reynolds yesterday published a 417-page list of US products that could potentially be hit with tariffs, covering everything from motorbikes and rollercoasters to beef and bourbon, leaving open the possibility that iconic US brands such as Harley-Davidson and Jack Daniel’s could be affected.\n\nTariffs of 25 per cent on British car exports to the UK came into force yesterday, while those on steel and aluminium have been in place since February.\n\nThe blanket 10 per cent rate will take effect tomorrow.\n\nMr Reynolds yesterday told MPs that the Government was also poised to act if Mr Trump’s global trade war resulted in cheap goods destined for the US market being ‘dumped’ in Britain.\n\nHe said the Government would be ‘extremely vigilant’ about domestic suppliers being undercut, and said ministers had already used quotas and tariffs to protect the British steel sector.","summary":"The Prime Minister said he was still focused on getting a deal with President Trump that could spare British firms the worst impacts of the US tariff blitz.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14570035/Starmer-hit-US-trade-tariffs-deal-deadline.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/04/01/96902289-0-image-a-11_1743726825777.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/03/7549242890584044283/1024x576_MP4_7549242890584044283.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:36:18","author":"Editor,Jason Groves","authors":["Editor","Jason Groves"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":307454498,"title":"Trump purges national security team after meeting conspiracist","text":"Donald Trump fired several US national security officials after a far-right conspiracy theorist questioned their loyalty in a White House meeting with the president, US media reported Thursday.\n\nInfluencer Laura Loomer, who is known for claiming that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job, laid out her concerns to Trump on Wednesday, the New York Times said in a report followed up by other outlets.\n\nThe reported purge comes as the National Security Council (NSC) faces scrutiny over a scandal in which a journalist was accidentally added to a chat on the Signal app in which officials discussed air strikes on Yemen.\n\nSix people from the NSC were sacked after the Loomer meeting, including three senior officials on the body which advises the president on top foreign policy matters from Ukraine to Gaza, the New York Times said.\n\nLoomer confirmed the meeting, but said on X that \"out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I'm going to decline on divulging any details.\"\n\nThe activist later said she had presented \"opposition research\" to the Republican president.\n\nAsked about the report of the firings, Trump later told reporters: \"We're always going to let go of people -- people we don't like or people that take advantage of or people that may have loyalties to someone else.\"\n\nTrump described Loomer as a \"great patriot\" but said she was \"not at all\" involved with the reported NSC firings.\n\n\"She makes recommendations... and sometimes I listen to those recommendations,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nNSC spokesman Brian Hughes told AFP the council \"doesn't comment on personnel matters.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Loomer often flew with Trump on his campaign plane during the 2024 election.\n\nShe sparked accusations of racism when she said on social media that Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris -- whose mother was of Indian descent -- would make the White House \"smell like curry\" if she won.\n\nIn recent days Loomer has repeatedly targeted national security official Alex Wong -- who was reportedly not among those sacked -- over the so-called \"Signalgate\" scandal that has rocked the White House\n\nShe baselessly suggested that he was responsible for accidentally adding Atlantic magazine journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to the chat, even though National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for the error.\n\nTrump has resisted calls to sack Waltz over the issue.

This policy, which threatens to erode the advantages AGOA provides, raises concerns about the country’s trade diversification efforts. In this interview with DAMILOLA AINA, the President, Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce, Alhaji Sheriff Balogun offers some insight on the global trade strategy\n\nWhat is the total value of Nigeria’s exports to the U.S. under AGOA since its inception?\n\nSince the African Growth and Opportunity Act began in 2000, Nigeria has exported an estimated $277bn worth of goods to the United States under AGOA. The vast majority of this value has come from crude oil shipments. In fact, petroleum products have overwhelmingly dominated Nigeria’s AGOA exports each year – oil alone accounts for practically all of Nigeria’s exports under the programme by value. Non-oil exports (such as agricultural and manufactured goods) have been only a small fraction of the total. This means that over two decades, Nigeria’s participation in AGOA has been heavily tied to oil exports.\n\nWhat is the annual average value of Nigeria’s AGOA exports to the U.S.?\n\nNigeria’s AGOA exports average roughly $10–12 billion per year in value. However, this average hides big swings over time. In the mid-2000s, during the oil boom, Nigeria’s exports to the U.S. under AGOA were extremely high – for example, in 2008, Nigeria exported over $35 billion in goods (mostly oil) to the U.S.\n\nAfter 2010, as U.S. demand for Nigerian crude fell (due to rising U.S. improved oil production), Nigeria’s AGOA exports plummeted – dropping from about $17.2 billion in 2009 to just $1.4 billion in 2015. They rebounded somewhat in later years (e.g. back up to $6.1 billion by 2017 as oil prices and exports rose again). In short, while the long-term average is around $10 billion annually, Nigeria’s yearly AGOA export figures have fluctuated dramatically, driven largely by oil market trends.\n\nHow could the new 14% U.S. tariff on Nigerian exports affect Nigeria’s AGOA benefits?\n\nA blanket 14 per cent tariff on Nigerian goods would undercut the duty-free access that AGOA currently provides. Under AGOA, eligible Nigerian exports enter the U.S. tariff-free, giving them a price advantage. Imposing a 14 per cent import tax erodes that benefit by making Nigerian products more expensive in the U.S. market. This loss of preferential treatment could have several impacts, ranging from higher costs. Nigerian exporters (and U.S. importers) would suddenly face a 14 per cent cost increase on their goods, which may force them to raise prices or absorb losses. For example, a Nigerian apparel item that used to enter the U.S. duty-free would now incur a 14 per cent tariff, wiping out much of its competitive margin. Also, there will be reduced competitiveness. Nigerian goods would become relatively more expensive than exports from other AGOA countries that are still tariff-free. Sectors that rely on thin margins would be hardest hit. Our analysts have noted that African countries’ apparel and automotive exports would be hit hard by a sudden rise in tariffs, as these industries depend on AGOA preferences to compete. The same logic applies to Nigeria’s nascent non-oil exports – even a moderate tariff can make them uncompetitive. Thirdly, there will be lower export volumes. Over time, the tariff could lead U.S. buyers to reduce orders from Nigeria or switch to alternative suppliers with duty-free access. Nigeria’s exporters might see diminished sales in the U.S. market, reversing the gains made under AGOA. In essence, the 14 per cent tariff effectively nullifies much of Nigeria’s AGOA advantage, putting its exporters at a disadvantage and potentially shrinking Nigeria’s U.S.-bound exports if it remains in effect. In summary, the tariff undermines the core benefit Nigeria enjoys under AGOA – duty-free entry – and could negatively impact export revenues and diversification efforts.\n\nHow many Nigerian firms have participated in AGOA, and how many are active now?\n\nCurrent figures indicate relatively few Nigerian companies have taken part in AGOA trade, aside from the oil sector. Over the entire period since 2000, the total number of Nigerian firms that have exported to the U.S. under AGOA is likely less than a hundred at most. Many of these are one-off or occasional exporters. Utilisation of AGOA by Nigerian businesses has been consistently low. For example, in one recent year, it was reported that only 37 Nigerian companies exported goods under the AGOA scheme, totaling about £38 million worth of products. This is an extraordinarily small number given the size of Nigeria’s economy. Notably, those exports were all non-oil products – illustrating how few Nigerian non-oil firms export to the U.S. According to the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, only a few Nigerian exporters have benefited from the U.S. duty-free trade opportunity. This statement underscores that the number of companies utilising AGOA is very limited. As of today, only a handful of Nigerian firms remain active exporters under AGOA. Aside from the major oil producers, which account for petroleum shipments, the active non-oil AGOA exporters are just a few dozen companies, primarily in agriculture and small manufacturing. In short, Nigeria’s participation in AGOA at the firm level is highly concentrated – a small core of exporters is involved, and the vast majority of Nigerian businesses have not engaged with the programme. \n\nOn average, how many Nigerian companies export to the U.S. via AGOA each year?\n\nThe annual participation is very low, on the order of only a few dozen companies per year. If we spread out the numbers, it works out to roughly 20–40 Nigerian firms at most exporting to the U.S. under AGOA in a typical year. For context, Nigeria has tens of thousands of exporters in total (most ship to other markets, not the U.S.), yet only a tiny fraction of these are tapping into AGOA annually. In many years, the count of Nigerian AGOA exporters has been in the tens, not hundreds. For example, as noted, one report showed just 37 companies in a year. Even if that figure varies from year to year, it consistently indicates that fewer than 50 companies (outside of oil shipments) take advantage of AGOA in any given year – a very low average participation rate for an economy of Nigeria’s size. This highlights a major challenge: the AGOA preference is under-utilized by Nigerian businesses.\n\nWhich sectors have benefited most from AGOA in Nigeria, and how have they performed?\n\nLike I said earlier, oil is by far the biggest beneficiary. Nigeria’s AGOA exports have been overwhelmingly oil and gas. Crude oil and related petroleum products make up the lion’s share of the value. For instance, between 2000 and 2022, Nigeria’s oil exports under AGOA amounted to about $277 billion. Even in recent years, the pattern holds – in 2023, Nigeria exported $3.8 billion under AGOA, of which $3.6 billion was crude oil. In other words, over 95 per cent of Nigeria’s AGOA exports are petroleum. Non-oil sectors have seen only limited gains under AGOA. A few agricultural products have started to make inroads. Nigeria exports a modest selection of agricultural goods to the U.S. duty-free, including items like cocoa beans, sesame seeds, cashew nuts, and shea butter. These are areas where AGOA’s tariff exemptions have opened avenues for Nigerian farmers and agro-processors. However, the volumes are still very small relative to Nigeria’s potential. For example, the total value of Nigeria’s agricultural exports to the U.S. under AGOA was about $63 million in 2020, rising to roughly $95 million in 2021 – tiny figures compared to oil exports. While growth in agro-exports is a positive sign, Nigeria’s agricultural engagement with AGOA remains at an early stage. Despite being eligible for AGOA’s textile and apparel benefits, Nigeria has hardly made a dent in this sector. Neighbouring countries have built garment factories to ship clothes under AGOA, but Nigeria’s textile/apparel exports to the U.S. are minimal (virtually zero in many years). Challenges with production cost, compliance, and infrastructure have kept Nigeria’s apparel industry from capitalising on AGOA so far. Similarly, Nigeria’s exports of manufactured or value-added products under AGOA are very limited. A small number of firms have sent products like leather goods, processed foods, or cosmetics, but again, these amounts are negligible in scale. There’s been no significant automotive or machinery export from Nigeria under AGOA in contrast to South Africa, for example. In summary, Nigeria’s AGOA exports are still almost entirely in the oil and gas sector, with non-oil sectors contributing only a sliver of the total. The performance of non-oil categories – agriculture, apparel, etc. – has been underwhelming, though there are some recent improvements in agricultural exports. Nigeria clearly has not yet leveraged AGOA to develop broad-based export industries beyond petroleum.\n\nHow does Nigeria’s AGOA performance compare to other top AGOA countries?\n\nIn terms of export value, Nigeria has often ranked near the top of AGOA beneficiaries, but for very different reasons than others. Nigeria’s high export values come from oil, whereas several other countries have excelled in diversified, non-oil exports. Currently, South Africa is the largest AGOA beneficiary by value most years. It exported about $3.6bn under AGOA in 2022, slightly more than Nigeria’s $3.5bn. Crucially, South Africa’s AGOA exports are diversified – mainly autos, minerals, metals, chemicals, and agricultural products (e.g. cars, citrus fruit, wine) rather than one dominant commodity. This industrial diversity means South Africa has created jobs in manufacturing (like car assembly for export) thanks to AGOA. Like Nigeria, Angola has used AGOA mostly for oil. In the 2000s, Angola was a top AGOA exporter due to crude oil shipments. However, with the U.S. importing less African oil in recent years, Angola’s AGOA exports have fallen. In 2022, Angola sent around $391 million under AGOA (all of it crude oil) – far less than Nigeria. Kenya is also a standout example of AGOA-fueled non-oil exports. Kenya exported about $614 million to the U.S. under AGOA in 2022, composed mostly of textiles and apparel. Through AGOA, Kenya has built a thriving apparel industry (factories producing clothing for U.S. brands duty-free). This has created tens of thousands of jobs in Kenya. By comparison, Nigeria’s apparel exports are negligible, meaning Nigeria hasn’t tapped the textile opportunity that Kenya did. Until recently, Ethiopia was another major apparel exporter under AGOA (over $200 million in garments), though it is currently suspended from AGOA. Lesotho, a much smaller country, consistently exports over $250 million in apparel to the U.S. annually. In fact, AGOA-related textile exports form a significant chunk of Lesotho’s economy. This highlights how even small economies have maximized AGOA in specific sectors.\n\nA country like Ghana exported about $746 million under AGOA in 2022 – much of it oil and some cocoa. Côte d’Ivoire’s AGOA exports (~$127 million in 2022) are mainly cocoa products and some oil. These countries, while exporting less than Nigeria, have a bit more balance between commodities and processed goods. In summary, Nigeria’s AGOA profile is an outlier. It’s dominated by one commodity (oil), whereas other top AGOA countries have leveraged the program to boost manufactured and agricultural exports. Nigeria’s non-oil AGOA exports are tiny, not just in absolute terms but also relative to peers. For instance, much smaller economies like Kenya or Lesotho export far more non-oil goods to the U.S. than Nigeria does. This comparison underlines that Nigeria has underutilised AGOA’s potential for industrial and export diversification.\n\nWhat do these trends mean for Nigeria’s trade diversification and economic outlook under AGOA?\n\nThe data suggests that Nigeria has yet to truly use AGOA as a tool for diversification. While AGOA has dramatically increased Nigeria’s oil exports in the past when the US demand was high, it has not yet transformed Nigeria’s non-oil export sectors. Trade diversification remains a key challenge. Nigeria’s economy is still heavily reliant on oil, and AGOA hasn’t changed that equation so far – unlike in some other countries where AGOA spurred new export industries. However, the opportunity for diversification through AGOA is not entirely lost. There are encouraging signs in recent years, such as the growth, albeit from a low base of agricultural exports like cocoa, cashews, and sesame to the U.S. duty-free. These niche exports show that Nigerian entrepreneurs can compete in the US market when given tariff advantages and the right support. If Nigeria scales up such efforts – for example, by improving product quality, meeting US standards, and investing in processing – it could significantly increase its non-oil exports under AGOA. That would help create jobs in agriculture and light manufacturing, contributing to Nigeria’s broader goal of reducing over-reliance on oil. It’s also important to note that AGOA is currently set to expire in September unless renewed by the US Congress. This looming deadline adds some urgency for Nigeria. In the short term, Nigeria would want to maximize use of AGOA before the deadline– essentially, make the most of the duty-free window while it’s open. In the medium term, if AGOA is renewed or replaced with a similar program, Nigeria will need to be much more proactive in exploiting it. The imposition of a 14 per cent tariff on Nigerian goods if it continues, blunts the incentive for firms to invest in exporting to the US. The Federal Government may need to double down on policies that encourage non-oil exports – improving infrastructure, providing export incentives, ensuring products meet international standards – so that more firms can benefit from initiatives like AGOA. The goal would be to emulate the success of countries that used AGOA to kick-start new sectors like Kenya’s apparel or South Africa’s autos. Diversifying within AGOA will also prepare Nigeria for a future where preferential access might not be guaranteed. If Nigeria can establish competitive non-oil exports now, those industries could survive even if preferences erode, such as if AGOA lapses or tariffs stay in place. In essence, Nigeria’s engagement with AGOA highlights a significant untapped potential – with better utilisation, AGOA could support Nigeria’s economic diversification, but without reforms and active participation, Nigeria risks missing out on the full benefits of the programme.","summary":"Nigeria’s participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act is under serious concern following the announcement of the newly imposed 14 per cent tariff by US President Donald Trump.

Google parent Alphabet and cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks slid almost 5%.\n\nTrump announced a minimum tariff of 10% on imports starting April 5, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries such as China, with 34%, Taiwan, with 32%, Vietnam, with 46% and the European Union, with 20%, starting April 9.\n\n“President Trump refuses to let the United States be taken advantage of and believes that tariffs are necessary to ensure fair trade, protect American workers, and reduce the trade deficit — this is an emergency,” the White House said in a fact sheet Wednesday.\n\nFor Apple, Meta and Nvidia, the hit was substantially worse than across the major stock indexes, where the Dow Jones tumbled 4%, the S&P 500 sank close to 5% — for its worst day since the pandemic crashed the economy in 2020 — and the tech-heavy Nasdaq dove 6%.\n\n“Trump’s tariffs and instability are wreaking havoc with companies’ stock prices,” said Adam Kovacevich, CEO of tech industry lobby group Chamber of Progress. “It’s causing investors to be nervous, it’s causing businesses to be uncertain about expansion plans, capital, supply chains.”\n\nFor Silicon Valley tech giants, the tariffs would significantly disrupt manufacturing and sales of hardware, software and services.\n\n“That’s going to affect their profitability and may force increases in prices, and that may cause lower sales,” said Stanford Law professor Alan Sykes, who studies international trade. “Everybody sees high tariffs as a potential threat to their bottom line.”\n\nAdding to investor worries over Silicon Valley firms is the threat of targeted punitive responses by tariff-hit countries seeking leverage with the Trump administration, Sykes said.\n\n“The big American tech companies are the most profitable global companies we have, so they are the natural targets of retaliation by foreign governments,” Sykes said. Other nations such as China or members of the EU could slam Silicon Valley giants with taxes or hit them with anti-monopoly legal actions to put pressure on the U.S., Sykes said.\n\n“All of these policies that affect the wellbeing of these companies are potentially in play if we have a full-scale trade war,” Sykes said. “If I were another country, and I wanted to exert pressure on the U.S. to change its ways, I’d go after the most influential U.S. companies, and the Silicon Valley companies are among the most influential.”\n\nFor this region’s tech giants, the tariffs deliver a smackdown that contrasts with the presence of their CEOs on Trump’s inauguration stage.\n\n“I suspect some of the Silicon Valley supporters of Mr. Trump are having second thoughts,” Sykes said.\n\nSilicon Valley tech firms such as Apple and Nvidia, whose businesses are dependent on Chinese manufacturing and markets, “will be the most under pressure,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.\n\nBecause tech companies’ products and services are layered into virtually every other industry, they can suffer additional damage beyond their own tariff-induced ills, said UC Berkeley Haas business school economic strategist Olaf Groth.\n\nMany in the U.S. hope the tariffs are a temporary negotiating tactic, but with Trump’s stated goal of leveling U.S. trade imbalances with other countries, it remains unclear what he would demand from other nations, Sykes said.\n\n“The trade deficit is not likely to go away no matter what negotiations occur,” Sykes said. “There’s never been any reason to expect bilateral trade to balance. I have a big trade deficit with the Safeway: They don’t buy anything from me. You buy from the people that have the things you want to buy, and you sell things to the people who want what you have.\n\n“The idea that negotiation is going to get rid of bilateral trade imbalances is just foolishness.”\n\nThe White House fact sheet on the tariffs said trade deficits “have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base,” leading to “a lack of incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity.”\n\nIves in a Thursday afternoon note to investors called the idea of making Apple iPhones in America “a fantasy tale.” Wedbush analysts believe the “vast majority” of iPhone production comes from China, and domestically made versions would likely cost $3,500, Ives said.\n\nStill, in an earlier note Thursday morning, Ives described the tariffs’ effects on stocks as a “Category 5 hurricane” that — if temporary — made it a good time to snap up certain tech stocks such as Apple, Alphabet, Palantir, Palo Alto Networks, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon and Microsoft.\n\n“Over the coming 24 hours the world will quickly realize these tariff rates will never stay as they are shown, otherwise it would be a self-inflicted Economic Armageddon that Trump would send the U.S. and world through over the coming year,” Ives said. “We have to assume this is the start of a negotiation and these rates will not hold.”\n\nHowever, opportunistic investors should not bank on quick returns, since the duration of the tariff tumult poses a big unknown, Groth noted.\n\n“It could be as much as a year, if not longer,” he said. “You should have an appetite to hold for that long.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Adding to investor worries over Silicon Valley firms is the threat of targeted punitive responses by tariff-hit countries seeking leverage with the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/03/tariffs-hammering-silicon-valley-tech-giants-stock/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/20160420__sjm-googbio-04211.jpg?w=645&h=428","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:28:28","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":307456148,"title":"Brown University to see half a billion in federal funding halted by Trump administration","text":"The Trump administration is planning to halt more than half a billion dollars in contracts and grants awarded to Brown University, adding to a list of Ivy League colleges that have had their federal money threatened as a result of their responses to antisemitism, a White House official said. \n\nNearly $510 million in federal contracts and grants are on the line, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the plan and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n\nIn an email Thursday to campus leaders, Brown Provost Frank Doyle said the university was aware of “troubling rumors” about government action on its research money. “At this moment, we have no information to substantiate any of these rumors,” Doyle said. \n\nIt comes two days after President Donald Trump’s administration halted research grants at Princeton University.

But we have a trade deficit with America.\n\n“Do not retaliate,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThis is how abusers operate. \n\nThey attack you, they lie to you, and then if you respond, they blame you.\n\nWe face a choice as a nation. \n\nWe can accept the abuse. \n\nOr we can fight back.\n\nThe retaliation menu\n\nMy first four ideas are as follows.\n\n1. A $1-million-a-day charge on Facebook for operating in Australia.\n\n2. A $50,000 tariff on every Tesla sold.\n\n3. A ban on the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movie that is scheduled to open soon.\n\n4. A $1 million tariff on every RAM truck.\n\nWe need to hit the parts of the American economy that backed Mr Trump – Elon Musk and\n\nMark Zuckerberg. \n\nWe need to hit the culturally powerful parts – Hollywood and Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd we should take the chance to hit the annoying parts – massive trucks and stupid sequels.\n\nThese are just a few ideas to get the ball rolling.\n\nWhat’s really noticeable about Donald Trump’s trade war is he only focuses on goods. America does run a goods trade deficit. They import loads of oil and food to fuel their giant consumer economy.\n\nBut America runs a huge trade surplus in services. \n\nFacebook, Google, Netflix, app stores, movies, hotel brands, Amazon, banks and more – all these services companies and industries make far more money from the rest of the world than the rest of the world makes from America.\n\nHitting America in the services sector is clever. \n\nYes, it would suck if the Australian government shut down Netflix before you finished watching Adolescence. \n\nIt would sting if Hilton Hotels had to pay a tax per room per night, Starbucks was stung per terrible coffee sold or Fitbit got pinged for every day an Australian counted their steps on their watch. \n\nBut this pain need only last as long as Mr Trump’s unprovoked tariff attack on us does.\n\nWhat is Trump’s plan? \n\nA tariff means any Australian export to America will have to pay a 10 per cent tax. \n\nSome of our biggest exports to America are gold and meat. \n\nSo if, for example, you’re a cattle farmer, you will now have to pay a $100,000 tax on every million dollars of exports to the US.\n\nThat money goes to the US government. \n\nThe exporting company tries to make up for it by raising prices in America. \n\nBut of course raising prices reduces sales. \n\nSo in the end, a messy compromise is reached: Prices go up by less than 10 per cent, sales fall a bit, consumers pay higher prices and the company has lower revenue. \n\nAs a result of lower sales and higher taxes paid, profits fall.\n\nAmerican consumers suffer and Australian companies suffer, but the US collects a bit more tax. \n\nAustralia’s tariffs are comparatively light. \n\nOther countries are getting hit far harder.\n\nChina is getting 34 per cent tariff on top of existing tariffs. \n\nMalaysia is getting an extremely unpleasant 49 per cent. \n\nVietnam gets 46 per cent. \n\nThese are brutal figures for countries that depend on trade with the world’s biggest nation. \n\nIf we go into world recession, South East Asia will be at the epicentre.\n\nAnd what’s the point? \n\nA trickle of revenue for America? \n\nThe world has experimented with tariffs a lot. \n\nWe found they make everyone worse off. \n\nIt’s just a bad way of raising revenue.\n\nThat’s why the world worked so hard over half a century to dismantle them. \n\nWork via the World Trade Organisation and via a lot of Free Trade Agreements. \n\nWork that has now been undone.\n\nMr Trump’s liberation day is a day of destruction and we need to fight it as hard as we can.\n\nJason Murphy is an economist | @jasemurphy.bsky.social.

It features Donald Trump’s face.\n\n“For $5 million, this could be yours,” pitched the president. “You know what that card is? It’s the Gold Card, the Trump Card,” said the president.\n\n“Who is the first buyer?” one of the reporters asked.\n\n“Me,” Trump quipped.\n\n“The second?” the reporter pushed on.\n\n“I don’t know, but I’m the first buyer. It’ll be out in ... less than two weeks. Pretty exciting, right?” the president asked.\n\n“Anybody want to buy one?” Trump asked.\n\nMediaite highlighted the interaction between Trump and the reporters.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced late last month the “sale of 1,000 Gold Cards this week, raising $5 billion in a single day.”\n\nUnlike American citizens, gold card holders will not have to pay taxes to the U.S. government on their overseas income.\n\nTrump introduced the cards in February to allow wealthy immigrants to live and work in the U.S. The price would grant them residency in the U.S. and, in essence, replace the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, according to Forbes.\n\nTrump was quickly asked by reporters about the negative impact of his new tariffs on the global markets.\n\n“Well, I mean, it’s to be expected where this is a patient that was very sick,” claimed Trump. “We really inherited a terrible economy … with a lot of problems.”\n\nIt was a “sick patient that went through an operation on ‘Liberation Day,’” he added, referring to his name for the day he announced the new tariffs on Wednesday.\n\n“It’s gonna be a booming country ... It’s going to be amazing, actually. We see it because we have trillions of dollars committed to come in.”\n\nTrump has often claimed that tariffs on products imported to the U.S. are paid by countries where the goods originate. In fact, American companies importing the products pay tariffs to the US government and typically pass on much of the costs to American consumers.\n\nIn response to Trump’s trade war, the S&P 500 had its worst day since 2020, with a fall of 4.8 percent.\n\nTech stocks such as Apple and Amazon fell further while markets in Asia and Europe pulled back.\n\nThe tariffs have been denounced by Democrats, some Republicans, business groups, and trade experts.

The basic import tariffs, as well as reciprocal tariffs set by the regulators from the Red and White countries, could have a negative impact on the economy and even the labor sector.The Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF) revealed that Indonesia's export market share to the U.S. reached 10.3 percent annually, making it the second largest after Indonesia's exports to China.The Head of the Industrial, Trade, and Investment Center at INDEF, Andry Satrio Nugroho, stated that Trump's new import tariffs could affect the fate of millions of domestic workers. Exporters of leading commodities, such as textiles, footwear, electronics, furniture, and agricultural products, will face high costs. Moreover, over 30 factories in the textile sector and its derivatives have closed in the past three years.\"If the government remains silent, we will not only lose our main market, but will also face a much larger wave of continued layoffs,\" said Andry in a written statement on Thursday, April 3, 2025.Trump announced the import tariff policy on Wednesday, April 2. He imposed a minimum tariff of 10 percent on all products entering the U.S. from all countries. The U.S. will impose a 32 percent tariff on imported commodities from Indonesia, ranking it eighth for the highest tariffs received.Additional reciprocal tariffs, which are now set higher according to Trump, are described as a response to several trading partner countries, including Indonesia. The added tariffs are expected to cause Indonesian exports to the U.S. to decline.In line with Andry, Syafruddin Karimi, an Economics Department Lecturer at Andalas University, mentioned that Trump's 32 percent tariff will drastically reduce the competitiveness of exports, especially in labor-intensive sectors. Products like fabrics, furniture, and footwear depend heavily on competitive prices in the U.S. market.\"These high tariffs will raise selling prices, prompt buyers to turn to other countries, and trigger the risk of mass layoffs domestically,\" he said.If Trump's policy is slow to respond to, he said, Indonesia's potential contraction of exports will directly impact the retail sector. \"Yet, the non-oil and gas export sector is one of the main pillars of economic growth and job creation,\" said Syafruddin.Wijayanto Samirin, an economist from Paramadina University, also stated that Trump's trade tariff regulations will affect Indonesia's economic growth. He even mentioned that this year's economic growth target is no longer realistic. The condition could become critical after being hit by new U.S. regulations.\"Considering our exports to the U.S. are dominated by labor-intensive industrial products such as shoes, textiles and textile products, rubber products, and electrical and electronic goods,\" said Wijayanto. \"The pressure for layoffs will become stronger.\"In an official statement, quoted from the official White House website on April 2, 2025, Trump revealed his reasoning, calling out other countries for taking advantage of the U.S. Indonesia and Brazil, according to Trump, are declared to have higher import duties for ethanol than the U.S. Trump, who officially returned to the White House towards the end of January, also highlighted Indonesia's Domestic Component Level (TKDN) policy, import licensing, and foreign exchange from natural resource exports (DHE SDA) imposed by Indonesia.According to the White House fact sheet, Indonesia maintains local content requirements across commodities for many sectors, a complicated import licensing regime. Indonesia required natural resource companies to retain export earnings in the country for transactions amounting to US$250,000 or more.Sultan Abdurrahman contributed to the writing of this article.Editor's Choice: Why Trump Imposed Reciprocal Tariffs and How They Will Affect Indonesian ExportsClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Economists warn that Trump's tariff policies will not only affect trade but also have an impact on millions of domestic workers.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/1993317/economists-warn-of-layoff-risks-in-indonesia-amid-trumps-trade-tariffs","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/04/03/id_1389159/1389159_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:06:37","author":"Ervana Trikarinaputri","authors":["Ervana Trikarinaputri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":307446236,"title":"Republicans moving ahead with Trump’s ‘big’ bill of tax breaks and spending cuts amid tariff uproar","text":"By LISA MASCARO\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — After a long wait, the Senate is launching action on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” of tax breaks and spending cuts at a risky moment for the U.S. and global economy.\n\nMore than a month after House Republicans surprised Washington by advancing their framework for Trump’s tax breaks and spending cuts package, Senate Republicans voted Thursday to start working on their version.

It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.\n\n“The President has no power to do any of this,” the state attorneys general wrote in court documents. “The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American.”\n\nTrump’s order said the U.S. has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protection.” Election officials have said recent elections have been among the most secure in U.S. history. There has been no indication of any widespread fraud, including when Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe order is the culmination of Trump’s longstanding complaints about how U.S. elections are run. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for “millions of people who voted illegally.” In 2020, Trump blamed a “rigged” election for his loss and falsely claimed widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines.\n\nTrump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it’s rare.\n\nIt has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.\n\nThe order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and puts states’ federal funding at risk if election officials don’t comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots.\n\nForcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run.\n\nCongress has the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but the Constitution doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration.\n\n“We are a democracy – not a monarchy – and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the Trump administration is requiring states to either comply with an unconstitutional order or lose congressionally approved funding, something he said the president has no authority to do.\n\n“In one fell swoop, this president is attempting to undermine elections and sidestep the Congress, and we’re not going to stand for it,” he said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump’s executive order was an attempt to impose “sweeping voting restrictions” across the country and disenfranchise voters.\n\nThe attorney general and secretary of state in Nevada, a presidential battleground, defended their state’s elections as fair, secure and transparent, and objected to the president’s attempt to interfere in how they are run. Attorney General Aaron Ford praised Nevada’s automatic systems for registering voters and distributing mail ballots.\n\n“While this order is on its face unconstitutional and illegal, it is also unnecessary,” he said.\n\nA request for comment sent to the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts by the Democratic attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.\n\nOther lawsuits filed over the order argue it could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People are already required to attest to being citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.\n\nUnder the order, documents acceptable to prove citizenship would be a U.S. passport, a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license that “indicates the applicant is a citizen,” and a valid photo ID as long as it is presented with proof of citizenship.\n\nDemocrats argue that millions of Americans do not have easy access to their birth certificates, about half don’t have a U.S. passport, and married women would need multiple documents if they had changed their name. That was a complication for some women during recent town elections in New Hampshire, the first ones held under a new state law requiring proof of citizenship to register.\n\nNot all REAL ID-compliant driver’s licenses designate U.S. citizenship.\n\nCassidy reported from Atlanta.

PGA Commissioner Jay Monahan recently dubbed Trump the \"facilitator\" of the ongoing discussions between the two golf tours — but nearly two years since the bombshell announcement was made of a potential deal, there has yet to be one. Trump gave his stance on what he hopes will happen on his way to South Florida. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Ultimately, hopefully, the two tours are going to merge. That’ll be good. I’m involved in that, too,\" Trump said. \"But hopefully we’re going to get the two tours to merge. You have the PGA Tour and the LIV Tour. And I think having them merge would be a great thing.\" Trump called the LIV golfers — a roster that includes Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and others — \"some of the best players in the world.\" Back in February, the PGA Tour credited Trump for \"[getting] involved for the good of the game,\" and it appears there has been movement since he got involved. \"Those talks are real. They’re substantial, and they’re being driven at the top levels of both organizations. Those talks have been significantly bolstered by President Trump’s willingness to serve as the facilitator,\" Monahan said last month. \"President Trump is a lifelong golf fan. He believes strongly in the game’s power and potential, and he has been exceedingly generous in his time and influence to help bring a deal together. He wants to see the game reunified. We want to see the game reunified, and his involvement has made the prospect of reunification very real.\" PHILLIES' MATT STRAHM CALLS FOR PITCHERS TO USE PINE TAR AGAIN IN RESPONSE TO TORPEDO BAT CRAZE Monahan added, \"We believe there’s room to integrate important aspects of LIV Golf into the PGA Tour platform,\" and said he could envision \"a future\" in which Public Investment Fund governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan can join the Tour's board. \"We’re doing everything that we can to bring the two sides together. That said, we will not do so in a way that diminishes the strength of our platform or the very real momentum with our fans and our partners,\" he said, adding that \"hurdles remain\" between the two sides. Trump last month expressed optimism the two sides will get some type of deal done. \"They’re gonna have to get together,\" he said. \"They’ve had a lot of discussion back and forth. They both are meaning well, and a deal will ultimately happen. I think it will happen pretty quickly. It would be nice to see the best golfers play against each other.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"They are all great people, and they want to work it out,\" Trump added. \"So, if I can help work it out… I don’t get anything out of it. I can help them work it out.

It is likely to substantially increase the budget deficit.\n\nEvery Republican voted for the measure, except Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Democrats unanimously voted against it.\n\n“The Senate Budget plan gives us the tools that we need to get our shared priorities done, including certain PERMANENT Tax Cuts, Spending Cuts Energy, Historic Investments in Defense, Border, and much more,” Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday.\n\nThe Thursday vote has triggered up to 50 hours of debate, followed by an unlimited amendment process before a vote on adopting the budget blueprint that’s expected this weekend. Democrats intend to offer amendments to put Republicans in a political bind, such as barring tax cuts for wealthy earners and forbidding Medicaid cuts.\n\n“You’re going to see a whole lot of amendments going after Donald Trump and the Republicans on a whole bunch of issues where they are favoring billionaires and against families,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. told reporters.\n\nRepublicans, who control 53 votes in the Senate, are likely to reject the Democratic amendments and approve the budget resolution in the end. If the House adopts the same measure, that would instruct committees to begin work on the bill that can bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold and cut Democrats out of the process.\n\nRepublicans indicate in the budget blueprint that they plan to use an accounting method to score the cost of permanently extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts at $0, after it was estimated to cost $4.6 trillion in a letter Thursday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nThe plan allows for an additional $1.5 trillion in tax cuts on top of that, giving the Senate Finance Committee flexibility to decide where those cuts are made. GOP senators told NBC News they may use that to pursue Trump’s other proposals, like nixing taxes on tips.\n\n“It’d be things that the president talked about — like tax on tips, stuff like that. Maybe some other things that we think of,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Senate Budget Committee. “Making the tax cuts permanent will help the economy. Determining the baseline is my job, not anybody else’s.”\n\nThe budget plan also paves the way for $175 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement to carry out mass deportation, and a $150 billion increase to military spending.\n\nThe big open question is how much spending Republicans will cut, and what they’ll go after. The measure calls for only a few billion dollars in spending cuts, a paltry sum compared to the tax cuts and spending increases it necessitates.\n\n“I think when it comes to cutting spending, we’re not going to go after Medicaid benefits — I agree with that — but there are a lot of things we can do,” Graham told reporters on Thursday, endorsing “a work requirement for able-bodied people” on Medicaid.\n\n“We’re going to cut, I think, trillions of dollars in spending,” he said, without getting specific about how.\n\nThe budget resolution also calls for a $5 trillion debt limit increase ahead of a deadline this year to act or risk a default on U.S. debt.\n\nThe vote was delayed slightly on Thursday as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., met privately with some senators who had “questions” about the “process” of what comes next, according to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.\n\n“I know that there’s some senators that have more questions. But we’ve been doing this since January, and the side of the gallows concentrates the mind,” Kennedy said, adding that he advised Thune to call the vote. “The only way to to to get some senators to focus is to hold a vote, and then they’ve got three choices: They can vote yes, they can vote no, or they can jump the rail and run.”\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said leadership was “not twisting arms, but they — some folks wanted to make sure that they understood how the process worked” and, as a result, proceeding to the vote “took a little bit longer to get it done.”\n\nDemocrats, who don’t have the votes to stop it unless four or more Republicans defect, are hoping to at least make it a politically painful vote for the majority party.\n\n“The job of the Democrats over the next 36 hours is to hold the Republicans’ feet to the fire, force them to tell the truth about what they want to do to the American economy and what they believe fairness is, and that is a country that works for a handful of billionaires and lets everybody else eat dirt,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters. “The Democrats are in this fight all the way. We’re ready to go.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — The Republican-led Senate voted 52-48 on Thursday to begin debate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Senate Republicans Push Forward with Major Budget Plan Aligned with Trump&#8217;s Agenda first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/senate-republicans-push-forward-with-major-budget-plan-aligned-with-trumps-agenda/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-04/250403-John-Thune-aa-1040-0679e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:01:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.123},{"id":307445550,"title":"As markets melt down, Trump touts $5m gold card for wealthy immigrants (featuring his face)","text":"Amid a market meltdown following his dramatic announcement of worldwide tariffs, Trump took the time on Thursday to show off his “Gold Card” to reporters aboard Air Force One. \n\nWealthy immigrants can buy the card for $5 million to gain U.S. residency. It features Donald Trump’s face.\n\n“For $5 million, this could be yours,” pitched the president. “You know what that card is? It’s the Gold Card, the Trump Card,” said the president.\n\n“Who is the first buyer?” one of the reporters asked. \n\n“Me,” Trump quipped. \n\n“The second?” the reporter pushed on. \n\n“I don’t know, but I’m the first buyer. It’ll be out in ... less than two weeks. Pretty exciting, right?” the president asked. \n\n“Anybody want to buy one?” Trump asked.\n\nMediaite highlighted the interaction between Trump and the reporters.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced late last month the “sale of 1,000 Gold Cards this week, raising $5 billion in a single day.”\n\nUnlike American citizens, gold card holders will not have to pay taxes to the U.S. government on their overseas income.\n\nTrump introduced the cards in February to allow wealthy immigrants to live and work in the U.S. The price would grant them residency in the U.S. and, in essence, replace the current EB-5 immigrant investor visa program, according to Forbes.\n\nTrump was quickly asked by reporters about the negative impact of his new tariffs on the global markets. \n\n“Well, I mean, it’s to be expected where this is a patient that was very sick,” claimed Trump. “We really inherited a terrible economy … with a lot of problems.”\n\nIt was a “sick patient that went through an operation on ‘Liberation Day,’” he added, referring to his name for the day he announced the new tariffs on Wednesday.\n\n “It’s gonna be a booming country ... It’s going to be amazing, actually. We see it because we have trillions of dollars committed to come in.”\n\nTrump has often claimed that tariffs on products imported to the U.S. are paid by countries where the goods originate. In fact, American companies importing the products pay tariffs to the US government and typically pass on much of the costs to American consumers.\n\nIn response to Trump’s trade war, the S&P 500 had its worst day since 2020, with a fall of 4.8 percent. \n\nTech stocks such as Apple and Amazon fell further while markets in Asia and Europe pulled back. \n\nThe tariffs have been denounced by Democrats, some Republicans, business groups, and trade experts. Economists issued warnings that the tariffs would raise prices for U.S. consumers and prompt employers to pull back on hiring.","summary":"‘For $5 million, this could be yours,’ Trump says of card available to wealthy immigrants to buy a right to live and work in the U.S.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gold-cards-tariffs-markets-b2727169.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/03/23/59/Donald-Trumps-gold-card.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lvsHDlHe-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-04 00:00:05","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.521},{"id":307445170,"title":"Trump Speaks Out on MAGA Star’s Role in White House Mass Firings","text":"President Donald Trump denied Thursday afternoon that far-right firebrand Laura Loomer had anything to do with a round of National Security Council firings. \n\nDuring his flight to Miami on board Air Force One, Trump sang the prominent conservative conspiracy theorist praises, but answered ‘no’ when asked if she was behind the dismissal of several of National Security Advisor Michael Waltz’s aides.\n\n‘Laura Loomer is a great patriot. She’s a very strong person,’ Trump said. ‘She’s been in the party a long time, she’s done a good job,’ he later added.\n\nInstead of being behind the firings, the president said that Loomer met with him Wednesday and gave him recommendations on people to hire. \n\n‘And sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody, I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But I saw her yesterday. She was at the ceremony. And she’ll always have something to say, usually very constructive,’ Trump said. ‘She recommended certain people for jobs.’ \n\nEarlier Thursday, DailyMail.com confirmed an Axios report that said Trump had fired several members of the National Security Council team. \n\nThe president didn’t offer a number to reporters during the Air Force One ride. \n\nThe dismissals come after Waltz accidentally added The Atlantic magazine’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat where top administration officials were discussing an attack on the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nTrump has publicly supported Waltz, a former Florida congressman, in the aftermath of ‘Signalgate’ despite some White House insiders labeling him a ‘f***ing idiot.’ \n\nHowever, The New York Times reported Thursday morning that Loomer visited the Oval Office on Wednesday and pressed for NSC firings.\n\nThe NSC is used by the president to advise him on national security, military, and foreign policy matters. \n\nLoomer came to the White House armed with research that purportedly showed some NSC staffers were not loyal enough to the president’s agenda.\n\n‘Out of respect for President Trump and the privacy of the Oval Office, I’m going to decline on divulging any details about my Oval Office meeting with President Trump,’ Loomer told DailyMail.com Thursday. \n\n‘It was an honor to meet with President Trump and present him with my research findings, I will continue working hard to support his agenda, and I will continue reiterating the importance of strong vetting, for the sake of protecting the President and our national security,’ she added. \n\nWaltz sat in on the meeting and defended members of his team, The Times said. \n\n‘NSC doesn’t comment on personnel matters,’ was the official line from NSC spokesperson Brian Hughes. \n\nBut CNN reported Thursday that the individuals fired were Brian Walsh, Thomas Boodry and David Feith.\n\nThe network said that the firings were directly the result of Trump’s meeting with Loomer, who Trump’s top Congressional ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, had tried to get banished from MAGA months ago. \n\nLoomer, however, has maintained a position in Trump’s orbit. \n\nThe axed officials include Walsh, a director for intelligence who previously worked for now Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Boodry, Waltz’s former legislative director in Congress who was a senior director for legislative affairs and Feth, who oversaw technology and national security. Feth had served in the State Department during Trump’s first term. \n\nLoomer had publicly set her sights on pushing out Alex Wong, Waltz’s deputy, and the one NSC staffer mentioned by name on the Houthi Signal chat. \n\nShe has mainly gone after Wong for being ‘Chinese.’\n\nWong is American, with parents who immigrated from China. \n\nLoomer also floated that Wong isn’t loyal because his wife had worked at the Department of Justice during Obama and Biden administrations and her father was a shareholder of a Chinese satellite maker. \n\n‘I don’t know why we have Chinese individuals in positions of national security,’ Loomer said of Wong in an online video posted last week. \n\nThe rhetoric surrounding Wong got so heated, that Republican Sen. Tom Cotton had to jump to his and his wife’s defense. \n\n‘Alex Wong and his wife Candice are complete and total patriots, 100% MAGA Warriors who always put America First,’ Cotton said in an X post on March 27. \n\n‘For three years, Alex worked hard for me until President Trump smartly hired him away,’ Cotton said. ‘President Trump made another great decision to hire Alex as his Deputy National Security Adviser. America is safer and better off with Alex in the White House. THANK YOU for your service, Alex!!!’\n\nIt appears that Wong wasn’t part of the ousted group of National Security Council employees. \n\nGreene, the Georgia Republican who also has a history of making controversial statements and pushing conspiracy theories, has been the most prominent MAGA member to publicly attempt to push Loomer out. \n\nIn September, ahead of the 2024 election, Greene called out a post written by Loomer as being ‘extremely racist.’ \n\nLoomer said if Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, won the election ‘the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center.’ \n\nHarris is half-Jamaican and half-Indian. \n\nThe Georgia Republican called out Loomer’s ‘rhetoric and hateful tone’ and said she ‘doesn’t represent MAGA as a whole.’ \n\nGreene’s office did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com’s request for comment about this week’s Loomer development.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump denied Thursday afternoon that far-right firebrand Laura Loomer had&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Speaks Out on MAGA Star&#8217;s Role in White House Mass Firings first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-speaks-out-on-maga-stars-role-in-white-house-mass-firings/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/03/23/96883695-0-image-a-63_1743718401336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-03 23:59:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.098},{"id":307451012,"title":"GOP rep says we have to see how the result of tariffs 'shake out' across the auto industry","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air April 03, 2025 04:24 \n\n GOP rep says we have to see how the result of tariffs 'shake out' across the auto industry \n Rep.

It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.\n\n“The President has no power to do any of this,” the state attorneys general wrote in court documents. “The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American.”\n\nTrump’s order said the U.S. has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protection.” Election officials have said recent elections have been among the most secure in U.S. history. There has been no indication of any widespread fraud, including when Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe order is the culmination of Trump’s longstanding complaints about how U.S. elections are run. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for “millions of people who voted illegally.” In 2020, Trump blamed a “rigged” election for his loss and falsely claimed widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines.\n\nTrump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it’s rare.\n\nIt has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.\n\nThe order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and puts states’ federal funding at risk if election officials don’t comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots.\n\nForcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run.\n\nCongress has the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office, but the Constitution doesn’t mention any presidential authority over election administration.\n\n“We are a democracy – not a monarchy – and this executive order is an authoritarian power grab,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nRhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the Trump administration is requiring states to either comply with an unconstitutional order or lose congressionally approved funding, something he said the president has no authority to do.\n\n“In one fell swoop, this president is attempting to undermine elections and sidestep the Congress, and we’re not going to stand for it,” he said.\n\nThe attorney general and secretary of state in Nevada, a presidential battleground, defended their state’s elections as fair, secure and transparent, and objected to the president’s attempt to interfere in how they are run.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump’s executive order was an attempt to impose “sweeping voting restrictions” across the country and disenfranchise voters.\n\nA request for comment sent to the White House was not immediately returned.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts by the Democratic attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.\n\nOther lawsuits filed over the order argue it could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People are already required to attest to being citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.\n\nUnder the order, documents acceptable to prove citizenship would be a U.S. passport, a REAL ID-compliant driver’s license that “indicates the applicant is a citizen,” and a valid photo ID as long as it is presented with proof of citizenship.\n\nDemocrats argue that millions of Americans do not have easy access to their birth certificates, about half don’t have a U.S. passport, and married women would need multiple documents if they had changed their name.
