Vice President Kamala Harris, she said, “had an incredibly good day in revealing her economic plan,” while former President Donald Trump was “ranting and raving” at his golf club. Tarlov noted that Harris, unlike President Joe Biden, mentioned in her speech Friday that the price of bread has gone up 50%, adding that Harris is adopting more of a Bill Clinton-esque “I feel your pain” approach. “I think that this was an incredibly good day for Kamala,” Tarlov continued. “She was able to introduce herself to the American public in a way she hadn’t before.” The TV host then compared Harris’ speech to the one Trump gave on Thursday: “You had President Trump, someone who grew up a millionaire, became a billionaire, standing in front of his golf club, ranting and raving about everything, lying about everything from GDP rates to poverty rates to energy production, et cetera.” “You have Kamala Harris, someone talking about her middle-class upbringing, the fact her family rented throughout their lives so she knows what it means for people out there who can’t get on the property ladder, someone who worked at McDonald’s through college,” Tarlov continued. “You couldn’t have a starker juxtaposition between these two candidates.” However, Jeanine Pirro dismissed Harris’ plan to end price gouging as “communism” and compared her to former Soviet Head of State Joseph Stalin. She also wondered why Harris, a former Attorney General of California, hadn’t already convened all the states’ AGs to fix price-gouging at the state level. “No, she waits until now,” Pirro said.

Troy Nehls (R-Texas) is now suing his former boss for employment discrimination, alleging that the Texas Republican fired him due to his sexuality. Politico reported Friday that Alex Chadwell — who worked as a legislative correspondent for Neils' Washington, D.C. office in 2021 — has filed a lawsuit formally accusing Nehls and his chief of staff Robert Schroeder of \"direct anti-gay hostility\" with frequent comments denigrating the LGBTQ+ community. According to Politico, Chadwell named \"the entire office\" as defendants in the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Mary Davis, who was a deputy district director at Nehls' office in Richmond, Texas at the time of the allegations, told the outlet that Nehls called her on one occasion and asked her to find out whether Chadwell was gay. After confirming that he was, Davis said the congressman acted differently toward Chadwell. She recalled one instance when an employee was watching the show \"Queer Eye,\" and Nehls remarked: \"Why are we watching this? We need to turn it off. We don’t support these people.\" READ MORE: 'No room for forgiveness': Vets blast GOP rep for continuing to wear medal 'he didn't earn' \"They were really good family friends and then it was like Alex was dead to him after he found out he was gay,\" Davis told Politico. Schroeder in particular was accused of making remarks in the office like \"gays go to hell,\" and that the natural order for humans was \"Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\" Attorney Les Alderman, who is representing Chadwell in the suit, said it was \"particularly reprehensible that someone could be forced out of a job because of their sexuality in this day and age.\" \"We should be beyond this as a society, and we will be sure that justice is served,\" he said in a statement.

She told Politico that the congressman \"did not, and does not discriminate based on any unlawful factor.\" “There is no merit whatsoever to Mr. Chadwell’s claim and the allegations of sexual orientation harassment are totally false,” she said. “The office intends to mount a vigorous defense in this matter and is confident that it will be exonerated once all the facts are known.” Currently, federal law includes the LGBTQ+ community among other protected classes — like gender, religion, race, disability, ethnicity and other classes — in anti-discrimination laws. However, former President Donald Trump has suggested that those protections would no longer exist if he won a second term this November. The far-right Heritage Foundation's authoritarian Project 2025 playbook has also called for all LGBTQ+ protections to be stripped from federal statutes.

Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the three progressives on the court in dissenting. The Biden administration requested the nation’s top court enforce parts of a new federal rule meant to protect LGBT and pregnant students from discrimination in 10 states where the rule was put on hold by federal judges. All justices agreed the disputed changes, including the new definition of “sex discrimination” to include “gender identity” and the restrictions on same-sex spaces, could remain blocked. “All Members of the Court today accept that the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary injunctive relief as to three provisions of the rule, including the central provision that newly defines sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity,” the Supreme Court said in its unsigned opinion. The Biden administration intended to expand Title IX’s protections to LGBT students with the new regulations. Conservatives celebrated the decision on social media. “Not all Supreme Court justices know what a woman is, but enough did today! Lets goooooo,” former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines posted on X. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Rep. Mary Miller (R-IL) also commended the court’s decision. Blackburn said, “I am pleased to see the Supreme Court siding with the rule of law—and basic common sense—in blocking the Biden-Harris administration’s dangerous Title IX reforms. We must always protect real women.” Others weren’t as pleased. “By a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has decided, once again, that the constitution doesn’t apply to trans people,” Stacy Cay, a transgender comedian, posted on X. Gender and women’s issues have been made a top issue this election cycle as Republicans and Democrats tussle over transgender and abortion rights. Former President Donald Trump has suggested he will prevent biological men from taking part in women’s sports, while LGBT voters have largely backed Vice President Kamala Harris.","summary":"The Supreme Court denied the application of President Joe Biden&#8217;s new Title IX sex discrimination and education regulations in states where courts blocked them in a 5-4 decision Friday.

During her economic policy speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harris blamed inflation on the supply chain crisis that occurred during the COVID pandemic, but stressed that \"prices are still too high\" despite the fact that \"our supply chains have improved.\" \"A loaf of bread cost 50% more today than it did before the pandemic,\" Harris said at one point. \"Ground beef is up almost 50%.\" HARRIS' PRICE CONTROL PROPOSAL RISKS VALIDATING ‘COMMUNIST’ LABEL, SAYS LIBERAL WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST That quote was quickly clipped, with an \"I'm Donald Trump and I approve this message\" disclaimer added on at the end, cut from an official campaign ad. It was shared by the popular X account End Wokeness as the \"shortest political ad I've ever seen\" for former President Trump. Others had some fun at the expense of the Democratic nominee on social media and boasted about how effective the parody ad is for Trump. \"Oh boy. This is devastating,\" Fox News contributor Joe Concha reacted. \"This is well done,\" Outkick founder Clay Travis said. \"Kamala just said in her economics speech that prices were way better when Trump was in office. She’s making ads for Trump now.\" \"This is flat out amazing,\" former Trump aide Hogan Gidley posted. OBAMA ECONOMIST TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS' PRICE CONTROL PLAN: ‘THIS IS NOT SENSIBLE POLICY’ The Trump War Room also lampooned Harris, writing, \"We definitely appreciate her honesty.\" The post reached more than 2.5 million views in just a few hours. The Harris campaign rolled out a first-ever federal price-fixing plan for corporations as part of a sweeping initiative intended to reduce grocery prices and other everyday expenses. \"There’s a big difference between fair pricing in competitive markets and excessive prices unrelated to the costs of doing business,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement. \"Americans can see that difference in their grocery bills.\" DAVE RAMSEY EXPLAINS WHY KAMALA HARRIS' PRICE CONTROL PLAN WILL NOT CURB INFLATION: ‘IT’S NOT SUSTAINABLE' The proposal would give authority to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to impose harsh penalties on companies for setting excessively high prices. However, some economists and financial experts have cast doubt on Harris' plan, arguing that corporations don't play a huge role in rising grocery prices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell criticized the plan, writing \"It’s hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is.\" \"If your opponent claims you’re a ‘communist,’ maybe don’t start with an economic agenda that can (accurately) be labeled as federal price controls,\" Rampell wrote Thursday.

She emphasized the importance of addressing the financial burden that weighs on voters, which former President Donald Trump is trying to attribute to her. Speaking in the pivotal state of North Carolina, Harris highlighted her commitment to bolstering the middle class as a key priority of her presidency. She outlined her proposal to introduce a federal restriction on price gouging by food producers and retailers. Comparing Harris to Trump, Wallace expressed her view that the vice president advocates for the interests of the middle and lower classes, while the former president favors policies that benefit those with significant wealth, allowing them to pursue their desires unrestricted. Polls nonetheless show that Americans are more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy: Some 45 per cent say Trump is better positioned to handle the economy, while 38 per cent say that about Harris. About 1 in 10 trust neither Harris nor Trump to better handle the economy, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. Riding a resurgence of enthusiasm since the Democrats’ campaign reboot, Harris has embarked on a battleground state blitz in recent weeks that has broadened the number of races viewed as competitive by strategists. In North Carolina, Democrats are navigating renewed energy with caution in an economically dynamic state that hasn’t been won by a Democratic presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008. Gov. Roy Cooper told Friday’s crowd, “I have that 2008 feeling.” “That’s the last time we voted for a Democratic nominee for president, Barack Obama,” Cooper said. North Carolina State University political science professor Steven Greene said that the state “went from a situation where Joe Biden was almost surely going down in defeat here, whereas Kamala Harris has a very real chance of winning,” Deborah Holder, a 68-year-old Raleigh resident who runs six McDonalds restaurants, said of the vice president, “Her culture is something that is going to be a huge strength for her, because she’ll be able to look at the rest of us not just as her constituents, but as people that she has dealt with in all walks of life,” Harris is trying to strike a balance in defining her own image and economic agenda while still giving credit for the Biden administration’s track record. Her speech in North Carolina came a day after the president was asked if Harris might distance herself from his economic record and responded, “She’s not going to.” In their first joint speaking event since Biden dropped out, he and Harris were in Maryland on Thursday where they showcased successful negotiations to lower prices for Medicare recipients on 10 prescription drugs. But Harris spent far more time talking about Trump than Biden in North Carolina, promising “to build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy.” “And where everyone has the opportunity,” she said “not just to get by, but to get ahead.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris unveiled a comprehensive set of economic measures on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris suggests reducing food and housing expenses to push back against Trump&#8217;s criticisms first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/harris-suggests-reducing-food-and-housing-expenses-to-push-back-against-trumps-criticisms/","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/RVKnTlI_FAtffpeX5AjIxu5CVE8=/0x97:5325x3092/500x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F9a524b57-d1b3-47ea-b676-5decae415f17","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:39:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":254293932,"title":"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to host Pa. GOP poll-watcher recruitment event on Sunday via Zoom","text":"One of former President Donald Trump's most outspoken and controversial supporters in Congress is slated to headline a pair of Pennsylvania GOP events in the coming weeks. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) will be the special guest for the Republican National Committee's \"election integrity virtual training\" on Sunday. MORE: N.J. Sen. Menendez ends independent bid for re-election days before he is expected to resign \"The PA RNC Poll Watcher Training provides a comprehensive overview of Pennsylvania's electoral process, as well as guidance on how Poll Watchers can play an important role in upholding election integrity. You will learn how to observe and report any potential problems that may arise during the voting and tabulation process,\" according to a Zoom link promoting the event. That same link indicates the event is closed to the press. Punchbowl News first reported Friday that the training session is with the Lehigh County Republican Committee. The Pennsylvania GOP and Pennsylvania Democratic parties did not immediately reply to requests for comment Friday. Following Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Greene falsely claimed that the loss was due to the election being stolen. She also objected to certifying the election results, and has been a vocal supporter of Trump's reelection campaign, and frequent critic of Democrats, particularly those in the progressive wing of the party. Sunday is not the first event that Republicans have held in Pennsylvania aimed at recruiting poll watchers. In June, RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, RNC Co-Chair Lara Trump, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) held the second stop of a \"protect the vote tour\" in Bucks County. The training portion of the program for that event was also closed to the press. The RNC's nationwide campaign seeks to recruit 100,000 poll watchers, poll workers, and legal experts for the 2024 election, with a goal of getting at least 5,000 volunteers in Pennsylvania alone. On Sept. 3, Greene is scheduled to be the keynote speaker for the Washington County Republican Party's Fall dinner. \"We will be asking her to speak her mind, totally unfiltered,\" the Washington County Republican Party wrote on Facebook promoting the fundraiser. There are several ticket packages available for the dinner which range from the $5,000 Donald package to the $100 dinner and dessert ticket. While Greene has become one of the most outspoken conservative voices in Congress since being elected, she's also caused divisions within the Republican Party, and was removed from the conservative House Freedom Caucus in 2023. In a previous session of Congress, she lost her committee assignments with Democrats and a few Republicans voting to remove her from various committees. Both Pennsylvania events are taking place on opposite sides of the commonwealth that feature different parts of the electorate in the Keystone State. Lehigh County, located in the Lehigh Valley north of Philadelphia, voted for Biden by just under 8 points over Trump in 2020. Washington County, situated in the southwestern region of the state, voted for Trump by 22 points over Biden in 2020.","summary":"Rep., Marjorie Taylor Greene, is slated to headline a pair of Pennsylvania GOP events in the coming weeks.

Karen Lee Cohen Walnut Creek Voters offer a check on U.S. senators Re: “Biden’s court talk is election-year politicking” (Page A6, Aug. 13). In his Letter to the Editor, Daniel Mauthe points out that Joe Biden served 36 years in the Senate while Biden has proposed Supreme Court justices only serve 18 years. Daniel then asks “Rules for thee, but not for me?” Well, yes, there are different rules for each. Per the U.S. Constitution, a senator is elected by voters every six years, while a Supreme Court justice serves for life (or until they retire). Having a choice for your senator every six years gives us a chance to vote out incompetent, corrupt or just plain crazy people. The rules for the Supreme Court do not allow this to happen. So “Rules for thee, but not for me” … true. If one would like the same rules to apply, perhaps the Supreme Court justices should be elected every six years — not that I agree with that. Bob Wheeler Walnut Creek Justices serve for life, unlike senators Re: “Biden’s court talk is election-year politicking” (Page A6, Aug. 13). Mr. Mauthe missed the point of Joe Biden suggesting term limits for the members of the Supreme Court. Once selected and confirmed they are there for life. They never face an election or even a performance review again. During Biden’s more than 50 years in politics, mostly in the U.S. Senate, he has had to be reelected every six years. There are limits imposed to his length in office as president and the voters are able to review his performance before reelecting or rejecting him. Not so with the Supreme Court. Regardless of their performance, they are there until they retire. Ruth Miller Alamo Team could bring light to Washington Re: “Harris taps Walz” (Page A1, Aug. 7). The pernicious effect of “MAGA” has become clear: Instead of becoming Great Again, the relentless drumbeat is on how bad we are: Elections are being stolen, the entire U.S. government is corrupt, and good people are being persecuted. Eventually, we will begin to feel guilty about being Americans. What we need now is a sunny-side team that is proud of being American. George Doddington Walnut Creek U.S. as a Christian nation is a bad idea There is a political move these days to declare the United States a Christian nation and to bring Christian religion into our public schools. I think these are bad ideas. Why? Though I grew up in the Methodist Church and the Methodist Youth Fellowship was very formative for me, and though my parents, rest their souls, were pillars of that church, and though many of the nation’s founders were Christians (whose sects violently disagreed), declaring the United States a Christian nation goes against our nation’s proud emphasis on freedom and denies the diversity of its current citizens. And to little purpose, there being agreement among most faiths on the important morals, generally derivable from the golden rule. Schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, etc., are great for providing support, fellowship, the comfort of community and the development of moral living, but the practice of a particular faith should be left to churches. Wallace Clark Concord ‘Pro-democracy’ crew silent on ousting Biden Irrespective of his performance as commander in chief, the decision to replace Biden was made solely by a few people, not unlike dictatorships we see around the world, and certainly not per the Constitution nor a representative democracy. Voters may wish to consider this and what it means to their futures, as they vote in the coming election.

Thirty-nine percent in the poll have a favorable impression of Walz as a person, while 30% see him unfavorably. That compares with an underwater favorable-unfavorable rating for Vance, 32%-42%. There is room to move. Sizable shares in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, have no opinion of either candidate -- 31% for Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and 26% for Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio. By another measure, 52% approve of Vice President Kamala Harris' choice of Walz, compared with 45% who approve of former President Donald Trump's selection of Vance. Forty-four percent disapprove of the Walz pick, compared with 50% disapproval for Trump's choice. Other vice-presidential candidates have been better received. While available data are spotty, approval reached 67% (among registered voters) for the selection of Jack Kemp (who ran with Bob Dole) in 1996 and was an initial 60% for John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin in 2008, although she later widely was seen as a liability for his campaign. For Harris, in 2020, 54% approved. Groups In their native Midwest, more approve of the selection of Walz than of Vance by a substantial 15 percentage points, 55% vs. 40%, and more see Walz favorably, 39% vs. 29%. That's even though Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and Republicans and GOP leaners are evenly matched in the region, with 46% in each group. Despite a dispute over Walz's characterization of his military service, his favorability rating is similar from veterans (41%) and non-veterans (39%) alike. Vance's favorability rating is 48% among veterans, and 56% of veterans approve of his selection, as do 50% for Walz (not a significant difference given the sample size). Veterans are 12 points more likely than non-veterans to be Republicans or Republican-leaning independents. Approval of the vice presidential picks breaks along expected partisan and ideological lines. Eighty-two percent of Republicans and 77% of conservatives approve of the Vance pick. For Walz, it's a rosier 92% approval among Democrats and 87% among liberals. Approval of Vance for vice president drops to 42% among independents, potential swing voters in presidential elections, compared with 49% for Walz. On favorability, Vance's rating peaks among those who voted for Trump in 2020 (75%), Republicans (68%) and conservatives (65%). It's also higher among white evangelical Protestants (59%), military veterans (48%, as noted) and rural residents (45%), all groups Trump won by double-digit margins in 2020, than among their counterparts. Walz, for his part, is seen most favorably by 2020 Biden voters (82%), Democrats (77%) and liberals (78%). He's also seen favorably by 53% of college graduates and 50% of Black people. Methodology This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel Aug. 9-13, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,336 adults.

Thirty-nine percent in the poll have a favorable impression of Walz as a person, while 30% see him unfavorably. That compares with an underwater favorable-unfavorable rating for Vance, 32%-42%. There is room to move. Sizable shares in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, have no opinion of either candidate -- 31% for Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and 26% for Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio. By another measure, 52% approve of Vice President Kamala Harris' choice of Walz, compared with 45% who approve of former President Donald Trump's selection of Vance. Forty-four percent disapprove of the Walz pick, compared with 50% disapproval for Trump's choice. Other vice-presidential candidates have been better received. While available data are spotty, approval reached 67% (among registered voters) for the selection of Jack Kemp (who ran with Bob Dole) in 1996 and was an initial 60% for John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin in 2008, although she later widely was seen as a liability for his campaign. For Harris, in 2020, 54% approved. Groups In their native Midwest, more approve of the selection of Walz than of Vance by a substantial 15 percentage points, 55% vs. 40%, and more see Walz favorably, 39% vs. 29%. That's even though Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents and Republicans and GOP leaners are evenly matched in the region, with 46% in each group. Despite a dispute over Walz's characterization of his military service, his favorability rating is similar from veterans (41%) and non-veterans (39%) alike. Vance's favorability rating is 48% among veterans, and 56% of veterans approve of his selection, as do 50% for Walz (not a significant difference given the sample size). Veterans are 12 points more likely than non-veterans to be Republicans or Republican-leaning independents. Approval of the vice presidential picks breaks along expected partisan and ideological lines. Eighty-two percent of Republicans and 77% of conservatives approve of the Vance pick. For Walz, it's a rosier 92% approval among Democrats and 87% among liberals. Approval of Vance for vice president drops to 42% among independents, potential swing voters in presidential elections, compared with 49% for Walz. On favorability, Vance's rating peaks among those who voted for Trump in 2020 (75%), Republicans (68%) and conservatives (65%). It's also higher among white evangelical Protestants (59%), military veterans (48%, as noted) and rural residents (45%), all groups Trump won by double-digit margins in 2020, than among their counterparts. Walz, for his part, is seen most favorably by 2020 Biden voters (82%), Democrats (77%) and liberals (78%). He's also seen favorably by 53% of college graduates and 50% of Black people.

On Wednesday, August 14, in Asheville, North Carolina, the Republican leader was left exposed yet again after another security lapse by the Secret Service. The incident was brought to attention online by journalist Susan Crabtree of RealClearPolitics, who revealed that a female agent had left her post at the campaign rally \"to breastfeed with no permission/warning to the event site agent (the person in charge of the entire event's security).\" \"Shortly before Trump's motorcade arrival -- I'm told five minutes beforehand -- the site agent was getting ready for the arrival. The site agent went to do one final sweep of the walking route and found the agent breast-feeding her child in a room that is supposed to be set aside for important Secret Service official work, i.e. a potential emergency related to the president,\" Crabtree shared in a lengthy post on X (formerly Twitter). She explained that three separate sources in the Secret Service community had informed her of the breach. The journalist noted that family members of the Secret Service agents are not allowed during duty hours. \"A working agent on duty cannot bring a child to a protective assignment. The woman was out of the Atlanta Field Office. The woman agent was in the room with two other family members. The agent and her family members bypassed the Uniformed Division checkpoint and were escorted by an unpinned event staff into the room to breastfeed, the sources said. Unpinned means they have not been cleared by the Secret Service to be there.\" In an exclusive statement to Newsweek, Secret Service's chief of communications, Anthony Guglielmi, assured, \"All employees of the U.S. Secret Service are held to the highest standards. While there was no impact to the North Carolina event, the specifics of this incident are being examined. Given this is a personnel matter, we are not in a position to comment further.\" After security lapses allowed the Butler sniper to come close enough to fire at Trump, the agency is already under intense scrutiny. Kimberly Cheatle, the agency's director, resigned from her role after several investigations into the incident were opened. Director Ronald Rowe took her place after the Congress hearing. According to Fox News, employees of the Secret Service, both past and present, have expressed displeasure over the agency's chronic understaffing despite a $3 billion budget increase. USSS leaders are being questioned on their management of team morale, their ability to attract and retain talent, and their shortcomings on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Before the July rally, reports claimed that the GOP nominee had been turned down several times for additional security manpower from the agency.","summary":"A female agent from the Atlanta Field Office allegedly left her post at the Trump campaign rally, to breastfeed.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/secret-service-for-donald-trump-makes-another-concerning-security-breach-in-protecting-him","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/711024/uploads/14322c70-5bb7-11ef-b9a3-89341dfd882d_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":254293020,"title":"Poll: Majority of Voters Say Media Are Shilling for Kamala Harris","text":"A majority of voters think news reporters are trying to help far-left Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris into the White House over former President Donald Trump, a new Rasmussen Reports poll found.

Roughly a quarter (26 percent) believe most reporters will offer unbiased coverage, and 10 percent say they are unsure, the survey found. “Looking ahead at the campaign, 66 percent of Republicans, 34 percent of Democrats, and 50 percent of unaffiliated voters expect most reporters to try to help Harris,” according to the poll report. “Thirty-eight percent (38 percent) of Democrats say most reporters will offer unbiased coverage instead, but only 14 percent of Republicans and 26 percent of unaffiliated voters agree.” The survey found that 60 percent of respondents believe most reporters try to help their preferred candidate when covering political campaigns, up from 51 percent during the 2020 election cycle. Nearly three in ten (28 percent) disagree and say most reporters are unbiased, and 12 percent are unsure. Democrats (44 percent) are more likely than Republicans (16 percent) and unaffiliated voters (23 percent) to say reporters try to offer unbiased campaign coverage.

The charges relate to a short exchange in which Trump told Musk, “I look at what you do. You walk in and say, ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike. I won’t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK. You’re all gone.’” Musk’s response was a simple “Yeah,” but that was enough for the union to file federal labor charges against the pair. “Employers need to be held accountable in this country when they break the law,” UAW President Shawn Fain told CBS. “It is a federal right of workers to go on strike. They cannot be fired for that.” Fain carries considerable political clout in the Wolverine State, which is home to 134,000 UAW members and 300,000 auto workers — and he’s more outspoken than ever in his opposition to Trump. It’s difficult to discern how individual UAW members will vote in November, but both Trump and Harris are courting this politically divided demographic in Michigan, a must-win midwestern state. One UAW member told CNN in June he estimates about 40% of the union’s members support Trump. Still, the powerhouse auto union’s top brass has stood fiercely opposed to Trump and his candidacy, drawing the ire of the former president, who has called for the Fain to be canned. ​​”The leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately, and every single auto worker, union and non-union, should be voting for Donald Trump,” Trump told the Republican National Committee audience last month. Trump and the GOP have sought to win over union members this election cycle and scored a major point in their column with the appearance of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien at the RNC. Last month, in a good sign for Trump and his party, O’Brien implied his union could work with Republicans.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., issued a note to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Friday concerning information on the Chinese groups and persons who engaged with Walz on these trips. Along with that, pertinent documents and comms between the democratic candidate’s office, along with any FBI ties, have been requested. According to The Hill, it is unknown whether the FBI had any communication with Walz over these matters. The outlet reported that Walz taught high school in China for one year back in 1989; later, as a high school teacher, along with his wife, Gwen, in Nebraska and Minnesota, the two held field trips to China. The New York Times further noted that Walz visited China over 30 times. National File has reported extensively on Walz’s engagements with China and the CCP, including his delegations through the globalist NGO Global Minnesota, which sponsored at least one of his trips. Comer’s letter asks the FBI if they provided any standard defensive briefs to Walz, whereby informing politicos if they are being targeted or influenced by the CCP. Comer also wishes to flag any of Walz’s contacts within the Chinese government, including any other entities. Walz criticized the Chinese government, although he met with Consul General Zhao Jian as early as March 2024, as indicated in the post below on X.

So far, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have tip-toed around the politically fraught topic, with each promising not to cut benefits. That position is popular across the political spectrum but doesn’t address the program’s looming financial shortfall. Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have recently introduced multiple bills that would fix part of the solvency issue by expanding the payroll tax to high earners. Congressional Republicans have criticized that plan while offering few specific alternatives. “Will [Republicans] go behind closed doors and have a package that has some cuts? Or will they do it out in the open and do what the Democrats want to do? I think that’s what’s really at stake,” said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a progressive advocacy group in favor of expanding the system. Here’s what each party has put forward on Social Security recently. What Democrats have called for Lift the payroll tax cap Democrats want to address the Social Security shortfall by extending the payroll tax to those with higher incomes. The Social Security 2100 Act, sponsored by Representative John Larson, D-Conn., would subject income above $400,000 to Social Security payroll taxes — the program’s main funding source. Today, the 6.2% tax only applies up to $168,600. The proposal mirrors the Biden-Harris administration’s plan, which called for extending solvency “by asking the highest-income Americans to pay their fair share.” A 2022 poll of registered voters suggests lifting the payroll cap to include higher wages would have broad support, with 79% of Republicans and 88% of Democrats in favor. Critics of the plan, like Brian Riedl at the conservative Manhattan Institute, point out that uncapping the payroll tax would still result in a deficit after just five years. He said the plan would “dramatically raise taxes not just on the rich but also the upper middle class.” Other Democratic-backed legislation introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., sets the income threshold lower, imposing the payroll tax on earnings above $250,000. As a senator, Harris co-sponsored that legislation. Boost in benefits and changes to the COLA formula Larson’s bill, which has the support of most House Democrats, would increase benefits by 2% across the board for all Social Security beneficiaries. It would also boost benefits specifically for lower-income seniors, as well as widows and widowers. If passed, the plan would tweak how the government calculates the annual cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) to ensure the formula accounts for the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers (CPI-E). That index weighs health care costs more heavily, which could mean higher annual bumps for retirees. To pay for those changes, the legislation would extend the payroll tax to include incomes above $400,000 and add an additional 12.4% net investment income tax (NIIT) for taxpayers making over $400,000. Eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security Earlier this year, Representative Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced a bill to eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors. Today, individuals who earn above $25,000 pay income tax on up to 50% of their Social Security retirement benefits. For seniors who earn above $34,000, an additional 35% of benefits are taxable. Nine states also collect taxes on Social Security. Like other proposals, the legislation addresses revenue concerns by extending the payroll tax, in this case to incomes above $250,000. So far, none of the bills have gained much traction in Congress. What Republicans have called for Republicans have been less upfront about their vision for Social Security but insist they won’t cut benefits for seniors. On the campaign trail, Trump has vowed not to slash benefits or raise the retirement age. The official Republican Party Platform adopted at the Republican National Convention echoed those promises. Trump has also called for an end to federal taxes on Social Security benefits but hasn’t explained how he would address the subsequent revenue shortfall. “There’s some ideas floating out there, but not something actually being introduced into Congress,” Richard Johnson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said of the GOP’s approach to Social Security. For now, the most comprehensive GOP plan comes from the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) 2025 budget proposal. The RSC, which comprises nearly 80% of all House Republicans, proposed raising the retirement age for those not near retirement “to account for increases in life expectancy.” The plan would also “limit and phase out auxiliary benefits for high income earners” who are not near retirement. In the proposal, Republican lawmakers blasted the “reckless spending policies” of President Biden and Congressional Democrats, arguing that their political opponents would accelerate Social Security benefits cuts for seniors. The GOP lawmakers said the Democrats’ payroll tax plan would eliminate job opportunities in the U.S. and “fail to make Social Security solvent.” Instead, the RSC said its budget would address concerns by increasing payroll tax revenues through “pro-growth tax reform” and “pro-growth energy policy that lifts wages” as well as “regulatory reforms that increase economic growth.” “We will not now or ever support cutting or delaying retirement benefits for any senior in or near retirement,” the RSC said. The RSC called on President Biden to “stop the political gamesmanship” and asked him to start “engaging with Republicans on sensible reforms.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n( ) — Social Security recipients will see their benefits cut in roughly&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What is the Democrats&#8217; and Republicans&#8217; stance on Social Security? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/what-is-the-democrats-and-republicans-stance-on-social-security/","image":"https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/07/66a71520716965.89471794.jpeg?w=900","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:05:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":254291900,"title":"RFK Jr. Refutes Report That He Approached Harris for a Cabinet Position","text":"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. refuted a Washington Post report from earlier this week that said he would drop out of the race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in exchange for a cabinet position if she wins in November. During an Aug. 15 Latino Town Hall on TikTok, he told the moderators that the story is “fake news.” “I didn’t ask for a cabinet position,” Kennedy said. “I want to meet with all candidates about dampening down the rhetoric and unifying our country.” Kennedy said candidates, including former President Donald Trump and Libertarian presidential nominee Chase Oliver, have met with him. “Kamala Harris said she doesn’t want to [meet],” he said. Kennedy has repeatedly said at campaign stops and in interviews with media outlets and on podcasts that he would always welcome conversations with opposing candidates, media outlets, and podcasters who do not share his views. He told The Epoch Times that many Democrats and Republicans acknowledge the division in America but then get mad “if you meet with Trump or Kamala Harris.” He said he is “willing to take the heat by working to build a bridge between both sides.” Kennedy, who is attempting to get on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, met with Trump last month in Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention. The Washington Post reported that Kennedy discussed dropping out of the race to back the former president and join his administration if he returns to the White House. The purpose of meeting with President Trump was to talk about the chronic disease epidemic and children’s health, Kennedy said. He denied that he would end his presidential bid and support the former president. Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed concern that Kennedy could take away votes from their respective presidential candidates. Earlier this year, the DNC hired Lis Smith, a veteran Democrat strategist who managed Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, to spearhead an aggressive communication plan to combat Kennedy, independent Cornel West, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. In recent months, the DNC and Clear Choice, a super PAC aligned with Biden to counter third-party presidential candidates, have objected to Kennedy’s appearance on the ballot, making legal filings in multiple states. Last week, a New York State Supreme Court judge ruled that Kennedy falsely listed that he was a New York resident on his nominating petitions. As a result, he was removed from the state’s general election ballot, a decision Kennedy has appealed. The DNC has called Kennedy a “stalking horse” to “prop up” Trump. Kennedy, meanwhile, has accused the DNC of trying to win the election in courtrooms and keep voters from having another choice. Regarding the report that Kennedy sought a meeting with Harris, Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesman.said, “No one has any intention of negotiating with a MAGA-funded fringe candidate who has sought out a job with Donald Trump in exchange for an endorsement.” David Carlucci, a former Democratic New York state senator who is now a Democratic strategist, told The Epoch Times that Kennedy’s attempt to reach out to Harris “speaks to the issue that many voters already know: Kamala Harris will be elected as our next president.” Kennedy’s actions during his campaign have “repeatedly shown that his judgment is not suitable for the presidency or any other leadership role in government,” he said. Stefanie Spear, Kennedy’s press secretary, told The Epoch Times in a statement that “Mr. Kennedy is willing to meet with leaders of both parties to discuss the possibility of a unity government” and has done so since he entered the presidential race.","summary":"The independent candidate, however, says he would always welcome conversations with opposing candidates.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/rfk-jr-refutes-report-that-he-approached-harris-for-a-cabinet-position-5707256","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/07/id5701326-RFK-JR-5_JF_06122024-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 23:03:35","author":"Jeff Louderback","authors":["Jeff Louderback"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":254291782,"title":"Nigel Farage paid almost £98,000 a month to present GB News","text":"Clacton MP Nigel Farage is paid almost £98,000 a month to be a presenter on GB News, his register of interests has revealed.

The California State Council on Developmental Disabilities estimated 615,252 Californians met the federal definition of a developmental disability that impacts their ability to live independently. In a perfect world, these unfortunate individuals would be sheltered and cared for by their families. But what happens if they don’t have supportive families? California relies on a network of private group homes to provide rooms and medical care for the mentally disabled. The living conditions in these homes are often appalling due to a lack of governmental oversight. So where do these neglected individuals go? They wander the streets and land in encampments. California needs a realistic and robust plan for sheltering and carrying for the disabled. It’s a tall order, and one our politicians have been both unable and unwilling to tackle.

My best friend worked at Agnews Developmental Center, so I knew how important it was for the mental health of its residents. As soon as I heard it was being closed down, I knew that the current situation with mentally ill homeless people would start developing.

So now we are giving free vacations to members of the San Jose City Council (two of them will be leaving their office this year) as well as the city manager, city clerk and a substitute for the mayor. What a blatant example of the “cluelessness” that exists among our elected officials and in high-level city positions. We read daily about the crises that exist: homelessness, affordable housing, support for residents (as well as the homeless) affected by addiction and mental health issues. The choice to spend “taxpayer-funded district office money” for these trips is insulting to all residents. We are waiting for effective solutions to the many serious issues our city faces. The need to travel to our sister city is not one of them. Send one person and anyone else can pay their own way. Maybe the Irish can teach them some lessons in frugality. Judy Barbeau San Jose Christians’ support for Trump is confusing I’m old — 79 — and there have been many changes in my lifetime, so there are lots of things I don’t really understand, like the latest technology and especially what happened to evangelical Christians. Although I do not regularly attend church, I have always tried to live by Christian values, which I understood to be: humility, kindness, honesty, integrity, love, honoring women, generosity and forgiveness So, I just don’t understand how so many Christians can support the current Republican candidate for president. I am honestly perplexed. Don Eggleston Aptos GOP works for power, not the good of nation The Republican Party policy of saying no to everything (other than cutting taxes on the very rich and corporations, thus running up the national debt) is not only demonstrating their lack of governing ability but is seriously damaging to the future of our country. From opposing Obamacare — which was a near copy of Romney care they enthusiastically supported — to recently following Donald Trump’s wish to block the passing of their own declared border policies while saying Democrats won’t act is disingenuous. And now after opposing Biden’s reelection for being old and enfeebled, they decry as anti-democratic him choosing not to run again. It’s a sad thing for our country that, like when the Republicans admitted wishing for a failed presidency for Barack Obama, the GOP is reduced to acting only in its own interests rather than for the good of the whole country. Fred Geiger Santa Cruz Copying Trump policy is no answer for Harris Most experts believe implementing this idea would be difficult(cq comment=” or impossible” ]. Certainly, many voters don’t even get tips as part of their jobs and don’t care about it anyway. Harris needs to draw a line and not imitate her opponents if she wants to win the election. So far, both candidates have drifted away from the nitty-gritty issues to play trivial pursuit too often.

The whole force behind the modern MAGA GOP is deeply weird, and is reflected in everything from Vance’s and Trump’s misogyny to their authoritarian ideals, Thankfully, the majority of American voters don’t share their worldview—and the more voters get to know Vance, the more they dislike him.

The Democratic nominee's plan includes tax cuts, a federal ban on price gouging by food producers and offering down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers who qualify. As the Associated Press (AP) reported, the policies are largely built off the Biden administration's priorities.\"As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food,\" Harris told supporters Friday. \"We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed. But our supply chains have improved and prices are still too high.\"Cuban, a frequent critic of former President Donald Trump, shared his two cents on Harris' proposals to X, formerly Twitter, including addressing criticism that the vice president has received for promising to go after price gouging as a way to tackle inflation. Trump has called the plans similar to \"Maduro-esque price controls,\" comparing the plan to the Venezuelan leader's policies that crippled the country's economy.Bloomberg columnist Matthew Yglesias wrote to X on Friday, \"I'm pretty sure Harris did not in fact propose price controls on groceries—just kind of vaguely said that antitrust enforcement is good (it is good).\"Cuban responded to Yglesias' post, \"This is a fact.\"\"Did you also notice that she said that the 25k credit only applies to NEW homes? Did I hear that right?\" he wrote in a separate response to Yglesias.Cuban posted another statement a few minutes later praising Harris' plans to bring down health care and drug costs, writing, \"And my favorite of course, did anyone else hear @VP say she was going to bring TRANSPARENCY to pharmacy and healthcare middlemen? The root cause of almost all that is wrong with healthcare pricing?\"According to AP's report, Harris' price gouging attacks include instructing the Federal Trade Commission to penalize any \"big corporations\" that engage in price spikes. But economists previously told Newsweek that the plan could backfire, and likely does not address the root problems of inflation.\"The idea of a political solution to an economic non-problem is flawed,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., during an interview with Newsweek. \"There's very little evidence that corporate greed or price gouging is responsible for high grocery or housing prices.\"\"Preventing price increases sounds good, but what do investors and farmers do when they can't guarantee a return on investment or cover their costs?\" Lincicome added. \"They cut back on investment, leading to reduced supply and even higher prices or outright shortages.\"Harris also attacked Trump's economic proposals during her rally on Friday, including critiquing the GOP candidate's calls for increased tariffs on imports.The vice president said that Trump \"wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.\"\"It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs,\" Harris added, per AP's report. \"A Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.\"Cuban also praised Harris as a \"pro-business candidate\" during his string of posts to X.Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign via email for comment on Friday evening.","summary":"Harris unveiled several policy proposals at a North Carolina rally on Friday that aim to bring down the cost of essential goods.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/mark-cuban-posts-flurry-responses-kamala-harris-economic-plan-1940604","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2451998/cuban-posts-flurry-responses-harriseconomicplan.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:59:48","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.636},{"id":254291880,"title":"Melania Trump’s six-figure top income sources revealed","text":"Former First Lady Melania Trump’s income sources were revealed in her husband Donald Trump’s latest financial disclosure (Picture: Getty Images) Former First Lady Melania Trump’s biggest sources of income, at six figures apiece, have been revealed in her husband Donald Trump’s latest financial disclosure.

In today’s edition, “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker looks at the big question Vice President Kamala Harris will seek to answer at the Democratic National Convention next week. Plus, national politics reporter Bridget Bowman explores how the race for control of the House has changed with Harris at the top of the ticket. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. The big question Harris still hasn’t answered: What’s her vision for the country? By Kristen Welker Kamala Harris ran for president in 2020. She’s the current vice president of the United States. And she’s set to accept the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination next week. And yet, there are still major questions about her vision for the future of the country. What is her goal beyond defeating Donald Trump? That is a part of the backdrop as Harris prepares for her address at the Democratic National Convention, which is now just days away. Among the questions voters may want her to answer when they hear from her next Thursday: Would her presidency be a continuation of President Joe Biden’s policies and programs? Where does she disagree with Biden?Where do her allegiances lie in the Democrats’ progressive-vs.-establishment fight?What would be her top priority if Democrats win full control of Congress?Where would she compromise with Republicans?How would she wield power?And how does she handle defeat and victory? (Unlike past modern presidential nominees, she’s never won a presidential primary or caucus.) Nearly four weeks into her ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, we don’t have an answer to any of those questions. Yes, she’s outlined her position on the Israel-Hamas war (she’s committed to Israel’s right to exist and defend itself, but will speak up about Palestinian suffering). Yes, she’d sign that bipartisan border deal into law. And, yes, she announced economic proposals during a speech in North Carolina today like a federal ban on corporate price-gouging in the food and grocery industries and a $6,000 child tax credit. But on those big questions — that “vision thing” that former President George H.W. Bush talked about — we still don’t have an answer. There’s nothing equivalent yet from Harris like Barack Obama’s “hope” and “change,” or Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again.” What’s Harris’ bumper-sticker-sized vision for the country? (The campaign did debut “A New Way Forward” message on Friday.) That’s her challenge heading into next week and what will be the biggest speech of her political career so far. NBC News’ Sahil Kapur has more from Harris’ speech today, where she outlined her plans to tackle food, housing, medicine and child care costs. ‘A roller coaster’: Harris’ sudden rise resets a tight battle for the House By Bridget Bowman Harris’ ascension to the top of the ticket has reset the battle for the House, with Democrats feeling hopeful they can ride a new wave of energy to the majority and Republicans tempering their dreams of dramatically expanding the playing field. Biden’s exit from the presidential race, both parties are bracing for an even tougher fight centered on a small group of competitive districts, as Democrats need to net just four seats to take control of the House. The president had been struggling in key battlegrounds even before his disastrous June debate performance, and he recently acknowledged to CBS News that his potential down-ballot drag contributed to his decision to drop out. That drag had given some House Republicans confidence that they would not only hang on to their narrow majority, but push deeper into Democratic territory this fall. Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said at a Politico event at the Republican National Convention last month that the party was eyeing districts Biden won by double digits in 2020, noting, “I think we can expand the map.” Now, Hudson told NBC News in an interview this week, “I do think we’re in a different reality where the environment has tightened some,” acknowledging internal polling has shown the Democratic base consolidating around Harris. Hudson, who described this election cycle as “a roller coaster,” was still confident that Republicans will keep their majority and pick up seats. He argued that voters will pin concerns about the cost of living and immigration on the Biden administration, and that Harris’ past liberal positions will turn off swing voters. Among Democrats, however, there is palpable optimism among candidates and strategists about winning back House control. It’s a marked shift from just a few weeks ago, when vulnerable party lawmakers were dodging reporters at the Capitol to avoid questions about Biden. When Biden was in the race, Democrats still saw a path to the majority, noting that their candidates often performed better than him in the polls. But now, there is less pressure to outrun the top of the ticket with a more popular presidential nominee. “We were in a strong position,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Suzan DelBene of Washington told NBC News this week. “We’re in a stronger position now.” That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

Harris said at a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina: There’s a serious housing shortage in many places. It’s too difficult to build and it’s driving prices up. As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing. We need both to rent and to buy. We will take down barriers and cut red tape including at the state and local levels. And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class. Harris did not explain how those new homes were to be built in a high-interest-rate environment. She also did not explain whether she meant 3 million units in addition to those that would already have been built, or three million units total. Nearly 1.5 million homes were built in the U.S. in 2023, so 3 million over four years would actually mean construction had slowed down by 50%. Presumably, she meant 3 million additional homes — 750,000 extra per year. That would match or exceed the pace of the peak housing boom of the post-World War II period. But Harris has a track record against which to measure her promise, and it is the failure of the Biden-Harris administration to build the electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that it promised to build under the infrastructure bill of 2021. at a cost of $7.5 billion. The goal was 500,000; two-and-a-half years later, as of May 2024, only eight EV stations had been built. The situation is even worse when it comes to the Biden-Harris administration’s promise to build new broadband Internet connections.

That's up 6 percent from February when 81 percent of voters said that.Most voters blamed the Biden administration's \"lack of enforcement\" for the situation, with 71 percent placing a great deal or some blame on the current administration. However, a clear majority also holds former President Trump's administration and Senate Republicans responsible, with at least 57 percent assigning a great deal or some.The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.On Friday's episode of Mornings with Maria, Bartiromo recited the poll's findings and then asked Burlison, \"What do you say to these polls that also blame you and the Republicans for blocking legislation, obviously referring to that Senate deal.\"Burlison referred to the $118 billion bipartisan border bill earlier this year as \"just painting a whitewash over the problem, it wasn't really fixing the problem, it was just going to absolve the first 5,000 immigrants that were going to come across the border.\"Several lawmakers have refuted this claim, such as Republican Senator James Lankford who wrote in a social media post at the time, \"The emergency authority is not designed to let 5,000 people in, it is designed to close the border and turn 5,000 people around.\"The bill sought to establish tougher migration rules, fund an increase in ICE detention capacity, fast-track asylum cases but have stricter requirements, and provide funding to hire more Border Patrol agents, among other initiatives.Newsweek reached out to Burlison's press secretary for comment via email on Friday evening.Burlison continued by sharing anecdotal stories about criminal activity and fentanyl poisoning related to border crossings during the Biden administration but didn't directly answer the question.Bartiromo further pressed him again, saying, \"Right, but what I'm asking you, is what do you say to these polls that say voters also blame you and your colleagues?\"\"I'll say it again, the bill that we were faced with was only going to ignore... the numbers, you don't fix a situation by erasing the first few data entries,\" he replied.Immigration and border security are expected to play a big role in the upcoming presidential, Senate, and House elections this November. The Fox News poll found immigration to be tied in second place with abortion, at 14 percent, as the most important issue to voters this election. The survey found that 38 percent of voters found the economy as the most important issue.","summary":"Fox News Host Maria Bartiromo pressed Republican Representative Eric Burlison on new polling data on the border situation.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-host-confronts-republican-poll-showing-voters-blame-gop-border-1940577","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2451961/representative-eric-burlison.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:42:54","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":254291144,"title":"Ex-Obama Economic Adviser Casts Doubt on Kamala Harris Plan","text":"A former economic adviser to ex-President Barack Obama has expressed doubts pertaining to Vice President Kamala Harris' plan to combat rising grocery costs by banning \"corporate price gouging.\"Harris announced a series of economic policy proposals this week, including a plan for the \"first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries,\" arguing that \"the excessive prices that Americans have seen in the food and grocery industry\" are \"unrelated to the costs of doing business.\"Jason Furman, former Obama administration official currently serving as a Harvard University economics professor, told The New York Times on Friday that rising prices had more to do with supply and demand, and expressed concerns that limiting the ability to raise prices could hurt the economy by dissuading new companies from entering the marketplace.\"This is not sensible policy, and I think the biggest hope is that it ends up being a lot of rhetoric and no reality,\" Furman said. \"There's no upside here, and there is some downside.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Harris campaign via email on Friday.Prices for groceries and other consumer items soared as the U.S. economy adjusted to supply and demand issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a 9.1 percent inflation rate in June 2022, the highest in decades. Similar increases were seen around the world.Inflation, however, has recently been decreasing. The U.S. Labor Department announced on Wednesday that the year-over-year rate stood at 2.9 percent in July, the lowest since March 2021.While Furman and other economists who previously spoke to Newsweek argued that the Harris price gouging plan has major flaws, opinions on the matter are not unified, with some instead offering praise.University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor Isabella Weber told The New York Times that companies were following competitors by raising prices during the pandemic, which in some cases allowed them to increase their profits.She warned that the practice may continue even without similar pandemic-era economic conditions.\"If the worst of times for ordinary people ends up being the best of times for corporations ... Some sort of basic social contract is kind of crumpling,\" Weber said, while praising Harris for the price gouging proposal.Other proposals in the Harris plan include $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, tax credits for developers who build affordable rental units and starter homes, expanded earned income tax credit, expanded child tax credits and stopping \"predatory\" investors from colluding to raise rent prices.Harris and former President Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, have expressed support for eliminating taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers, a proposal that economists and tax experts also expressed doubts about in previous comments to Newsweek.","summary":"Harris has vowed to enact the \"first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ex-obama-economic-adviser-casts-doubt-kamala-harris-plan-1940566","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2451982/kamala-harris-economy-price-gouging-plan-criticism.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:41:04","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":254291510,"title":"Plane carrying JD Vance forced to land unexpectedly in Milwaukee","text":"Sen.

Key Background Trump campaign planes have experienced at least three issues this year. The plane carrying Trump last week was bound for Bozeman, Montana, before it was diverted to Billings over the mechanical issue. The former president landed about 140 miles east of his initial destination and used a private jet to finish his trip to Bozeman ahead of a rally there. Trump’s plane, a Boeing 757, also clipped a parked plane while taxiing at a Florida airport earlier this year though it was unclear whether Trump was aboard the plane during the mishap.

Less than one month ago, President Joe Biden announced that he was exiting the presidential race. Almost at once, Vice President Kamala Harris became the heir apparent to the party nomination. Just over two weeks later, she became the official nominee; the next day, she named Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. This timeline means that the typical flow of a first-time nominee’s presidential campaign has been scrambled. But after a summer full of surprises and switch-ups, Harris will take the expected step of a Democratic nominee: appearing at the Democratic National Convention. The convention, which has had varying degrees of significance in recent presidential races, could be of particular consequence this time around. Here are three key things to keep in mind as you follow the news next week. This convention will be light on procedurals, and will focus on refining the political message of a relatively new campaign. Major-party conventions usually serve some bureaucratic purposes: Delegates vote to confirm the party’s nominee, and candidates sometimes announce their running mate (as Donald Trump did during his party’s convention last month). All of this has already happened for the Democrats—Harris was nominated in a virtual roll call, an unusual process for the party, in early August, and she picked Walz soon after. Those following along at home aren’t paying much attention to the procedures, though—they’re watching for the speeches and political narratives. Conventions serve to unite a political party around a coherent story. The party strategizes about which guests, and what message, will both speak to undecided Americans and excite the base. Family members of the candidates will attempt to humanize them and help them appear relatable. The full lineup of speakers has not yet been released, but President Biden is expected to play a role. Rumors and speculation about which celebrities may appear have also been swirling. Harris will be looking to reintroduce herself to the American public. Despite her name recognition, many people lack a clear sense of who Harris is and what she stands for. As my colleague Elaina Plott Calabro, who has profiled Harris, wrote last month, “After years of struggling to find her political voice, Harris seems to have finally taken command of her own story.” Harris once seemed ambivalent, even apologetic, about her image as a prosecutor, but now she seems to be starting to own that part of her past, using it as a point of contrast with Trump’s status as a felon. Harris lacked the testing ground of a contested primary—she is the first nonincumbent to win a major-party nomination without a primary race since 1968—which means she didn’t have the opportunity to sharpen her messaging before the general election. As my colleague Ronald Brownstein wrote recently, her relatively undefined image “gives Harris a chance to benefit more than usual from the Democratic gathering in Chicago … if she can flesh out her story in an engaging way.” Conventions in recent cycles haven’t led to drastic movement in polls. But as Ronald notes, the convention has been a game changer on at least one occasion in the past: Bill Clinton’s 1992 convention speech helped turn around voters’ perceptions that he was elitist, in part by emphasizing his modest roots; he saw a remarkable 16-point post-DNC jump in the polls. Experts told Ronald that Harris is unlikely to see a poll bump of more than a few points, but, he wrote, “she might be able to reach the upper end of the convention bump still available in this polarized time.” Harris’s campaign is also hoping to reach more viewers than is average for a convention by streaming it on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. The convention could help clarify the role of policy conversations in this election. Harris’s campaign has been criticized for its lack of substantive policy discussion so far. This afternoon, she presented her most robust proposals yet: In a speech in Raleigh, North Carolina, she laid out plans for combatting the high cost of living for Americans, which included tax cuts for new parents, a federal ban on price gouging, 3 million new housing units during her time in office, and $25,000 in downpayment support for first-time homeowners for the next four years. More details on her platform, economic and beyond, are expected at the convention and in the coming weeks. Given how far along we are in the race, voters may be more focused on the big picture and the themes of the campaign than on the kinds of details that may come up during a primary. In some ways, Harris’s shortened runway makes things easier for her: As my colleague David Graham wrote in a recent article about the unknowns around Harris and her politics, “If Democrats believe Harris can beat Trump, they may not care about much else, at least for now.” Related: Here are three new stories from The Atlantic: Today’s News Dispatches Explore all of our newsletters here.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) is running on it. But one of Vance's U.S. Senate colleagues is calling him out for failing to actually get it enacted when he had the chance. According to Semafor reporter Joseph Zeballos-Roig, an \"arms race\" is now underway between the two candidates in regard to the child tax credit. During her economic speech in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday, Harris proposed a $6,000 tax credit for parents of newborns, and making the enhanced child tax credit President Joe Biden approved during the Covid-19 pandemic permanent. That pandemic-era expansion raised the tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 per child, and included 17 year-olds in the covered group. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, that expanded child tax credit kept an estimated 500,000 children out of poverty across the country. Senate Republicans – with the help of Sen. Joe Manchin (I-West Virginia), who was a Democrat at the time — blocked a previous effort to prolong the higher child tax credit. READ MORE: 'Hurt the Republican ticket': Conservative mom of 6 admits Dems are better on family policy Vance, in the meantime, called for a child tax credit of $5,000 per child in a recent CBS interview, though he didn't make clear what age groups or income brackets would be included in that higher amount. \"I'd like to have a broad based family policy and a broad based Child Tax Credit,\" Vance said. \"Again, we've talked about doing this for a long time. President Trump has been on the record for a long time supporting a bigger child tax credit, and I think you want it to apply to all American families.\" However, Ohio's junior U.S. senator was notably absent when he had the chance to transform his campaign proposal into concrete legislation, as he was campaigning for Trump on the southern border. In a Friday tweet, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) reminded his followers that \"JD Vance was a no-show on the vote for my bill to expand the child tax credit when it was on the senate floor two weeks ago.\" \"My bill failed after Republicans blocked it, leaving 16 million kids worse off,\" Wyden tweeted. READ MORE: JD Vance suggested America should 'punish' people for not having children \"There’s always a lot of talk among Republicans about supporting families, competing with China, and cracking down on fraud in government programs, but they just rejected a bill that would accomplish all of that in one package,\" Wyden told the AP after the bill was shot down. While the election is still nearly three months away, one op-ed suggests Republicans are taking Democrats' policies seriously when it comes to their own families. In an essay for Newsweek, Bethany Mandel — a former Heritage Foundation writer — wrote that as a mother of six children, she's noticed that Democrats are so far the better party for parents. She specifically cited the example of Vance skipping out on the vote to expand the child tax credit. \"Just last week, Senate Republicans blocked an effort to expand child tax credits, especially those targeted at low-income Americans. [JD] Vance, a United States Senator who could have voted for child tax credits now, skipped the vote, as did a half dozen other Republican senators,\" she wrote. \"I'm not one to give credit to the Democratic Party on anything, but credit where credit is due,\" she added. \"And it's going to hurt the Republican ticket, especially when it tries to paint itself as pro-family.\" READ MORE: 'Didn't care about us': Company JD Vance bankrolled known for 'nightmare' work environment","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is now proposing an expansion of the child tax credit as both he and Vice President Kamala Harris roll out their respective policy platforms, and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen.

Earlier in August, a Microsoft threat-intelligence report said the Iranian network Storm-2035, comprising four websites masquerading as news outlets, was actively engaging US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. The engagement was being built with “polarizing messaging on issues such as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict”, the report stated. The Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are locked in a tight race, ahead of the presidential election on 5 November.

They also list numerous trademarks that he holds.One company, under the registered owner name of DTTM Operations, has trademarked \"TRUMP\" for a variety of clothing items including lingerie, shower caps and white sackcloth robes for priests and pastors.Other trademarks for the Trump name in China are for purposes that include \"health spa services,\" \"children's clothing,\" \"computerized file management\" and the \"rental of drinking water dispensers.\"Five Chinese trademarks for products and services including restaurants and constriction projects were also filed in his daughter Ivanka Trump's name.In January, Trump admitted that at least four of his businesses earned $5.5 million from China during his first two years in office as president. A Democratic report accused him of violating the U.S. Constitution's foreign emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting money or gifts from foreign governments without the permission of Congress.At a Fox News town hall, Trump defended himself: \"If I have a hotel and somebody comes in from China, that's a small amount of money.

That economic thinking embraces the idea that the federal government must act aggressively to foster competition and correct distortions in private markets. The approach seeks large tax increases on corporations and high earners, to fund assistance for low-income and middle-class workers who are struggling to build wealth for themselves and their children.

Will it help with young voters?","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris struck a decidedly populist tone when she unveiled her economic policy in Raleigh, North Carolina on Friday. The vice president made housing the core part of her policy rollout, pledging to build three million new homes. As part of that, she has proposed a tax incentive to build starter homes. This comes as nearly 1 in 10 homes are now worth more than $1 million, which is a record high. Harris also proposed providing a $25,000 payment support to help people buy a home for the first time. “There’s a serious housing shortage in many places. It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up,” she said on Friday. “We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well. Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.” The policy rollout comes just as Harris will head to Chicago for the Democratic National Convention. Much of the focus has been on whether she will face a revolt from younger voters because of her and President Joe Biden’s support for Israel amid its war with Hamas that has led to thousands of deaths in Gaza. Indeed, Harris has confronted protesters at some of her early rallies, to varying levels of success. But as Inside Washington has noted before, polling has shown that young voters tend to prioritize the economy, particularly the cost of living and housing, while not nearly as many consider the war in Gaza to be of similar salience. Indeed, when The Independent interviewed Black voters in Milwaukee during the Republican National Convention before Biden stepped aside, they cited inflation and “high as hell” rent as primary reasons for dissatisfaction with Democrats. Harris’s decision to make housing a core part of her first major economic policy rollout shows that she sees it as a winning issue in November. Lee Miringoff, the director for the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, told The Independent that Harris is trying to combine the new-found energy that her ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket has given the party with policies focused around potential Democratic voters who may have wandered away because of a hypothetical rematch between Biden and Donald Trump. “So there's no doubt that young people have concerns about inflation and their ability to also become homeowners,” Miringoff said. “Harris is trying to take that on front and center to to show that it's not just that she's young, more energetic and new generation and all that, but that she's also got some policies that she would like to put forth.” Harris’s decision to deliver the speech in Raleigh is not an accident either. North Carolina has had an influx of residents moving in from states like California and New York, which have exorbitant housing prices. Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, said that the housing market has never fully recovered from either the 2008 housing crisis – which led to Harris suing big banks as California attorney general – and the boom in housing purchases during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when mortgage rates dropped before they went back up and made housing unaffordable. “So even though the Biden-Harris administration can point to a lot of successes in the economy, the housing market is the glaring problem,” she told The Independent. “And because it's, you know, the American dream to own a home, it's something that really does matter if you're going to claim success on the economy.” Republicans for their part have tried to talk about the cost of housing. But Republicans like Kari Lake, who is running for Senate in Arizona, have sought to blame illegal immigration for the rising costs. Trump for his part has offered few solutions on housing. While he has said his administration would “target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issue[s],” he has offered little in terms of specifics. On top of that, during a rally in Bozeman, Montana, he pledged “There will be no low income developments built in areas right next to your house.” During his nonsensical press conference on Thursday where he displayed boxes of Cheerios, bacon and coffee, he offered little in terms of specifics to counteract inflation. “Definitely some race and class connotations there,” Fairweather told The Independent about Trump’s rhetoric on housing. “It's definitely more of a fear mongering message than one of tackling the problem. So definitely different approaches.” At the same time, Fairweather said that there is a divide in how coastal voters think about housing affordability compared to swing state voters.","summary":"Polling shows young voters care about the cost of housing","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-economy-young-voters-b2597625.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/16/22/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Harris_77810.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zJgii2PR-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:10:55","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":254289916,"title":"JD Vance updates: Republican vice presidential nominee addresses the Milwaukee Police Association during campaign stop in Wisconsin","text":"MILWAUKEE (WLS) — Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance campaigned Friday in Milwaukee.

That didn’t stop both supporters and opponents of the Trump-Vance campaign from showing up to make their voices heard. “It is very important, especially for younger conservatives like myself, to get out here, all across the state, and chase ballots, get low propensity Republicans to turn out and show our presence, especially in a place like Milwaukee, where I think we have a very, very good chance to narrow the margin,” Nolan Jackett said.

The president of the Milwaukee Police Association said the Trump campaign reached out to them about two weeks ago, saying they were looking forward to hearing their concerns, which, much like those of CPD, surround retention and recruitment issues, at a time when the city is still coming down from its COVID-era highs, as it relates to crime. “We want to know that we’re being supported, and, that obviously, back the blue, that people have our backs, because we are the ones that have the community’s back, you know,” Alexander Ayala said. “Know that police work, by its nature, is not always pretty, but it’s necessary, and people that hurt the most are the community when they don’t have enough police to answer those calls.” Milwaukee police will have a role to play during the DNC next week.

DNC employee David Strange filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Wednesday asking the commission to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot. The election commission's attorney, Angela O'Brien Sharpe, wrote to Strange on Friday saying she had dismissed the complaint because it names commissioners as respondents and they can't ethically decide a matter brought against them. Dismissing the complaint clears the way for a potential lawsuit seeking to keep Stein off the ballot. A spokesperson for the DNC had no immediate comment Friday. The Stein campaign didn't immediately respond to a message sent to their media email inbox. The bipartisan elections commission unanimously approved ballot access for Stein in February because the Green Party won more than 1% of the vote in a statewide race in 2022. Sheryl McFarland got nearly 1.6% of the vote while finishing last in a four-way race for secretary of state. Strange argued in his complaint that the Green Party can't nominate presidential electors in Wisconsin because no one in the party is a state officer, defined as legislators, judges and others. Without any presidential electors, the party can't have a presidential candidate on the ballot, Strange contended. Stein's appearance on the ballot could make a difference in battleground Wisconsin, where four of the past six presidential elections have been decided by between 5,700 votes and about 23,000 votes. Stein last appeared on the Wisconsin ballot 2016, when she won just over 31,000 votes - more than Donald Trump's winning margin in the state. Some Democrats have blamed her for helping Trump win the state and the presidency that year. The Wisconsin Supreme Court kept Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins off the ballot in 2020 after the elections commission deadlocked on whether he filed proper nominating signatures. The latest Marquette University Law School poll conducted July 24 through Aug. 1 showed the presidential contest in Wisconsin between Democrat Kamala Harris and Trump to be about even among likely voters. Democrats fear third-party candidates could siphon votes from Harris and tilt the race toward Trump. The elections commission plans to meet Aug. 27 to determine whether four independent presidential candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, have met the prerequisites to appear on the ballot. Strange filed a separate complaint last week with the commission seeking to keep West off the ballot, alleging his declaration of candidacy wasn't properly notarized. Cornel's campaign manager countered in a written response any notarization shortcomings shouldn't be enough to keep him off the ballot. That complaint is still pending. Michigan election officials tossed West off that state's ballot Friday over similar notary issues.","summary":"Wisconsin elections officials dismissed a complaint by a Democratic National Committee employee to remove Jill Stein from the presidential ballot.

She now leads in most national polls and in many recent swing state polls. Momentum is clearly on her side. What most analysts have overlooked, though, is where her support is coming from. While she has made up ground among all demographics from President Biden’s dismal post-debate standing, she remains well behind historic levels of Democratic support among blacks and Latinos. That means the reason she’s in the lead is that she’s doing historically well among whites, especially college-educated whites. So her already slim lead is much more tenuous than it looks. The Cook Political Report’s polling average makes this clear. It shows Harris with a thin lead nationally, 47.3% to 46.9%. It also shows her with wide leads among blacks (75-19) and Hispanics (53-41). An average reader would see those data and think she leads because of those demographics. The political pro immediately makes the opposite conclusion, because these margins, as large as they are, are much smaller than Democrats traditionally win. Cook helpfully provides some data from 2020 that subtly makes this point. Biden beat Trump 90-9 among blacks and 60-37 among Hispanics. Trump got roughly 47% of the vote in 2020, so he should be doing better than that in the polls now given that that he’s polling much better among these groups, which cast over 20% of all votes in 2020. Yet he’s only running even with his 2020 showing despite these impressive gains — because he is losing votes among whites. Polls by Emerson College, Ipsos and Survey USA show Trump leads by either 13 or 14 points among whites in a one-on-one race with Harris. But Trump won whites by 17 points in 2020, per the exit poll. Republicans have done even better with white voters in other recent presidential races. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 21 points with white voters in 2016; Mitt Romney trounced Barack Obama by 20 points with them in 2012. Harris’ deficit among whites is only slightly more than the 12 points that Barack Obama lost them by in 2008. That was a year when the stock market was collapsing, the world was falling into recession and the incumbent Republican president had a job approval rating of just 28% on Election Day. It boggles the mind that Harris could nearly equal Obama’s result, given that she is the incumbent vice president for an administration whose own job approval ratings are dismal. Trump’s own unpopularity is not likely the cause. He remains disliked by more people than liked, but his current 44.3% favorability rating is over 2 points higher than it was on Election Day 2020. Nor is Harris herself especially popular. She, too, is disliked by more people than like her, and her 45.5% favorability rating is only slightly higher than Trump’s. The factors point to a simple reason for her standing: hype. She’s been the subject of massive amounts of uncritical attention for the past month. This has fueled a rise in her favorability rating, but it also presumably has helped persuade people who dislike both candidates to reluctantly favor her in a showdown with Trump. So there’s reason to think Trump can fight back. The campaign has already booked tens of millions of dollars of ads in the swing states to run over the next three weeks. That alone could cause some of the hype to fade there. Trump can also use personal appearances to make the case that Harris is too liberal and too weak to be president. That, however, would require more effort and discipline than he has shown in recent weeks. If he can do that, though, it wouldn’t take much to propel him into the lead. Whites will cast roughly two-thirds of all votes this year. Winning them by 16 points rather than 13 may not seem like much of a difference, but that small change shifts the national margin by about two percentage points in Trump’s favor. It’s the difference between victory and defeat. Whites are even more decisive in the key Midwestern swing states. They cast between 81% and 86% of the vote in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Given Trump’s gains with non-white voters, Harris has to run better than Biden with whites to have a prayer of winning any of those states. There are still about 11 weeks until Election Day. In a race as close as this, anything can happen. Once the Democratic convention and Harris’ honeymoon period end, don’t be surprised if some white voters move back to Trump and the polls tighten even further.

A survey says that’s possible, with oil and gas policies from the last few years to blame. New polling of seven swing states shows the Biden-Harris administration’s energy policies could crimp the vice president’s electoral hopes in November — and the former president’s ability to bring cheap gas to American pumps may be a winning message down the stretch. The battleground state survey, which Morning Consult conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, finds voters drawing a direct connection between the high cost of living and impractical energy and environmental guidelines courtesy of the Democrats in the White House. “The U.S. continues to be a global leader in energy production, but the American people recognize that our leaders in Washington must advance an agenda to grow our nation’s energy advantage for decades to come,” API President and CEO Mike Sommers said. “With geopolitical tensions rising and inflation remaining a top concern, we need policies that reinforce the role of American energy on the world stage and support access to the affordable, reliable energy consumers need.” The polling data show inflation is a massive issue across Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as affirmed by 91% to 94% of voters in all seven states. Previous polling has shown nearly 60% of Americans blame the administration for increasing inflation. Vice President Kamala Harris is rolling out plans to repair what her administration has done, but former President Donald Trump says her “Maduro plan,” which includes a proposal to fix grocery prices, is “like something out of Venezuela or the former Soviet Union.” But this poll indicates voters know lowering gas prices is essential to reduce the cost of living, suggesting the California Democrat may need to read the room better in the battlegrounds where this election will be decided or risk losing the race due to an inauthentic message at odds with what voters experience in the Biden-Harris economy. Consider this: At least 80% of people in all seven states polled “agree that producing more oil and natural gas here in the U.S. could help lower energy and utility costs for American consumers,” per API. The high-water mark is Georgia’s 88%. In must-win states like Pennsylvania, where 85% say to “drill, baby, drill,” Harris’ previous opposition to fracking doesn’t sit well. And the teleprompter speech has yet to offer a defense of her unpopular policy position from when she ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Indeed, swing voters want energy independence, per this survey, with four out of every five saying they “support leveraging America’s domestic resources rather than relying on other regions of the world.” This includes a staggering 89% of Michiganders, many of whom remember the Trump administration showcasing the Wolverine State as an “incubator” of an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy abandoned by the Democratic incumbent’s team. And it’s not just about cheap supply. It’s also about national security. More than four out of every five voters in all states surveyed believe energy security is key to holding America’s enemies at bay, including 91% in Georgia, 89% in Arizona and 88% in North Carolina who believe “producing oil and natural gas here in America helps make our country more secure against foreign adversaries.” The Biden administration has broken with historic best practice regarding energy, failing to restock storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve while releasing stock from it this summer not due to an emergency but whim and political expediency. Of course, that kind of fast-shuffle may not have been necessary if President Biden hadn’t moved to put the kibosh on the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Voters are also rejecting the Biden administration’s electric-vehicle mandates and moves to phase out petroleum engines, and just like with the rest of the survey, the numbers are compelling, particularly in the blue-wall states Harris must win. Eighty percent of Michiganders, 78% of Wisconsinites and 77% of Pennsylvanians say they “oppose government mandates that restrict consumer choice, including banning new gasoline, diesel and hybrid vehicles.”","summary":"Is a Kamala-crisis imminent?

Higgins: Butler SWAT Operator Shot Thomas Matthew Crooks 'From the Ground' Before Secret Service Delivered Fatal Shot","text":"Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) said in a Monday investigative report that a Butler SWAT operator shot would-be presidential assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks’ gun “from the ground” before the shooter was killed by a U.S. Secret Service sniper during former President Donald Trump’s July 13 campaign rally. A total of ten shots were fired during Trump’s July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Rep. Higgins said in a preliminary investigative report to Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), the Chairman of the “Bipartisan Task Force to Investigate the Attempted Assassination of Donald Trump.” The report stated that eight “shots were fired by Crooks from his firing (and dying) position” on the rooftop, and that all eight bullet casings are now “allegedly in proper possession of the FBI.” “Thomas Matthew Crooks’ rifle is also allegedly in the proper possession of the FBI,” the congressman noted. “I will need to examine all of the physical evidence that has been harvested by law enforcement and is in the possession of the FBI. All of it.” Notably, the ninth shot fired at the July 13 rally “was from a Butler SWAT operator from the ground about 100 yards away from the AGR building,” Higgins continued in his report. Shot nine “hit Crooks’ rifle stock” and fragmented into the shooter’s face, neck, and right shoulder area from the stock breaking up into pieces, the congressman said. At that point, Crooks “went down” from his firing position, “and the SWAT officer was certain of his hit,” but then the would-be presidential assassin “recovered” a few seconds later and “popped back up,” the report added. “The 10th (and, I believe, final) shot was fired from the southern counter-sniper team,” Higgins stated in his report. “I will not be 100% certain of this until further investigation.” The congressman also said that he does “not believe it was possible” for a second shooter to be atop a water tower at the rally venue on July 13, “nor have I seen any evidence that supports the theory of a 2nd shooter.” “I’m not saying conclusively that there was no other shooter somewhere or that no other conspirators were involved in J13, but I’m saying that based on my investigation thus far, there were 10 shots fired on J13, and all shots are accounted for, and all shots align with their source,” he said. Moreover, “Crooks’ firing position did NOT offer excellent concealment from the southern counter-sniper team,” Higgins added. “However, it should be noted that the would-be assassin perfectly positioned himself to minimize the threat of counter-fire from the ground or the USSS counter-sniper teams,” the congressman said. The findings in Higgins’ report are interesting, as Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe made no mention of the Butler SWAT operator during his August 2 press briefing, in which he offered a detailed summary of the events that unfolded during the July 13 rally. Elsewhere in his report, Higgins said he requested to examine the body of Crooks, only to discover that the shooter’s body was “gone” and that “the FBI cleaned up biological evidence from the crime scene,” which the congressman says “injure[d]” the investigation. “My effort to examine Crooks’ body on Monday, August 5, caused quite a stir and revealed a disturbing fact… the FBI released the body for cremation 10 days after [July] 13,” the congressman said. “On [July] 23, Crooks was gone.” “Nobody knew this until Monday, August 5, including the County Coroner, law enforcement, Sheriff, etc.,” Higgins added. “The FBI cleaned up biological evidence from the crime scene, which is unheard of. Cops don’t do that, ever,” the congressman asserted in his report. “It should be noted that the FBI was fully aware of the fact that Congress would be investigating J13.” “The FBI does not exist in a vacuum,” Higgins added. “They had to know that releasing the J13 crime scene would injure the immediate observations of any following investigation.” The congressman also pointed out that on the day Crooks’ body was cremated, “both the Homeland Security Committee and the Oversight Committee had begun House Committee jurisdictional investigation into J13, and Speaker Johnson had already stated that he was forming an Official Congressional investigative body.” “Why, then, by what measure, would the FBI release his body to the family for cremation?” Higgins asked. “This pattern of investigative scorched earth by the FBI is quite troubling.” “This action by the FBI can only be described by any reasonable man as an obstruction to any following investigative effort,” the congressman said.

Let’s face it: President Joe Biden was former President Donald Trump’s clearest path to victory. And the gift that kept on giving has laid its last golden egg. Biden is gone. It’s incredible how poor a candidate he was. And it took his exit to fully realize just how bad off the Democrats were with him at the top of the ticket. Enter Vice President Kamala Harris, and the euphoria that was pent up has been released like water over Niagara Falls. I get that. Political flaks know what a honeymoon looks like. They know what to do: Weather that slight bump but continually rage against the machine — in this case, the Democrat machine that is now Harris/Walz. It’s at this stage of the presidential campaign that Trump’s limited political experience has failed him. Sure, he is surrounded by a team of experts with years of being on the campaign trail. But I’ve seen enough presidential races to know that it takes a veteran at the top — the candidate himself — to recognize when the ship of state is listing and in need of a course correction. Even candidates who didn’t go on to win the White House adjusted and pivoted to match the shifting winds of the electorate, to respond to the zeitgeist of the day. I have yet to see the pivot. And frankly it must come from the candidate himself, not even his VP pick. Trump needs a course correction … and quickly. As I type this, the first ballots in Pennsylvania get mailed out in less than 38 days. If there is one state every election watcher has their eye on, it’s Pennsylvania. So technically, both sides have weeks, not months, to begin to make their marks on a small map impacted by the Electoral College. Three things are a political imperative to get the Trump Train back on its tracks: — Stay on mission. The Biden-Harris administration is the mission. Harris is Biden’s standard-bearer. Everything he touched during his term, he put into the ditch. Inflation, the economy, jobs (see the stock market last week?), fentanyl, immigration, housing, the list is endless. No one — and I mean no one — believes they are better off under Biden and Harris. So attack her. Toss in Biden for good measure. He reminds even wobbly Democrat voters what they almost were stuck with. Michigan has 800,000 Arab American voters. Remind them of how bad Biden/Harris was for their agenda. Don’t get distracted with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. He’s a proxy for her terrible policies. When both start doing press conferences, be ready to attack everything they say, because their responses will not match what is keeping American families up at night. Please, no more talk of stolen elections. Look presidential and keep the main thing the main thing: Harris is scary. — Help down-ticket races. Finally a different twist — take this message to West Virginia, Montana, Ohio, Nevada and New Mexico, and help your party down-ticket. Ohioans, for example, love Trump. Help out the Senate race there. Trump will help himself, I promise. The same is true in at least four or five other states and in some key congressional districts across the country. Don’t miss the opportunity to grow an incoming majority in the Senate. This race is far from over. And both sides will take their fair share of lumps while doling out a hefty amount of political ordnance. The winning side will be the one that makes the fewest mistakes and stays on mission. It won’t be easy, but it will be simple.

In announcing the investigation, James Comer, chair of the US House Oversight committee, cited reports highlighting the Minnesota governor’s “long-standing connections to Chinese Communist Party entities and officials”. The Kentucky Republican wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting “information, documents and communications related to the CCP-connected entities and officials” Walz may have “engaged and partnered with”. Comer in a statement issued by the panel claimed that Walz shared a “cosy relationship” with China and served as a fellow at a Chinese institution in Macau that maintains a “devotion to the CCP”. The Minnesota governor spent about a year teaching high school in China in the late 1980s through Harvard University’s WorldTeach programme. After returning to the US, Walz met his wife, the former Gwen Whipple, while both were teaching at a high school in Nebraska. In 1994, the two set up a company called Educational Travel Adventures that offered summer trips to China for their students. In 2007, Walz was a fellow at Macau Polytechnic University. “The American people deserve to fully understand how deep Governor Walz’s relationship with China goes,” said Comer, referencing Walz’s 30 visits to China since 1989. In 2016, Walz met the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. A year later he co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which imposed sanctions on mainland and local officials over alleged human-rights abuses during the city’s 2019 protests. Comer, a US congressman since 2016, is no stranger to championing House probes against political rivals. In March, his months-long effort to indict US President Joe Biden unravelled when he failed to substantiate key allegations about benefits the American leader was said to have accrued from his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings. And in 2023, Comer’s committee launched an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, seeking information from various sources, including Anthony Fauci, who served as the president’s chief medical adviser from 2021 to 2022. As of June this year, the panel announced it would persist in its search for evidence of Fauci’s criminal wrongdoing. On March 20, Consul General Zhao Jian met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at the Minnesota State Capitol and they exchanged views on China-U.S. relations and sub-national cooperation. pic.twitter.com/ONDue0Zexe — ChinaConsulateChicago (@ChinaConsulate) April 2, 2024 The Walz probe comes just days after Republican congressman Jim Banks of Indiana wrote to Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin urging the governor’s travel to China during his 24-year-long military service be investigated. These actions align with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s strategy of labelling political opponents “communists”. Meanwhile, the former US president has often touted his strong relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and claimed that Sino-American relations would improve if he were to regain the White House. Trump on Thursday said his campaign’s strategy to win voters in the 2024 presidential race was “hitting a nerve”. “I think this is a different kind of a race,” he explained. “All we have to do is define our opponent as being a communist or a socialist or somebody that’s going to destroy our country.” When asked how he would manage ties with Beijing, Trump predicted: “I think we’ll have a great relationship with China.” Comer in his letter to Wray asked if the FBI had given “any warnings or advice” to Walz “about US political figures being targeted by or recruited for CCP influence operations”. The letter claimed Walz attended a US-China Peoples Friendship Association event in 2019. However, the Chinese embassy press release for the non-profit group’s event dated October 25, 2019, did not mention Walz’s participation. In March, Walz posted a photo taken with Consul General Zhao Jian of Beijing’s mission in Chicago, saying they had “exchanged views” on Sino-American relations and subnational cooperation.","summary":"Republican chair writes FBI chief and cites Minnesota governor’s ‘cosy relationship’ with Beijing and ‘devotion to the CCP’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/3274850/china-ties-probe-tim-walz-democratic-vp-candidate-formally-launched-us-house-panel","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/17/7fb4024e-95f2-4cab-b00d-8f068e47e5ca_d26622b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-16 22:00:30","author":"Khushboo Razdan","authors":["Khushboo Razdan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.149},{"id":254290636,"title":"From Bible bucks to legal debt, Trump's financial disclosure is wild","text":"On Thursday, Donald Trump released the financial disclosure forms required of candidates to comply with election campaign laws to the Office of Government Ethics. Those forms show that Trump drew his income from a number of sources—from peddling Bibles to putting his image on trading cards to the hefty fees charged by his golf facilities. They also show that Trump still owes a large amount from legal settlements that he has been in no hurry to pay. These documents are not as detailed as the tax forms that Trump promised to release, then refused to release, and which were finally released in part by the House Ways and Means Committee. Still, at over 250 pages, there’s a lot of information and it may take days before analysts and accountants have put together everything revealed in this document. What can be seen from even a casual glance is that, while Trump might not be as wealthy as he claims, he has more than enough income to pay his legal bills, donate to his campaign, and keep up even the most lavish lifestyle. In other words, all the begging he did to get other people to fund his legal expenses was a flat-out scam. A few highlights from Trump’s disclosure include: Trump made $300,000 for his part in selling those Lee Greenwood Bibles. This seems significant, but if Trump is worth $6.5 billion as he claims, then this is the equivalent of Gov. Tim Walz (whose net worth happens to be just over $300,000) embarrassing himself for about $14. Trump got $12 million in licensing fees, $7 million of which came from putting a version of his face, and scraps of a suit, on those pricey (and ridiculous) NFT trading cards. He may be the only one to come out of this investment a winner. Melania was also paid $330,609 in license fees for NFTs, so she must have made some appearance on those cards. Trump owns between $1 million and $5 million worth of cryptocurrency, despite having frequently declared that it's a scam. Showing that he’s a true watcher of late-night Fox broadcasts, Trump also owns somewhere over $100,000 in gold bars. A book called “Letters to Trump”—which is exactly that, a collection of notes that celebrities have written to Trump, mostly before his first run for office—brought in $4.5 million. That book also contains the story of Trump and Willie Brown being on a helicopter ride. But Brown’s actual letter to Trump makes no mention of a helicopter. Trump set the value of the company behind Truth Social at “over $50 million” even though the company just posted a $16 million loss in the second quarter. The big money came from Trump’s properties at a monster $513 million: that includes $56.9 million from Mar-a-Lago and a whopping $160.7 million from the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort. In addition to the income, Trump has outstanding debts. In particular, there are three line items related to legal decisions over the last two years. Trump still owes writer E. Jean Carroll between $1 million and $5 million for his loss in the first case she filed against him. Since the settlement in that case was for $5 million, it seems like a good bet that Trump has paid her nothing. Trump also owes E. Jean Carroll another $83 million for his loss in the second trial after he repeatedly called her a liar even after a jury held him accountable for sexual assault and a judge claimed that what Trump did to Carroll was rape. The disclosure form only ranks this item as “greater than $50 million,” but again, it’s a good bet that Trump hasn’t begun to pay Carroll what he owes. Also in the over $50 million category is a debt where Trump lists New York Attorney General Letitia James as the creditor. This appears to be the $355 million Trump owes after losing his New York trial on real estate fraud. Clearly the people who made “over $50 million” the top category didn’t anticipate someone like Trump filling out these forms. Trump has income and he could pay off what he owes to Carroll. He could put more of his own funds into his campaign. He could certainly afford to pay his own attorneys. He just doesn’t want to pay. And why should he, so long as there is a stream of suckers and losers who will sign up to cover his bills? Disclose a little of your own finances by sending $10 to the Harris/Walz campaign today.","summary":"On Thursday, Donald Trump released the financial disclosure forms required of candidates to comply with election campaign laws to the Office of Government Ethics.
