Ohio Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown — the man at the center of the United State’s most important (and most expensive) election outside the presidency this year — was cornered by Fox News and asked about Harris’ decision to remove her support from nationwide fracking bans in an unusually awkward moment for the battle-tested legislator. “My focus is on my state and my work,” a flustered Brown mumbled on his way toward an elevator. “I’ve endorsed Vice President Harris … I don’t know what she said on fracking.” Brown is known to be close with President Joe Biden, whose current semi-retirement has made the senator’s tight re-election chances even tighter. “Sherrod Brown is in lockstep with San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris on all of her radical policies, including a complete ban on fracking,” Brown’s opponent, Republican business owner Bernie Moreno, told The Post. “Brown and Harris would rather rely on our adversaries for energy instead of using our resources here at home. In November, Ohioans will reject their radical, anti-energy agenda,” he added. Brown, who has voted several times in favor of fracking bans, must now either reverse his own course to join Harris and help her pursue voters in emerging energy states like Pennsylvania and Ohio who rely on fracking, or hold fast to his well-documented beliefs. “The point is they’ve both supported fracking bans – Harris can try and flip flop now, but her stance is well documented,” a spokesperson for Moreno added. “We know they both want to ban it. But Bernie will always support Fracking.” Moreno is not the only prominent Republican to smell blood in the water right now either. “Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking and buy energy from every dictator around the world. Donald Trump wants to drill baby drill,” another Ohio senator, and Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance said today at a rally in Arizona. “Do we want to ban fracking,” he bellowed to the crowd who shouted back an enthusiastic, “NO!” It’s been a tough week for Republicans in the polls as the nation adjusts to a tumultuous two weeks of impactful shakeups. Harris has closed most of her significant gaps in the swing states and is looking to draw more white men into her camp — a demographic she may need desperately to win in November. By backpedaling on her 2020 promise to ban fracking nationwide, Harris is looking to keep her popularity scores going up, even if it costs her some credibility. And the GOP seems perfectly happy to help her get that message out.","summary":"As the presumptive Democrat nominee for president, Vice President Kamala Harris, attempts a tricky back peddle on her fracking policies, Republicans are attacking her and any other liberal they can find over the flipflop.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/kamala-harris-fracking-flip-flop-is-affecting-races-for-other-democrats/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/86812052.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fznmkRGx-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-03 00:15:11","author":"Joe Durbin","authors":["Joe Durbin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":253269324,"title":"Butler rally was first Trump event of 2024 with Secret Service snipers","text":"When U.S. Secret Service counter snipers pulled up to a farm grounds in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 10, just three days before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, it was the first time this campaign cycle that the highly trained, tactical unit had been deployed to secure an event for the former president.\"It was the first time Secret Service counter snipers were deployed to support\" a Trump event this year, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe confirmed to CBS News during a news conference Friday, held at the federal law enforcement agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters. On July 13, a gunman opened fire on Trump from a rooftop roughly 400 feet away from the former president during an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A CBS News video analysis determined that the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, fired eight shots in under six seconds before he was fatally struck by a round from one of the counter snipers — a fact later confirmed by the FBI. Among a litany of security lapses Rowe disclosed Friday afternoon, the acting director told reporters that Secret Service counter snipers did not have radio communications with local law enforcement that day. Instead, the agents relied on text messaging, with local Butler County tactical teams sending Secret Service snipers two pictures of Crooks via text message at 5:45 p.m., about 26 minutes before shots were fired. At that point, neither local law enforcement nor Secret Service knew Crooks had a gun. Rowe revealed that neither the counter snipers nor Trump's security detail were aware that the suspicious individual — first spotted by local law enforcement roughly 75 minutes earlier — was armed until the shots were fired. \"What I've directed now is that everybody should be using the radio net,\" Rowe said. \"And if we don't have the ability to pipe in or leverage that counterpart system, that's one of the things that we're looking at now.\"Communications were also disjointed, Rowe explained, because there were two separate command posts used that day — a \"Secret Service security room\" and a separate command post staffed with local law enforcement. Only one Pennsylvania State Police officer was assigned to the agency's security room, and there were no Secret Service personnel within local law enforcement's command post, a situation that Rowe described as \"unique,\" meriting further investigation. \"If the large majority of our partners are in a unified command post or in a different location, we need to probably be there too,\" Rowe added. According to a Secret Service timeline unveiled by Rowe on Friday, at 5:53 p.m., the leader for the U.S. Secret Service counter snipers texted their team that local law enforcement was \"looking for a suspicious individual outside of the perimeter lurking around the AGR building,\" referring to the roof from which the shooter later opened fire on Trump. \"At this time, Secret Service personnel are operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual,\" Rowe said. \"The concept of local law enforcement working on such issues is common at sites.\"Rowe noted that there were multiple suspicious persons reported to the Secret Service on July 13, along with over 100 calls for local law enforcement to address issues ranging from general help requests to medical problems to missing children reports. At 6:11 p.m., moments before the shooting, a member of Trump's protective detail contacted a counterpart within Secret Service's Pittsburgh field office to follow up on that earlier communication, but it was too late. As the agents spoke on the phone, shots rang out. \"Right in the middle of that phone conversation, the shots begin firing,\" Rowe said. Rowe described the lack of coverage on the roof where Crooks was situated as \"a Secret Service failure,\" adding, \"the roofline should have been covered. We should have had better eyes on that.\"The Secret Service also failed to deploy a drone at the rally site, Rowe said, with the agency also turning down an offer from local law enforcement to use their drone. The acting director said he was unsure why that offer was declined, calling it another protocol issue that will be reviewed. \"One of the other changes that I implemented when I became the acting director, is we are now going to leverage the use of unmanned aerial systems at sites now,\" Rowe said. The assassination attempt has prompted heightened scrutiny of Secret Service operations, with several departmental and congressional investigations underway. Rowe took over leadership of the agency last week, after Kimberly Cheatle resigned amid pressure from lawmakers. The Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday delayed plans to meet and consider next year's funding for the U.S. Secret Service. In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, Rowe conceded that the July 13 shooting \"made me ashamed,\" adding that he \"cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"— Scott MacFarlane and Kaia Hubbard contributed to this report.","summary":"It was the first time this campaign cycle that the highly trained, tactical unit had been deployed to secure an event for the former president.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/butler-rally-first-trump-event-of-2024-with-secret-service-snipers-officials-say/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/03/872fca97-7b5c-4d71-a161-f60465f8ba78/thumbnail/1200x630/6b0e13fd6b599df81fa7202eb2399b36/gettyimages-2164437897.jpg?v=d7dedd293aad546f97f947149642d369","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/08/02/2360565315923/3095351_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-03 00:08:30","author":"Faris Tanyos,Nicole Sganga","authors":["Faris Tanyos","Nicole Sganga"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":253269444,"title":"Republican Candidate for Senate Steve Garvey Bucks National Line, Supports Immigration Reform in Op-Ed","text":"Local baseball icon turned politician Steve Garvey has broken with his fellow national Republicans in order to support a policy of comprehensive immigration reform. The column came as the GOP, led by Donald Trump and his campaign, promoted a policy of mass deportations — a move Garvey, who is running for United States Senate, decried as unrealistic. Garvey began by saying that the under-resourced and overloaded immigration system has created a massive bureaucratic backlog that has spilled into other parts of American society, such as education and the judicial system. “Illegal immigration is… blatantly unfair to the millions of hard-working immigrants who came to the United States legally and now call California home,” Garvey wrote in the Aug. 2 column in La Opinión. “However, the mass deportation of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in our country is not a realistic solution,” he added. “Fixing the immigration issue is more complex.” Garvey advocated for tighter border controls and more “Remain in Mexico” policies, while at the same time prioritizing the processing of green cards for families, streamlining the citizenship progress, and reducing the wait times for those seeking entry into the United States. “Securing the border and making it easier for good actors to come here, are two sides of the same coin,” he wrote. “You can’t solve this issue with only one or the other.” Garvey credited his time playing for southern California professional sports with giving him a different understanding of immigration than the nativist stance that is currently supported by many other members of the Republican Party. “When I played baseball for the San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers, I shared the dugout with teammates from across the world. We learned so much from each other, and I truly value the cross-cultural friendships I developed,” he wrote. ” But if it were not for the United States immigration policies, these teammates would never have been able to share the bench with me and build a new life in this country.”","summary":"\"Illegal immigration is... blatantly unfair to the millions of hard-working immigrants who came to the United States legally and now call California home,\" Garvey wrote in the Aug. 2 column in La Opinión.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2024/08/02/republican-candidate-for-senate-bucks-national-line-supports-immigration-reform-in-op-ed/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/All-Star-FanFest13.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-03 00:06:46","author":"Brooke Binkowski,Chris Stone","authors":["Brooke Binkowski","Chris Stone"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.349},{"id":253269002,"title":"Jon Stewart Says Kamala Harris' Popularity is Going To Bother Trump, 'Popularity is My Thing'","text":"In the latest episode of his Weekly Show podcast, Jon Stewart dove into the remarkable momentum behind Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign. Stewart kicked off the discussion by marveling at the electric atmosphere of Harris’ recent rally in Atlanta, Georgia, where rapper Megan Thee Stallion performed, and Harris directly challenged GOP nominee Donald Trump to a debate. She said, \"So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it — you may have noticed. He won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me. Well, Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the saying goes, 'if you’ve got something to say, say it to my face.'” As per HuffPost, Stewart exclaimed, \"Holy shit!...It’s the one thing I think that would, more than any policy or any discrepancy on economics or anything else, the thing that would bother Donald Trump the most is a giant arena filled with enthusiastic supporters having a party. I almost think he’d be like, ‘What? Popularity is my thing,’...doesn’t even give a shit about the election anymore, he just wants to be like, ‘My crowd was bigger.’” This isn’t the first time Stewart has taken aim at Trump. Recently, he offered advice to Republicans lamenting Kamala Harris’s ascendancy to the top of the Democratic ticket following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he was stepping down from the 2024 race. Republicans, including Trump's running mate JD Vance, have cried foul, claiming a \"coup\" within the Democratic Party. Stewart mocked, “But I get it. If I thought I had this thing in the bag, you were gonna be going up against old Joe Biden, then they pull this, I’d be like, ‘Ref, ref open your eyes. How can you not see they’re coup-ing! They’re coup-ing!’...But you know what? I do understand that they’re upset. It makes sense. So how about we do this out of fairness, I’m a fair person – you can replace your old guy, too.” As per The Independent, Stewart pointed out that Trump has responded to Harris’ presidential run in his classic manner. On the day Biden bowed out, Trump took to Truth Social and exclaimed, “So, we are forced to spend time and money on fighting Crooked Joe Biden, he polls badly after having a terrible debate, and quits the race. Now we have to start all over again, Shouldn’t the Republican Party be reimbursed for fraud in that everybody around Joe, including his doctors and the Fake News Media, knew he was not capable of running for, or being, President? Just askin’?” Stewart found humor in Trump's reaction, noting his frustration and suggesting that the former president would need to recalibrate his attacks. “Well, what’s done is done. You’re gonna have to shift gears, recalibrate, you’ve had crooked Joe and sleepy Joe on speed dial. You’re gonna need a new line of attack.”","summary":"Stewart quipped, “...they’re upset.

Mueller III was starting his investigation, his agents and prosecutors were chasing potentially explosive allegations about foreign influence over Donald J. Trump and his campaign. C.I.A. intelligence relayed to the special counsel’s office suggested that senior leaders of a foreign adversary had signed off on secretly funneling millions of dollars — with the help of a Trump campaign adviser acting as “a bag man” — to Mr. Trump in the final days of the 2016 election. Interviews and other evidence obtained by the special counsel’s office showed that indeed Mr. Trump had lent his campaign a similar amount of money in the final days of the race — and, after beating Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump immediately struck a far more favorable tone toward the country than his predecessors. The country in question, however, was not Russia. It was Egypt. Seven years after Mr. Mueller’s team dug in on those allegations, people familiar with the investigation acknowledged that while much of the country’s attention was focused on ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, the most concrete lead Mr. Mueller’s team initially had about potential foreign influence over Mr. Trump involved Egypt.

Speaking of the trend toward hostage trades generally, he added: “I don’t see how this doesn’t lead to an escalation or increase” in the practice by foreign governments.

The woman joined the gym Sunday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. By Friday morning, a Republican state lawmaker had held a news conference outside the gym, and protesters gathered to criticize the fitness center, according to the newspaper. “I have been contacted by a lot of people,” Rep. Justin Sparks told The Associated Press on Friday. He held the news conference but said he did not organize protesters. Sparks represents a House district neighboring the gym. Life Time spokesperson Natalie Bushaw said the woman showed staff a copy of her driver’s license, which identified her as female. AP requests for comment via Facebook to the gym member were not immediately returned Friday. She told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that a women approached her in the sauna Monday and said she was a man and that she did not belong there. “The Missouri Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,” Bushaw said in a statement. “Therefore, the member is to use Life Time’s women’s locker room.” Ellisville police Capt. Andy Vaughn said the agency on Friday received a report of alleged indecent exposure at the gym that is being investigated. No charges have been filed. Also on Friday, Attorney General Andrew Bailey announced he is investigating the gym and sent a letter warning Life Time that its policies “are enabling potentially criminal behavior.” “As Attorney General, I will vigorously defend and enforce Missouri’s laws,” Bailey wrote. “You face both potential criminal and civil liabilities.” Missouri has not enacted a law dictating transgender people’s access to public restrooms, and the state’s attorney general has limited authority to press criminal charges. That is typically left to local prosecutors. Bailey cited a 2015 Missouri appeals court ruling against a man convicted of misdemeanor trespassing in a women’s gas station restroom. In that case, the man holed up in a women’s gas station bathroom and smoked cigarettes for several hours. He did not claim to be a woman or to be transgender, but he attempted to disguise his voice when staff asked him to stop smoking. Workers called police, who arrived and asked the man why he was in the female restroom. “Appellant responded that he had to defecate ‘really bad,’ ” according to the ruling. He was carrying lotion and a pornographic magazine. Ellisville police said the agency is not investigating potential trespassing because the private gym gave the member permission to use the women’s locker room.

Some 15,000 Morgan Stanley advisers were told they can start guiding clients’ purchase of shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, CNBC reported based on anonymous sources. The reported policy switch by Morgan Stanley — the sixth largest US bank — comes as crypto investors have been betting big on Donald Trump winning the presidency in November, hoping the former president will relax industry regulations if he gains the White House. In January, the SEC approved applications for 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. The move made it easier for people to invest in a Bitcoin ETF from the same place they manage their other stocks, and gave investors a crypto vehicle that can be more readily traded. Most Wall Street giants – including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo – have banned their financial advisors from pitching Bitcoin ETFs, the report said. Morgan Stanley’s reversal is a response to client demand and an attempt to keep up with a changing industry, anonymous sources told CNBC. The policy change is not without its terms. Financial advisors can only approach clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million, a high risk tolerance and a desire to make speculative investments for the new Bitcoin ETFs, sources told CNBC. The Bitcoin ETFs are meant for taxable brokerage accounts, not retirement accounts, and the bank will monitor clients’ crypto holdings so they are not exposed to high volatility, sources told CNBC. In 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major US bank to offer Bitcoin funds to its clients. The bank phased out private funds from Galaxy and FS NYDIG earlier this year, according to CNBC.","summary":"The policy switch up is a huge pivot from Wall Street's tendency to snub cryptocurrency and may represent a shift toward embracing the evolving market.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/business/morgan-stanley-tells-financial-advisers-they-can-pitch-bitcoin-etfs-as-crypto-bets-big-on-trump-presidency-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/electronic-signs-shown-morgan-stanley-85528472.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:39:42","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":253268476,"title":"Letters: Pass AB 1866 | Public health | Youth vote | Inaction disqualifies | Dismantle pipeline","text":"Legislators must pass oil well emission bill Re: “Oil companies should stop oil well emissions” (Page A6, July 24).

Reetu Gupta Fremont AB 1866 would address public health issue Re: “Oil companies should stop oil well emissions” (Page A6, July 24). I am writing in response to Ron Sadler of Livermore’s Letter to the Editor. As a community psychiatrist with decades of experience working with marginalized populations, I support these concerns regarding the significant threat that idle oil and gas wells pose to public and environmental health. Oil and gas wells emit methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, as well as benzene, formaldehyde and multiple other hazardous substances. People living close to wells are at higher risk for asthma, heart disease, birth defects and cancer. I have personally observed how these illnesses impact the mental health of those affected and their families. AB 1866 is vital to protecting public health and is a key piece of legislation in California’s path toward a sustainable future. Wendy Bernstein Berkeley Derision is no way to draw youth vote Re: “Harris administration would offer hard lesson” (July 30). Bill Behan’s letter denigrating younger voters exemplifies perfectly why so many of them are delighted by the prospects of a candidate like Kamala Harris. Data has shown that the millennial and Gen Z generations are the first generations who feel worse off than their parents. Prices and income requirements to achieve a first home are beyond even the median U.S. wage. As such, younger workers have to work two to three jobs just to survive. Yet when it came to the old guard in politics, these worsening conditions for our upcoming generations were largely ignored. Now, being presented with an option that listens to their concerns, why shouldn’t they be excited? If the only response to that is to belittle the candidate, complain about wanting free stuff (while ignoring Trump’s promises of unfunded tax cuts), and threaten a draft, is it really any mystery why young voters are so put off? Christopher Dooner Sunnyvale Inaction on Jan. 6 disqualifies Trump Donald Trump is morally disqualified from being president of the United States. His inaction following the breach of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters disqualifies him. The investigation by the Jan. 6 committee shed some light on Trump’s behavior, but neither Trump nor any of his spokespeople have provided an affirmative accounting of his actions during that period of time. In Trump’s Jan. 6 speech at the Ellipse, he directed the crowd to go to the U.S. Capitol and protest “peacefully.” As soon as he was aware that the Capitol security perimeter was breached he should have used the vast reach of his social media presence to immediately direct his followers to cease their actions and withdraw from the premises. This failure to act was a failure of leadership and moral authority. It is up to the voters of this country to hold him to account.

On Thursday, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced off against Italian boxer Angela Carini, winning in 46 seconds after Carini abruptly pulled out of the fight. Following the match, Carini burst into tears and declined to shake Khelif’s hand, telling reporters that she withdrew due to the intensity of her opponent’s initial punches. “I put an end to the match because after the second blow,” Carini said, “I felt a strong pain in my nose.” That reaction has since spawned scrutiny of Khelif, who was assigned female at birth and identifies as a woman. False claims that she is a trans person or that she is a man pretending to be a woman quickly spread thanks to reports she was disqualified from a 2023 International Boxing Association event and the resurfacing of comments by the president of that organization suggesting that her elimination was because she failed a hormone test. The inaccurate statements about her identity were boosted by prominent anti-trans individuals like Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, as well as politicians like US Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance and conservative Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Their statements stirred up a storm of anger on the right despite the fact that Khelif is a cisgender woman. As Vox’s Alex Abad-Santos has explained, there aren’t any transgender athletes at the Olympics this year who are competing outside of the sex they were assigned at birth, though IOC rules don’t bar their inclusion so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. “There has been some confusion that somehow it’s a man fighting a woman,” International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters. “The question you have to ask yourself is, are these athletes women? The answer is yes.” The 2024 Olympic boxing match between Imane Khelif and Angela Carini, explained During their match this week, Carini and Khelif competed against one another in their respective first fights of this Olympics. Olympic boxing contests group competitors by weight class and operate in a knockout fashion, meaning the winner of a match moves forward while the loser is eliminated. Both had also previously competed in Tokyo, with Carini getting eliminated in her first bout during those Olympics, and Khelif getting eliminated in her second bout. The two fighters started the round trading blows; after Carini paused the match to adjust her headgear, Khelif went on the offensive, landing a solid punch to her opponent’s face. Rather than continue, Carini, pulling at her nose, relinquished the competition completely. That’s atypical for a boxing match, which often includes three rounds of combat. As the referee prepared to call the match, Carini told her team, “It’s not fair.” Carini could then be seen dropping to her knees and refusing any attempts at a handshake or other customary gestures of sportsmanship from Khelif. The match may have passed unnoticed except for the controversy that erupted after it, which was fueled by events that occurred more than a year before it even began. In 2023, Kehlif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting hoped to compete in the boxing world championships held by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in New Delhi, India. Kehlif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA, and press reports suggested that it was because they failed a test of some sort and had elevated testosterone levels. The IBA’s president reportedly told a Russia outlet at the time that both Khelif and Lin had “XY chromosomes” — a chromosomal composition most commonly seen in those assigned male at birth. Exactly what led to this statement is unclear. The IBA did not disclose documentation at the time or reveal what tests were conducted. Questions were also raised because the organization, which was led by Russian official Umar Kremlev, did not disqualify Khelif until after she had already beaten a Russian boxer. In recent days, the IBA released a statement claiming that in 2023, Khelif and Lin “did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test, whereby the specifics remain confidential.” The statement also said the test “conclusively indicated that both athletes … have competitive advantages over other female competitors.” Both Khelif and Lin had also competed in the 2022 world championships, also administered by the IBA the year before. The IBA’s 2023 decision was heavily criticized by the IOC, which deemed it “arbitrary” and not transparent. Both athletes competed without issue in the Olympics in 2021. At the time, neither medaled, and both lost to multiple female opponents. Adding to the confusion is the fact that the IOC has declared the IBA an unreliable steward of global boxing: Officials banished the group from regulating the sport at the Olympic level due to concerns over its financial dealings, leadership, and allegations of match-fixing. The lack of clarity about what happened in 2023 has helped mis- and disinformation about Khelif to fester. The IOC, however, has been clear that Khelif and Lin qualify to compete based on its rules. Those do not include sex testing, which the IOC abandoned in 2000 and which has long been scrutinized for operating off questionable and flawed science. The committee does still disqualify some athletes who have Differences of Sexual Development (DSD), “a group of rare conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs,” per Reuters. When it comes to DSDs, IOC rules governing eligibility use factors like safety and fairness to determine who can compete. Beyond questions of sex, there are racial dynamics at play in the perceptions of this match. Female athletes of color — particularly those of African and African American descent — have long been accused of being men when they’ve beaten white women in competition. This happened most notably with tennis phenom Serena Williams and track star Caster Semenya, both of whom endured tropes that cast Black women as more masculine and threatening. Following the attention on this week’s match, Carini has said she’d like to apologize to Khelif: “If the I.O.C. said she can fight, I respect that decision.” Other boxers have expressed they aren’t concerned about competing against Khelif. “I don’t care about the press story and social media,” said Anna Luca Hamori, a boxer from Hungary who will compete against Khelif next. Lin’s first match proceeded as planned — like Khelif, she won. The attention is being used to advance conservatives’ agenda The facts of Khelif’s Olympic journey have not gotten in the way of the false narrative that exploded in the wake of her win. Her victory proved to be an opportunity for those with transphobic views to score rhetorical and political points. Rowling and other prominent anti-trans figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk were quick to spread lies and cite the boxing match as an example of why they believe it is important to back stark gender binaries. “We object because we saw a male punching a female,” Rowling wrote in a post on X. US conservatives who misattributed and questioned Khelif’s gender identity also used the fight to weaponize the anti-trans rhetoric they’ve utilized in the past to activate their voter base. Vance was quick to wrongly link Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to the international boxing match in a nonsensical post, writing on X, “This is where Kamala Harris’s ideas about gender lead: to a grown man pummeling a woman in a boxing match.” Former President Donald Trump similarly wrote on Truth Social that he would “keep men out of women’s sports.” As Vox’s Nicole Narea and Fabiola Cineas have explained, this sort of rhetoric on the part of GOP leaders is tied to an explosion of anti-trans legislation in states across the country focused on bathroom access, women’s sports, and gender-affirming care for minors. Collectively, these bills have sought to frame trans people as a threat and to stoke fear among GOP voters. Women’s sports is an arena where the GOP has leaned into this messaging because they see it as activating religious Republicans, including Evangelical voters, and potentially resonating with more moderate women, too. “Trans issues in particular challenge … biblical concepts of gender,” Sophie Bjork-James, a Vanderbilt University anthropologist who studies the religious right, previously told Vox. “Evangelicals tend to believe that men and women have very different qualities that are innate in us. I think there’s a huge interest in maintaining a gender binary because it really does provide a foundation for their theology and their everyday lives.” Republican state legislatures including those in Tennessee and Texas have successfully passed bills that limit athletes to participating in sports for the sex they were assigned at birth. The attacks on Khelif are just the latest manifestation of such ideas.","summary":"An Olympic women’s boxing match — and misinformation about one of the athletes involved — is now being used by conservatives to promote their anti-trans agenda.&#160; On Thursday, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif faced off against Italian boxer Angela Carini, winning in 46 seconds after Carini abruptly pulled out of the fight.

Tammy Baldwin winning third term over soft-on-immigration record","text":"WATERTOWN, Wis. — The border crisis has emerged as a top concern for voters in Wisconsin — as the critical battleground state gears up for one of the most competitive US Senate races on top of a historic presidential election in November. Democrat incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin is likely to face off against multimillionaire Republican challenger Eric Hovde when voters head to the polls later this year. Baldwin, who is a fierce Kamala Harris ally, is now coming under scrutiny over her soft-on-immigration record, especially as Harris has emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee. Voters fear that a Balwin and Harris win could leave the besieged southern border wide open. “I don’t think the border is a border state issue anymore,” Kyle Schroeder, Chairman of the Wisconsin Young Republicans, told The Post, insisting that immigration is one of the top three issues for younger conservative voters aged 18-40 in Wisconsin. “Ultimately their voting records [on immigration] have been an absolute disaster,” the 28-year-old added of the prospect of a Harris presidency and Badlwin third term. “They voted to allow previously deported felons to return without penalty. They’re two peas in the pod at the end day.” Baldwin — who refused to appear with President Biden at a rally after his rocky debate performance then enthusiastically endorsed Harris within hours of Biden stepping down — shares a similar record as the Democratic presidential nominee, who was once coined the Biden administration’s “border czar.” Both Baldwin and Harris voted against Kate’s Law, a bill that would mandate five-year prison sentences for illegal immigrants with felonies apprehended in the United States. It was named after Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who was killed in San Francisco in 2015 by an illegal migrant from Mexico who had seven felony convictions at the time of his arrest and had been deported from the US to Mexico six times. Baldwin voted against cloture on Kate’s Law in 2016, effectively helping to kill the bill. Harris also helped kill the bill when it came back up in 2017 in the Senate. Those votes are both taking center stage again after Sen. JD Vance — now former President Donald Trump’s running mate — reintroduced the bill in February of this year following the violent murder of Laken Riley allegedly at the hands of an illegal immigrant who had been previously deported. Baldwin and Harris also voted against an immigration amendment to the Broader Options for Americans Act, which would have mandated the detention of an illegal migrant convicted of any DUI, even as a first offense. Had that amendment been approved, it could have meant the detention and eventual deportation of Victor Manual Gomez-Acosta, a Mexican man who was living in the US illegally, before he allegedly stabbed his wife and daughters to death earlier this year. “Kamala Harris’ open border policy has thrown once-stable cities into discord as they grapple with the influx of new residents,” Badger State small business owner Cori Houston told The Post. “Tammy Baldwin’s illegal immigration record is no better. The ongoing challenges facing these communities only suggest that their election will worsen conditions for regular American citizens,” Houston added. Houston also expressed concern about Harris’ record on immigration as a prosecutor in California. “A glance at San Francisco reveals her indifference to the issues of immigration and homelessness in her own community — why would she care about ours?” she asked. As San Francisco District Attorney, Harris supported the city’s decades-old sanctuary city policy and refused to seek the death penalty in the gruesome killing of a father, Tony Bologna, and his two sons, Michael and Matthew, by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador — despite calls from the mother and widow. In 2018, Baldwin and Harris voted against cloture on Senate Amendment 1948 — an amendment that would have made sanctuary cities ineligible for certain federal law enforcement grants. “Sen. Baldwin and VP Harris opened our borders and let criminals, terrorists and deadly drugs enter the US without any consequences,” Hovde, Baldwin’s likely rival in the 2024 Wisconsin Senate race, told The Post. “As more and more illegal immigrants commit shocking violent crimes on a seemingly daily basis, Sen. Baldwin and VP Harris are dangerously wrong for Wisconsin.” However, Baldwin’s team defended her record by pointing to her vote in February for a bipartisan border security compromise intended to cut back border crossings. “Earlier this year [Baldwin] voted for the bipartisan border deal that would have added hundreds of Border Patrol agents, shut down the border to illegal crossings, and helped stop fentanyl and other illegal drugs from coming into our country,” Baldwin’s spokesperson, Andrew Mamo, said. “While that bill was supported by Republicans, Democrats, and the US Border Patrol, her opponent Eric Hovde said he would have voted against the bill because he is more interested in playing politics with this issue than addressing the problem.” The bill, which was tied to funding for Ukraine, ultimately failed to pass. A Fox News poll, released July 26, shows Baldwin leading Hovde 54% to 43% among registered Wisconsin voters. The same poll shows Harris and Trump neck-and-neck in the Badger State. Baldwin, meanwhile, appeared alongside Harris as a show of support at her first campaign rally as presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in Milwaukee on July 23. “I had the privilege of serving with Tammy when I was in the United States Senate,” Harris told the crowd at the rally. “And she is always fighting for the people of this state. And I know that the folks that are here are going to make sure you return her to Washington, DC, in November.”","summary":"The border crisis has emerged as a top concern for voters in Wisconsin -- as the critical battleground state gears up for one of the most competitive US Senate races on top of a historic presidential election in November.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/wisconsin-voters-fear-kamala-harris-win-sen-tammy-baldwin-winning-third-term-over-soft-on-immigration-record/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-ug26fnr8v-1722639600428.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722625251&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fznmkRGx-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:18:03","author":"Amy Sikma","authors":["Amy Sikma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":253267688,"title":"Biden-Harris wasted $8.5 billion in taxpayer money to lose 15,000 jobs at Intel","text":"Well, ladies and gentlemen: the chips are down — literally and figuratively. Two years ago, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris touted their “Chips Act” to bring the semiconductor industry back home from Taiwan, China and Singapore. The price tag on the bill: a cool $280 billion of corporate handouts. It was arguably the largest corporate welfare bill in American history. Intel, Micron, Global Foundries, Polar Semiconductor, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung, BAE Systems, and Microchip Technology have been the direct beneficiaries of the law. This was supposed to be one of the “Crown Jewels” of the Biden-Harris admin. A massive job creator that would allow America to take back its technologicalleadership. Even many Republicans in Congress shamelessly voted for the handouts at a time when the federal government was already borrowing more than $1 trillion a year. Heavy failures But today, the failures far outweigh the successes — and in spectacular fashion. Intel was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Chips Act, receiving an $8.5 billion grant announced in March, a $25 billion sweetheart tax incentive and likely the lion’s share of an $11 billion federal loan program. That’s only the opening act. What did we get in exchange? Intel this week announced it was laying off 15% of its workforce — 15,000positions. America lost twice: billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Nvidia, which took no government money, has been the top-performing stock over the past 18 months and has made hundreds of billions of dollars for American shareholders. Its chips are mostly made in Taiwan, but it creates thousands of jobs here at home. This Chips Act was supposed to be the Biden-Harris crowning achievement. A giant job creator. Hundreds of billions of government handouts to bring the semiconductor industry back home. Now, it’s looking like the Titanic. Maybe these layoffs make business sense and will help Intel become the powerhouse it once was. But the company’s new government-dependent status means all of its decision-making is being directed by Washington — not the marketplace. Their strategy has been to maximize taxpayers’ dollars — not creating value for their customers. How many times can we learn the same lesson? Government is terrible at picking winners and losers. Remember Solyndra and Fisker Auto? Corporate welfare woes Politicians gamble — with your money — and go broke again and again. Corporate welfare almost never works. We’ve tried it with steel, autos, solar panels and electricbatteries. Just look at how this policy has hobbled the electric-vehicle industry. Biden has handed out tens of billions in handouts, mandates and other Hershey kisses to an industry that was well on its way to success when Donald Trump left office. Now the car companies are losing billions of dollars even as they chase down all this “free” money. EV sales would be much higher today if politicians had simply kept their paws off of it. Or consider that the Biden administration passed its Green New Deal —dishonestly called the “Inflation Reduction Act” — with hundreds of billions for solar and wind companies. Today, the industry is still flat on its back — providing less than 10% of American energy. Meanwhile the nonsubsidized oil and gas and coal industries still supply 80% of our energy. The oil and gas industry actually pays taxes rather than just taking government money. Poor policy The theory of national industrial policy is based on the idea that some sectors are of such paramount importance that they can’t be left to the private sector. That may make sense when it come to defense industries. But as we’ve seen with electric vehicles and green energy in recent years, trusting the government to take charge is about the worst way for any business to succeed. Ironically, the Biden-Harris administration wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% on our successful corporations — the ones that actually make a profit and don’t need government subsidies — and use that money to prop up the loser industries. It’s no way to run a country. It is the way socialist regimes have all gone broke. The two of us have suggested that America should pass a law preventing the government from giving any company a subsidy if it has more than $100 million in sales. Use the savings to cut tax rates for everyone. The failure of the Chips Act is a reminder of the maxim that the best government policy for the economy is: don’t meddle. In the meantime, Congress should suspend the $100 billion that the semiconductor industry hasn’t already spent and wasted. Never throw good money after bad.

Just a day after online voting kicked off, Harris, the only party candidate, received more than a majority of votes from delegates to become the nation's first woman-of-color presidential nominee as she has been cranking up a powerful campaign in a tight race against former President and Republican flag-bearer Donald Trump. Harris launched her campaign after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month amid dogged questions over his old age following a woeful debate performance in June. Her campaign has since created much enthusiasm among once-demoralized Democrats, seen a substantial fundraising haul and reshaped a race viewed as more favorable to Trump. \"I am so proud to confirm that Vice President Harris has earned more than a majority of votes from all convention delegates and will be the nominee of Democratic Party following the close of voting on Monday,\" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Jaime Harrison said in a statement. Before the online vote started, the DNC said that 3,923 delegates -- or 99 percent of the participants -- had petitioned to put Harris on the nomination ballot. She ran unopposed in the intraparty battle as no Democrat met the threshold of obtaining at least 300 delegate signatures by Tuesday to be on the ballot. A candidate is required to secure 1,976 delegate votes to clinch the Democratic nomination. Should Harris beat Trump in the November election, she would become America's first woman president. After passing the delegate threshold, Harris said she was \"honored\" to be at the top of the ticket. \"I am honored to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. I will officially accept the nomination next week,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are.\" The virtual roll call vote is set to conclude on Monday. It was arranged ahead of the Democratic National Convention set for Aug. 19-22, because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit the names of their candidates. South Korean policymakers have been closely watching the US election race as policy changes could take place depending on who occupies the White House. If elected, Harris is expected to continue key tenets of the Biden administration's foreign policy, including strengthening a network of alliances and partnerships to confront shared regional and global challenges, though she could put her own style in policy formulation and implementation processes. As Harris's campaign has gobbled up media attention, Trump's campaign has sharpened attacks on Harris in a neck-and-neck race that has drawn a sharp contrast between the two starkly different candidates in light of age, race, ethnicity and gender. Harris, currently 59, was born to a family of Jamaican- and Indian-born parents. During a major gathering of Black journalists earlier this week, Trump made remarks about Harris' racial identity, saying, \"Is she Indian? or is she black?.\" Harris dismissed them as \"the same old show\" of \"divisiveness\" and \"disrespect.\" The contest between Harris and Trump has given rise to the \"prosecutor vs. the felon\" narrative in reference to Harris' former service as the attorney general of California and Trump's conviction in a high-profile hush-money trial. As the competition is heating up, Harris is expected to walk a fine line to highlight the Biden administration's major achievements, such as reducing certain prescription drug costs and bolstering America's alliance networks, while guarding against attacks on the administration's perceived shortfalls. She also faces the question of how to keep maintaining forward momentum beyond what many have called a \"honeymoon phase\" following the launch of her campaign, and how to cement and broaden her appeal, particularly in the battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- that would largely determine the outcome of the general election. Harris is expected to announce her pick for vice president next week before she begins her swing through seven battleground states, which includes a stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Among those mentioned for the post are Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Harris was sworn in as vice president in January 2021, making history as the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be in that post. She was inaugurated as a senator of California in 2017 and previously served as the attorney general of California and district attorney of San Francisco.","summary":"WASHINGTON --US Vice President Kamala Harris has officially earned the necessary number of delegate votes in a virtual voting process to become the Democratic Party&#039;s standard-bearer for the Nov. 5 presidential election, the party&#039;s national committee chief said Friday.

Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, told CNN that the former president's statements were \"totally reasonable,\" saying, \"Look, all he said is that Kamala Harris is a chameleon.\" Conservative media personality Candace Owens defended Trump's statements as \"objectively funny.\"According to Michael Tesler, political science professor at the University of California Irvine, Trump's focus on Harris' race is likely an attempt to \"appeal to the large share of African American voters who hadn't seen Harris as sufficiently supportive of Black interests during the first three years of her vice presidency.\"\"But the way he went about doing it was so inept that it will almost certainly backfire with all audiences,\" Tesler told Newsweek via email.\"Trump's racist attacks on Harris will likely rally [Black voters] to her,\" he added. \"And most white Americans do not want to be seen as racist, so trafficking in explicitly racist appeals is not an effective strategy.\"Tesler pointed to an article he co-authored on July 9, which cited polling data by the Associated Press that found registered Black voters rated President Joe Biden six points more positively than Harris during the 2022 midterm elections.As the 2024 election cycle has progressed, that gap in Black support has seemingly closed. A YouGov/Economist poll released July 29 found that Harris had a 7-point lead in favorability rating among Black Americans than Biden (77.3 percent to 70.3 percent).But polling earlier in the year had shown Trump making gains among Black voters, meaning that his campaign's focus on Harris' race this week could risk the momentum.\"Trump and the party have made gains with Black and Latino voters,\" said Lee Hannah, political science professor at Wright State University. \"We saw that in the 2020 election results and we've seen it in some polls. He is certainly risking softening that support and mobilizing new voters who take offense to a racially-charged campaign.\"Hannah noted that, with less than 100 days until the election, there has been a clear difference between Harris and Trump's campaign messages. While he believes Harris \"has been remarkably disciplined and on message\" during her first two weeks in the 2024 race, Trump \"hasn't been able to find a clear and focused attack on Harris that is resonating.\"\"He still has time for that, but if the election doesn't go his way, I think a lot of people are going to look back at these past two weeks as a missed opportunity,\" Hannah told Newsweek. Several prominent Republicans have attempted to steer away from Trump's comments about Harris' racial heritage and instead encouraged their party to focus on Harris' policies under Biden's administration. North Carolina Thom Tillis said in a post to X, formerly Twitter, that the GOP was not \"gaining ground\" by commenting on \"anything but this Biden administration's failed economy, failed border, failed national security.\"U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also bashed Trump's comments while speaking to Punchbowl News on Thursday, saying, \"\"What have we been talking about all week long? ... Maybe they don't know how to handle the campaign, so they default to issues that simply should not be an issue.\"Hannah told Newsweek that Harris' team likely \"anticipated having to defend the Biden Administration's record\" when the vice president first launched her campaign, but that \"Trump's lack of focus has instead given her space to criticize Trump and make her case for president.\"\"Trump's team wants him to go after her record and positions, but instead they are spending time in cleaning up his comments from NABJ and answering questions about his running mate's quotes,\" Hannah added, referring to Vance's controversial past statements about women and reproductive rights.Tesler also described Harris' team as running an \"inclusive campaign that seeks to expand the Democratic coalition,\" while Trump is mainly firing up his MAGA base.\"This is, perhaps, most evident in their [vice president] selections,\" he added.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, held a similar opinion when talking to Newsweek over the phone Thursday about Trump's NABJ appearance, saying that Trump's campaign has \"been about the base. It's not been about expanding.\"\"I think they're going to have to figure out a different way,\" she added.\"It may be that their ... strategy is, we just need to get the folks that support Donald Trump to turn out in huge numbers,\" Walsh said. \"In which case they're just going to keep throwing red meat, which I think was what we saw [Wednesday].\"","summary":"Analysts told Newsweek that the former president's comments about Vice President Kamala Harris' race may turn off some voters before November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-campaign-tactics-could-backfireanalyst-1934034","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2442208/trumps-campaign-tactics-could-backfire-analyst.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:08:53","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":253267350,"title":"The FBI is back to meddling in free speech on social media","text":"They just can’t help themselves: The FBI is once again dipping its toes back into social-media meddling. In response to a Department of Justice report on “information sharing” about “foreign malign influence threats to U.S. elections” released in July, Associate Deputy Attorney General George. D. Turner issued a memo stating that the FBI “will resume regular meetings in the coming weeks with social media companies to brief and discuss potential FMI threats involving the companies’ platforms.” The info-sharing quarterly meetings began “after the 2018 midterm election and ended in mid-2023,” according to the DOJ’s report. Now the DOJ wants to start them up again, just in time for the 2024 election. Brace yourself: The FBI is going to work with social-media companies to squash information it doesn’t like. And maybe try, once again, to tilt the election away from Donald Trump. How do we know? Because it’s done it before. In 2022, Twitter File releases and other evidence showed the FBI was heavily involved in content moderation at social-media companies between 2020 and 2022, flagging accounts that the agency decided could be engaged in “foreign influence” and even bullying Twitter when the company did not respond the way the FBI wanted. Accounts and sites that purportedly posted “anti-Ukraine narratives” were treated with suspicion, including those that shared information about Hunter Biden’s role at Burisma. As independent journalist Matt Taibbi pointed out: “Intel about the shady origin of these accounts might be true. But so might at least some of the information in them — about neo-Nazis, rights abuses in Donbas, even about our own government. Should we block such material?” It’s worth noting that many of the government’s accusations of “foreign influence” couldn’t be substantiated by Twitter. The Democrats’ obsession with “disinformation” reached a head during Russiagate, which was used as an excuse to treat anyone posting right-wing material as possible foreign meddlers. An arguably even bigger crime was the government’s prepping platforms like Twitter and Facebook to dismiss the 2020 election-eve reports by The Post on Hunter Biden’s laptop, suggesting it was “foreign disinfo.” (And it wasn’t just the FBI: Remember the 51 Spies Who Lie? Many had CIA links.) By censoring our scoop, government officials and their social-media partners were attempting to directly tilt the election by hiding information from the voters. It’s abusive and anti-American: The cost of free speech, after all, is tolerating speech we disagree with; government officials have absolutely no business pressuring companies (especially ones they have leverage over) to publish or censor information. Given its record, it’s hard not to suspect that the FBI will now use its power over social-media companies to clamp down on speech that could help Donald Trump or hurt Democrats. Elon Musk, who bought Twitter (now called X) and vows to keep it open to free speech, may resist such efforts, but left-leaning outfits — Facebook, Google, etc. — are sure to play along. Keep that in mind the next time they squelch a Post story claiming it’s merely “foreign disinfo.”","summary":"Associate Deputy Attorney General George. D.

Asked if asked if Haniyeh’s assassination ruined the chances for a cease-fire agreement in Gaza, the prez said, “It doesn’t help.” Is he for real? Would any normal American have said taking out Osama bin Laden after 9/11 was inflammatory and jeopardized peace with al Qaeda? (Then again, Biden did oppose the US mission to kill the 9/11 terror chief. Pathetic.) Fact is, if Israel had a chance to eliminate the head of the terror group responsible for the Oct. 7 horrors, Ismail Haniyeh, it would’ve been nuts to pass it up. That is precisely what you do to murderous terrorists like Haniyeh. And that’s the answer Biden should’ve given. And by the way, killing Hamas’ leader should only increase the group’s desire for a cease-fire. Remember, Haniyeh’s death came as Israel confirmed that it had wiped out the group’s military leader in Gaza, Mohammed Deif. Israel is destroying Hamas, piece by piece. Of course the group would be more likely to agree to some sort of truce, if only to buy time before all its members are wiped out or forced to surrender. Yet whether for political reasons or a cowardly fear of escalation, Biden has failed to support Israel fully and has instead looked to appease Hamas. He’s also appeased its chief sponsor, Iran, easing off sanctions enforcement and OKing funding for it. When Iran fired more than 300 rockets, missiles and attack drones at Israel, Team Biden-Harris warned Jerusalem not to respond. He lets Iran get away with funding anti-Israel protesters who wreak havoc in America. He even allowed its proxies to attack US bases in the Middle East, killing three US soldiers, with near impunity. And make no mistake: Vice President Kamala Harris is fully onboard with that program. No wonder Iran seems to be pushing to stop Donald Trump from winning in November. It fears him more than Harris. New US intelligence suggests Iran is actively working — surreptitiously, via online influence operations — to undermine Trump’s candidacy. US spy agencies have “observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,” an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Tehran perceives correctly: Trump would would surely push back against it. As president, he took a tough line against Iran, withdrawing from the disastrous, pro-Iran 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions that slowed the Iranian economy. He also ordered the assassination of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force leader Qassem Soleimani, one of the most powerful men in the regime. Iran’s leaders want to him back in the White House much like people look forward to root canals. All of which explains why Iranian agents are waging covert online influence operations to hurt Trump, just as they did in 2020. It also explains the recent Iranian plot to assassinate the ex-prez. Given all the horrors Iran has caused, voters should pray for a president who’ll fight back. Tehran just let voters know which candidate it thinks will do that.","summary":"Yet again, President Biden took precisely the wrong position when he bashed Israel for taking out Hamas' leader, Ismail Haniyeh.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/opinion/irans-working-to-make-trump-lose-because-it-fears-his-wrath/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/us-president-joe-biden-briefly-86767170.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8047nsJs-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:04:41","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":253267568,"title":"UAW chief slams Donald Trump’s labor record","text":"In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Shawn Fain said former President Donald Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse if he’s elected again. “Trump has never supported working class people. He has never supported unions,” Fain said. “But he sure as hell was trying to pander for our votes now.” Fain has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against him at rallies and in speeches. Trump has called him an idiot, courting autoworkers’ votes by saying Fain is putting their jobs at risk by embracing a move to electric vehicles. Although the UAW has members across the nation, many auto-making jobs are concentrated in the Great Lakers region and Michigan, a key swing state that could decide the presidential race in November. This week, the UAW endorsed Harris. Trump and Harris realize that increasing their share of union votes gives them a much better chance of taking Michigan, where the last two presidential elections have been close, said Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton, and then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to President Joe Biden. Appealing to autoworkers helps to get votes from other union members, and union membership is high in the state at about 556,000, Masters said. That doesn’t include thousands of family members and union retirees, he said. Any swing in those votes would be consequential in the race. During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, Trump called on union workers to fire Fain, using false statements that Chinese auto companies are building factories in Mexico to ship vehicles to the U.S. without tariffs. Industry analysts say they aren’t aware of any such plants under construction, at least not yet. “You probably have to get rid of this fool, this stupid idiot representing the United Auto Workers,” Trump said at a July 20 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Trump claimed that he’ll get 95% of the UAW vote because Fain is pushing electric vehicles. “They’re going to be made in China,” he said. He also pledged to bring the auto industry back from obliteration if he’s elected. But the industry is far from obliteration. Since Biden took office in January 2021, employment making cars and parts has grown 13.8% to just over 1 million people, according to the Labor Department. Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have made billions in annual profits. Fain dismissed the insults as typical Trump behavior. “All the man does his name call, label people. He never has solutions,” Fain said. “That’s the problem in leadership. You need to find solutions.” The move from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by electricity is inevitable, Fain said, and union members need to be ready for it. During the transition, auto companies are still making gasoline vehicles and keeping factory workers employed, he said. Trump, he said, did nothing for autoworkers when General Motors closed its small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019. Biden, who last month announced he would drop out of the race and support Harris, helped to get GM to build an electric vehicle battery plant in the Lordstown area, replacing some of the lost jobs, Fain said. On Friday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Harris has secured enough votes from delegates to become her party’s nominee. Fain said he’s confident that Harris will remain an advocate for working people, citing her trip to walk picket lines with striking GM workers in 2019. “She was there with the president through a lot of things we’ve been through,” he said. “She’s been there for labor.” Of candidates to become Harris’ vice presidential choice, the union prefers Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Fain said. The union isn’t backing Arizona Senator Mark Kelly because he has opposed a bill that would boost union organizing, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro favors school vouchers, which would take send tax dollars to private schools and hurt public schools, Fain said. But even if Harris doesn’t pick one of the union’s favorites, the 370,000-member UAW would still put its political might behind her, Fain said. “I think she’s a brilliant woman. A very strong person,” Fain said. “She understands the issues. I think Trump’s just all talk. That’s all he’s ever been. He’s a showman.” In a statement, Trump’s campaign called Fain “a puppet for the Democrat party” who isn’t serving union laborers who are supporting Trump. “Shawn Fain’s empty words don’t matter — President Trump will take action to fight for the American auto worker,” the statement said.","summary":"Kamala Harris can boost the Democrats' chances of winning swing-state Michigan.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/02/uaw-chief-slams-donald-trump-labor-kamala-harris-michigan/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24215645153136-e1722639689541.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:02:53","author":"The Associated Press,Tom Krisher","authors":["The Associated Press","Tom Krisher"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":253267200,"title":"Vance says he’s called weird because Harris’ campaign is run by ‘social media interns bullied in school’","text":"JD Vance has come up with his own, somewhat unusual explanation for the ongoing attempts by the Harris campaign to brand him and Donald Trump as “weird.” The Republican vice presidential nominee laughed while discussing the Democrats’ new attack line against him, before suggesting that the label had been created by “social media interns” who had been “bullied in school.” The Harris for President campaign has ramped up attacks on Vance and Trump in recent days, with the label of “weird,” though seemingly innocuous, having stuck. “I certainly know the Kamala campaign wants to call me weird,” Vance said, during a recent episode of the Full Send podcast. “I don’t know if it’s something they focus-grouped and pushed on us. I’m a pretty normal guy, I’ve got a wife and kids and I like to hang out and watch football. And I care about this stuff because I care about the country.” He continued: “My best guess — this is just a total guess — is that her campaign is run by a lot of 24-year-old social media interns who maybe were bullied in school and so now they’ve decided they’re going to do the same thing. “They’re going to take that attitude of the middle school social scene and try to run a campaign on it… I just don’t think most Americans buy it or care.” Vance added: “My attitude is, I’m just gonna be who I am. If they want to attack me for whatever they’re going to attack me on that’s fine. You just have to power through and do your thing.” The Ohio Senator has been hounded by online users since becoming Trump’s running mate last month, as more and more of his past, questionable remarks, have emerged including calling the former president “America’s Hitler”. At one rally appearance, he claimed that his enjoyment of drinking Diet Mountain Dew soda would be branded by the Democrats as “racist.” A since-retracted fact-check article by The Associated Press titled “No, JD Vance did not have sex with a couch” also prompted ridicule online. Vance currently boasts the lowest favorability rating of any VP pick immediately after the party convention since the 1980s, with a net negative favorability of -6 points, according to CNN. The Harris campaign has also targeted Trump with its “weird” label, though the former president has lashed back in typical style. In an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham this week he claimed that it was Harris who is “weird.” “Just plain weird. You know who’s plain weird? She’s plain weird. She’s a weird person,” he said about the vice president. “Look at her past. Look at what she does.”","summary":"The Republican vice presidential nominee laughed while discussing the Democrats new attack line against him in a recent appearance on the Full Send podcast","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-weird-harris-campaign-interns-b2590506.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/14/hero_GettyImages-2152218732.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oyLda8DS-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 23:02:52","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":253267208,"title":"Letters: Desalination plan | Dead trees | Worthy honor | Climate crisis | Little change | Ultimate victory","text":"Desalination makes little sense on bay Re: “Agency officials OK feasibility study for desalination facility” (Page A1, July 23). Santa Clara Valley Water District’s desalination site options in San Francisco Bay make no sense. The proposed South Bay locations have the highest salt content. The lowest salt content (cheapest desalination cost) is at the confluence of San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento River in Suisun Bay. However, the bigger question is why SCVWD should build a desalination plant in the San Francisco Bay in the first place. Northern California communities would have all the water they need if we did not ship a massive amount of water to Southern California communities. Why should Santa Clara County water ratepayers pay for a desalination plant that indirectly enables shipping of more water to Southern California cities? It makes more sense for Southern California water users to build their own desalination plant for their water use.

Please use the power of your vote. Support candidates who recognize climate change for what it is — a global crisis that must be addressed. Paula Danz Los Altos Political chaos displays reluctance to change It may be an understatement to say that July 2024 was eventful in American politics. At the beginning of the month, the Supreme Court decided its case on presidential immunity; it has slowed down Donald Trump’s criminal trials and will (in my opinion) stain this country for as long as the ruling stands, which it may for decades. On July 13, there was an attempt on Trump’s life, which brought the country together in a politically polarized era. And on the 21st, Joe Biden suspended his reelection bid, marking the first time an incumbent president eligible for reelection did so since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968. Let’s hope that the next few months of the election season aren’t as chaotic as July. But it seems to me that the lessons of history are that people don’t learn from history and that human behavior has not changed much since civilization’s dawn.

With her new running mate expected to join her on stage no later than Tuesday, the selection process is now in its final hours. On Friday, The New York Times reported that vetting of the potential running mates has been completed after a Washington law firm reviewed candidates and presented the results to Harris. Reports are that this high-speed vetting was no fun for the potentials. Harris will reportedly be holding one-on-one sessions with each of the candidates over the weekend. It’s hard to imagine how vital these talks will be and how much is at stake. It’s enough to make the most confident governor, senator, or Cabinet secretary break out in a cold sweat. The NCAA tournaments lead to a Final Four and Miss America selects five finalists, but The Washington Post says that Harris has selected six potential running mates for this final round: Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Tim Walz of Minnesota; Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. There are no real surprises on this list, and all of them have the popularity and ability to be both assets in the campaign and capable partners down the line. The weekend meetings help explain a flurry of social media reports on Thursday revealing that candidates canceled appearances or shifted their schedules. It would not be surprising if all the members of the final six have shifted their calendars to make room for events this weekend, and possibly into next week. Over the past two weeks, several potential candidates have removed themselves from the list. That includes Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Gavin Newsom of California, and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. For those who are meeting with Harris this weekend, this is the final exam to end all final exams—one that could put them at her side for possibly the next eight years and open the potential for their own administration in the future. A lot of the analysis of a potential running mate centers on how they might affect the election. Would Shapiro lock down Pennsylvania? Would Beshear be the perfect counter to Donald Trump’s running mate, faux hillbilly JD Vance? Is Walz the perfect \"normal\" guy to fend off Republican “weird”? But Harris has to do more than pick a name to win this election. She has to select someone she can trust implicitly—someone who can do what she has done for Joe Biden and what Biden did for Barack Obama. And it seems like that decision is still in progress.

The body count. A ghost from my past popped up this week. The specter arose when the Sun-Times tipped the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office was hoping to move from its decades-old Harrison Street haunts to two buildings in the Fulton Market District. Back in 1967, the predecessor of the medical examiner’s office was the old Cook County Coroner’s office, a.k.a. the “Morgue,” and it was at 1828 W. Polk Street. In those days, one of the duties of a newly hired reporter at the legendary Chicago City News Bureau was to check out the morgue in search of possible stories. I was so new. It was still an era of pencils, notepads, typewriters, pneumatic tubes to transport news copy, and coin purses loaded with dimes and quarters to phone in scoops from whatever phone booth you could find. And, back then, the old coroner’s office was still rife with patronage — and as crooked as the trigger fingers that sent many of those corpses to the morgue. It had been that way pretty much since the office’s inception in 1858 and wouldn’t change until reform finally stuck in the 1970s. Back in 1967, it was a cold afternoon the first time I visited the morgue, on the orders of an elderly and rumpled, but highly respected, CNB editor named A. A. “Dornie” Dornfeld, who called his women reporters “chickie” and “girlie.” Tales from the crypts My visit had been arranged as an introduction. An attendant greeted me at the door. I wore a dress and probably carried a purse. The attendant gave me an official office rundown and then asked if I wanted to see the layout of the “place.” It was getting late. There was no story. I hesitated … but what the heck. As a Roman Catholic, I had seen the dead in open coffins at wakes and during pre-burial funeral services. But this “visit” was totally different. It was a tour of what they called “bays,” crypts housing the lost, the mangled, the murdered. The contorted forgotten ones laid out on slabs, some forever unidentified. The lights were flicked on and off to allow me to view the grim and dark cubicles. They were granted no privacy, even in death. Too stunned to act surprised, I wondered later that night if this had been a test to shock me, a joke by a morgue ghoul or just a way to gauge the mettle of one of the young woman reporters now occupying the desks of young newsmen who had been drafted to march off to war in Vietnam. I never asked. But I have often wondered. And thereafter, I would jettison the dress. Trump getting Trumped … The Slovenian connection: Donald Trump may be blasting President Joe Biden for what he considers mishandling “the high stakes negotiations” in the largest multi-country diplomatic exchange of American prisoners in Russia since the Cold War. But it was former first lady Melania Trump’s birth country of Slovenia that provided Biden the final piece to the puzzle to secure the release of the American hostages in Russia. “It all came together one hour before their release when the Slovenian prime minister released the Russian [prisoner] held in their custody,” Biden said. Melania Trump was born in Slovenia in 1970, when it was part of Yugoslavia. Her father, Viktor Knavs, now 80, had been a chauffeur and car salesman and was a member of the Communist Party. As many Slovenians did at the time, Viktor and Amalija Knavs had their children baptized as Catholics. When their son-in-law was president, the Knavs became U.S. citizens in 2018 through a family-based pathway that President Trump had denounced as “chain migration” when used by others, saying “often it doesn’t work out very well.” Amalija Knav died in January at the age of 78. Anyway, it’s a proud day to be an American … and for the members of former Russian hostage/Wall Street reporter Evan Gershkovich’s dinner group, which has continued to hold dinners in absentia for him. Imagine the upcoming homecoming feast. No Russian vodka, puleeze. A silent star … It’s no secret the Democratic National Convention in Chicago will pitch itself as a major showcase for American Democracy. So just asking: Will the newly retooled DNC showcase of stars supporting the presidential candidacy of veep Kamala Harris, include an invite to former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who bravely testified at the U.S. House Select committee hearing on Trump’s mendacious conduct during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol? J.B. for V.P? Hmmm. It’s looking more and more possible that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker could be steps away from becoming Dem presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s veep choice. To wit: Not only is Midwestern Gov.

But behind the scenes, months of nail-bitingly tense negotiations, near misses and fraught moral compromises had been playing out in the run-up to the largest East-West prisoner swap for decades. Not since the Cold War, when secret agents and political prisoners would be routinely exchanged on Berlin’s Bridge of Spies, have so many captives been traded. The remarkably complex deal, which saw 24 inmates freed from prisons in seven countries, had previously collapsed and was in doubt until just before it was sealed. Among those released were two captives holding British citizenship, eight Russian agents, four Americans, five Germans and five Russian anti-Putin activists. In the twilight hours of his presidency, embattled Joe Biden played the pacifier as Western officials bickered over terms. In particular, the Germans were reluctant to release Kremlin assassin Vadim Krasikov – who shot dead a Chechen exile in Berlin five years ago – reportedly fearing any swap would become ‘business model’ for Russia. But in hush-hush meetings on the fringes of other diplomatic gatherings, President Biden eventually convinced Chancellor Olaf Scholz to agree to it. According to analysts, this was the moral compromise – and it could prove to have lasting implications. Because if Vladimir Putin was previously unsure about whether he could recover valued henchmen, he no longer harbours any doubts on that score. It was a backstairs deal, if ever there was one. Due to Russia’s illegal invasion and occupation of Ukraine, East-West relations are at their worst for decades. Yet as this exchanged proved, spymasters in London, Washington and Moscow are still talking to each other. Throughout the negotiations, shadowy officials set up a special channel to discuss the various prisoner proposals. Among the detainees discussed was former US Marine Paul Whelan, a citizen of four countries, including Britain. He had been visiting Moscow to attend a wedding in December 2018 when he was arrested by balaclava-wearing Kremlin hoods who accused him of espionage. Mr Whelan spent 2,043 days in custody, singing national anthems to raise his spirits and was known to joke that the Russians thought they had arrested James Bond when actually they had detained Mr Bean. His ordeal finally ended at a quarter to midnight local time when a plane carrying him, Wall Street Journal correspondent Evan Gershkovich and others landed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Mr Whelan was the first to be greeted by Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. He saluted before shaking their hands. Months earlier it looked as if the deal had collapsed following the death of Putin critic and political rival Alexei Navalny, who perished in a Russian prison cell in February. Previously, Germany had been willing to trade Krasikov to secure Mr Navalny’s safety. But when he died, many observers thought the exchange would expire with him. Work to resuscitate the deal began immediately after his death at the Munich security conference – and continued even as Mr Biden undertook his disastrous TV debate against Donald Trump. On July 19, a Russian court found Mr Gershkovich guilty of spying and sentenced him to 16 years in a top-security detention centre. To the outside world, it had all the appearances of a devastating blow to the journalist. But those really in the know suspected otherwise. Prior to prisoner swaps, the Moscow authorities traditionally sentence to crushingly long prison terms those they are actually soon to release. Mr Gershkovich and the others received pardons yesterday as they finally tasted freedom.","summary":"Not since the Cold War, when secret agents and political prisoners would be routinely exchanged on Berlin 's Bridge of Spies, have so many captives been traded.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13704131/The-inside-story-deal-freed-journalist-Evan-Gershkovich-historic-prisoner-swap-Putin-critic-Alexei-Navalny-exchange-death-Russian-prison-writes-MARK-NICOL.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/02/23/88102887-0-image-m-10_1722638768310.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/01/5932421216208964809/1024x576_MP4_5932421216208964809.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:47:12","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol Diplomacy","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol Diplomacy"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":253267248,"title":"Assassination attempt: Secret Service will not give ‘real-time updates’ on disciplinary action","text":"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe vowed on Friday to provide “high-level” information on any disciplinary action he takes against agency employees over the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Rowe said, however, that he would not give “real-time updates” because of the internal nature of employee matters. Rowe’s remarks came as part of the first press conference the Secret Service has held on the shooting on July 13 that left one dead, two seriously injured, and Trump with a minor injury. The press conference marked an effort by Rowe to be transparent with the public after former Director Kimberly Cheatle faced widespread criticism over her refusal to answer certain questions on the security failures that led to the assassination attempt. Cheatle resigned less than two weeks after the incident. Rowe said his agency was conducting an internal investigation called a “mission assurance review” and that he “will not rush to judgment nor ignore due process” when it comes to reprimanding employees over the shooting. “If in fact there were policy violations, at that point now, it will go into a parallel path of a disciplinary type of investigation,” Rowe said. “Those are internal investigations that deal with employee matters so we’re not going to be able to provide real-time updates.” Rowe added that he would “at a high level provide at least some type of statement that people are being held accountable.” Rowe said that typically the Secret Service does not comment at all on open investigations but that the historic assassination attempt, the first on a president or former president in four decades, was an “extraordinary” circumstance. He indicated that he would provide more information in the coming weeks. Authorities say Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, climbed onto a nearby rooftop and fired eight rounds with an AR-15 rifle into a crowd at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Rowe shed new light on the communication gaps that occurred at the rally, saying the Secret Service countersniper who responded to the gunshots by killing Crooks had no awareness of an armed person on a roof until the shots were fired, in part because of technological failings. Rowe explained that interoperability is a regular challenge and that the Secret Service and local law enforcement were communicating on various networks, including cellular and radio networks. Radio warnings from local law enforcement about a gunman on the roof “did not make it over” to the Secret Service in time, Rowe said. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Rowe was adamant that the shooting was a Secret Service failure and not a local law enforcement failure.

According to US Weekly, the reality television star was a \"pageant queen growing up\" as she won Miss Sonoma County before competing in the Miss California and Miss Malibu USA events. In an episode of the 10th season of Vanderpump Rules the celebrity said, her career in the pageant had officially come to an end because of the ex-POTUS. Leviss who became a regular face of the reality show was simultaneously trying her luck in the Miss USA pageant. The Bravo star put the blame on Trump saying he changed the rule where competitors over the age of 27 may no longer be a part of the contest. As reported by Washington Post, \"Delegates must be at least 18 years of age and under 28 years of age on the date [that] the national competition commenced,\" to take part in the beauty pagaents. However, the contestants are free to take part in the pagaents every year. The Miss Universe website declared, \"Delegates may compete in their state or country pageants more than once, but may only compete at Miss Universe, Miss Teen USA or Miss USA once.\" Notably, the businessman-turned-politician had sold Miss Universe back in 2015 and the rule could have been changed by future owner. But Leviss held Trump responsible as reported by Cheatsheet. In an Instagram post back in 2022 she wrote, \"I just wrapped my last ever Miss California USA contestant headshot. [It’s] so bittersweet knowing this will be the last time I compete in a state pageant.\" She continued, \"Fingers crossed that it won’t be my very last pageant ever and that I will have the opportunity to represent California on the Miss USA stage ??You may know me as “the pageant girl” but my one wish is to debunk the stereotype that comes to mind. Through this experience I’ve met some of the most kindhearted girls who truly want to leave a positive impact on our world,\" as she spoke about the myths around pageant girls. \"The two things I have always strived for, as I competed on and off throughout the years of my young adult life, were self-improvement and building confidence,\" she said. \"Looking back at the times I did compete, I truly see such a beautiful transformation and I owe a lot of that to pageantry. I am so proud of the woman I have become. My thoughts and opinions are not only important but they are kind and beautiful,\" she added. Leviss concluded, \"A unique perspective is meant to be shared. If you have self doubt, try to understand why you’re seeking approval from others. Then turn around and give your younger self the validation that you have always deserved. Smiling and tearing up ? Okay, good chat. Bye! ? #pageantryreimagined.\"","summary":"In an episode of the 10th season of &#34;Vanderpump Rules&#34; Raquel Leviss said, her career in the pageant had officially come to an end because of Trump.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/how-donald-trump-put-an-end-to-vanderpump-rules-star-raquel-leviss-pageant-career","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708550/uploads/bc4f2420-5000-11ef-aec9-5102dd66381f_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:45:01","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.115},{"id":253266688,"title":"Philly mayor tweets puzzling video, sparking rumors Josh Shapiro is Kamala Harris’ running mate","text":"Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker sparked a frenzy Friday afternoon by seeming to leak the identity of Vice President Kamala Harris’ new running mate in a campaign ad-style video that described Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as Harris’ No. 2 on the Democratic ticket. “Kamala Harris for president — Josh Shapiro for vice president!” the mayor declared in the video. “Now we need you. Let us and Kamala Harris know you stand with her!” The video quickly went viral — with viewers questioning whether Parker had accidentally revealed Shapiro’s triumph in the veepstakes over other contenders, such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Tim Walz of Minnesota. A source close to Parker quickly told the Philadelphia Inquirer that she was simply making a show of support for Shapiro, whom she considers a “friend.” ”This is not an announcement of anything. This is just the mayor showing her support for a longtime friend who we know is one of the people being considered,” a source close to Parker told the local newspaper. National sources close to the Harris campaign told The Post that they strongly doubted the mayor leaked any closely held information. One source close the Harris campaign told The Post that the video was “odd,” but that they believe Parker was simply “trying to make ‘fetch’ happen.” Another source close to the campaign said it’s their understanding that Harris, 59, has not yet made a decision on her running mate — and that if she has, extremely few Democrats know the name. A third Post source, who is close to a different potential Harris running mate, said the selection was “still up in the air” so far as they’re aware. Context clues hint at the denials being true — including the fact that Parker posted a video wearing the same outfit on July 26, suggesting the footage indicating Shaprio was the VP pick could be more than a week old. Harris’ running mate decision is expected either over the weekend or early next week — with the yet-to-be-named pair expected to blitz the swing states with Harris in the coming days ahead of the Aug. 19-22 Democratic convention in Chicago. The pairing must be formalized by Aug. 7 in order to meet an Ohio ballot-access deadline. She is expected to speak with her running mate at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Harris on Friday secured enough voters in a virtual roll call to cement her status as the Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden, 81, abruptly ended his campaign for a second term on July 21 after a party mutiny over his apparent cognitive decline. Preliminary polling indicates that Shaprio, 51, could aid Harris’ campaign against former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania — though his political liabilities include past pro-Israel statements that could reignite Democratic infighting over the Israel-Hamas war. Parker’s office did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker sparked a frenzy Friday afternoon by seeming to leak the identity of Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217; new running mate in a campaign ad-style video that described Pennsylvania Gov.

I am honored to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. I will officially accept the nomination next week. This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are. Join us: https://t.co/abmve926Hz — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) August 2, 2024 Following this, Kamala Harris shared a post on X, and said, “I am honoured to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.”“I will officially accept the nomination next week. This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are,” she added.After this announcement, US President Joe Biden also shared a post on X and stated, that he made one of the best decisions to pick Kamla Harris as president adding he couldn’t be prouder.“One of the best decisions I’ve made was picking @KamalaHarris as my vice president. Now that she will be our party’s nominee, I couldn’t be prouder,” Joe Biden said on X.More than 4,000 convention delegates had until Monday to submit their ballots, but no other candidate qualified to challenge Harris, making her selection all but certain. Still, the formal nomination ascent of the first woman of colour to lead a presidential ticket marks a milestone for a nation long riven by racial and gender issues, as per the Washington Post. “I am honoured to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States,” Harris said on a call with supporters. “And I will tell you the tireless work of our delegates, our state leaders and staff has been pivotal in making this moment possible.”The announcement was made moments before by Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, who noted that Harris crossed the threshold just a day after online balloting began. The voting was opened on Monday.“The fact that we can say today — just one day after we opened voting — that the vice president has crossed the majority threshold and will officially be our nominee next week, folks, that is simply outstanding,” Harrison said.On July 27, Harris signed the forms, officially declaring her candidature for the US presidential elections, assuring that her people’s-powered campaign would win in November.Harris took to social media X and emphasised that in November, her people-powered campaign will win.She further reiterated that she would work hard to earn every vote.”Today, I signed the forms officially declaring my candidacy for President of the United States. I will work hard to earn every vote. And in November, our people-powered campaign will win,” Kamala Harris said in her post.After President Biden abruptly bowed out of the race on July 21 and endorsed Harris, Democratic leaders scrambled to create a nomination process that did not rely on state primary contests, all of which Biden had already won.The new nomination contest allowed anyone to run if they obtained 300 signatures of delegates supporting their bid, including no more than 50 from any single delegation while meeting other basic qualifications.With top party officials seeking to rally the party to confront the candidacy of Donald Trump, no elected Democratic politician besides Harris announced their intention to seek those signatures. The candidates who did signal their intent to seek the nomination failed to obtain the required signatures.On July 30, the Democratic National Committee said that 3,923 delegates had petitioned to put Harris on the ballot for the nomination, a large majority of the total delegate pool.Party leaders decided months ago, when Biden was still expected to be the nominee, to use a virtual vote to finalize the nomination, rather than waiting for the party convention in Chicago on August 19-22. They said the early nomination was needed because legal ambiguities in Ohio’s early deadlines meant that Biden could be kept off the ballot in that state. Ohio ultimately amended its timeline for ballot qualification, but the Democrats stuck to their plans for a virtual nomination. Under the party’s rules, delegates do not need to vote on Harris’s vice-presidential selection.Democratic convention planners are preparing a symbolic roll call for prime-time television coverage in Chicago, with representatives of each state offering their votes for Harris in a customized fashion.Harris becomes just the second person of colour in America’s nearly 250-year history to head a major presidential ticket, after Barack Obama in 2008. Harris is Black and Indian American, and Trump has recently attacked her identity and suggested that she formerly downplayed her Black heritage, an assertion for which there is no evidence.Harris will also be the second female major-party nominee, after Hillary Clinton in 2016, when Clinton lost to Trump in a contest that stunned Democrats and upended the political landscape.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/08/us-election-kamla-harris-officially-secures-democratic-nomination-for-president/","image":"https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_lossy+ret_img+to_webp/thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ANI-News-Logo-96x96.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:35:34","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.014},{"id":253266466,"title":"Acting Secret Service Director acknowledges additional failures in Donald Trump assassination attempt and addresses personnel changes following former president’s shooting","text":"Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe continued to reveal failures Friday from the day former President Donald Trump was nearly assassinated while speaking at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Rowe also revealed that nobody has been fired yet over Trump’s near-death experience. The acting director explained that Secret Service officials had no radio communications with local police and weren’t aware Thomas Matthew Crooks had a gun aimed at the ex-president before he opened fire. Rowe confirmed that ‘there was somebody who did, in fact radio out that they had seen the individual with a weapon.’ ‘What I can tell you is that piece of information, that vital piece of information, and by no fault of anyone, it was a very stressful situation, it did not make it over,’ Rowe said. Local and state law enforcement officers aren’t on the same radio network as Secret Service agents. Trump’s Secret Service detail, Rowe said, was ‘operating under the assumption’ from the last bit of information that they received. ‘That there was an issue that the locals were working at the three o’clock,’ he said, using a clock as a directional cue. ‘That’s a bit of information that we had. Not anything about a weapon.’ In fact, more details about the threat were being shared, when the gunshots rang out. ‘So the former president’s detail – they had an advanced person on the ground who was responsible for the site,’ Rowe said. ‘The radio transmission goes out about locals working an issue at the 3 o’clock.’ ‘The member of that detail called their Pittsburgh Field Office counterpart. “Hey, what do you know about this?” In the midst – right in the middle of that phone conversation, the shots begin firing,’ Rowe said. The former president is a fan of holding large outdoor rallies, but Rowe suggested that busy radio chatter – from people making medical emergency requests due to the heat – could have played a role clogging up the airwaves at a vital time. Rowe said that about 100 calls had been made for support ahead of the shooting. ‘It was a very hot day that day,’ Rowe explained. ‘There were a lot of – not only EMS type of calls to address people but, there were people that needed some other type of law enforcement assistance.’ ‘This happens. Candidly happens a lot at outdoor rallies where, especially on hot days,’ the acting director continued. ‘So there was a lot of traffic, radio traffic on the local net about, “Hey, I need an EMT here.” So there were a lot of people that were needing assistance,’ Rowe said. Rowe said it was now ‘plainly obvious’ that the Secret Service didn’t have the information they needed, but refused to assign blame. ‘It just so happened that there was a sense of urgency, that there might have been radio traffic that we missed,’ he said. ‘We have to do a better job at that.’ During the press conference, which ran under an hour, Rowe revealed that he would ‘provide some type of statement that people are being held accountable’ when asked if the American public would be informed about firings over the assassination attempt. He also said that all the main principals – Trump, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance and whomever Harris chooses for her VP would all get Secret Service sniper teams at their events going forward. Rowe was also asked about an allegation from a whisteblower that he ‘personally directed’ cuts to the agency’s Counter Surveillance Division, the unit tasked with evaluating event sites in advance. ‘I’ve become aware of this. We got a congressional letter on it. What I can tell you is that the Counter Surveillance Division, they do a fantastic job,’ Rowe said. He said that he was aware of the allegations that he had denied requests to utilize them. ‘The Counter Surveillance Division has been out there supporting the former president at some very high-profile events. They continue to provide that support and they’re out there providing support right now,’ Rowe said. When asked to clarify if he cut CSD resources he responded, ‘I did not, no.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe continued to reveal failures Friday from&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Acting Secret Service Director acknowledges additional failures in Donald Trump assassination attempt and addresses personnel changes following former president&#8217;s shooting first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/acting-secret-service-director-acknowledges-additional-failures-in-donald-trump-assassination-attempt-and-addresses-personnel-changes-following-former-presidents-shooting/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Acting-Secret-Service-Director-admits-more-staggering.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:34:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.813},{"id":253266508,"title":"How Kamala Harris became first black woman and Asian American US presidential nominee","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris received enough votes to clinch the Democratic Party’s nomination on Friday (Picture: AP) Vice President Kamala Harris has made history by becoming the first black woman and Asian American to be the presidential nominee of a major US political party.

President Joe Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign on July 21 and minutes later, endorsed his vice president, Harris, to replace him as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Biden called his decision to choose Harris as his second-in-command when he won the 2020 election, the ‘best decision I’ve made’. Democrats quickly united in support of Harris, despite some other names who were tossed around including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Maryland Governor Wes Moore. Though there was earlier talk of potential candidates competing ahead of the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, Harris for the past couple of weeks has enjoyed running unopposed. Kamala Harris was the first woman, black and South Asian American to become vice president (Picture: AP) How has Kamala Harris made history?

It comes after she made history in 2020, becoming the first woman, black and South Asian American to become vice president. Glenda Carr, who heads the Higher Heights organization helping black women run for office, told CBS News that ‘this is an exciting moment about her making history’ and that ‘her candidacy sets a new direction in the way that we talk about Black women’s political leadership’. Democratic National Convention Chair Minyon Moore ahead of the roll call vote said that Harris ‘has earned the right to run this race and run it in a dignified way’. Former President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ racial background in a combative panel discussion on Wednesday (Picture: Getty Images) What did Donald Trump say about Kamala Harris’ racial background? Former President Donald Trump, who secured the Republican nomination in mid-July, attacked Harris’ racial identity in a combative interview at the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday. ‘She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,’ said Trump. ‘I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black?’ Trump faced heavy criticism for questioning Harris’ racial background as numerous polls have shown Harris edging slightly ahead of him. As of Friday morning, 538 had polling averages showing Harris leading Trump with 45% support from voters versus 43.5%. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Judge Sean Lane initially tossed out the case last month, citing Giuliani’s lack of financial transparency and his apparent attempts to evade court orders. But Giuliani’s lawyers and and his bankruptcy creditors were left trying to figure out how the former mayor would pay tens of thousands of dollars he owes for administrative fees, whether he can actually pay any of it, and how much money he has on hand — questions that have also been at the center of the bankruptcy case. Giuliani’s agreement to pay off his administrative costs means that he will dodge further scrutiny over his financial disclosures — including having to testify under oath, which Judge Lane had suggested was a possibility. But the end of the bankruptcy proceedings means his creditors can continue to push the courts for what they say they are owed. The parties had all agreed last month that dismissing the bankruptcy proceedings would be the best way forward for debtors to try to collect, including $148 million that a jury awarded a pair of election workers who were subject to harassment and threats after Giuliani defamed them with bogus claims about their actions during the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss can now rely on the courts to seek what they’re owed, including potentially seizing his assets. Giuliani’s attorneys told the court last month that dismissing the case would give him the “best chance” of appealing that defamation verdict. Under the terms of the order, the former mayor must hand over $100,000 to his lawyers “to be held in escrow for the purpose of paying allowed professional fees and expenses,” according to an order signed by Judge Lane and approved by the parties earlier this week. The remaining fees shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale of either Giuliani’s New York City apartment or Florida condo, “whichever sale occurs first.” Giuliani’s New York condo, which has been up for sale on and off throughout the year, is valued at around $5.6 million, while his Florida condo is valued at about $3.5 million. The former mayor’s lawyer previously argued against their client selling both places, claiming that it would result in Giuliani “join[ing] the ranks of the homeless.” Global Data Risk, the firm whose expenses Giuliani has been ordered to pay, can also force a sale in six months if he doesn’t take action. Giuliani filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2023 in the wake of a nearly $150 million defamation judgment for his election lies. A bizarre monthslong behind-the-scenes courtroom drama that followed has laid bare his financial state as he battles criminal indictments across the country. The defamation verdict is among a growing list of legal obligations for Giuliani, including criminal charges in Georgia and in Arizona for his efforts to reverse Donald Trump’s election loss in those states. He also is an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal criminal case surrounding Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Giuliani also is being sued by voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic for defamation. A former Dominion executive has separately sued Giuliani. Creditors separately asked the judge to impose sanctions against Giuliani after failing to comply with document requests. Last month, the creditors’ committee’s lawyers accused him of treating “the bankruptcy process as a joke, hiding behind the facade of an elderly, doddering man.” The order came days after a scheduled hearing involving a case from a former employee-turned-sexual assault accuser Noelle Dunphy. Dunphy had asked for the New York Supreme Court to unfreeze the case and to “place this matter back on the active calendar” at the “earliest convenient date” once the bankruptcy case came to an end. Giuliani’s lawyers asked to push back the court date, arguing that “lifting the bankruptcy stay is premature and improper” because Lane had called into question whether the dismissal would stick.","summary":"Election workers awarded $148 million after winning a defamation case against the disgraced former mayor can now try to get what they’re owed through the courts, including seizing his assets","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rudy-giuliani-bankrupt-case-dismissed-b2590493.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/25/18/SEI213112548.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/dZ19CSSh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:21:47","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":253266658,"title":"U.S. to send more warships, fighter jets to Middle East to bolster defences","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories One dead and two hurt in Stratford, Ont. shooting, suspect also dead Shocking new details have been released about Thursday night's triple shooting in Stratford, Ont.

Samerano’s son, Yonatan, was killed and his “body was seized and taken to the Gaza Strip by an UNRWA employee after he was killed by Hamas terrorists on October 7,” according to the Times of Israel. Israel has said that several UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7 attacks; that many belong to terrorist organizations, and that many applauded the attacks. Several countries suspended their funding as a result, though some have resumed it. Lazzarini delivered a pro-Palestinian speech in the Swiss town of Lausanne on the occasion of Switzerland’s “National Day.” But he was heckled mercilessly by Samerano, who stood up wearing a T-shirt with her son’s image on it, and the words: “UNRWA kidnapped my son! Where is he, Mr. Lazzarini?” UN Watch reported: Lazzarini delivered the keynote address for the city of Lausanne’s National Day celebrations, and on the 300th day of the captivity of Yonatan’s body in Gaza. The decision of Lausanne’s Socialist Party mayor Grégoire Junod to invite Lazzarini sparked outrage among many in Switzerland due to UNRWA’s ties to terror. … “An UNRWA worker kidnapped my son. A social worker for a so-called humanitarian organization kidnapped my son,” said Samerano. Israel has called on Lazzarini to be fired and has said that UNRWA will have no role in postwar Gaza.

A young gunman shot at Trump, 78, when he was addressing an election rally in Butler. Trump escaped the assassination attempt, as a bullet flew within a millimetre of him and one of them hit his right ear. “The Secret Service takes full responsibility for the tragic events of July 13th. This was a mission failure. The sole responsibility of our agency is to make sure our protectees are never put in danger. We fell short of that in Butler. And I'm working to make sure that this failure does not happen again,” Acting Director of the US Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, told reporters at a news conference here. The main role of Secret Service is to protect the President, the former presidents and their family members. Presidential nominees also get protection of the secret service. Rowe said that the Secret Service will continue to cooperate with pending oversight investigations of the July 13 failure being done now by Congress, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, and the independent review directed by President Joe Biden. “I am not waiting for the completion of those reports, and I've directed the Secret Service to take immediate steps to ensure our protectees are indeed safe. I am committed to pursuing accountability for the Secret Service's failure in Butler, Pennsylvania. “But let me be clear. If policy violations by Secret Service personnel are identified by the agency's Mission Assurance Review, those individuals will be held accountable. They will be held accountable to our fair and thorough disciplinary process,” he said. Giving the sequence of events of July 13, Rowe said at 5.30 pm, Trump arrived at the campaign rally via Secret Service motorcade, and at that time, he met with supporters in a secure backstage area within the protective site. At 5.45 pm, a local Butler County Emergency Services Unit counter sniper team member texted the Secret Service counter sniper team leader about a suspicious person and sent two photos of the individual, later identified as the assailant. At 5.53 pm, the Secret Service counter sniper team leader texted the Secret Service counter sniper teams that local law enforcement was looking for a suspicious individual outside of the perimeter lurking around the AGR building. At this time, Secret Service personnel were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual. At 6 pm, former President Trump took the stage to begin remarks. “Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the AGR building with a firearm. It is my understanding that personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,” he said. “At 6.11 pm, a member of the former President Trump's protective detail contacted their Pittsburgh field office counterpart to inquire about the radio update that there was an issue local law enforcement was looking into near the perimeter. “At 6.11 pm, the assailant's first volley of three shots was fired, and within three seconds, the former president's detail rushed the stage and covered Trump, shielding him with their own bodies,” Rowe said giving the timeline of the failed assassination bid on July 13. “The fourth-through-eight shots took place over the next several seconds. Fifteen and a half seconds after the assailant's first shot, a Secret Service counter sniper fired a single round that neutralised the assailant,” he said. Rowe told reporters that this was a failure. “We should have had better protection for the protectee. We should have had better coverage on that roof line. We should have had at least some other set of eyes from the Secret Service point of view covering that. That building was very close to that outer perimeter, and we should have had more of a presence,” he said. “This was a Secret Service failure. That roof line should have been covered. We should have had better eyes on that,” he added.

Vice President Harris is of Indian and Jamaican descent, which has confused many Trump supporters, including the former U.S. president. During an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention this week, Trump drew backlash for questioning Harris’s racial identity. “She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she became a Black person,” Trump said. Trump went further and took to Truth Social to share a video from 2020 that featured The Office alum Mindy Kaling cooking Masala dosa with Harris. In the video, Kaling called the VP “Crazy Kamala” and a “stone-cold phony.” Kaling tells Harris, “We’re both South Indian.” Harris then replies, “Yes, you look like the entire one-half of my family.” “Damn, I forgot how weird The Office got after Michael Scott left,” Chieng joked. Chieng went on to slam Trump, saying, “How did he even find this? Was he doing a deep oppo research on Mindy Kaling’s Instagram page? How far down the Mindy rabbit hole did he go? Is he going to come out next week like, ‘Kamala Harris is not Black, and Mindy and B.J. Novak belong together, OK? Do the right thing B.J. Make an honest Indian out of her.’” The Daily Show host commented that the video “doesn’t even prove his point,” adding, “He’s saying Kamala identifies as Indian and not Black. And this is a video of her saying, ‘I’m half Indian.’ What does Trump think the other half is? Woman? How does this guy not understand what half means?” “He constantly tells us he’s a genius, but he can’t comprehend a golden doodle?” Chieng continued before joking, “Also, Trump doesn’t get to decide how Black a Black person is. Only Kendrick Lamar can do that, OK?” Watch the entire The Daily Show segment below.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRonny Chieng took to The Daily Show to call out Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ronny Chieng from &#8216;The Daily Show&#8217; criticizes Donald Trump for involving Mindy Kaling in controversy over Kamala Harris&#8217;s racial background. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/ronny-chieng-from-the-daily-show-criticizes-donald-trump-for-involving-mindy-kaling-in-controversy-over-kamala-harriss-racial-background/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-‘The-Daily-Shows-Ronny-Chieng-Drags-Donald.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:14:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":253267134,"title":"Why Does “Weird” Work?","text":"It began with Tim Walz on Morning Joe. Auditioning for the Democratic nod for vice president, the Minnesota governor steamed through complaints about the Republican politics of the present. Sen. JD Vance, Walz said, “gets it all wrong” when he talks about small-town values. “It’s not about hate. It’s not about collapsing in. The golden rule [in rural America] is mind your own damn business.” Walz argued Republican policies had destroyed Vance’s imagined idyllic America; conservatives had pushed division through book bans and an isolated world wrought by trickle-down economics. “We do not like what has happened,” Walz said, seeming to speak for an unmentioned mass of people, “where we can’t even go to Thanksgiving dinner with our uncle because you end in some weird fight that is unnecessary.” The host laughed. “Well, it’s true,” Walz responds to the chortle, “these guys are just weird.” Since then, the word has become a catchphrase for Democrats to describe their conservative opponents, infuriating Republicans. “Weird” has done a particularly good job where other Democratic slogans have failed. I think the main reason is that Walz’s attack flips the usual Republican appeal to a silent majority. For years, demagoguery on the right has been a way of telling Americans that their racism and hatred are shared—broadly accepted if not broadcast. In so doing, there is invoked a myth of normalcy; the unspoken-for bigoted masses. In this way, the right self-victimizes. They say they speak for the “forgotten man,” as historian Lawrence Glickman has written, downtrodden by the government and forced to appease; here is “a cross-class group of productive white people [who] are forced to subsidize unproductive and unworthy others.” These normal people, conservatives say, are burdened by all this liberal bullshit. “Weird” reverses and intervenes at the crucial point of transmission of that idea. No, it says, the appeals by the right to supposed family values (anti-trans bigotry; restricting no-fault divorce; slashing public school funding; hatred of immigrants) are not normal. They aren’t fundamental American values that the liberal elites have somehow derailed. They are, instead, deeply strange. And “we” (a new silent majority that Walz invokes in his use of “weird”) are tired of it. Democrats have long failed to sound like real people when playing cultural politics. Finally, with “weird,” they sound honest. The Minnesota governor said it randomly and doubled-down. It is not a shifting, focus group–tested insult brought back to life from a vaudeville talkie (“morals of an alley cat!”). It is a jibe that sounds human. So often Democratic hits against Trump, and, importantly, against those who voted for him, have been horrific. Not bad—but terrible. During the 2016 race, Hillary Clinton said half of Trump’s voters fit into a “basket of deplorables“; she described a misbegotten group economically blighted into bigotry. Clinton meant this as a way to speak honestly about how many Americans truly believe bad things. But it did not sound that way. Clinton’s comments caused such havoc because they seemed to reveal how she really felt about a huge swath of Americans (more than 30 million, apparently), shining a light on what the worst version of the modern Democratic Party believes. She described a group of forgotten Americans, too—and she said they are to be pitied; these poor souls duped on cultural issues. Oh well, the idiots vote for Trump! What can you do? It was a liberal version of the infamous comment by Sen. Mitt Romney about how “47 percent” of people are just beholden to the Democratic Party because of public benefits. The “deplorables” comment and the subsequent meandering around America to talk to Trump voters produced this constantly from Democrats. They did not say what they felt because what they felt was disgust. Even the empathy reeked of sanctimony. Walz’s comment, by contrast, implies a new Democratic take. It does not pity. It does not look from the outside at Trump voters. And it does not assume with condescension. Instead, it implies Trump voters are known, even members of your family—specifically, your uncle—whose annoying opinions have been allowed to flow free. And Jesus Christ man now everyone is weird as hell and ruining the holidays. Deplorables could be adopted as the majority condescended to by out-of-touch liberals. (We’re all deplorables!) But “weird” cannot be co-opted to stand for a silent majority. It is something the majority says about the people making your life worse. In this way, it makes Republican family values abnormal and odious. A neat trick. Vance is a good target for this. His book, Hillbilly Elegy, ironically is the flip side of the same coin as “deplorables.” It says, yes, please do understand the Trump voters—I will say they are culturally broken. To understand the Republican nominee for vice president, as I’ve written before, is less about what has changed about him since 2015 than about what has not changed: Vance has always been someone trying to do some version of Trumpism without Trump—and explain the appeal to the upper classes. Before it was to sell books to liberals; now it’s to get people on board for MAGA 2024. So much of the first Trump era (God it’s been almost a decade of this) has forced pundits and opponents to try to understand Trump as a person. Good luck. The entire exercise has felt like an exhausting, stupid psychoanalytic chasing of one’s own tail by political journalists and columnists. Vance and Project 2025 have helped shift the focus to Trump’s substance in a way that lets Democrats attack his policies without attacking his voters’ identities. Vance is the living embodiment of how Trump’s America has made a bunch of semi-normal politicians into absolute freaks. So, when you call the MAGA elite weird, you’re saying how Trump and his policies forced a strangeness on all of us. “Weird,” as a word, has an interesting valence on this point. Instead of a general mangling of phrases over time in English, you can be rather specific with its etymology. In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, there are three witches—the Weyward Sisters. Or, as we know them now, the Weird Sisters. That is where weird basically comes from. These witches are not simply oddballs. Instead, they control, or channel, fate with a particular and twisted sense of morality. That history gives weird a specific connotation: It is not simply eccentricity; it implies a dark and imposing freakishness. The Weird Sisters do strange stuff and it actively makes the world worse. If you’ll allow me to stretch here, I think that’s how Republican policies feel when described by Vance. These things he wants, these cultural politics—about sex, love, lust, parents, children, the family—have all been presented as conservatives saying let’s get back to normal. And it gives us that normality as the strict straitjacket of the American family. They impose on your private life. And so the reason Walz’s comment stuck, I have come to think, is because weird describes that. It shows these forces—like those witches, like Vance’s tech bro–inflected cultural extremism—that disrupt the fate of your family and your community without your control or say. As I watched Walz, I could not help but think of another famous moment. In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson released a famous ad called “The Confession of a Republican” against his radical right opponent Sen. Barry Goldwater. “I’ve always been a Republican,” a man explains, in his suit and glasses. He appears almost, as John Dickerson has noted, to be engaged in a therapy session. The conservative, alone—working through his anxieties. “I mean, when the head of the Ku Klux Klan, when all these weird groups come out in favor of the candidate of my party,” the man laments, “either they’re not Republicans or I’m not.” That ad gained a second life in 2016, as conservatives kvetched about the ascension of President Donald Trump. That Republican moment has long passed. Trump is the standard bearer of his party. Many on the right do not need absolution anymore, simply permission. In the story of Vance—his switch from Never Trumper to running mate—we see the answer to what happens when you do not say it is not possible for weird people to support your party. In trying to figure out how to become a Trumpist, he has accidentally revealed the core of the former president’s appeals to common sense. How, at the bottom, a lot of what the right thinks is normal—about the family, about the markets, about immigrants, about race—is, when you try to explain it, weird.","summary":"It began with Tim Walz on Morning Joe.&#160; Auditioning for the Democratic nod for vice president, the Minnesota governor steamed through complaints about the Republican politics of the present.

Now Hugh Hewitt is Furious. In an appearance on the right wing Full Send podcast (full video) this week that posted Friday, Senator Vance said, “I don’t know if you guys remember this. But there was this thing that happened in Charlottesville where a white supremacist killed this girl and, very tragic situation. And the media said Trump stood up for the white supremacist, and there was a time in my life where I would have believed the media, what they said about it, and then you go and read what the transcript of what he actually said. It’s like, wait a second, he actually condemned the white supremacist.” (Vance’s suggestion that Trump never condemned white supremacists is erroneous. During that press conference a reporter asked him specifically, “Why did you wait so long to denounce neo-Nazis?” which kicked off the “both sides” remarks. Trump on August 12 did not specifically condemn white supremacists, on August 14, after nationwide outrage, he did.) “He never said that there were ‘very good people on both sides.’ What he said is that some of the protesters were good people, not like the white supremacist who murdered this girl. And you realize so much of what the media says about this guy is totally dishonest. I think once you accept that frame of mind, you start to think for yourself a little bit and when I started doing that, I started realizing one, he’s a good president, but two, he’s just not the guy. He’s not the scary person the media makes him out to be.” Watch the videos above or at this link.","summary":"Donald Trump’s vice-presidential running mate JD Vance is falsely claiming as President in 2017, Trump did not make his infamous “very fine people on both sides” remarks after the deadly Charlottesville “Unite the Right” white supremacist neo-Nazi rally.

The video is titled ‘We Choose Freedom’ and features the song ‘Freedom’ by Beyonce, which is also being used as Harris’ walkout song at events. While Beyonce has not officially endorsed the vice president as of now, a source familiar confirmed Beyonce’s team gave the campaign permission to use the song. The video is also narrated by the vice president herself and is being promoted across the campaign’s social media platforms. In it, Harris lays out her priorities as her campaign scrambles to reintroduce Harris to the American people as the Democratic presidential candidate. She also goes on a blistering attack on former President Donald Trump. But noticeably absent from the minute-twenty video: any mentions of President Biden or images of them together. ‘In this election, we each face a question,’ Harris says in the video. ‘What kind of country do we want to live in?’ ‘There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate, but us, we choose something different. We choose freedom,’ she continues. The video starts with imagery of an American flag and Harris supporters waving ‘Kamala’ signs at her rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday. It then cuts to ominous images of Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance. Later in the video, Harris calls for a future where ‘no one is above the law.’ At that point it shows an image of Trump’s mugshot from his Georgia election interference case as well as headlines from when Trump was indicted and found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York. Harris has been taking the fight to Trump in her speeches. At her first rally, she touted prosecuting predators and said Trump is one. She spoke of taking on fraudsters and slammed Trump for being guilty of fraud. While the new video features images of Trump, it does not mention the Republican presidential nominee by name, and besides the directed lines, it is a more optimistic introduction of the Democratic candidate. The video relies heavily on images of Harris supporters holding signs and cheering from Harris’ first campaign rally with voters as a presidential candidate. The Milwaukee event was attended by three-thousand people in the all-important swing state. It also features pride flags, families, construction workers and physicians. ‘The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,’ Harris says. She calls for a future ‘where no child lives in poverty’ and ‘where we all can afford health care.’ It ends with Harris’ rallying cry she is enthusiastically using on the campaign trail. ‘We believe in the promise of America and we are ready to fight for it,’ she says. ‘Because when we fight, we win.’ While the campaign’s first video was released on social media, it has not yet placed any political ad buys on television featuring the vice president. However, the campaign has been advertising on digital. The same day Biden dropped out of the race, it started posting digital ads promoting the president’s endorsement of Harris and pushed supporters to raise money for her run for president. In just over 24 hours, the Harris campaign raised more than $100 million from more than 1.1 million donors.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris released her first video promoting her run for president&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; new campaign video excludes a significant name and fiercely criticizes another person. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kamala-harris-new-campaign-video-excludes-a-significant-name-and-fiercely-criticizes-another-person/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-releases-first-campaign-video-that.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-02 22:01:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.074},{"id":253266460,"title":"UAW leader says Trump would put labor movement into reverse if he’s elected again","text":"DETROIT — Putting Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket increases the Democrats’ chance of winning Michigan and keeping the White House in November, the head of the United Auto Workers union says. In an interview Friday with the Associated Press, Shawn Fain said former President Donald Trump is beholden to billionaires, knows nothing about the auto industry and would send the labor movement into reverse if he’s elected again. “Trump has never supported working-class people. He has never supported unions,” Fain said. “But he sure as hell was trying to pander for our votes now.” Fain has become a top nemesis of the Republican presidential nominee, who frequently rails against him at rallies and in speeches. Trump has called him an idiot, courting autoworkers’ votes by saying Fain is putting their jobs at risk by embracing a move to electric vehicles. Although the UAW has members across the nation, many automaking jobs are concentrated in the Great Lakers region and Michigan, a key swing state that could decide the presidential race in November. This week, the UAW endorsed Harris. Trump and Harris realize that increasing their share of union votes gives them a much better chance of taking Michigan, where the last two presidential elections have been close, said Marick Masters, a business professor emeritus at Wayne State University who follows labor issues. Trump won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton, then lost the state four years later by nearly 154,000 votes to President Biden. Appealing to autoworkers helps to get votes from other union members, and union membership is high in the state at about 556,000, Masters said. That doesn’t include thousands of family members and union retirees, he said. Any swing in those votes could be consequential in the race. During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last month, Trump called on union workers to fire Fain, falsely claiming that Chinese auto companies are building factories in Mexico to ship vehicles to the U.S. without tariffs. Industry analysts say they aren’t aware of any such plants under construction – at least not yet. “You probably have to get rid of this fool, this stupid idiot representing the United Auto Workers,” Trump said of Fain at a July 20 rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Trump claimed that he’ll get 95% of the UAW vote because Fain is pushing electric vehicles. “They’re going to be made in China,” he said. He also pledged to bring the auto industry back from obliteration if he’s elected. But the industry is far from obliterated. Since Biden took office in January 2021, employment making cars and parts has grown 13.8% to just over 1 million people, according to the Labor Department. Detroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have made billions in annual profits. Fain dismissed the insults as typical Trump behavior. “All the man does is name-call, label people. He never has solutions,” Fain said. “That’s the problem in leadership. You need to find solutions.” The move from internal combustion vehicles to those powered by electricity is inevitable, Fain said, and union members need to be ready for it. During the transition, auto companies are still making gasoline vehicles and keeping factory workers employed, he said. Trump, Fain said, did nothing for autoworkers when General Motors closed its small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019. Biden, who last month announced he would drop out of the race and support Harris, helped to get GM to build an electric vehicle battery plant in the Lordstown area, replacing some of the lost jobs, Fain said. On Friday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee said Harris has secured enough votes from delegates to become her party’s nominee. Fain said he’s confident that Harris will remain an advocate for working people, citing her trip to walk picket lines with striking GM workers in 2019. “She was there with the president through a lot of things we’ve been through,” he said. “She’s been there for labor.” Of candidates to become Harris’ vice presidential choice, the union prefers Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, followed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Fain said. The union isn’t backing Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly because he has opposed a bill that would boost union organizing, while Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro favors school vouchers, which would send tax dollars to private schools and hurt public schools, Fain said. But even if Harris doesn’t pick one of the union’s favorites, the 370,000-member UAW would still put its political might behind her, Fain said. “I think she’s a brilliant woman. A very strong person,” Fain said. “She understands the issues. I think Trump’s just all talk. That’s all he’s ever been. He’s a showman.” In a statement, Trump’s campaign called Fain “a puppet for the Democrat party” who isn’t serving union laborers who are supporting Trump. “Shawn Fain’s empty words don’t matter – President Trump will take action to fight for the American auto worker,” the statement said.

The online voting process doesn’t end until Monday, but the campaign marked the moment when she crossed the threshold to have the majority of delegates’ votes. Harris is poised to be the first woman of color at the top of a major party’s ticket. “I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee,\" Harris said on a call with supporters. Harrison said “we will rally around Vice President Kamala Harris and demonstrate the strength of our party” during its convention in Chicago later this month. Democrats have pushed ahead with a virtual vote to nominate Harris, nearing the culmination of a turbulent process that was upended by President Joe Biden’s decision not to seek reelection. Delegates to the Democratic National Convention began voting via secure email on Thursday, and the voting will remain open until Monday evening. Harris has not yet chosen her running mate, and she's expected to interview candidates over the weekend. The formal nomination is expected to be finalized by Aug. 7 even though the party's convention in Chicago isn't scheduled to begin for more than two more weeks. Democratic officials have said the accelerated timeline was necessary because of an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure candidates appear on the Ohio ballot. Harris was endorsed by Biden shortly after he dropped out of the race, catapulting her to the forefront of the campaign to beat Republican nominee Donald Trump. No other major candidate challenged Harris for the nomination, and she was the only choice for delegates under party rules that required pledges of support from at least 300 delegates, with no more than 50 signatures from any one delegation. Any delegate who wants to vote for someone other than Harris will be tallied as \"present.\" Democrats still plan a state-by-state roll call during the convention, the traditional way that a nominee is chosen. However, that will be purely ceremonial because of the online voting. The party insists it has to have its nominee in place before its convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19 to make sure it meets ballot access deadlines in Ohio — an argument that the state’s Republicans dispute. Ohio state lawmakers have since changed the deadline, but the modification doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. Democratic attorneys warn that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a presidential nominee could prompt legal challenge. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
