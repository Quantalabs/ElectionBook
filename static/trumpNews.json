Nothing that could be regarded great progress was reported after the three-hour meeting in the Kremlin, just two days ahead of Trump’s Friday deadline for Russia to agree a ceasefire or face fresh sanctions.\n\nWhite House sources quoted by news agencies did not share the president’s positive view of the meeting and neither did Secretary of State Marco Rubio. If things continued to progress, “an opportunity will present itself for the president to meet with Vladimir Putin and president, hopefully, in the new future,” said Rubio. He said that “a lot has to happen before that can occur,” and admitted that many “impediments” to peace remained.\n\nThe reality is that Putin has no interest in a peace deal which does not involve Ukraine’s surrender on his terms, and the reason he granted Witkoff an audience was to avoid the fresh sanctions Trump threatened to impose if there was no ceasefire by Friday. On Wednesday morning he had signed an executive order placing an additional 25 per cent tariff on imports from India, taking the total to 50 per cent, in retaliation for India buying oil from Russia. Other countries would be similarly punished by Trump if Russia did not agree to something by Friday.\n\nPutin did the absolute minimum to avoid sanctions, at least for now. The Kremlin said he could meet Trump to discuss the war, as early as next week, but it denied there were any plans for a subsequent meeting of Trump, Putin and Zelensky as some news reports were suggesting. This makes the Russian president’s intentions crystal clear. He is biding his time because a peace deal cannot be agreed at a meeting with Trump, from which Zelensky would be absent. It was also reported that Russia was willing to consider a ceasefire in the air war (the daily barrages of drone and missile attacks on Ukraine) but this was nothing more than a gimmick.\n\nWhile everyone would like to see an end to the war in Ukraine, it can only materialise through Ukraine’s complete surrender to Putin, something that will not happen. And the fact is that Trump’s claims of “great progress” cannot be taken at face value, as he had been misled by Putin in the past. A few months ago, the US president announced that Putin was ready to negotiate, only to eventually realise this was not the case.\n\nAll attempts by the US to broker peace talks have failed, because Putin is not interested in any deal that would limit his war aims (aims that admittedly he is nowhere near achieving) and there has been no information to suggest otherwise. Moscow’s sole objective at present is to avoid the imposition of additional sanctions by the US. Delaying this, by engaging in arrangements for a meeting between Trump and Putin, is the current plan. Once that happens, Trump would have to meet Zelensky to convey Russia’s proposals because Putin is refusing to meet the Ukraine’s president.\n\nAs long as there are talks, even if they lead nowhere, there will be no additional sanctions.","summary":"President Donald Trump said “great progress was made” in Wednesday’s talks on ending the war in Ukraine between his special envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In a striking departure from the traditional US stance, President Donald Trump, speaking at a press conference in the UK on Monday, contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s dismissal of starvation concerns in Gaza as “Hamas propaganda.” Trump expressed serious concern, telling reporters, “We’re going to be getting some good, strong food; we can save a lot of people. I mean, some of those kids — that’s real starvation stuff… It’s crazy what’s going on over there.” His remarks have garnered significant attention, not only because he is US president but also because they signify a change in policy, which has long been characterised by unwavering support for Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, France’s announcement to formally recognise Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in September, coupled with its co-hosting of a UN Security Council conference on the two-state solution alongside Saudi Arabia — an event boycotted by both Israel and the US — marks a significant shift in the diplomatic landscape surrounding the Palestinian issue. For decades, the two-state solution has been the cornerstone of peace efforts, underpinned by numerous UN resolutions, internationally mediated agreements and proposals. Yet, each time, these efforts have been derailed by Israel with active complicity of Western powers, particularly the US. Israel’s ongoing settlement expansion plan in the occupied West Bank, its genocidal campaign in Gaza, and the resultant humanitarian disaster have badly hurt the prospects of a peaceful resolution. However, the decision by France and Saudi Arabia to co-host the UNSC conference, with strong support from Pakistan — July’s UNSC president — represents a crucial attempt to bring the issue back into the global spotlight. It reaffirms that the two-state solution along the 1967 borders is not merely an aspirational goal but a tangible, necessary path toward resolution. This diplomatic initiative also places increasing pressure on the UK and Germany to step up their support for the two-state solution. For instance, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing pressure, with over 200 lawmakers signing a letter urging him to officially recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nFor far too long, Western powers have sidestepped actions that could antagonize Israel. But the catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding in Gaza has created a moral and diplomatic imperative for change. The pressure on the UK and Germany will undoubtedly intensify as conditions in Gaza keep worsening. More than 140 UN members have already recognised Palestinian statehood, signalling growing international support for Palestinian self-determination. Whether the UNSC conference’s push for an independent Palestinian state can break the longstanding deadlock remains uncertain. Nonetheless, the increasing global consensus is shifting the dynamics of the conflict in ways that could profoundly impact Israel’s expansionist ambitions, which, if unchecked, threaten to further entrench its settler-colonial project. Even as peace remains elusive the growing momentum for a two-state solution offers a glimmer of hope that the political inertia may finally be broken.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025","summary":"EDITORIAL: As public outrage mounts around the world over Israel’s relentless assault on Gaza, marked by the death and destruction of countless lives and the use of starvation as a weapon of war, even the US — Israel’s staunchest ally — can no longer turn a blind eye to the escalating humanitarian crisis.

In a new column for the outlet, Gustavo Arellano lamented that Trump will be heading the task force in charge of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and warned the president would use the spectacle and the city for his own agenda. \"That’s why L.A. needs to withdraw from hosting the Olympics — the sooner the better,\" Arellano wrote. Arellano said when Los Angeles 2028, the group tasked with organizing the Olympics in the city, chair Casey Wasserman announced Trump as head of the task force, it was like him offering the city a \"giant whoopi cushion.\" TRACKING THE TRANS ATHLETE HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS CONTROVERSIES SHAKING THE NATION OVER THE LAST YEAR The columnist went on to trash other top officials from the Trump administration who were present at the announcement. \"On Trump’s right was a rash of L.A. haters, some of whom played a prominent role in Southern California’s summer of deportations, including Vice President JD Vance and Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem,\" he wrote. \"Not present, but hailed by Trump during the presser as an ‘MVP candidate,’ was Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who has made it his life’s mission to crush the multicultural metropolis that birthed him.\" Wasserman’s praise for Trump was, according to Arellano, nothing short of groveling. \"I haven’t seen such a suck-up since the last time I vacuumed my dad’s pool,\" he wrote. \"And you definitely don’t entrust kiss a-- like Wasserman — I’m still not sure what he did to deserve his powerful LA28 gig, except being the grandson of the late Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman — with calming down someone like Trump.\" ‘60 MINUTES’ KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION Arellano noted how the federal government was always going to be involved with hosting the Olympic Games but said that the fact that Trump is part of it makes it problematic. \"The federal government was always going to play a role in providing security for the 2028 Olympics, just as it has for previous Games in the U.S. But Trump, as the head of the task force, now gets to personally oversee our own siege,\" he wrote. \"With the Games happening in a presidential election year, Trump would love nothing more than to traipse around an L.A. radically transformed by his deportation blitzkrieg to proclaim his mission accomplished and broadcast his conquest to the world.\" He also warned that Trump would use the next three years of Olympics prep to \"humiliate blue L.A. at every chance.\" Arellano asked readers if they wanted to give Trump and his \"goon squad\" more opportunities to make life \"miserable\" in Los Angeles. He said he'd rather forego the city hosting the games because \"I don’t want my money going toward something that Trump will use to bolster his noxious legacy. I’m not going to cheer on Wasserman as he chums up Trump while la migra continues to terrorize L.A., possibly for months, if not years.\" \"La Migra\" is a Spanish language term, often used in slang, that refers to U.S. immigration enforcement agencies, primarily U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Border Patrol.

Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, ahead of a key cabinet meeting on the next stage of the Gaza war, Netanyahu stressed that Israel does not plan to retain civilian governance over the territory.“We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza, and to pass it civilian governance,” Netanyahu said as per Fox News. “We don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter, but we don’t want to govern it. We don’t want to be there as a governing body,” Netanyahu added. The Israeli prime minister said a “detailed plan” would be drawn up for a post-Hamas government in Gaza, with no role for the Palestinian Authority, according to Fox News. “We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly, without threatening us, and giving the Gazans a good life,” he said.Netanyahu noted that Israel currently controls about 75% of the enclave but has avoided areas where Hamas is believed to be holding hostages. He reiterated that Israel has no intent to cause civilian suffering, citing ongoing humanitarian aid efforts.Explaining the destruction seen in Gaza, Netanyahu mentioned that Hamas booby-traps buildings, and detonating the group’s underground tunnels often brings down empty structures above them, as per Fox News. When asked if US President Donald Trump had given Israel a “green light” to take over the Strip, Netanyahu replied, “He just says, ‘I know Israel will do what it has to do.’ We haven’t got into that kind of discussion,” while confirming that the US and Israel have discussed humanitarian aid surges and broad principles for post-Hamas Gaza, but not a detailed plan.

Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.\n\n“There’s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There’s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that’s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.”\n\nMuch of the investment into building U.S. chip factories began with the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act that President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022, providing more than $50 billion to support new computer chip plants, fund research and train workers for the industry.\n\nTrump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.\n\nTrump’s announcement could be a signal for other chipmakers to imitate the investments that companies like South Korea's Samsung are making, said Long Le, a business professor at Santa Clara University.\n\nBut with China’s SMIC and Huawei unlikely to be exempted, it could also give the Trump administration \"more leverage at the trading table\" ahead of an upcoming deal with China, he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump's ambiguous plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners - boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.

The deal does not call for the U.S. to pay for the construction of the transit corridor, but instead for private corporations to develop it.\n\nThe deal was reached after a visit earlier this year by Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff to Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku and continued talks between the parties.\n\nNearly four decades of bloodshed between the two\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan faced off for nearly four decades of fighting for control of the Karabakh region, which was known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the mostly Armenian-populated region had an autonomous status within Azerbaijan. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fueled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years.\n\nClashes erupted in 1988 when the region made a bid to join Armenia. As the USSR collapsed in 1991 and Armenia proclaimed independence, hostilities escalated into a full-blown war that killed an estimated 30,000 people and displaced about 1 million.\n\nWhen the war ended with a cease-fire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan.\n\nDecades of international mediation efforts failed. In September 2020, Azerbaijan launched an operation to reclaim the region. NATO-member Turkey, which has close ethnic, cultural and historic bonds with Azerbaijan, gave it strong support.\n\nIn six weeks of fighting involving heavy artillery, rockets and drones that killed more than 6,700 people, Azerbaijani troops drove Armenian forces from areas they controlled outside Karabakh. They also reclaimed broad chunks of Karabakh. A Russia-brokered peace deal saw the deployment of about 2,000 troops to the region as peacekeepers.\n\nAzerbaijan then reclaimed all of Karabakh in September 2023 in a lightning military campaign. Over 100,000 people, nearly all of Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenian population, fled to Armenia in a week, fearing Azerbaijani rule.\n\nRussia, busy with its war in Ukraine, didn’t intervene, angering Armenia’s leadership, which responded by scaling down its ties with Moscow and bolstering relations with the West.\n\nProspects for peace and better relations\n\nAfter reclaiming Karabakh, Azerbaijan engaged in talks with Armenia on normalizing ties. As part of the negotiations, Armenia agreed to hand over several border villages to Azerbaijan.\n\nAzerbaijan also has demanded that Armenia rewrite its constitution, which contains a reference to the prospective reunification of Armenia and the Karabakh region. The authorities have yet to present a revised draft in the face of public protests.\n\nA key stumbling block in peace talks was Azerbaijan seeking a land bridge to its Nakhchivan region. Azerbaijan doesn’t trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, while Armenia had staunchly resisted control by a third party, seeing it as a breach of its sovereignty.\n\nIt was not clear how that resistance had been overcome in the deal.\n\nRussia, which has a military base in Armenia, had previously proposed deploying its troops to secure the corridor. Armenia, bent on scaling down ties with Russia in favor of closer relations with the West, rejected the idea.\n\n“Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine.\n\n“Russia now lacks resources to deal with Armenia and Azerbaijan,” Vartanyan said.\n\nThe prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran.\n\nTurkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. Pashinyan, who visited Turkey in June in the first such visit by an Armenian leader, has made normalizing ties with Turkey a key goal.\n\n“For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.\n\n“Armenia has an extensive transport infrastructure since the Soviet times, including railways and highways that could significantly expand trade routes via South Caucasus,” she said.","summary":"The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan are expected to sign a peace deal Friday at the White House that could potentially put an end to decades of conflict, President Donald Trump said.

But Azerbaijan has since outlined a host of demands -- including amendments to Armenia's constitution to drop territorial claims for Karabakh -- before signing the document.It was not immediately clear Thursday whether those demands have been met. And while Trump said his administration \"has been engaged with both sides for quite some time,\" he did not provide specifics on the document that will be signed by representatives of the two countries.In early July, Pashinyan and Aliyev met for the latest round of peace talks in the United Arab Emirates, but they failed to yield a breakthrough.The two foes had previously met on the sidelines of the European Political Community summit in Albania in May.At the time, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Council President Antonio Costa called for a prompt signature of a peace agreement between the two countries.","summary":"US President Donald Trump will host the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan on Friday for what he called a \"Historic Peace Summit\" aimed at ending a decades-long conflict between two former Soviet republics.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-host-armenia-azerbaijan-historic-peace-signing-3780480","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4615164/azerbaijans-president-ilham-aliyev-l-armenias-prime-minister-nikol-pashinyan-r-are-meet-us.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=765ca7a965ff5ff44b4399e56a14a7f8","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:36:06","author":"Michael Mathes","authors":["Michael Mathes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":349158180,"title":"Trump says assassination attempt 'wasn't easy' as he compares it to Purple Heart heroism","text":"Donald Trump drew parallels between the assassination attempt on his life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year and the sacrifices of Purple Heart veterans during a White House ceremony on Thursday afternoon. Thomas Matthew Crooks Hailing from Bethel Park - a well-to-do area south of Pittsburgh - travelled 53 miles to the Butler Farm Show grounds hosting the rally, before unleashing gunfire from a neighbouring rooftop, injuring two rally-goers and fatally shooting another. Trump's right ear was clipped during the attack. Within days, he appeared at the Republican National Convention, where he formally secured his party's nomination having been selected as their presidential candidate. READ MORE: Hunter's terrifying final moments before fatal goring by 'Black Death' buffalo On Thursday Trump said: \"Last year, after an assassin tried to take my life in Butler, Pennsylvania, Thomas [Matteo] generously mailed me one of his Purple Hearts,\" the president declared. \"Many of the other veterans showed me the same gesture of unbelievable kindness, including three-time Purple Heart recipient John Ford and Gerald Enter Jr., who also came along with us and did us a great, great favor,\" the president went on. \"Gerald, John and Thomas, I want to thank you very much.\" The trio of veterans Trump referenced were in attendance at the ceremony. Each had, as he noted, posted him one of their Purple Hearts following his shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024, by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks , reports the Mirror US . \"What a great honour to receive those Purple Hearts,\" Trump went on, drawing parallels between his own journey and the trials faced by the three veterans to earn their Purple Hearts. \"I guess, in a certain way, it wasn't that easy for me, either, when you think of it,\" he mused, before conceding: \"But you went through a lot more than I did, and I appreciate it all very much.\" The medals bestowed upon Trump were given during ceremonies held in the final months of his campaign last year. Matteo, Ford and Thomas weren't the only veterans who sent Trump their Purple Hearts - numerous others did as well. Trump extended an invitation to several of the veterans who had posted their Purple Medals to him to his campaign events, so he could return the medals to their rightful owners. The gathering Trump hosted at the White House on Thursday afternoon commemorated National Purple Heart Day, observed annually on 7 Aug. At the conclusion of his speech - which he seemed to read from a script, rarely deviating from it - he signed a proclamation declaring 7 Aug. 2025, National Purple Heart Day - officially recognising the holiday. The Purple Heart is the oldest military accolade still in circulation. It's awarded to service members who are killed or injured while engaging in enemy combat or who become victims of acts of terrorism. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honour houses over 1.8 million medals awarded since the inception of the award in 1782. Trump himself has never served in the military. Indeed, he received five draft deferments when called upon to serve during the Vietnam War. His initial four deferments were education-related, as he was studying at university at the time, while his fifth was due to a medical exemption - he cited supposed bone spurs in his heels.

Probably not,” Fansmith said. \n\n“But it does continue this rhetoric from the administration that some students are being preferenced in the admission process at the expense of other students.”\n\nBecause of the Supreme Court ruling, colleges have been barred from asking the race of students who are applying, Fansmith said. \n\nOnce students enroll, the schools can ask about race, but students must be told they have a right not to answer. \n\nIn this political climate, many students won’t report their race, Fansmith said. \n\nSo when schools release data on student demographics, the figures often give only a partial picture of the campus makeup.\n\nDiversity changed at some colleges — but not all\n\nThe first year of admissions data after the Supreme Court ruling showed no clear pattern in how colleges’ diversity changed. \n\nResults varied dramatically from one campus to the next.\n\nSome schools, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Amherst College, saw steep drops in the percentage of Black students in their incoming classes. \n\nBut at other elite, selective schools such as Yale, Princeton and the University of Virginia, the changes were less than a percentage point year to year.\n\nSome colleges have added more essays or personal statements to their admissions process to get a better picture of an applicant’s background, a strategy the Supreme Court invited in its ruling.\n\n“Nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected the applicant’s life, so long as that discussion is concretely tied to a quality of character or unique ability that the particular applicant can contribute to the university,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in 2023 for the court’s conservative majority.\n\nAs an alternative to affirmative action, colleges for years have tried a range of strategies to achieve the diversity they say is essential to their campuses.\n\nMany have given greater preference to low-income families. \n\nOthers started admitting top students from every community in their state.\n\nPrior to the ruling, nine states had banned affirmative action, starting with California in 1996.\n\nThe University of California saw enrollment change after the statewide ban in 1996. \n\nWithin two years, Black and Hispanic enrollments fell by half at the system’s two most selective campuses — Berkeley and UCLA. \n\nThe system would go on to spend more than $500 million on programs aimed at low-income and first-generation college students.\n\nThe 10-campus University of California system also started a program that promises admission to the top 9% of students in each high school across the state, an attempt to reach strong students from all backgrounds. \n\nA similar promise in Texas has been credited for expanding racial diversity, and opponents of affirmative action cite it as a successful model.\n\nIn California, the promise drew students from a wider geographic area but did little to expand racial diversity, the system said in a brief to the Supreme Court. \n\nIt had almost no impact at Berkeley and UCLA, where students compete against tens of thousands of other applicants.\n\nToday at UCLA and Berkeley, Hispanic students make up 20% of undergraduates, higher than in 1996 but lower than their 53% share among California’s high school graduates. \n\nBlack students, meanwhile, have a smaller presence than they did in 1996, accounting for 4% of undergraduates at Berkeley.\n\nAfter Michigan voters rejected affirmative action in 2006, the University of Michigan shifted attention to low-income students.\n\nThe school sent graduates to work as counselors in low-income high schools and started offering college prep in Detroit and Grand Rapids. \n\nIt offered full scholarships for low-income Michigan residents and, more recently, started accepting fewer early admission applications, which are more likely to come from white students.\n\nDespite the University of Michigan’s efforts, the share of Black and Hispanic undergraduates hasn’t fully rebounded from a falloff after 2006. \n\nAnd while Hispanic enrollments have been increasing, Black enrollments continued to slide, going from 8% of undergraduates in 2006 to 4% in 2025.","summary":"President Donald Trump is requiring colleges across the nation to prove they are

election victory was not recognized by Washington -- to $50 million.\"Today, the Department of Justice and State Department are announcing a historic $50 million reward for information leading to the arrest of Nicolas Maduro,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a video on social media. \"He is one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world and a threat to our national security.\"The previous bounty was set in January at $25 million.In 2020, during President Donald Trump's first term in office, Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan officials were indicted in federal court in New York on several charges including participating in a \"narco-terrorism\" conspiracy.The Justice Department accused Maduro of leading a cocaine trafficking gang called \"The Cartel of the Suns\" that shipped hundreds of tons of narcotics into the United States over two decades, earning hundreds of millions of dollars.Investigators say the cartel worked hand-in-hand with the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which the United States has labeled a terrorist organization.Bondi said Maduro also had worked with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and Mexico's Sinaloa cartel.The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) \"has seized 30 tons of cocaine linked to Maduro and his associates, with nearly seven tons linked to Maduro himself,\" Bondi said.The US government has seized more than $700 million in Maduro-linked assets, according to Bondi, including two Venezuelan government aircraft since September last year.\"Yet Maduro's reign of terror continues,\" she said. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Maduro will not escape justice and he will be held accountable for his despicable crimes.\"The 62-year-old Maduro, a former bus driver and trade unionist, faces up to life in prison if he can be tried and is convicted.At the time of the indictment, Maduro slammed what he called \"spurious, false\" accusations.In June, Venezuela's former intelligence chief Hugo Armando Carvajal pleaded guilty to US drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges. The Miami Herald, citing sources familiar with the case, said Carvajal had offered to provide US authorities with documents and testimony implicating Maduro.Relations between Washington and Caracas have been deteriorating for years.The US government has not recognized Maduro, who first took office in 2013, as the duly elected president of Venezuela since what the State Department has called a \"deeply flawed 2018 presidential election.\"\"In the July 28, 2024 Venezuelan presidential election, Maduro fraudulently declared himself the victor despite evidence to the contrary,\" the State Department said in an announcement of the earlier bounty in January.\"The United States joined many other countries in refusing to recognize Maduro as the legitimate winner of the July 2024 presidential election.\"Washington has placed an array of economic sanctions on Maduro's government.","summary":"The United States on Thursday doubled its bounty on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro -- who faces federal drug trafficking charges and whose most recent election victory was not recognized by Washington -- to $50 million.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/us-raises-bounty-venezuelas-maduro-50-mn-3780479","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4615163/united-states-has-increased-its-bounty-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-50-million.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ca2587711546f99b11a3d2fffb5b8db3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:30:17","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":349156284,"title":"Donald Trump says Putin does not have to meet Zelensky for US-Russia summit to go ahead","text":"Donald Trump last night dismissed the idea that a US-Russia summit will only happen if Vladimir Putin meets Ukraine’s president.\n\nThe US leader is continuing to seek a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine – and is threatening economic sanctions if Putin continues to snub Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nA Kremlin aide yesterday indicated that Mr Trump and Putin could get together ‘in the coming days’. \n\nPutin said desire for a US-Russia summit was ‘mutual’ and that friends in the UAE could accommodate the meeting.\n\nHe also did not rule out face-to-face talks with President Zelensky, adding ‘certain conditions’ would need to be met, without specifying what those would be.\n\nEarlier, a White House official, cited by several US outlets, said the Russian leader would have to agree to meet his Ukrainian counterpart in order for the talks with Mr Trump to go ahead.\n\nBut when pressed on further details by reporters, the US President said Putin and Mr Zelensky did not have to meet in order for the US-Russia meeting to take place.\n\nA US deadline for Russia to commit to peace talks expires today. \n\nIf the deadline passes, the US is expected to levy secondary tariffs targeting Russia’s key allies India and China.

Thought they were being edited out.',\n'Typical bbc Showing masterchef, with the 2 judges who both been sacked #Masterchef.'\nBody language expert Judi James told The Mirror that the pair lacked on-screen chemistry.\nShe told the publication: 'Torode and Wallace are not really presented as a double act here, more like two experts with little in the way of close communication or synchronicity.\n'Nothing seems to hinge on any on-screen chemistry between the stars and any interaction there is seems to be either shot with a spatial distance at a table or in the style of one commenting solo to the camera while the other is filmed doing the reaction shots.'\nWallace and Torode were both sacked from the program in quick succession last month.\nWallace was fired after more than 45 complaints against him were upheld following a BBC investigation.\nAustralian-born chef John, 59, also lost his job after two decades over allegations that he used the N-word, which he claims to have 'absolutely no recollection' of.\n\n Gregg Wallace, 60, bizarrely does squats outside the gym as he continues to plug his personal training business - after hitting out at backlash over his autism charity appointment \nOne contestant, Sarah Shafi, will not appear on the programme after she complained about the behaviour of Gregg.\nShe claimed she was 'eyed up and ogled' by Gregg on the show, while accusing the TV host of making an 'off' comment about his reputation with women.\nGregg stepped down from the hit BBC cooking show after complaints were made about his behaviour and following a report into his conduct, in which 45 of 83 complaints were upheld. In total, 41 people complained.\nThe review concluded that the 'majority of the substantiated allegations against Wallace related to inappropriate sexual language and humour'.\nIt added that 'a smaller number of allegations of other inappropriate language and being in a state of undress were also substantiated', with 'one incident of unwelcome physical contact' also substantiated.\nThe ex Eat Well for Less? presenter told the Sun that while he didn't deny being guilty of some of the claims, he believed things had been 'perceived incorrectly'.\nGregg claimed that he had worked with around 4,000 people, meaning that just 0.5% of those he has worked with 'found fault with me'.\nHe said his actions were the result of learned behaviour and workplace culture and claimed that his recent autism diagnosis also played a role.\n\nWallace was fired after more than 45 complaints against him were upheld following a BBC investigation\n\nThere was a last-minute scramble to re-edit it and limit the appearances of its stars Gregg and John (the contestants are seen) \n'I know I am odd. I know I struggle to read people. I know people find me weird. Autism is a disability, a registered disability,' he said.\nGregg has previously said he felt the BBC failed to provide enough support for his condition during his 20 years working on MasterChef.\n'My neurodiversity, now formally diagnosed as autism, was suspected and discussed by colleagues across countless seasons of MasterChef,' he said.\n'Yet nothing was done to investigate my disability or protect me from what I now realise was a dangerous environment for over 20 years.'\nGregg WallaceJohn Torode\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMasterChef loses nearly 1MILLION viewers as new series airs after both presenters Gregg Wallace and John Torode were sacked\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 15\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

George Washington created the Purple Heart on Aug. 7, 1782, when he presented a purple ribbon shaped like a heart to each of three soldiers for their gallantry in battle.\n\n\"Just as George Washington did 243 years ago, today we give our everlasting thanks to you and your unbelievable families,\" Trump said while referencing the dozens of Purple Heart recipients in the audience.\n\nWhile Washington was the first to bestow a Purple Heart to soldiers, it remained a footnote in U.S. military history until Gen.

Both he and his son received Purple Hearts while serving in Afghanistan.\n\nMilitary specialist Kevin Brown also was honored for pulling Capt. Sam Brown from a Humvee that an explosive device had damaged.\n\nBoth men earned their Purple Hearts on that day, and the Senate last week confirmed Brown as the Military Affairs Department's under-secretary for memorial affairs.\n\nTrump said the Purple Heart \"tells a story of courage, sacrifice and purpose\" and \"speaks of a price paid for the soldier beside you, the country behind you and the generations of Americans yet to come.\"\n\nHe then signed the proclamation designating Aug. 7 as National Purple Heart Day.","summary":"National Purple Heart Day will be celebrated on the seventh day of August after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation making it so on Thursday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/07/national-purple-heart-day/1801754610364/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1801754610364/2025/1/99d3bf771783e9cef6fc99340eb914ae/v1.5/Trump-creates-National-Purple-Heart-Day-to-honor-wounded-warriors.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:28:13","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.477},{"id":349163316,"title":"US Uses War Rhetoric, Superman To Recruit For Migrant Crackdown","text":"From Uncle Sam to Superman, the US government is deploying patriotic icons and increasingly warlike rhetoric to recruit Americans into enforcing Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.Job ads promising $50,000 signing bonuses to new \"Deportation Officers\" have flooded social media over the past week, accompanied by jingoistic rallying slogans that declare \"America Needs You.\"White House officials have shared World War I-style posters, including one with Uncle Sam donning an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) baseball cap, while a former Superman actor has pledged he will \"be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.\"\"So many patriots have stepped up, and I'm proud to be among them,\" Dean Cain, who starred as the Man of Steel in 1990s TV series \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,\" told FOX News.ICE, the agency chiefly responsible for the recent, divisive masked raids on farms, factories and Home Depot parking lots across the nation, is pulling out all the stops to hire new officers at a staggering rate.

Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until January 31, 2026.The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remaining independent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair, Jerome Powell, for keeping short-term interest rates unchanged, calling him “a stubborn MORON” last week on social media.Miran has been a major defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump’s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, that politicians might be unwilling to take.Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank’s interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.Miran’s nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell’s view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.Trump has said he will appoint Fed officials who will cut interest rates, which he says will reduce the borrowing costs of the federal government’s huge $36 trillion debt pile. Trump also wants lower rates to boost moribund home sales, which have been held back partly by higher mortgage costs. Yet the Fed doesn’t directly set longer-term interest rates for things like home and car purchases.At its most recent meeting last week, Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors — Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term.RELATED STORY | Trump visits Federal Reserve amid criticism of Powell, renovation costsStill, even with Miran on the board, 12 Fed officials vote on interest rate policy and many remain concerned that Trump's sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.Miran could be renominated to a longer term on the Fed once his initial appointment is concluded, or replaced by another nominee.Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. Yet, Powell could remain on the board of governors until January 2028, even after he steps down as chair. That would deny, or at least delay, an opportunity for Trump to appoint an additional policymaker to the Fed’s board.As a result, one option for Trump is to appoint Powell’s eventual replacement as chair to replace Kugler once the remaining four months of her term are completed. Leading candidates for that position include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and frequent critic of Powell’s chairmanship, and Kevin Hassett, another top Trump economic adviser.Another option for the White House next May would be to select Waller, who is already on the board, to replace Powell, and who has been widely mentioned as a candidate.Marco Casigraghi, an analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, noted that the choice of Miran could be a positive sign for Waller, because Trump did not take the opportunity to nominate someone likely to become chair once Powell steps down.After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.“What we’re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,” Miran said on MSNBC. “And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president’s view.”Last year, Miran expressed support for some unconventional economic views in commentaries on the Fed and international economics.Last November, he proposed measures that would reduce the value of the dollar in order to boost exports, reduce imports and cut the U.S. trade deficit, a top priority for Trump. He also suggested tariffs could push U.S. trading partners, such as the European Union and Japan, to accept a cheaper dollar as part of a “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” an echo of the Plaza Accord reached in the 1980s that lowered the dollar's value.As a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, Miran in March 2024 also proposed overhauling the Fed's governance, including by making it easier for a president to fire members of its board of governors.“The Fed’s current governance has facilitated groupthink that has led to significant monetary-policy errors,” Miran wrote in a paper with Dan Katz, now a top official at the Treasury Department.","summary":"President Donald Trump said Thursday he will nominate a top economic adviser to the Federal Reserve’s board of governors for four months in a temporary position.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/trump-to-nominate-top-economic-aide-stephen-miran-to-federal-reserve-board","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90ab9d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2215x1163+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2Fc1%2Fd6218eb14fddb14545ade17a688e%2Fap25219715009905.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:07:46","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.199},{"id":349154290,"title":"Satellite images show Israel preparing for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, sources say","text":"WASHINGTON — Commercial satellite images show the Israeli military building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave, according to three U.S. officials and a former official who viewed the imagery. The images show troop movements and formations that the four sources recognized as signs of an imminent major ground operation. It is not clear whether the Israelis really intend to begin a new offensive in Gaza or whether the move is a negotiating or pressure tactic. If there is a new military operation, it could include efforts to retrieve hostages held by Hamas and expand humanitarian assistance in areas outside the fighting, the three U.S. officials and a person briefed on Israeli discussions said. Israeli troops have been conducting ground operations in Gaza since Oct. 27, 2023, with pauses during two ceasefires. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday on Fox News that Israel intended to take control of all of Gaza. “We intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there, enable the population to be free of Gaza and to pass it to civilian governance that is not Hamas and not anyone advocating the destruction of Israel. That’s what we want to do.” Pressed again on that point, specifically on whether he meant Israel would “take control of the entire 26-mile Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu said: “Well, we don’t want to keep it. We want to have a security perimeter. We don’t want to govern it.” The troop buildup comes during a tense time in relations between the United States and Israel. On July 28, Netanyahu and President Donald Trump had a private phone conversation that devolved into shouting amid White House concerns over how the Gaza Humanitarian Fund, a U.S.- and Israel-backed relief effort, is working, according to a senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and a Western official who were briefed on the matter. The recent flare-up of tensions between Trump and Netanyahu began July 27. Appearing at an event in Jerusalem that day, Netanyahu said: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza. And there is no starvation in Gaza.” When Trump was asked about those comments the next day during a trip to Scotland, he contradicted Netanyahu. He said that he had seen images of children in Gaza who “look very hungry,” that there is “real starvation” there and that “you can’t fake that.” Netanyahu then privately demanded a phone call with Trump, the senior U.S. official and the former U.S. official briefed on the call said. The two leaders were connected within hours, those two officials said. Netanyahu told Trump on the phone that widespread starvation in Gaza is not real and that it had been fabricated by Hamas, said the senior U.S. official, two former U.S. officials and the Western official, all of whom were briefed on the call. Trump interrupted Netanyahu and began yelling, they said, saying that he did not want to hear that the starvation is fake and that his aides had shown him proof that children there are starving, they said. White House officials declined to comment on the phone call. Israeli officials declined to comment. One of the former U.S. officials briefed on the call described it as “a direct, mostly one-way conversation about the status of humanitarian aid” in which Trump “was doing most of the talking.” “The U.S. not only feels like the situation is dire, but they own it because of GHF,” the former official said, referring to the Gaza Humanitarian Fund. The phone call prompted a trip to the region last week by Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, to find a unified path forward in the war. Israeli officials were pleased with Witkoff’s visit, according to the Western official and the source briefed on Israeli discussions. The Israelis viewed everything from his body language to the questions he asked as indicators that they were able to effectively communicate the challenges Israel faces. The Israeli officials also addressed international criticism of GHF with Witkoff, explaining why, in their opinion, some critics want it to fail, the source briefed on Israeli discussions said. GHF has been working in Gaza since May. It operates only in specific designated distribution sites that are far away from some Palestinians who need food, leading to large crowds that Israeli troops — who are stationed nearby — have at times fired upon. As of late July, more than 1,000 Palestinians had been killed while seeking food, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. GHF has been boycotted by the U.N., which has operated its own aid distribution network in Gaza. Witkoff pressed officials about whether current relief efforts can meet ongoing need or should expand further, according to the source briefed on Israeli discussions. Witkoff has since returned. He briefed Trump on his visit over dinner Monday night, according to a White House official. Their discussion included humanitarian aid in Gaza and Witkoff’s meeting with Israeli officials and hostage families. Asked by reporters Tuesday whether he would support Israel’s occupying Gaza, Trump said he is focused on getting people there food. As for a military occupation, he said: “I really can’t say. That’s going to be pretty much up to Israel.” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News: “We do not comment on the President’s private conversations. President Trump is focused on returning all the hostages and getting the people in Gaza fed.” A new Gaza ceasefire has proven elusive. Israel does not believe Hamas is motivated to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages, the source briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official said, and it believes a military offensive is the likeliest option. The international community has recently been heaping pressure on Israel, with the United Kingdom, France, Canada and others saying they may move to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. General Assembly in September. “It seems like we are at a brick wall, with countries saying they are recognizing Palestine,” said the person briefed on Israeli discussions. “Now all ideas are being exhausted.” The Western official said an offensive remains a very dangerous prospect for the Israeli military because Hamas is very dug in and there is “no chance they can kill every fighter.” The Western official added that there is concern that Hamas will kill hostages or put them in the way of fighting if it is threatened. Israeli forces know the general area where all the hostages are, said the person briefed on Israeli discussions and the Western official, one of whom added that the belief is that area is in central Gaza. “Looking at the condition of hostages, it’s clear that they don’t have much more time,” one of the sources added in reference to a recent video of an emaciated Israeli hostage inside a cramped Gaza tunnel digging his own grave.","summary":"Commercial satellite images show Israel building up troops and equipment near the border with Gaza that would support a possible new ground invasion.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/satellite-images-show-israel-building-forces-possible-ground-invasion-rcna223722","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-Israeli-army-aa-337-7db938.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:07:39","author":"Carol E.

On Thursday, US President announced that the long-feuding neighbours are expected to sign a historic peace agreement at the White House on Friday, potentially bringing an end to decades of hostility, and this is all because of \"TRUMP\". Trump indicated that Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and President Ilham Aliyev would sign agreements with the United States to explore joint economic ventures, aiming to maximise the South Caucasus Region's potential.\"I look forward to hosting the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, and the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, at the White House tomorrow for a Historic Peace Summit. These two Nations have been at War for many years, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people. Many Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to “TRUMP.” My Administration has been engaged with both sides for quite some time. Tomorrow, President Aliyev AND Prime Minister Pashinyan will join me at the White House for an official Peace Signing Ceremony,\" Trump said. \"The United States will also sign Bilateral Agreements with both Countries to pursue Economic opportunities together, so we can fully unlock the potential of the South Caucasus Region. I am very proud of these courageous Leaders for doing the right thing for the Great People of Armenia and Azerbaijan. It will be a Historic Day for Armenia, Azerbaijan, the United States, and, THE WORLD. See you then! DJT,\" he added. This agreement could resolve long-standing conflicts and enable the reopening of vital transport routes across the South Caucasus, which have remained closed since the early 1990s.Three anonymous US officials revealed to AP that the agreements include establishing a significant transit corridor across the region, which had previously hindered peace negotiations.According to these officials, the US would receive leasing rights to develop this corridor, designated as the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity.The corridor would connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan region, currently separated by 32 kilometres of Armenian territory.The planned transit corridor would incorporate railway lines, oil and gas pipelines, and fibre optic cables, facilitating goods movement and eventually passenger travel. Private corporations, rather than the US government, would finance the corridor's construction.The agreement resulted from negotiations following Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, earlier this year.Azerbaijan-Armenia disputeThe Karabakh region has been a source of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan for nearly forty years.During Soviet rule, the predominantly Armenian region maintained autonomy within Azerbaijan. Tensions between Christian Armenians and Muslim Azerbaijanis, influenced by the 1915 Ottoman Turkish massacre of 1.5 million Armenians, intensified as the Soviet Union declined.The region attempted to join Armenia in 1988, sparking clashes. Following Armenia's independence from the dissolving USSR in 1991, the situation escalated into warfare, resulting in approximately 30,000 deaths and one million displaced persons, AP news agency reported.The 1994 ceasefire left Armenian forces, supported by Yerevan, controlling both the region and significant portions of Azerbaijan.International mediation proved unsuccessful. Azerbaijan launched a campaign to reclaim the region in September 2020, supported by NATO-member Turkey, which shares strong ethnic and cultural ties with Azerbaijan.The six-week conflict, involving artillery, rockets and drones, resulted in over 6,700 casualties. Azerbaijani forces regained control of areas outside Karabakh and within it. A Russian-brokered peace agreement led to the deployment of 2,000 peacekeepers.Azerbaijan completely reclaimed Karabakh in September 2023 through rapid military action. Subsequently, nearly all of Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian population, over 100,000 people, fled to Armenia within a week.","summary":"Donald Trump declared that Armenia and Azerbaijan are set to sign a peace agreement.

To that end, I am creating a Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting.\"Perez's move follows Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis calling Florida \"malapportioned,\" as the governor added that redrawing the state's congressional map mid-decade would be \"appropriate.\"\"I haven't done it yet, I think that I will when I need to,\" DeSantis said in a news conference last week. \"But this is obviously something that we're looking at very seriously.\"Blue states have pledged to retaliate by redrawing their own congressional maps to pick up more Democratic seats in the House if Republicans move forward with redistricting in GOP-controlled states.Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom has openly said he'll push for partisan redistricting in the Golden State if Texas moves ahead with its plans. New York Governor Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, has said she'll move ahead with redistricting in her state, but due to state law and the structure of the process, the earliest congressional maps could be redrawn in New York would be by the 2028 midterms.What People Are SayingRepublican U.S. Representative Jimmy Patronis wrote on X: \"Texas can do it, the Free State of Florida can do it 10X better.\"Evan Power, chair of the Florida GOP, told The Hill last week of a redistricting push in the state: \"It's picking up steam. We were probably heading there with the court decision, but Texas made it top news.\"Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried told Politico: \"This is corruption, plain and simple. Drawing district maps is supposed to happen once a decade, after a federal census. Floridians are watching their home insurance rates skyrocket, their rents go up, and their public schools crumble, but instead of fixing any of it, Florida Republicans are too busy with voter suppression schemes in the middle of the decade to protect Trump. This is not normal. Redistricting will cost Floridians millions of taxpayer dollars. We cannot allow this to happen.\"What Happens NextPerez told his fellow Florida House lawmakers that the select committee's membership will be announced in September and that it will begin its work \"during the previously scheduled interim committee weeks.\"He added, however, that no one who has \"expressed an interest in running for Congress\" will be appointed to the committee. Perez also said that those who \"suggest an intent to favor or disfavor an incumbent or political party, which is currently prohibited by the Florida Constitution,\" will also be disqualified from consideration.","summary":"Florida Republicans took the first step toward redrawing congressional maps in the Sunshine State amid a nationwide battle.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/florida-republicans-redistricting-battle-texas-2110559","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2698723/daniel-perez.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=9eae28da6d0c31e81b79aba7b17c2bcb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-08 00:06:30","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":349162010,"title":"Trump rules out tariff talks with India as 50 per cent hike looms","text":"New York, Aug 8 (SocialNews.XYZ) US President Donald Trump has ruled out negotiations with India on the tariffs that will rise to 50 per cent later this month.\n\n“No, not until we get it resolved”, he said when a reporter asked him if he expected more negotiations following the announcement of the 50 per cent tariff that is to take effect on August 27.\n\nIt was not clear from the curt reply if he meant the resolution of the Ukraine War, since the additional 25 per cent punitive tariff he announced on Wednesday for buying Russian oil is linked to it, or a settlement of issues underlying the 25 per cent tariff he imposed on India last week in his general trade war.\n\nThe punitive tariff appeared to aim at bringing economic pressure on Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, as India is the second-biggest customer for its oil.\n\nHe was also ambiguous on Wednesday when a reporter asked him if he would end the 25 per cent punitive tariff if there was an agreement with Moscow on ending the war.\n\nHe said, \"We'll determine that later, but right now, they're paying a 50 per cent tariff”.\n\nTrump had put a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or get hit with more sanctions, at which time the punitive measures known as secondary tariffs would be imposed on all its oil customers.\n\nHe later shortened it to 12 days, ending Friday, but came out with the 25 per cent punitive tariff singling out India on Wednesday, although it won’t take effect till August 27.\n\nIndia said it was “extremely unfortunate” that the US was imposing “additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest”.\n\nIt vowed to “take all actions necessary to protect its national interests”.\n\nTrump and Indian officials had been very optimistic about reaching a trade deal, as recently as last month, saying it was imminent.\n\nHowever, the negotiations apparently collapsed, according to reports, over US demands for access to agriculture and dairy markets in India.\n\nAbout Friday’s deadline for Russia sanctions and the secondary tariffs, Trump said, “It's going to be up to him (Putin).

The deal does not call for the US to pay for the construction of the transit corridor, but instead for private corporations to develop it.\nThe deal was reached after a visit earlier this year by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff to Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku and continued talks between the parties.\n Nearly four decades of bloodshed between the two Armenia and Azerbaijan faced off for nearly four decades of fighting for control of the Karabakh region, which was known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.\nDuring the Soviet era, the mostly Armenian-populated region had an autonomous status within Azerbaijan. Long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azerbaijanis — fuelled by memories of the 1915 massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Muslim Ottoman Turks — boiled over as the Soviet Union frayed in its final years.\nClashes erupted in 1988 when the region made a bid to join Armenia. As the USSR collapsed in 1991 and Armenia proclaimed independence, hostilities escalated into a full-blown war that killed an estimated 30,000 people and displaced about 1 million.\nWhen the war ended with a ceasefire in 1994, ethnic Armenian forces backed by the government in Yerevan not only took control of the region but also captured broad swaths of Azerbaijan.\nDecades of international mediation efforts failed. In September 2020, Azerbaijan launched an operation to reclaim the region. NATO-member Turkey, which has close ethnic, cultural and historic bonds with Azerbaijan, gave it strong support.\nIn six weeks of fighting involving heavy artillery, rockets and drones that killed more than 6,700 people, Azerbaijani troops drove Armenian forces from areas they controlled outside Karabakh. They also reclaimed broad chunks of Karabakh. A Russia-brokered peace deal saw the deployment of about 2,000 troops to the region as peacekeepers.\nAzerbaijan then reclaimed all of Karabakh in September 2023 in a lightning military campaign. Over 100,000 people, nearly all of Nagorno-Karabakh’s ethnic Armenian population, fled to Armenia in a week, fearing Azerbaijani rule.\nRussia, busy with its war in Ukraine, did not intervene, angering Armenia’s leadership, which responded by scaling down its ties with Moscow and bolstering relations with the West.\n Prospects for peace and better relations After reclaiming Karabakh, Azerbaijan engaged in talks with Armenia on normalising ties. As part of the negotiations, Armenia agreed to hand over several border villages to Azerbaijan.\nAzerbaijan also has demanded that Armenia rewrite its constitution, which contains a reference to the prospective reunification of Armenia and the Karabakh region. The authorities have yet to present a revised draft in the face of public protests.\nA key stumbling block in peace talks was Azerbaijan seeking a land bridge to its Nakhchivan region. Azerbaijan does not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, while Armenia had staunchly resisted control by a third party, seeing it as a breach of its sovereignty.\nIt was not clear how that resistance had been overcome in the deal.\nRussia, which has a military base in Armenia, had previously proposed deploying its troops to secure the corridor. Armenia, bent on scaling down ties with Russia in favour of closer relations with the West, rejected the idea.\n“Russia has been left on the sidelines, because the Kremlin has nothing to offer to Armenia and Azerbaijan,” said Olesya Vartanyan, a South Caucasus expert, noting that Moscow’s regional influence withered after it focused on the war in Ukraine.\n“Russia now lacks resources to deal with Armenia and Azerbaijan,” Vartanyan said.\nThe prospective peace deal also would pave the way for Turkey and Azerbaijan to reopen borders with Armenia that have been shut for nearly four decades, leaving the landlocked country to rely on limited transit routes via Georgia and Iran.\nTurkey views the prospective agreement as part of its efforts to expand its influence in the South Caucasus, while Armenia sees the reopening of the border and resuming trade with Turkey as a top priority. Pashinyan, who visited Turkey in June in the first such visit by an Armenian leader, has made normalising ties with Turkey a key goal.\n“For Armenia, it would guarantee stability and allow access to the Turkish market, ports and investments, as well as its inclusion into key regional transport corridors,” Vartanyan said, adding that a peace deal would help make Armenia a key link between Europe and Asia.\n“Armenia has an extensive transport infrastructure since the Soviet times, including railways and highways that could significantly expand trade routes via South Caucasus,” she said.

I like that. I voted for that.\"Financial Motivation?Cain’s recruitment seems to be part of a Department of Homeland Security push to boost ICE’s ranks with financial incentives like signing bonuses and “legal” student loan repayment. \n\n\"You can defend your homeland and get great benefits,\" he told followers.While Cain’s new role is making headlines, RadarOnline.com has learned Cain has faced a plethora of tax issues over the last decade. The reported $50,000 bonus for new ICE members may be a stronger factor than politics for the Miracle at Manchester actor.Public records show Cain has faced five major tax liens since, all of which have since been released. \n\nThe liens total over $800,000.\n\nCain faced three federal tax liens, one for $409,314 Federal Tax Lien filed April 8, 2016, one for $204,347, filed October 31, 2017, and one for $109,158 Federal Tax Lien filed February 8, 2018.\n\nIn addition, the TV actor also dealt with two California state tax liens, one for $65,495 filed May 24, 2017, and one for $109,158 filed February 8, 2018.\n\nThere is no evidence of any current tax liens, but the total underscores just how much tax debt Cain needed to work off.Trump and Cain have Tax Issues in CommonWhile Cain hasn’t suggested his decision to join ICE has anything to do with his past financial troubles, the timing has sparked speculation. \n\nCain’s politics and his willingness to lean into hot-button issues have made him a darling of the conservative media circuit. But his latest gig and growing closeness with the President have raised eyebrows.\n\nIt turns out Cain and Trump share more than just a conservative platform.

It is not known if Leonardo took a private jet to the ceremony.\nJeff and Lauren's wedding reportedly cost some $40million - which also faced protests in the city of Venice. \nJeff BezosAmazonLauren Sanchez\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLauren Sanchez shows off VERY extravagant £227k watch she was gifted as a wedding present by her billionaire husband Jeff Bezos as they step out in Ibiza\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 60\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

So, let's say we live long. It will be 50-plus years. And if 10 of those years were bad, you know, anybody would take those odds,\" she added about how the couple has no plans to split even if times get hard again.The Need to 'Talk Honestly'Michelle went on to dish about the marital math, \"People don't tend to think in terms of odds and numbers. Of course, you're going to have years if you add up the days and the hours where you're struggling to find that connection.\"\n\n\"That is a normal experience. You would have that if you lived with your best friend for 30 years, 10 of those years you would hate each other. But you don't throw out a relationship or marriage because of a couple of bad years,\" she explained. \n\nThe former first lady said she worries terribly about younger people today who are quicker to quit on each other when things get tough and wishes they would follow her and Barack's lead to stick it out through unhappy times. \n\n\"I think more married couples need to talk more honestly about what marriage really is, because I see too many young people quitting on relationships,\" Michelle warned, saying otherwise people will \"end up alone\" unless they're willing to \"compromise\" quite a bit with their partner.10 Awful YearsThe Chicago native stunned fans in 2022 when she made a highly cutting comment about how she hated being married to Barack. However, she noted that it took place while the couple were raising their now-adult daughters, Malia, 27, and Sasha, 24, while balancing life in the White House as America's new first family. \n\n“People think I’m being catty for saying this...it’s like, there were 10 years where I couldn’t stand my husband. Ten years! And guess when it happened? When those kids were little,\" Michelle huffed at the time. The couple's kids were just 10 and seven years old, respectively, when Barack won the presidency in 2007.Fueling the FireMichelle fueled divorce rumors in a huge way when she skipped two major Washington D.C. events in January, leaving Barack to attend Jimmy Carter's state funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration solo while she vacationed in Hawaii.\n\nThe Becoming author said the choice was an intentional one when appearing on NPR’s Wild Card podcast in June. \n\n\"One of the major decisions I made this year was to stay put and not attend funerals and inaugurations and all the things that I'm supposed to attend,\" Michelle declared at the time about her independence from her husband's duties as a former president.\n\n\"That was a part of me using my ambition to say, 'Let me define what I want to do, apart from what I'm supposed to do, what the world expects of me.'\"\n\nReflecting on her high-profile snubs, Michelle added, \"Whatever the backlash was, I had to sit in it and own it. But I didn't regret it, you know? It's my life now, and I can say that, now. But we'll see. Maybe next year, we sit down, I'll go, 'I went a little too far.'\"","summary":"Michelle Obama declared that she intendeds to be 'married forever' to husband Barack Obama despite nonstop divorce rumors.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/michelle-obama-barack-divorce-rumors-struggling-connection/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/97fzysij2/0x0/michelle-barack-obama-together-forever-not-divorcing-1754604015583.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:58:04","author":"Beth Shilliday","authors":["Beth Shilliday"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":349156220,"title":"The sprawling £8,000-a-week Cotswolds manor house where JD Vance will enjoy his 'British MAGA summer'... and it's just a stone's throw from Jeremy Clarkson's farm","text":"JD Vance is renting a sprawling Cotswolds manor house a mile away from Jeremy Clarkson's Diddly Squat farm - just months after they exchanged an angry war of words over Britian's military capability.\n\nThe US Vice President opted for a quintessential British summer holiday with his family and is renting the enormous property in Oxfordshire for £8,000 a week, we can reveal.\n\nLocated in a tiny hamlet and set behind a 15 feet high stone wall with six acres of sprawling gardens, the home is perfect for a private getaway.\n\nYet he may be in for an awkward encounter if he runs into the former Top Gear, who previously labelled him a 't***' who has 'no clue about history'.\n\nClarkson slammed Vance after Donald Trump's deputy described the UK as 'some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years'.\n\nHis comments discrediting the efforts of British soldiers who fought with the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan came when discussing how the West could tackle the threat of Russia.\n\nWriting in his column in The Sunday Times at the time, Clarkson hit back: 'Now I don't want to stoop to his level, but I'm going to. \n\n'Vance is a bearded God-botherer who pretty much thinks that women who've been raped should be forced to have the resultant child.\n\n'I've searched for the right word to describe him and I think it's 't**t'. He also has no clue about history.\n\n'Because far more recently than 30 or 40 years ago, as Vance claimed last week, our brave young men were being blown to pieces in some godforsaken desert to support whatever madcap scheme the American president had embarked upon that week.'\n\nThe sprawling historic manor where Vance will be staying, isn't far from Clarkson's own Cotswolds home, Curdle Hill Farm, better known as Diddly Squat Farm.\n\nBuilt in the 18th century, it is currently swarming with secret service agents dressed in regulation navy blue sports jackets and khaki chino trousers who are guarding the property around the clock.\n\nOne of the team, when asked about Mr Vance's arrival, remained stern-faced, saying only: 'We can't tell you anything.'\n\nThe manor's owner was equally tight-lipped about Vance's arrival, only saying: 'Thanks so much but we have no comment to make.'\n\nBut locals were more forthcoming and confirmed the arrival of Trump's deputy.\n\nOne told the Daily Mail: 'There has been a lot of activity at the manor this last few days. It is hard to miss. Security absolutely everywhere.\n\n'Men dressed identically surrounding the property with ear pieces and dark glasses.\n\n'Blacked out Mercedes vans shuttling people around every few minutes. We have never seen anything like it. It's like something out of a film.\n\n'The word is that it is indeed for JD Vance. So we shall see.'\n\nIn the grounds, American secret service personnel in dark glasses, talking into ear-pieces, were dotted around its four corners keeping watch.\n\nOn the main gateway of the property, leading to a sweeping 'in and out' driveway, two suited security guards were checking the security clearance of those coming and going in a stream of blacked out cars and Mercedes limousine vans.\n\nIn an adjoining field, an impromptu circular helicopter landing pad had also been mown into the grass. Within the grounds, teams of gardeners had been drafted in to make the lawns and pretty herbaceous borders look immaculate.\n\nDuring his UK visit, Vance and his family - including his wife Usha and their children Ewan, Viviek and Mirabel - are set to stay the night with Foreign Secretary David Lammy at his grace and favour home in Chevening, near Sevenoaks in Kent.\n\nDespite Lammy previously describing Trump as a 'woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath', he is now said to consider the President's deputy as a 'friend' and that they 'completely relate' to each other.\n\nThe family are expected to arrive on Friday, staying one night at the 300-year-old Grade I mansion before heading off to Oxfordshire via Hampton Court Palace, in Richmond, London.\n\nThe politicians are said to have bonded over their religious backgrounds, with Lammy being raised in the Anglican church and Vance being baptised Catholic in 2019.\n\n'Lammy has visited Vance's family and the relationship looks like it will continue to grow on a personal as well as a professional basis,' a source told the Telegraph.\n\n'They will have a short bilateral meeting, no doubt discussing Ukraine, Gaza, trade and tech... They'll wrap it up and then the family will join.'\n\nThe Vance family will no doubt enjoy the sprawling mansion which sits within 3,000 acres of the North Downs countryside.\n\nThe Foreign Office said ministerial engagements would be announced in 'the usual way'.\n\nThe Cotswolds have seen an influx of rich Americans holidaying in the rural spot in the last few years, after a number of celebrities have flown over the pond to settle down.\n\nUS talk show host Ellen DeGeneres moved in with her wife Portia De Rossi last year after Trump's reelection.\n\nShe is said to now be deliberately fleeing her home in the country while the Vice Presidents settles in for the summer.\n\nOther famous names known to have visited the area include Beyonce, Jay-Z and Taylor Swift who have all enjoyed the bucolic area's chocolate-box villages, honeyed-stone, rolling hills and cosy pubs.\n\nMany locals in the area, however, are not too happy about Vance's arrival - with some groups hoping to spoil his trip.\n\nPro-Palestine activists, eco zealots and trade unionists have vowed to wreak havoc with planned protests during his stay, mirroring the similar demonstrations seen when the Vance family visited Disneyland.\n\nThe Stop Trump Coalition alliance is said to include pro-Palestinian activists, climate campaigners and trade unions.\n\nIt comes after his boss, President Trump, visited Scotland last week spending time teeing off at his Turnberry golf course in Ayrshire in between holding diplomatic talks with the Prime Minister.\n\nAnnouncing plans for a protest during Trump's proposed state visit to the UK in September, the group said: 'We are meeting Trump with protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh this month, and then in London and Windsor in September.\n\n'JD Vance is every bit as unwelcome in the UK as Donald Trump. We remember how Vance cut short his ski trip in Vermont because he was so enraged by the sight of a few protesters.\n\n'We are sure that, even in the Cotswolds, he will find the resistance waiting.","summary":"The U.S. Vice President opted for a quintessential British summer holiday with his family and is renting the enormous property in Oxfordshire for £8,000 a week, we can reveal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14979773/JD-Vance-cotswolds-manor-house-summer.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/07/14/101006587-0-image-m-25_1754573055183.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:56:04","author":"Editor,Eirian Prosser","authors":["Editor","Eirian Prosser"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":349156298,"title":"Trump's latest executive order banning 'debanking' takes aim at an industry that cheered his return","text":"President Donald Trump made his feud with big banks official.After making his grievances against banks clear earlier in the week, Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.According to the executive order and a White House fact sheet, the order requires various federal regulators and agencies to \"make reasonable efforts\" to reinstate debanked customers. The Treasury Department is tasked with creating a strategy and new regulations to prevent \"unlawful\" debanking, while the Attorney General would oversee and investigate cases of people suspected of being debanked in discriminatory ways.The Trump Organization and Eric Trump sued Capital One earlier this year for closing accounts in the wake of the January 6, 2021, riot. Capital One has denied wrongdoing, and litigation is ongoing.Earlier this week, Trump told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in an interview that Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase had previously refused to accept his deposits.\"They totally discriminate against, I think, me maybe even more, but they discriminate against many conservatives,\" he told show host Andrew Ross Sorkin. \"I think the word might be 'Trump supporters' more than conservatives.\"In a statement to Reuters, JPMorgan said it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America did not address Trump's claims.In January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump claimed Bank of America and other banks were refusing to accept conservative customers, which the Charlotte-based lender denied.Prior to the inauguration, crypto-connected supporters of the president turned debanking into a political issue. Well-known venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said on Joe Rogan's podcast that dozens of tech founders had been cut off from banking services during former President Joe Biden's administration.Banks are just the latest industry to draw the president's ire, despite the fact that the securities and investment industry gave more to Trump than his opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, according to political donation tracker OpenSecrets. Trump's cabinet also includes Howard Lutnick, a banker who ran Cantor Fitzgerald before becoming the Secretary of Commerce.The executive order could result in fines for banks found to have discriminated against conservatives, mimicking the White House's tactics for punishing other industries.Trump started his year by pulling funding from elite higher education institutions that he accused of condoning discrimination on campus. He soon pivoted to an ongoing legal battle with the country's biggest law firms, some of whom have represented clients in court cases against him.Then, as his tariff policies intensified, Trump went after the likes of Amazon and Walmart for potentially being explicit about how these trade barriers would drive up prices for US consumers. More recently, Big Pharma executives woke up one morning to a letter from the president, threatening them to lower the prices of drugs.Capitol One and the Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comments.","summary":"Trump's 'debanking' executive order targets financial institutions he believes are denying services to conservatives, including his family business.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-debanking-executive-order-2025-8","image":"https://i.insider.com/68927f703d5881a51c1eab7f?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:51:57","author":"Bradley Saacks,Katherine Li","authors":["Bradley Saacks","Katherine Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.554},{"id":349156348,"title":"Donald Trump biographer casts doubt over President's latest golfing heroics","text":"Donald Trump biographer casts doubt over President's latest golfing heroics\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump unveils 'very strong' gender testing for Olympics\n\nBy JAKE FENNER, US SPORTS WRITER\n\nPublished: 00:49 BST, 8 August 2025 | Updated: 00:50 BST, 8 August 2025\n\nFormer Sports Illustrated and ESPN writer Rick Reilly once again blasted President Donald Trump's golf game - further accusing Trump of lying about his accolades.\n\nReilly has written multiple books on the sport of golf, including one about Trump titled 'Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump'.\n\nThe latest jab the acclaimed sports writer delivered comes in the context of Trump posting a video of a putt of his on Truth Social with the caption, '36 Club Championships!'\n\nReilly took a screen grab of that video and captioned it: 'Number of \"championships\" he said he had last time: 24 Number he says he suddenly has now: 36 Number that his twisted ego just skipped: 11. Number of actual \"championships\" he's won: 0 #CommanderInCheat'.\n\nWhile Trump isn't the only President that Reilly has accused of nefarious scores (having previously accused Bill Clinton of similar behavior), Reilly's book on Trump became a New York Times Bestseller when it was released in 2019.\n\nThe notes for the book's listing on Amazon reads, 'Based on Reilly's own experiences with Trump as well as interviews with over 100 golf pros, amateurs, developers, and caddies, \"Commander in Cheat\" is a startling and at times hilarious indictment of Trump and his golf game.'\n\nFormer SI and ESPN writer Rick Reilly once again accused the President of cheating at golf\n\nOn Wednesday, the President posted this clip to celebrate his '36 Club Championships!'\n\nReilly took the chance to suggest again that Trump lied about his prowess on the course\n\nWayne Rooney's son Kai bumped up three age levels at Manchester United\n\n52.5k viewing now\n\nWhich striker will Newcastle sign?

Moore&apos;s findings come amid the backlash President Donald Trump is facing for firing the head of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a Biden-era appointee who he has claimed issued \"rigged\" jobs numbers during the Biden administration to help Democrats. \"I was telling the president that he did the right thing calling for a new head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because this shows that over the last two years of the Biden administration, the BLS overestimated job creation by 1.5 million jobs. Mr. President that&apos;s a gigantic error,\" Moore said Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. TRUMP FIRES LABOR OFFICIAL OVER WEAK JOBS NUMBER, ORDERS CRIMINAL PROBES OF PAST OPPONENTS Trump quipped in response that it \"might not have been an error,\" noting it may have been due to incompetence instead. \"If it was an error, that would be one thing,\" Trump added. \"I don&apos;t think it&apos;s an error. I think they did it on purpose.\" Just days after announcing the decision to fire Erika McEntarfer, the president accused her of inflating job numbers to an \"all-time high\" ahead of the 2024 presidential election to help Democrats hold the White House. Trump also claimed that, after he won the election, McEntarfer readjusted the numbers downward to make them look worse. Trump said the \"miscalculations\" were some of the most significant in more than 50 years. TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER FIRES BACK AT NBC HOST OVER &apos;SHOOTING THE MESSENGER&apos; CLAIM ABOUT BLS FIRING Trump&apos;s lashed out at McEntarfer after a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and downward revisions made to the prior two month&apos;s reports. The latter revisions suggested the economy was not as strong as previously expected. The move drew widespread condemnation from Trump&apos;s critics, who argued the move could set a dangerous precedent that undermines credibility in the BLS&apos;s data. \"The totally groundless firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at BLS, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau,\" said William Beach, who ran the BLS during Trump&apos;s first term. On Thursday, in addition to sharing how the Biden administration may have miscalculated job numbers during its final two years, Moore said the advanced look at Census data he had access to also showed that, from January through the end of June, the average median family income, when adjusted for inflation, was up $1,174. Moore also said he used the new data to compare family income numbers in the U.S. under Biden compared to the numbers during Trump&apos;s first term.

So, Mr. President, you gained ten times more income for the average family than Joe Biden, and that&apos;s because of your policies.\" Fox News Digital reached out to BLS but did not receive an immediate reply.","summary":"During an Oval Office meeting, pro-Trump economist Steve Moore said the president made the right call to fire the head of Bureau of Labor Statistics given faulty jobs projections.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/watch-biden-jobs-chart-had-gigantic-error-trump-right-fire-bls-chief-economist-says","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/08/trump-moore-jobs-bls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:49:11","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":349161996,"title":"Guterres ‘disheartened’ by Trump’s tariffs: Spokesperson ","text":"United Nations, Aug 8 (SocialNews.XYZ) UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “disheartened” by the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump that came into force on Thursday, according to his Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq.\n\nGuterres “has made clear that he believes that all trade wars are ruinous, and they need to be avoided”, Haq said on Thursday.\n\n“So, this is disheartening news”, he added.\n\nGuterres is concerned about the poorest, who will be affected the most by the higher tariffs, he said.\n\n“He wants to make sure that all governments are aware that at a time of trade wars, that measures need to be taken to protect the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of society, who will certainly suffer as a result of the higher prices”, Haq said.\n\nA tariff of 25 per cent on most imports from India took effect on Thursday, with an additional 25 per cent to be added next week as a punitive measure for purchasing Russian oil.\n\nThe UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)\n\nThree developing countries will face tariffs of over 35 per cent (two of them, Myanmar and Laos, in the least-developed category), eight will face tariffs of over 25 per cent, ten will face tariffs of over 18 per cent, and 32 will face tariffs of 15 per cent, according to his executive order.\n\nThe order listed Brazil at 10 per cent, but Trump has added a 40 per cent punitive tariff over a domestic politics issue.\n\nTrump is also abolishing on August 29 an exemption from tariffs for goods under $800 shipped individually.\n\nIndia has called the tariffs “extremely unfortunate.”\n\nIt criticised the imposition of “additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest”.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"United Nations, Aug 8 (SocialNews.XYZ) UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “disheartened” by the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump that came into force on Thursday, according to his Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq.

The chamber came within a one-vote margin of the bill failing.\n\nNow, the growing scandal enveloping Rep. Cory Mills, a Republican from Florida’s 7th congressional district, threatens to turn that margin against Johnson and GOP leadership and make the passage of future bills an even greater hurdle for the president’s party.\n\nMills, 45, is in his second term as a congressman. Having won re-election last year, the Seminole County representative was looking forward to a second term defined by his new chairmanship of a House subcommittee. Instead, he’s being accused by the current reigning Miss United States of sextortion — she claims he threatened to release intimate images and videos of her after they broke up. Mills denied the allegations and argued in a statement on Wednesday that the woman’s attorney, his former primary challenger, “weaponized” the claim to damage his reputation.\n\nBut the scandal is just one of several buzzing around the congressman. He’s also accused of racking up tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid rent and is under a totally separate House Ethics Committee investigation looking into whether he improperly benefited from federal contracts. An incident at Mills’s DC residence also led to a police investigation of Mills for assault earlier this year, though both he and the alleged victim denied an assault occurred.\n\nIn short, Mills’s baggage is becoming a problem. At the bare minimum, it’s providing a target for Florida Democrats to go after as the 2026 midterms approach.\n\nBut if he’s forced out sooner, Johnson’s problems become a lot bigger. The Cook Political Report rates Mills’ district as +5 Republican, giving the GOP an edge but no guarantee of victory in an election over the next two years.\n\nShould Gov. Ron DeSantis be forced to call a special election, that could be a real issue for the GOP: Democrats have been consistently overperforming in special elections in 2025, even in districts with strong Republican bents. Three have already announced plans to run for the seat next year.\n\nThe drip-drip of headlines is already making Mills’s colleagues nervous, Politico reported on Wednesday.\n\nMills’s bad press marks the third time since the 2024 elections that a ‘Florida Man’ member of the House has caused headaches for Mike Johnson and the caucus as a whole, and earned the derisive label synonymous with chaotic, bad decision-making and trashy behavior.\n\nFirst, the surprise resignation of Matt Gaetz just weeks after his successful re-election threw the House into a pre-Trump tizzy. The spat over his Ethics Committee report, which looked into allegations that he pursued underage girls for sex, led to Gaetz’s failed bid to become Trump’s attorney general and a special election, while casting a massive shadow over the president’s transition. Gaetz denied the allegations, but dodging efforts to investigate them cost him his political career.\n\nThen, another Florida congressman, Randy Fine, earned a condemnation from a fellow Republican, Marjorie Taylor Greene, after tweeting “starve away” in response to reports of widespread famine and devastation in Gaza; Fine is one of Israel’s most vocal supporters in the House, even among Republicans. Since joining the House, he’s also made racist statements about Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim and Somali-American congresswoman from Minnesota. Those won’t cause him much trouble with Republican leadership, who rarely punish that sort of thing, but could earn him a censure or even expulsion if they continue under a Democratic speaker in 2027 or beyond.\n\nAs Mike Johnson and Donald Trump look for ways to expand their single-digit majority with help from unprecedented gerrymandering attempts in Texas and other GOP states, one has to wonder whether the caucus would be served by examining why members from one reddening state keep giving them so much trouble.","summary":"String of Sunshine State issues is causing headaches for Mike Johnson and Donald Trump, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mills-sextortion-scandal-florida-republicans-b2804091.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/07/23/28/GettyImages-2152373805.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/DKib49mn-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:48:29","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":349158908,"title":"Trump honors Purple Heart recipients, including 3 who sent him medals after attempt on his life","text":"By MEG KINNARD\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump recognized nearly 100 recipients of the Purple Heart at the White House on Thursday, including three service members who gave him their own medals after an attempt on his life at a Pennsylvania campaign rally.\n\nTrump opened the event marking National Purple Heart Day by noting that dozens of the award’s recipients were at the ceremony in the East Room.

Yet they too, he says, refused to take his money.\n\n'I was loaded up with cash and they told me, \"I'm sorry, sir, we can't have you,\"' claimed the astonished client, none other than President Donald Trump, who revealed this all on CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nTrump had been 'debanked.'\n\nSo, allegedly, were his wife First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron.\n\nMelania, in her memoir, wrote that she and Barron, now 19, were unceremoniously ousted: 'I was shocked and dismayed to learn that my long-time bank decided to terminate my account and deny my son the opportunity to open a new one.'\n\nBoth JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have declined to comment on the president's claims. But he wasn't only the rich and famous who were allegedly targeted.\n\nThere are reports that banks possibly monitored ordinary citizens – flagging those who shopped at outdoors stores, like Bass Pro Shop, or for used words, like 'MAGA,' in private financial transactions payments.\n\nThe implications are chilling - and now, the Daily Mail is lifting the lid on this shadowy, dystopian practice that sources in the US banking industry say has been ramping up for years – but was allegedly pursued with real vigor under the administration of the President Joe Biden.\n\n'The Biden administration weaponized federal agencies,' a high-level executive source employed by a large American bank told the Daily Mail, who also said he is relieved that Trump is finally doing something about it.\n\n'Trump reduced debanking in his first term,' said the banking industry source. 'But he didn't drain the swamp. Now he's turning things upside down.'\n\nOn Thursday, the president signed an executive order to stop banks from discriminating against customers for political and religions.\n\nThe concept of 'debanking,' born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, was detailed in Congressional hearings throughout the spring of 2014.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee investigated a Justice Department campaign called 'Operation Chokepoint.'\n\nIt was a scheme to financially 'choke out' companies that Barack Obama's administration considered objectionable, even though they were legal businesses.\n\n'The initiative is predicated on the claim that providing normal banking services to certain merchants creates a 'reputational risk' sufficient to trigger a federal investigation,' the probe found.\n\nGun sellers, payday lenders and coin dealers were among those targeted by the effort.\n\nHouse Oversight determined that Chokepoint 'inappropriately demands that bankers act as the moral arbiters and policemen of the commercial world' and called for the program to be ended.\n\nIt was officially halted in August 2017.\n\nBut it never really went away.\n\nThe banking source explained the government simply turned to the bureaucracy to do its dirty work, even though the first Trump administration feebly attempted to take on the issue.\n\nA week before Trump left office in 2021, the OCC finalized a 'Fair Access to Banking Service,' which would have defanged 'reputational risk' rules.\n\nBut two weeks after that OCC paused the rule-making process and then the Biden White House killed it outright.\n\nThat's when things really took off, the Daily Mail is told.\n\n'Regulators under Biden looked for ways to do [debanking] all over again,' the banking source said.\n\nIt was – until recently – spelled out in Orwellian, nebulous terms, in the rules of one of the two major bank regulators.\n\n'Reputation risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from negative public opinion,' read the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) handbook. 'Departures from effective… risk governance principles and practices cast doubt on the bank's board and management.'\n\nAlong with these new regulations – came the regulators.\n\nBeyond oversight of the Federal Reserve and the OCC, banks are now monitored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC), among other.\n\n'Put it this way,' said Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan at the Economic Club of Washington DC earlier this year, 'There's 100-plus regulators in our building every day.'\n\nBanking industry sources tell the Daily Mail that banks existed in a state of fear. They were never explicitly told not to do business with certain clients, but they were pressured to be extremely risk averse.\n\nRyan Bangert, senior vice president at the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a legal charity that advocates against debanking, told the Daily Mail, 'Debanking is almost exclusively associated with more conservative figures and policies: energy, second amendment, climate.'\n\n'Concerns about reputational risk are understandable and justifiable if your bank is associated with fraud, illegal activities or reckless lending and investment. But the problem comes when it's extended to individuals that a particular segment of society dislikes. That's when you drift into a very dangerous place,' he explained.\n\n'You should not lose access to basic financial services because you hold a particular political view that the elite find distasteful.'\n\nYet, he says, the practice was 'turbocharged' under Biden's watch.\n\nIn 2021, the Alliance itself was debanked.\n\nMike Lindell, the vocal MAGA adherent and entrepreneur behind the MyPillow company, was told in February 2022 that Minnesota Bank and Trust would no longer do business with him.\n\nThat same year, Sam Brownback, the former governor of Kansas, had his account closed by JPMorgan Chase while leading the National Committee for Religious Freedom, a non-partisan, multi-faith non-profit.\n\nAt one point, Chase allegedly suggested they would reconsider Brownback's organization as client if they disclosed political candidates it intended to endorse.\n\nThe fact the agencies were involved in the enforcement of rules, didn't make them any less effective.\n\nIn 2024, TD Bank was fined $3 billion for failing to enforce anti money-laundering schemes: the fine contributed to a chilling effect on the industry, a banking source told the Daily Mail.\n\n'Justice Department involvement proved that these regulators had real teeth,' a banking source said. 'A criminal finding by the DOJ is life-threatening to a bank.'\n\nNow, banks are looking to undo the damage done, the big bank source told the Daily Mail, and they're pleased with the course the Trump administration is taking.\n\nThe 'reputation risk' rule is still in the OCC handbook, but it has been struck through. And the Federal Reserve, which operates independently of the executive branch, dropped its 'reputation risk' regulation in June.\n\n'It is right to go look at these rules, because at the end of the day, they are causing decisions to be made that can be looked at in retrospect and differently,' said Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America – the very bank that refused Trump's money. 'We should get these rules right.'\n\nJPMorgan said in a statement: 'We don't close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.","summary":"In early January 2021, shortly after the Capitol riots in Washington DC , one of the wealthiest and most recognizable businessmen in the world received an unexpected phone call from his bank.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14981331/debanking-Deep-State-Biden-Obama.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/07/23/101022439-0-image-m-8_1754605068782.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:38:41","author":"Editor,Harriet Alexander","authors":["Editor","Harriet Alexander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":349155766,"title":"CAIR urges US to probe the death of father killed in Israeli settler attack","text":"A Muslim American group has sent a letter to the administration of President Donald Trump urging it to investigate the death of United States citizen Khamis Ayyad in a settler attack in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said Ayyad’s family has “no confidence in any investigation conducted by Israeli authorities”.\n\nThe letter, penned by CAIR and its Chicago chapter, was sent on Wednesday, almost a week after Ayyad’s death on July 31.\n\nAddressed to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi, it underscored legal provisions, including the US-Israel Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), that would enable Washington to investigate Ayyad’s death.\n\n“The Department of Justice has previously relied on these very statutes to investigate the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel, which killed several Americans. Yet it has failed to apply them when the perpetrators are Israeli,” the letter read.\n\n“This double standard is indefensible and is a CLEAR act of discrimination. American citizenship must not be selectively protected based on the identity or political alliances of the killer.”\n\nAyyad, a Chicago area resident and father of five, was one of two US citizens killed in settler attacks in the West Bank in July.\n\nAccording to Ayyad’s family, settlers torched cars outside his home in the town of Silwad, north of Ramallah, last week.\n\nAyyad woke up to put out the fire, but then the Israeli army showed up at the scene and started firing tear gas in his direction.\n\nThe family believes that Ayyad died from inhaling tear gas and smoke from the burning vehicles.\n\nEarlier in July, Israeli settlers also beat to death 20-year-old Sayfollah Musallet, a Florida native, near the West Bank village of Sinjil.\n\nThe US government has acknowledged Ayyad’s death but stopped short of denouncing it or even calling for an investigation.\n\n“We can confirm the death of a US citizen in the town of Silwad in the West Bank,” a US State Department spokesperson told Al Jazeera last week.\n\n“We offer condolences to the family on their loss and are providing consular assistance to them. We condemn criminal violence by any party in the West Bank.”\n\nAccording to CAIR, US officials have not reached out to Ayyad’s family.\n\nWilliam Asfour, the operations coordinator for CAIR-Chicago, said the State Department’s statement shows that “Palestinian lives are not valued” by the US government.\n\n“This statement from the State Department seems more like formalities than any actual concern,” Asfour told Al Jazeera. “We want to see direct action. Holding the terrorist settlers accountable is a step in the right direction.”\n\nAfter Israeli soldiers or settlers kill American citizens, the US usually calls on Israel to investigate.\n\nBut Israel rarely prosecutes anyone for abuses against Palestinians. Rights advocates have long argued that Israel is not equipped to investigate its own crimes.\n\nFor example, no charges have been brought in the case of Musallet’s fatal beating nearly one month later.\n\nThe CAIR letter stressed that Israel has a “well-documented and deeply troubling history of distorting facts, fabricating narratives, and systematically exonerating its soldiers and illegal settlers”.\n\nSince 2022, Israeli soldiers and settlers have killed at least 10 US citizens. None of the cases have resulted in criminal charges.\n\n“The murder of Khamis Ayyad must mark a turning point. The time to stop hiding behind legal technicalities and political convenience is now. Inaction is complicity,” the CAIR letter said.\n\nOn Monday, Congressman Chuy Garcia, who represents a district in the Chicago area, also called for the US to launch its own probe into Ayyad’s death.\n\n“I join his family in urging a full US investigation into the incident and demand the accountability of those involved,” Garcia wrote in a social media post.","summary":"US Muslim group highlights the legal statutes that it says enable the Trump administration to investigate the incident.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/7/cair-urges-us-to-probe-the-death-of-father-killed-in-israeli-settler-attack?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-01T111110Z_2127814387_RC29YFAK6LW7_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-SETTLERS-ATTACK-FUNERAL-1754608149.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-07 23:34:40","author":"Ali Harb,Apps Support","authors":["Ali Harb","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.428}]}
