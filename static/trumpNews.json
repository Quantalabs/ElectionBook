He also attended a national security meeting, and reportedly weighed in on candidates for administrative positions.\n\nA Mar-a-Lago source tells us this new bond is “making a lot of Trump’s inner circle feel iced out.”\n\n“He’s always with Elon,” says the source. “It’s 24/7. Trump’s inner circle is getting smaller. He has dumped some others,” in favor of hanging with the SpaceX founder, 53.\n\nThe insider noted that Trump, 78, is also spending time with the co-chair of his transition team, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, but added of Trump, “the advisors he used to eat with are nowhere to be seen.”\n\nWe’re told even “former regulars at Mar-a-Lago are feeling left out.”\n\nAnother source tells us, “Trump loves pitting people — even his friends — against each other. Everyone is jealous of Elon. . . His close associates are a tad miffed they have lost their prime seat,” next to the president-elect.\n\nWe hear that Trump believes that Musk, who has dubbed himself the “First Buddy,” helped clinch his victory.\n\n“Trump credits Elon with helping him win the bro vote,” says the source. “Elon can’t take an official position — so no one’s losing a job — but by being together, working on the common good of the country, they are also wheeling and dealing together.”\n\nIt was announced this week that Musk will lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) with Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nBut away from any sniping, there’s at least one person who is enjoying Musk’s presence: Our source tells us that Melania Trump is a big fan of the Tesla boss.\n\n“Melania likes Elon,” a source tells us, adding it seems like she has “been around more.”\n\nOne video clip seen by Page Six shows the soon-to-be first lady beaming at Musk during a group meal.\n\nOn Wednesday while addressing House Republicans at a Beltway hotel, Trump reportedly joked, “Elon won’t go home. I can’t get rid of him — at least until I don’t like him.”\n\nMusk — along with his son X — was part of the Trump’s family photo taken on election night. \n\nDon Trump Jr.’s and Vanessa Trump’s daughter, Kai, even posted a pic with Musk at the golf course on X, captioned, “Elon achieving uncle status.”\n\nIn response to an NBC News report that said Musk is, “behaving as if he’s a co-president and making sure everyone knows it,” Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt commented, “Elon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.”\n\nAnother spokesperson, Anna Kelly, has said, “Elon Musk is a genius, an innovator, and has literally made history by building creative, modern, and efficient systems. Elon Musk has dedicated himself to America’s future by offering to serve with President Trump to ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America’s taxpayer dollars effectively.”","summary":"\"He's always with Elon,\" says a source. \"It's 24/7.

Now, that might have been believable if it had happened just once or twice. But five, six, seven, eight times in a row? There's no way.\"\"Federal air marshal whistleblowers came forward with very disturbing information,\" she continued. \"They revealed that I had been added to a secret terror watchlist run by the TSA called Quiet Skies on July 23. This is the very same day my husband and I began to be subjected to those in-depth TSA searches.\"Gabbard went on to say that she had \"put all the pieces together\" and determined that she was targeted by the TSA because she had criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, who had just announced her run for president, during a Fox News interview one day earlier.\"The TSA placed me on the Quiet Skies domestic terror watchlist in what I can only describe as the ultimate betrayal,\" she said. \"The Harris-Biden regime has now labeled me a domestic terror threat. Why? They see me as a threat to their power.\"Despite the assertions of the former congresswoman, it has not been confirmed that Gabbard has actually been flagged by the Quiet Skies program, with the TSA not publicly commenting on the matter.Newsweek reached out for comment to the TSA via email on Wednesday evening.The TSA describes Quiet Skies as a tool used to \"reduce the risk on airplanes by identifying passengers deemed to be higher risk according to certain travel patterns and other intelligence-based factors,\" while specifying that \"the program does not take into account race or religion.\"\"Passengers referred to the program may require additional scrutiny for a certain period of time; however, TSA routinely removes passengers from the program sooner than the prescribed period if we become aware of information that indicates the passengers do not represent a risk,\" a TSA blog post from August 2018 reads.Several Republican lawmakers, including Senators James Comer and Rand Paul, have demanded that the TSA release records concerning Gabbard and others allegedly being politically targeted by programs like Quiet Skies.","summary":"Gabbard has suggested that she was targeted by the TSA over her support of President-elect Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-tsa-terrorist-watchlist-1985527","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2520489/tulsi-gabbard-tsa-terrorist-watchlist-claim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 01:01:49","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":264662658,"title":"British Daily The Guardian Is Quitting X- Here’s Why","text":"The Guardian, a leading British Daily, is quitting X, claiming an increase in toxicity and the worsening environment on the platform.\n\nSuch concerns already existed for a long time within the media outlet regarding the kind of discourse and content happening on the platform, especially during the recent U.S. presidential election.\n\nFor The Guardian, recent elections made these problems all the more clear, and now they are permanently leaving this social media site.\n\nWhy it is quitting X?\n\nThe Guardian, in a statement published on November 13, said: “We wanted to let readers know that we will no longer post on any official Guardian editorial accounts on the social media site X. We feel that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere.”\n\nThe Guardian said that they were pulling out from the platform because of its often disturbing content, ranging from conspiracy theories and far-right propaganda.\n\nSome of this toxicity, it said, is attributable to Elon Musk himself, the owner of X, which has endemic problems. “I mean, Elon does control the room in a certain way, maybe certain narratives that are being allowed to flourish because of his presence or view.”\n\nThe Guardian expressed unease with Musk’s political role, noting that his actions may have helped shape the discourse surrounding Donald Trump’s campaign. Following Trump’s re-election, Musk is now set to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with improving governance and reducing waste.\n\nThe Guardian has more than 30 official accounts and a combined following that exceeds 20 million on X. It will halt all editorial postings on the platform, though, clarifying in a statement that individual reporters will be free to use X for news-gathering purposes.\n\nThis exit marks an important step for The Guardian, a move that shows the growing debate for media organizations regarding social media risks and benefits. “Social media can be an important tool for news organizations and help us reach new audiences,” The Guardian stated, “but, at this point, X now plays a diminished role in promoting our work.”\n\nElon Musk, took over the platform in 2022 and rebranded it as X, and has received harsh criticism for how he runs the platform, from policy to content moderation.\n\nALSO READ: Mark Zuckerberg Drops NSFW ‘Get Low’ Remix in Romantic Tribute To Wife","summary":"The Guardian said that they were pulling out from X as it promotes contents like conspiracy theories and far-right propaganda.\n\n\nThe post British Daily The Guardian Is Quitting X- Here’s Why appeared first on NewsX World.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/british-daily-the-guardian-is-quitting-x-heres-why/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_5795.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 01:01:13","author":"Vanshika Tyagi","authors":["Vanshika Tyagi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.272},{"id":264662480,"title":"Woman vows to cancel Thanksgiving and Christmas with husband’s family after he voted for Trump","text":"A woman has penned an essay explaining why she was canceling both Thanksgiving and Christmas following the election.\n\nOn November 6, it was announced that Donald Trump had won a second term in the White House beating out his opponent, Kamala Harris. Andrea Tate recently wrote an essay in HuffPost, reflecting on her reaction to the president-elect’s victory knowing that she voted for Harris and her husband had voted for Trump.\n\nTate wrote how upset she was following the announcement and how she had resorted to scrolling on social media to make herself feel better when she noticed a Facebook post from her husband that read, “God Bless America. God bless #45, 47.”\n\n“It had a few likes, and a few commenters joined him in his celebration. He was downstairs in the kitchen making coffee, and I was upstairs avoiding him. I couldn’t talk to him — or even look at him,” her essay read.\n\n“I immediately texted, ‘I love you, but out of respect for me and all my liberal writer friends, can you please take down that post? Also, tell your family I love them, but I will not be coming for Thanksgiving, and I won’t be hosting Christmas. I need space.’”\n\nShe explained that her husband went on to apologize, but she still maintained minimal contact.\n\nWhen she did finally speak to him, it was regarding the holidays as she said she couldn’t “bite my tongue like I did with Hillary.”\n\n“I don’t want to disrespect your parents or your brother and his family in their home, or our home, so it’s best this way. No scenes. You can go see them. Seriously — I will not be in a room of 15 people who voted for Trump,” Tate said.\n\nHer husband did not argue with her and only mentioned that their son and his girlfriend were supposed to be coming home and if they would “feel bad.” “We will have our own small holiday, and it will be fine,” she replied.\n\n“I was surprised he didn’t argue about the change in holiday plans. Normally, it would be a bone of contention because of how close he is to his family,” the essay continued. “Somewhere inside, he must understand what this election outcome means to me. I know he has empathy for me, for which I am thankful. I will hold onto this like a life raft as I try to figure out how we move forward with our marriage.”\n\nAs the essay was reposted on various Reddit forums, many people commented on their own experiences with family members who disagreed with them politically.\n\n“I can’t have a social visit with my parents without it escalating to yelling because they want to spout off on whatever was on the Fox News chyron that day,” one Reddit comment began. “I’m the only child. They were nothing but doting parents for my entire childhood and since about 2016 they’ve become miserable unbearable people to be around.”\n\n“Sadly, I was thinking of visiting my dad in Texas this Christmas, but my brother has gone full MAGA since moving there in 2020,” another commenter wrote. “I thought he’d be happy Trump got elected, instead I had 5 days of endless texts of hate until I finally blocked him.”","summary":"‘I don’t want to disrespect your parents or your brother and his family in their home, or our home, so it’s best this way,’ she told her husband","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/cancel-thanksgiving-christmas-donald-trump-b2646786.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/13/22/GettyImages-2183092208.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 01:00:54","author":"Brittany Miller","authors":["Brittany Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":264663094,"title":"Flurry of contract deals come as railroads, unions see Trump's election looming over talks","text":"The flurry of contract agreements announced early this fall — including two more Wednesday — offer evidence that major railroads and their unions are working to avoid the standoffs that led them to a brink of a national strike two years ago.\n\nBoth sides are also now keenly aware that President-elect Donald Trump — who has a track record of supporting big businesses — would be the one ultimately appointing the people who would help resolve the contract dispute this time if they can't work something out themselves. \n\n“I think overall it may lead the unions and employers to want to bargain more intensively and come to agreements sooner,” said Todd Vachon, who teaches in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations.\n\nBut it still won’t be easy to satisfy all the workers who remain concerned about the widespread job cuts and have seen much bigger raises in other labor disputes.\n\nCurrent contracts don't expire until July but the National Carriers Conference Committee group that negotiates on behalf of the railroads said in its statement at the start of the talks on Nov. 1 that it was hoping for an early resolution. And just Wednesday, the railroads announced two new tentative agreements with the Transportation Communications Union and the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen.\n\nThe railroads play such a crucial role in the economy that the president and Congress have the power to intervene because so many businesses rely on them to deliver their raw materials and finished goods. The Railway Labor Act that governs railroad contract talks dictates that if the two sides can't reach an agreement, the dispute could wind up in the hands of a special board of arbitrators the president appoints that would hear from both sides and recommend a deal. That happened in 2022 — though the industry still reached the brink of a strike.\n\nThe two unions that inked deals Wednesday and several others among the 12 rail unions had already reached some agreements with CSX, Norfolk Southern and BNSF railroads even before the formal talks began between the unions and a coalition of railroads that includes Norfolk Southern, BNSF and Canadian National. The other major railroads — CSX, Union Pacific and CPKC — have decided to bargain individually with their unions.\n\n“I think we all saw the perils of going through that again,” Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George said about the yearslong battle the industry engaged in last time that created “a lot of anxiety and uncertainty in the labor force.”\n\nThe industry has also made strides over the past two years toward addressing some of the quality-of-life concerns that nearly led to a strike in 2022 before Congress and President Joe Biden intervened. In the two years since the nation’s freight railroads nearly ground to a halt, the industry has offered paid sick time to 90% of them — at the urging of the Biden administration and other officials — and most railroads have promised to improve the unpredictable schedules of train crews who were generally on call 24-7 without any idea when their next day off might come.\n\nAs a result, the relationships between the major freight railroads and the dozen different unions that represent their workers have generally improved, though they remain strained at times. \n\nThe president of the largest rail union that represents conductors — SMART-TD — Jeremy Ferguson said, “We've come a long way in two years.” But many workers still feel overworked and underappreciated by the railroads after the job cuts made in the name of efficiency in recent years.\n\nCSX's CEO Joe Hinrichs, who has led the industry with the first sick-time deals and other efforts to show employees they are appreciated, said he's optimistic about the prospects for deals.\n\n“We’re in a dramatically different place than we were two years ago, that’s for sure,” Hinrichs said. “I think what’s gotten us there is just everyone stepping back at CSX and at the unions and saying, OK, no one was satisfied what happened last time. What are we going to do differently this time?”\n\nA bunch of those early deals were ratified this fall, not long after the first ones were announced in the midst of the labor dispute that brought Canadian National and CPKC railroads to a halt for a few days in Canada. But more recently, deals that offer 18.8% raises and improved vacation and health benefits over five years have been getting voted down after workers at Boeing and the East Coast ports secured deals with much larger raises following their strikes.\n\nJosh Hartford with the Machinist Union's District 19 rail division said that with a deal with CSX already out for a vote when the longshoreman secured their big raises, there wasn't enough time to explain why this contract — coming on the heels of the 24% raises rail workers received in their last contract — might be considered a good deal. The port workers had gone longer without a new deal before this one that includes 62% raises.\n\nBut Hartford said “the morale is still poor” on most railroads after all the cuts and there is a strong feeling among some workers that maybe they could get more if they fight longer, so the Machinists rejected that deal. Conductors have also voted down all but one small deal on part of BNSF they have considered so far, and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union has been unwilling to sign onto any of these early deals. Plus, the third largest union that represents track workers split on the deals it voted on so far.\n\nSo getting all the unions to agree won't be easy. Consider that BLET is locked into a lawsuit with Union Pacific trying to get that railroad to deliver the schedule improvements it promised, and SMART-TD is headed into arbitration on scheduling issues at UP and crew size details at BNSF.\n\nBLET union president Eddie Hall said his organization that represents engineers “wasn’t going to rush into deals that didn’t deliver.”\n\n“Some of the deals that were reached early by other unions were hurried and failed to meet the needs of those railroaders who operate trains,” said Hall, who cited concerns about the expanding use of remote-control trains, the ever-increasing length of trains and the impact of all the job cuts.\n\nBut the pressure will be on the unions to settle because the Biden administration won’t be there anymore to lean on the railroads, said Virginia Commonwealth University professor Victor Chen, who studies labor issues as a sociologist.\n\n“I expect the Trump 2.0 administration will continue with its earlier playbook of blocking unions at every turn. In negotiations, the unions will need to keep in the back of their minds that the White House will no longer step up for them the way that Biden did,” Chen said.","summary":"The flurry of contract agreements announced early this fall — including two more Wednesday — offer evidence that major railroads and their unions are working to avoid the standoffs that led them to a brink of a national strike two years ago","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-ap-joe-biden-omaha-eddie-hall-b2646854.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/14/01/Railroad_Contract_Talks_46738.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 01:00:39","author":"Josh Funk","authors":["Josh Funk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":264662366,"title":"Robot dogs spotted safeguarding Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRobot dogs have been standing watch at President-elect Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home ever since he won the US election.\n\nA robotic guard was spotted on at least two occasions patrolling the outside of Trump’s resort, in a gesture of heightened security after Trump survived two assassination attempts.\n\nTwo days after the election, a white and black robotic dog was captured on video walking along a path and lake at the Palm Beach residence near a Secret Service agent dressed in blue. \n\nRobotic dogs are ‘Secret Service assets’, according to the agency’s chief of communications, Anthony Guglielmi.\n\n‘Safeguarding the President-elect is a top priority,’ he told USA Today on Friday. \n\n‘While we cannot get into the specific capabilities, the robotic dogs are equipped with surveillance technology, and an array of advanced sensors that support our protective operations.’\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"'Safeguarding the President-elect is a top priority.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/14/robot-dogs-guard-donald-trump-maralago-home-21989047/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SEC_229493140-5cf4.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:59:09","author":"Jessica Kwong","authors":["Jessica Kwong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":264662408,"title":"Europe pushes for resolution against Iran at IAEA, diplomats say","text":"PARIS/VIENNA - European powers are pushing for a new resolution against Iran by the U.N. atomic watchdog's board next week to pressure Tehran over its poor cooperation, as the world awaits the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, diplomats say.Such resolutions risk further diplomatic tension with Iran.

Steve Scalise (R-LA) vowed to launch a House investigation into what he called an “outrageous abuse of power.” He said, “Denying disaster aid to Americans based on their support of President Donald Trump is as disgusting as it gets for an unelected bureaucrat being paid by American taxpayers.”\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) posted on X, “The blatant weaponization of government by partisan activists in the federal bureaucracy is yet another reason why the Biden-Harris administration is in its final days.” \n\nThreats to FEMA workers\n\nReports of emergency responders facing threats are well-documented. One such incident occurred in October in Rutherford County, North Carolina, where a man was charged with “going armed to the terror of the public” after making threats about harming FEMA employees while carrying a rifle and a handgun.\n\nAs a result of those threats, FEMA had to “stand down and evacuate the county immediately.” The hostile encounter occurred as false claims were being circulated about FEMA planning to bulldoze and seize Chimney Rock.\n\nIn Carter County, Tennessee, an armed militia confronted, “surrounded,” and threatened FEMA workers. The armed group only left after a volunteer member of the International Alliance of Community Chaplains defused the situation by distancing herself and the disaster relief command center from FEMA.\n\nViolent threats against FEMA workers have been widespread on social media platforms such as TikTok and X as well, with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue declaring it “poses a credible risk to public safety.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in October that if the threats create “so much fear that my staff doesn’t want to go out in the field, then we’re not going to be in a position where we can help people.”\n\nWashington, the former FEMA supervisor, admitted that the whistleblowers who leaked her message about avoiding pro-Trump homes “are telling you the truth,” but argued that the real issue is that FEMA employees are not given the resources and protection they need to be able to provide help to every household.","summary":"Former Federal Emergency Management Agency supervisor Marn’i Washington came under fire last week for advising her team to “avoid” Florida houses “advertising Trump.” This call allegedly came after several hostile encounters with property owners.

That’s why today, honestly, nobody believes that Ukraine is going to get back Crimea. That’s the reality,” Barroso told Euronews in an exclusive interview.\n\nThe former Commission chief acknowledged his comments were “delicate” as they put him directly at odds with the long-standing position of Ukraine, which firmly advocates for the complete recovery of all Russian-occupied territories as of 1991 borders.\n\n“We will force Russia to face reality, namely international law, the power of global solidarity, and the need to restore full justice for Ukraine, ultimately a lasting peace for our entire land,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in September while speaking at the Crimea Platform, a yearly summit devoted to the recovery of the Black Sea peninsula.\n\nIn a statement to Euronews, a spokesperson for the European Commission, currently led by Ursula von der Leyen, said “Crimea is Ukraine”.\n\n“This is a consistent position the EU member states agreed in all relevant European Council conclusions since 2014,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThroughout the interview, Barroso stressed he had “no doubts” about the bloc’s duty to support Ukraine against Russia’s full-scale invasion that began in February 2022, arguing the war has evolved into a “global conflict” due to the participation of North Korean troops and represents an “existential challenge” for the entire world.\n\n“Whatever happens with our American friends, we should support Ukraine,” he said, referring to the election of Donald Trump, which has stoked fears that Washington might soon cut off assistance and leave Europe to back Ukraine on its own.\n\n“What is at stake in Ukraine is a fundamental issue for all the world. The so-called Global South are looking,” he went on. “Are the Europeans, and the Americans as well, strong enough to defend their convictions or are they going to give up? This is very important.”\n\n‘An extremely difficult situation’\n\nIn his interview with Euronews, recorded on Tuesday afternoon, Barroso recalled the diplomatic squabble to outline a common EU response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\n\nBack then, he said, there were three options on the table: declare war on Russia, impose sanctions, or settle for a statement of condemnation.\n\nWith “strong support” from Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, then a member state, the bloc opted for the second option – sanctions – but opposition quickly emerged to water down the plans, Barrososo said.\n\n“The first one was in fact, [Hungarian Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán. Orbán said: ‘I don’t agree with sanctions because there will be counter-sanctions, it will be negative for us. But if there is a consensus, I will not oppose it,'” he recalled.\n\nThe Netherlands was “quite insular” in its views while Malta, Cyprus, Greece and Slovakia displayed “some level of ambiguity,” he explained.\n\nMaking matters more complicated, member states could not agree on what sort of sanctions they wanted to apply. “That’s why, at the end of the day, the sanction package was relatively minimalist compared to what happened afterward,” Barroso said.\n\nThe penalties included an arms embargo, an import ban on Crimea-made goods, an export ban on sensitive technology and restrictions on Russia’s state-owned banks, among other measures. Dozens of separatists in Eastern Ukraine were blacklisted.\n\nIn the aftermath of the full-scale invasion, the 2014 sanctions came under intense scrutiny for the limited scope and inability to curtail Moscow’s military might. \n\n“Governments were not ready to go further. That is the reality. The Commission (was) ready to go further, but governments were not ready to go further because of their own interests,” Barroso admitted. “It was an extremely difficult situation.”\n\n‘Putin doesn’t want Ukraine to exist’\n\nDuring his 10 years in office, Barroso met with Vladimir Putin 25 times, granting him privileged access to the Russian leader’s obscure thinking.\n\nAccording to Barroso, Putin “does not want Ukraine to exist”. Alternatively, he envisions a “vassal state” like Belarus, without an independent foreign and defence policy.\n\n“Putin does not want to come to the Russian people and say: ‘OK, we have gained some more territory, a little bit of Donbas, a little bit of Crimea.’ No. The goal of Putin was to avoid Ukraine (from being) a country. I know because I spoke with him about this,” Barroso said, evoking his private conversations with the Russian leader.\n\n“He said to me: ‘Why are you defending Ukraine? You know very well that Ukraine is an artificial country created by the CIA and by the European Commission.’ I told him: ‘Look, if it was the European Commission who created Ukraine, I should be informed.'”\n\nIt is up to the EU to decide whether Putin should be allowed to fulfill his neo-imperialist vision or have his impulses contained, Barroso argued.\n\n“Are we going to support Ukraine in a way that Ukraine can be a country or are we going to say: ‘OK, Mr Putin, you are stronger, we are weak, you can take Ukraine. It’s not so important for us.’ That’s the question,” he went on.\n\nAsked if he supports Ukraine’s EU aspirations, Barroso said the bloc had never admitted a country that was still fighting a war, making it impossible for Brussels to commit to a date by which Kyiv could be ready to join.\n\nIn the meantime, “we should do everything to help Ukraine to become a member”.","summary":"In an exclusive interview with Euronews, José Manuel Durão Barroso recalls how EU leaders struggled to come up with a common response to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Crimea and what Vladimir Putin told him in private.

Pete has spent his entire life as a Warrior for the Troops, and for the Country. Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice,” Trump said in a Nov. 12 press statement.\n\nIf Hegseth is confirmed by the Senate as the next defense secretary, he will serve as the military’s top civilian leader under the president, and will oversee the day-to-day efforts of the military.\n\nHis nomination occurs at a time when the U.S. military is transitioning from the counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations that have come to define the Global War on Terror era, to a renewed focus on conflicts with peer and near-peer adversaries such as Russia and China, whose actions in certain regions have complicated U.S. counter-terrorism and security interests.\n\nWhile studying at Princeton, Hegseth was commissioned as an officer in the Minnesota Army National Guard. He joined the service in October 2002 and served as an infantry officer.\n\nAccording to a copy of his service record shared with The Epoch Times, Hegseth’s unit did a rotation through Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, from June of 2004 to April of 2005. The base has served as a detention facility for foreign terror suspects throughout the Global War on Terror era.\n\nAfter that Guantanamo Bay deployment, Hegseth’s unit deployed to Iraq from September of 2005 to July of 2006. His unit deployed to Afghanistan from May of 2011 to January of 2012.\n\nIn the course of his military service, Hegseth twice earned the Bronze Star. His other awards and decorations include the Joint Service Commendation Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, three Army Reserve Components Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal with a Bronze Service Star, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, an Iraq Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with “M” Device, the Army Service Ribbon, two Overseas Service Ribbons, the D.C. National Guard Emergency Service Ribbon, a NATO Medal, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, a Combat Infantryman Badge, and an Expert Infantryman Badge.\n\nHegseth has authored several books focusing on military and political issues. He has also been a mainstay on Fox News, providing political commentary across the network’s various daytime and primetime programs.\n\nHis most recent book, published earlier this year, is titled “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.” The book focuses on concerns that U.S. military leadership has become overly focused on political issues, at the expense of its overall warfighting capability.\n\n“Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse,” Hegseth said.\n\nHegseth voiced support for firing military leaders deemed to be too focused on advancing political causes, up to and including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nHegseth said the U.S. military’s method for modernizing its arsenal is partly to blame for the declining probability of success in a hypothetical conflict.\n\n“The way our bureaucratic system works, the speed of weapons procurement works, we’re always a decade behind in fighting the last war,” he said.\n\nHegseth said he’s been a “recovering neocon” for the past six years, and lamented “the foolishness with which we ricocheted around the world intervening, thinking it was in our best interests, when really we just overturned the table and created something worse in almost every single scenario.”\n\nReferring to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Hegseth said, “The last thing I want is my son deploying to the Donbas, to defend eastern Ukraine.”\n\nThroughout the 2024 election cycle, Trump has said he would prefer to quickly bring an end to the current Russia–Ukraine conflict through negotiations.","summary":"Hegseth is a retired Army National Guard major and combat veteran turned author and political commentator.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/5-things-to-know-about-pete-hegseth-trumps-choice-for-secretary-of-defense-5759107","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/11/13/id5758785-Pete-Hegseth-Trump-1-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:50:55","author":"Ryan Morgan","authors":["Ryan Morgan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.111},{"id":264662016,"title":"Analysts peg October inflation at 33.48%","text":"Analysts have projected that Nigeria’s inflation figure for October will hit 33.48 per cent from 32.70 per cent in September.\n\nThis projection is coming ahead of the National Bureau of Statistics inflation report for October expected to be released on Friday.\n\nAccording to a Senior Market Analyst At FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, inflationary pressures have been cooling in recent months but the latest figure for October is expected to have jumped 33.4 per cent from 32.7 per cent in September.\n\n“This may be the result of fuel hikes and floods in the northern part of the country affecting the harvest season. The Central Bank of Nigeria has been on a mission to support the naira and attract investments using aggressive monetary policy.\n\n“Interest rates were raised by 50 basis points to 27.25 per cent in September – marking its fifth consecutive hike in 2024. Should the naira show signs of stabilising, annual inflation could peak in the final quarter of this year,” he said.\n\nFollowing Donald Trump’s victory at the polls, Otunnuga had projected that the Nigerian economy may be negatively impacted. \n\nHe said, “His (Donald Trump’s) return to the White House could result in higher domestic oil production while potential tariffs on China may impact global demand. This combination of rising supply and falling demand could enforce fresh pressures on oil which is down four per cent since the start of 2024. Should oil prices continue to weaken, this could threaten countries who acquire a chunk of their revenues from oil sales.”\n\nAlso, analysts at Meristem in their inflation expectation report pegged headline inflation at 33.48 per cent, representing a 78bps increase over the previous month.\n\nSimilarly, core inflation is expected to rise to 28.64 per cent from 27.43 per cent.\n\nPart of their report read, “Headline inflation reversed its previous decline in September 2024, climbing to 32.70 per cent from 32.15 per cent in August after two months of disinflation. As of September 2024, food inflation rose to 37.77 per cent, while core inflation stood at 27.43 per cent. In October, inflationary pressures remained strong, driven by persistent legacy issues in the country’s food sector and the lingering effects of the September flash floods. This led to a decrease in crop yields, undermining expectations of a bumper harvest and pushing food prices higher during the month.\n\n“Additionally, the rise in transportation costs (fueled by an approximate 15 per cent increase in PMS prices during the month), is further impacting food prices. Moreover, the continued depreciation of the naira, which raised the costs of import-dependent goods such as clothes, footwear, furnishings, and household equipment, among others, added to the overall inflationary pressures. For context, the Naira weakened further on the NAFEM window, averaging N1,635.11/USD in October 2024, compared to N1,589.86 in September.\n\n“Thus, we expect food inflation to maintain its upward trend in October, driven by the factors outlined above. Furthermore, we anticipate a rise in core inflation for October, driven by rising fuel prices and ongoing naira depreciation. Overall, we project a sustained increase in the country’s inflation in October 2024 due to these combined factors.”","summary":"Analysts have projected that Nigeria’s inflation figure for October will hit 33.48 per cent from 32.70 per cent in September.

Matt Gaetz of Florida, was once embroiled in a sex trafficking investigation by the Justice Department he’s been tapped to lead, and has been under scrutiny by the House Ethics Committee over allegations including sexual misconduct.\n\nThat probe effectively ended Wednesday, though, when Gaetz resigned from Congress.\n\nGaetz, a staunch Trump defender, has spent years enmeshed in scandals that threaten to derail his confirmation as the nation’s top federal law enforcement officer by the Republican-led Senate.\n\nGaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department’s investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.\n\nTrump’s attorney general is expected to oversee radical changes to the Justice Department, which has been the target of Trump’s ire over two criminal cases it brought accusing him of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump, who cast himself as the victim of politically motivated prosecutions, vowed repeatedly on the campaign trail to carry out retribution against his political enemies if returned to the White House.\n\nIt’s unlikely Gaetz would be confirmed in time to oversee special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two federal indictments against Trump that are both expected to wind down before the incoming president takes office. Smith is expected to leave his post before Trump takes office, but special counsels are expected to produce reports on their work that historically are made public, and it remains unclear when such a document might be released.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday announcing his pick, Trump said Gaetz would root out “systemic corruption” at the Justice Department and return the department “to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution.”\n\nIn a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Gaetz wrote, “It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!”\n\nHours before the announcement, Gaetz said in a social media post that there needs to be a “full court press against this WEAPONIZED government.” He added, “And if that means ABOLISHING every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF, I’m ready to get going!” If confirmed as attorney general, he would oversee both the FBI and the ATF, formally known as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\n\nInside a private meeting of House Republicans, the news that Trump had chosen Gaetz to lead the Justice Department sent a shock. Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho said he has a hard time believing Gaetz will be able to get through the Senate confirmation process. Republican Sen.

How can she become Director of US National Intelligence? How could she possibly pass a normal security clearance?”\n\n“If Tulsi Gabbard becomes Director of National Intelligence,” Åslund added, “it would be better for US national security to close down all intelligence.”\n\nThe Washington Spectator’s Dave Troy, an investigative journalist with expertise on Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin, explained: “This is the reality. This can’t happen. The other Five Eyes countries will cut us off. This is a decapitation strike.”\n\n“Five Eyes” is the joint intelligence-sharing alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nDr Ruth Deyermond, a Senior Lecturer in Post-Soviet Security at King’s College London’s Dept. of War Studies writes: “Even by Trump standards, this an extraordinary demonstration of the extent to which Russia-aligned interests have captured the incoming US executive. What NATO partner (Hungary aside) will trust the US with any intelligence now?”\n\nJournalist Craig Unger is a New York Times best-selling author of books about 9/11, the Bush family, and Trump, including: “House of Trump, House of Putin: The Untold Story of Donald Trump and the Russian Mafia.”\n\nHe writes: “As of now, NATO is effectively over. Why would any of our allies share intelligence with us when the head of National Intelligence is effectively in bed with Putin.”\n\nFormer FBI special agent Asha Rangappa, an attorney and legal contributor to ABC News, issued this warning: “I very much hope that the USIC [U.S. Intelligence Community] takes measures to protect sources (or hand them off to allied intelligence services) pronto because Pooty [Vladimir Putin] is about to learn EVERYTHING we know about them and Ukraine.”\n\nThe Guardian’s Carole Cadwalladr, who exposed the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, posted the video below by Tulsi Gabbard and wrote: “Trump has just appointed this woman Director of National Intelligence. A pro-Russian, pro-Putin mouthpiece. To remind you the UK shares intelligence with the US. Worse than worst case scenario.”\n\nChristopher Miller is the Financial Times’ award-winning chief Ukraine correspondent whose “reporting has focused on Ukrainian politics and various aspects of Russia’s war against Ukraine, exposing war crimes and revealing the plight of people forced to live under brutal occupation,” according to his bio.\n\nHe weighed in on the appointment of Tulsi Gabbard to ODNI:\n\nThe Atlantic’s David Frum, a former Bush speechwriter who recently renounced his membership to the Republican Party, declared Congressman Gaetz’s nomination is the “most absurd,” and former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard’s is “the most sinister.”\n\nREAD MORE: MAGA Congressman Vows Loyalty: ‘If Trump Says Jump 3 Feet High We Jump 3 Feet High’\n\nThe Lincoln Project’s Stuart Stevens, author of “The Conspiracy to End America: Five Ways My Old Party Is Driving Our Democracy to Autocracy,” warned:\n\n“A prediction: assuming we get through this period as a functioning democracy, there will be the first treason trials in America since 1949. Trump is giving functional foreign agents access to America’s security.”\n\nTrump’s latest announcement, that he is nominating U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the U.S. Dept. of Justice as Attorney General, drew consternation, with critics noting that the Florida Republican lawmaker is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, and had been under federal investigation for a litany of possible offenses, including illicit drug use, sex trafficking, and having sexual relations with a minor. He also reportedly had asked outgoing President Donald Trump for a “blanket pardon,” to cover any number of possible crimes, including his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n“Evidence suggested that he had spent time with a number of young women who advertised on a Web site that seemed to be a thinly veiled venue for prostitution,” The New Yorker reported in February. “Gaetz, then a three-term congressman with a reputation for a freewheeling private life, appeared to have the impulse control of a teen-age boy.”\n\nO’Brien also weighed in on Gaetz: “Good lord 2, Matt Gaetz as Attorney General. The GOP seems hellbent on turning the US Government over to Russia.” And he warned that “all of us who have been saying that Europe needs to take care of its own security without the USA…need to scream it louder.”\n\nGaetz has suggested Russia be admitted to NATO, instead of Ukraine.\n\nAlyssa Farah Griffin, the former Trump White House director of strategic communications and a co-host on “The View,” suggested there may be a “strategy” in play.\n\n“Perhaps there’s some strategy to the more *bonkers* Cabinet picks? Trump may be signaling to the Senate to be thoughtful in what nominees it considers blocking -Kristi Noem, for example, suddenly looks immensely qualified for DHS compared to say Gaetz as AG or Tulsi as ODNI.”\n\nMedia Matters’ Matthew Gertz observes, “Matt Gaetz pick is so crazy people have forgotten the Tulsi Gabbard pick which was so crazy people had forgotten about the Pete Hegseth pick. Who knows what tomorrow will bring.”\n\nWatch the videos above or at this link.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Tenfold Increase in Number of Deportations’: Trump Hands Stephen Miller Top Policy Post","summary":"National security and political experts are sounding the alarm over several of Donald Trump’s nominations to top Cabinet-level positions, saying they are not only “totally absurd and appalling,” but a threat to the nation’s—and the world’s—security.\n\nHere’s the current list of all of Trump’s Cabinet-level nominations (Politico is keeping track):\n\n• White House Chief of Staff – Susie Wiles\n\n•Secretary of State – Marco Rubio\n\n•Secretary of Defense – Pete Hegseth\n\n•Attorney General – Matt Gaetz\n\n•Secretary of Homeland Security – Kristi Noem\n\n•Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency – Lee Zeldin\n\n•Director of National Intelligence – Tulsi Gabbard\n\n•Ambassador to the United Nations – Elise Stefanik\n\n•Director of the CIA – John Ratcliffe\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Musk and Ramaswamy Heading New ‘DOGE’ Prompts Legal and Ethical Concerns: Experts\n\n“Good lord,” remarked Phillips O’Brien, a historian, professor of strategic studies, and author of books on World War II, “an outright Putin apologist is named to be head ","url":"https://www.alternet.org/trump-natsec-nominees/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/trump.png?id=28182625&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C4%2C0%2C4","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:45:02","author":"David Badash","authors":["David Badash"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":264661374,"title":"The US-China tech race is moving from chips to the raw materials they're made of","text":"In the race against the US for global tech supremacy, China has the upper hand in at least one critical area: rare earths.The term refers to a group of 17 elements required to make tech products ranging from semiconductors to industrial magnets and some solar panels — the same items embroiled in the US-China trade war.For more than a year, Beijing has slowly been tightening its grip on critical minerals and rare earths.In December, China banned the export of a range of rare earth processing technologies. Last month, China further tightened its grip on the sector. Citing resource protection and national security, Beijing made it mandatory for exporters to track how rare earth minerals are used in supply chains.Now, there are fears that China could tighten the global rare earths supply chain even more.Here's what you need to know about rare earths, what makes them so valuable, and how they play into the tech war between the US and China.China has long dominated the rare earths market due to supply, low labor costs, and lax environmental standards.The country produces 60% of the world's rare earth mineral supply and accounts for 90% of global refined output.The late Deng Xiaoping — the Chinese leader who spearheaded the country's economic reforms in 1978 — recognized their strategic importance in 1992, saying, \"The Middle East has oil, China has rare earths.\"Under the new regulations introduced last month, China's rare earth resources now belong to the state. Two Canadian-owned rare earth refineries in China are also being acquired by state-owned companies.This is not the first time Beijing has placed restrictions on rare earths. In 2010, China imposed strict rare earth quotas, citing environmental concerns and resource preservation. The move sent prices up sharply and prompted the US, the European Union, and Japan to file a complaint against China for unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization. China lost the case and lifted exported quotas in 2015.Various countries tried to diversify their rare earth supply chains in the wake of China's quotas in the 2010s, but success has been limited due to the high cost of investment and environmental concerns.There are renewed efforts to boost global production in the face of rising tensions.In 2022, the US Department of Defense awarded $45 million to MP Materials for rare earth oxide processing, and in 2023, it awarded over $288 million to Lynas USA to set up commercial-scale rare earth oxide production facilities.Beijing's moves to control critical minerals and rare earths are part of a toolbox Beijing has developed over the last four years, Rick Waters, the managing director of Eurasia Group's China practice, said at a press briefing.During President Donald Trump's first term, the US and China slapped retaliatory tariffs on each other. However, China has less leverage in a tariff fight because it exports more to the US than it imports, so it came up with another regulatory framework — this one involving rare earths — that it can use in a trade dispute.\"They're experimenting with its use, and I think, in a way, they could go further — if they perceive they need to,\" said Waters.Any further tightening of rare earth supplies — which are a subset under critical minerals — could leave the US vulnerable to supply shocks.\"China has cornered the market for processing and refining of key critical minerals, leaving the US and our allies and partners vulnerable to supply chain shocks and undermining economic and national security,\" the White House said in a statement in September.China's control over rare earths could weigh heavily in the trade war between Washington and Beijing, with chips in the center of the conflict.Chips are found in everything from computers to cell phones, cars, and defense equipment. Taiwan dominates the market, producing over 60% of the world's chips and over 90% of the most advanced ones.One company — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — is responsible for most of the output and is the key supplier to AI chip giant Nvidia, which is in the thick of the tech rivalry.The US has already moved to block the export of advanced chips and chipmaking equipment to China.If the trade tiff escalates — such as in the form of higher tariffs — China could pull its rare earth card, Oxford Economics wrote in a report published in July.\"China's dominance in the battery supply chain accords policymakers with leverage to withhold industry-specific inputs from Western manufacturers, which could prove inflationary and economically disruptive,\" wrote Louise Loo, the lead economist for Greater China at Oxford Economics.This could involve further controls on critical commodity exports, particularly in rare earth minerals, Loo added.As happened with China's rare earth export curbs in 2010, prices are likely to spike if supply is tightened, so any prolonged supply crunch could drive up inflation for end products.The US and China's moves to outmaneuver each other in the tech race have some analysts drawing parallels to the Cold War.Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider the idea that the US ought to out-compete China and prevent the nation from developing advanced chips plays into a \"bigger power competition narrative.\"She said the tensions are similar, though not identical, to the tensions between the US and Soviet Union that began after the end of World War II.As Bloomberg reported last month, the US is considering limiting export licenses for both Nvidia and AMD chips in an unfolding trade war that has also hit several sensitive industries, including electric vehicles, batteries, and some solar panels.The US imposed similar trade limits, embargoes, and economic sanctions on the Soviet Union, North Korea, China, and North Vietnam during the Cold War.\"I think the heart of the issue is concern about how China will use AI chips for military applications and surveillance,\" Chris Tang, a UCLA professor and expert in global supply chain management and the impact of regulatory policies, told BI. \"It's a different type of Cold War.\"Beyond a tense relationship, the dynamics between the US and China are also creating parallel systems, with the US and its allies on one side, and China and its allies on the other, Nick Vyas, the founding director of USC Marshall's Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute, told BI.Vyas said he's concerned the tension could escalate from this new Cold War to a hot one between global powers.\"When we stop transacting horizontally with each other, that's only creating a larger conflict,\" Vyas said. \"And then with a South China Sea conflict, the geopolitical conflict could turn into a larger conflict, which can lead to a major situation that leads up to a war.\"Representatives for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Representatives for AMD and the Bureau of Industry and Security didn't respond to requests for comment from BI.","summary":"The US is considering expanding its export limits on AI chips to China and its allies.

He is a decorated combat veteran but lacks experience in a senior defense role.\n\nYet it was Trump’s Wednesday’s decision to tap Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) as attorney general that created the greatest heartburn. Meanwhile, his choice of ex-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence was also met with strong skepticism from the senators who would be tasked with confirming her.\n\nGaetz, a House firebrand, was under scrutiny as part of a sex trafficking investigation by the same agency he has been asked to lead. Gaetz denied wrongdoing, and the Justice Department ended its investigation with no charges filed against him.\n\nGabbard, for her part, has no formal experience in intelligence and has been accused of propagating Russian narratives.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-SD), who is replacing Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as the incoming Senate majority leader, offered a measured response when asked what he thinks about nominees like Gaetz.\n\n“We’re gonna vet and process and look at all the noms when they come forward, and we’ll see,” he said. “That’s all gonna happen in the next few weeks we hope.”\n\nBut Senate Republicans, especially the chamber’s centrists, cast doubt that Trump’s nominees could be confirmed. Democrats reacted with disbelief.\n\n“I just heard about Matt Gaetz and Tulsi two minutes ago. We all couldn’t believe it. We thought they were kidding,” said retiring Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV). “I said come on, that’s bulls***.”\n\nHegseth nomination overshadowed\n\nRepublicans were generally surprised by the choice of Hegseth given he is a Fox News personality, but his nomination did not evoke the same kind of response as that of Gaetz or Gabbard.\n\nGOP senators generally regard Hegseth highly for his military service, with the chamber’s conservatives finding it appealing that he is not in the senior ranks of leadership.\n\n“I’m big on Pete. I like Pete. He’s not a Pentagon man, and we need to clean the Pentagon out,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL). “We got way too many generals.”\n\nOthers thought the attention on his current job was overshadowing his other qualifications.\n\n“First off, I see the narrative about a Fox News host, but I haven’t heard the narrative about somebody who’s gotten two bronze stars, as I remember — I think we’ll learn a lot more about his military record,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC).\n\nBut Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority next year, cast doubt he would receive many votes from within their party.\n\n“It’s an unusual choice. I think we have to look very carefully at his qualifications,” said Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “And I think we have to be very, at this point, skeptical.”\n\nGaetz faces dim path to confirmation\n\nGaetz is one of the most controversial figures in the House, where he serves on the Judiciary Committee. Known as a hard-liner, he was the Republican who initiated the ouster of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nGaetz has support from some corners of the GOP, particularly grassroots conservatives, but he has few friends in Congress and would have a difficult time getting confirmed.\n\n“Look, I love President Trump. I support every single one of his picks,” Rep. Max Miller (R-OH) told the Washington Examiner Wednesday. “But this one will never get through the Senate. And I would venture to go talk to every single House member out there to see how excited we are that he potentially can be leaving and will never get confirmed.”\n\nMiller slammed Gaetz’s nomination as a”reckless pick,” but said he’s “happy that he’s out of the House, or will be soon.”\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) was still processing the choice when asked about his nomination. “That’s an uff da,” he said, using a humorous Midwestern phrase for when hearing bad news. “Huh, I don’t know what to make of it. To be determined.”\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said she was “shocked by the announcement” in a brief interview, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, “I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general.”\n\nComplicating Gaetz’s path to confirmation despite Republicans controlling the House is that last year the Department of Justice investigated the Florida lawmaker over sex trafficking offenses involving minors. The Justice Department would decline to bring charges against Gaetz. \n\nThe Florida lawmaker has denied any wrongdoing in response to the allegations. \n\n“That shows why the advice and consent process is so important and I’m sure there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing,” Collins said. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX), who lost the race to serve as Republican Senate majority leader Wednesday, was more reserved in his response, but he indicated Gaetz could have trouble because of the allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding him.\n\nGaetz is also the subject of a separate House Ethics Committee investigation that he has denounced as political retribution against him.\n\n“That might come up,” Cornyn quipped with a grin. “I mean, I don’t know whether there’s any basis to it, so I’m sure we’ll be asking a lot of questions.”\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who himself was nominated for secretary of state by Trump on Wednesday, struck a more deferential tone when asked about Gaetz’s Senate confirmation.\n\n“I’ve known Matt for a very long time; I think he’d do a great job,” he told the Washington Examiner.\n\n“I will make that determination as it goes through,” Rubio said. “But I think he will because the president deserves great deference as a president with a mandate, and he has a right to surround herself with people he trusts, especially with a position that important.”\n\nGaetz finds Freedom Caucus boosters\n\nGaetz is not without some friends in Congress. He is closely aligned with members of the House Freedom Caucus who celebrated the nomination on Wednesday.\n\n“Matt Gaetz is a brilliant mind who will pursue and restore justice for all and de-weaponize a woke and out-of-control justice system,” said Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN). “I congratulate my friend Matt Gaetz and thank President Donald Trump for selecting an advocate for the American people.”\n\n“He’s a disrupter, and the Department of Justice needs massive disruption,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX). “I think that’s why the president nominated him.”\n\nHowever, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) was less effusive in his endorsement. “Matt would be great,” he said with a shrug.\n\nThere are some lawmakers who expect that the House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz could wind down given he resigned from his seat, effective immediately, on Wednesday.\n\n“We’re not going to do anything to expedite this. Once the investigation is complete, the Ethics Committee will meet as a committee,” said House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest (R-MS). “We will then return our findings. If Matt Gaetz is still a member of Congress, then that will occur, if Matt has resigned, then this ethics investigation, like many others in the past, will end.”\n\nGabbard gets backing of Rubio\n\nDespite Gabbard not joining the GOP until last month, there are some Republicans who are supportive of her bid to become director of national intelligence.\n\n“No, I like Tulsi a lot,” Rubio said when asked about Gabbard’s past disparagements against him as a “warmonger.” “We got to know each other quite a bit over the last couple months. I admire her service to our country as it relates to that. When you win by the margins that President Trump won by, that means you created a big tent, and I don’t think there will be any issue at all — I like her a lot.”\n\nBillionaire tech owner Elon Musk congratulated Gabbard’s nomination on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nOther conservatives were not willing to overlook her previous stances on America’s relationship with China and Russia. \n\n“When you voted for Trump, you voted to put Tulsi Gabbard, a Russian asset, in charge of our nation’s intelligence,” wrote former 2020 presidential candidate Joe Walsh on X. “That’s what you voted for. Congratulations.”\n\n“Tulsi loves Russia,” said former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a noted anti-Trump Republican, before he slammed Gabbard over her 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad. “She loves Assad. Assad is a butcher.”\n\nIt is unclear whether Gaetz, Gabbard, or Hegseth will ultimately survive Senate confirmation, and if Trump selects Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a confirmable position, he, too, would likely struggle to win over skeptical senators.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRecess appointments are one way to shortcut the confirmation process, but even then, the Senate would have to acquiesce to that scenario.\n\n“I always think everyone has good qualities, OK, but some people, you have to look harder,” said Manchin.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump&#8216;s first few choices to join his administration drew widespread approval within the GOP.

Trump was expected to fire Smith if he did not quit.\n\nOn Tuesday, a New York state judge granted a request by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office for a one-week delay in proceedings in a third criminal case against Trump to give prosecutors time to consider how his electoral victory affects that case.

That set off a 75-day consultation period, where talks quietly took place behind the scenes — a sort of grace window that closed on Wednesday.\n\nFreeland argued some of Canada’s closest allies, such as the UK, France and Italy, have brought in their own digital services taxes and are not suffering for it at the hands of the U.S.\n\n\"Italy and France are talking seriously about significantly raising the level of their [digital taxes] and they are facing no trade consequences with the U.S.,\" Freeland said. \"The fact that this is being handled within NAFTA is another sign of how special and privileged the Canada-U.S. trade relationship is.\"\n\nShe made the comments speaking with reporters following the second meeting of a special Canada-U.S. relations Cabinet committee that Ottawa rebooted to deal with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nThis kind of tax was a major thorn in the side of the first Trump administration, which ended negotiations with European nations over a global digital services tax in 2020.\n\nRobert Lighthizer, Trump’s former trade chief who may soon return to that key role, launched trade investigations against other countries bringing in digital taxes, and readied tariffs in retaliation against those going it alone, like France.\n\nMembers of Congress have also raised ire over Ottawa's decision. Republican representatives that sat on the powerful House Ways and Means committee this summer called for swift action against Canada, writing in a July letter the tax will “unfairly target U.S companies.” \n\nFreeland says Canada's preference has always been to be part of the global tax framework but her government ultimately gave up on waiting for other countries to reach consensus and move ahead with a plan.\n\nBusiness groups such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Business Council of Canada have also warned Canada will face trade ramifications for adopting the tax.\n\nGoogle brought in a 2.5 per cent surcharge for ads in Canada last month. \n\nAccording to this year's federal budget, the tax could bolster government coffers by $5.9 billion over the next five years.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 13, 2024.\n\nKyle Duggan, The Canadian Press","summary":"OTTAWA — Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland isn’t flinching now that the U.S. can move forward with a trade challenge against the Liberal government's controversial digital services tax.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/freeland-finds-safety-in-numbers-on-digital-sales-tax-9805063","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/11/d4b77e07b3509e3ca64de26fad508445bd5be8d5965701bf4cbaeff66b1a1187.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:36:13","author":"Kyle Duggan,The Canadian Press","authors":["Kyle Duggan","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":264660786,"title":"Protests erupt in Paris over pro-Israel gala organized by far-right figures","text":"By TOM NOUVIAN, Associated Press\n\nPARIS (AP) — Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday against a controversial gala organized by far-right figures in support of Israel.

Since signing on to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Mexico has allowed itself to become a backdoor for Chinese cars, auto parts and other products into Canadian and American markets,” Ford said.\n\nThe situation, he added, is “putting Canadian and American workers’ livelihoods at risk while undermining our communities and doing enormous harm to our shared economic success.”\n\n“If Mexico won’t fight transshipment by, at the very least, matching Canadian and American tariffs on Chinese imports, they shouldn’t have a seat at the table or enjoy access to the largest economy in the world,” the premier wrote.\n\n“Instead, we must prioritize the closest economic partnership on earth by directly negotiating a bilateral U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that puts U.S. and Canadian workers first.”\n\nFord’s comments came a week after the victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election in the United States, and ahead of the 2026 review of the USMCA, which superseded NAFTA in 2020.\n\nTrump has also railed against Mexico forwarding Chinese products north, saying in an address at the Detroit Economic Club last month that he would seek “strong new protections against transshipment” in the USMCA “so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products and auto parts into the United States tax-free through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains.”\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Ford once again made critical remarks about Mexico, saying that it is importing cheap products from China and consequently “undercutting our hardworking men and women, not only here but in the U.S.”\n\n“… They’re slapping a ‘Made in Mexico’ sticker on and shipping it up,” he said.\n\n“… What I’m proposing to the federal government [is] we do a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. and if Mexico wants a bilateral trade deal with Canada, God bless them,” Ford said.\n\nTariffs, trade and transshipment\n\nMexico implemented 5-50% tariffs on a wide range of Chinese products in April, but its duties on some goods, such as electric vehicles, are lower than those levied by the United States and Canada on imports from China.\n\nIn addition to imposing tariffs on goods from China and other countries with which it doesn’t have trade agreements, Mexico is actively seeking to reduce its reliance on imports from the East Asian economic powerhouse.\n\nFinance Minister Rogelio Ramírez de la O said in late July that replacing just one-tenth of Chinese imports with products made in North America would significantly boost economic growth in both Mexico and the United States.\n\nEarlier in July, Ramírez said that Mexico buys US $119 billion worth of products per year from China and sells just $11 billion worth of goods to China.\n\n“China sells to us but doesn’t buy from us and that’s not reciprocal trade,” he said.\n\nThe value of Chinese products that are shipped to the United States and Canada via Mexico is not known, but the Financial Times reported in early 2024 that “some Chinese goods” that would have previously been shipped directly to the United States “are still making their way to the country via Mexico — without facing the same levies.”\n\nThose goods, despite Ford’s claim, do not include Chinese-made vehicles, which could not be passed off as being made in Mexico even with the kind of “sticker” the Ontario premier referred to.\n\nIn an article headlined “China circumvents US tariffs by shipping more goods via Mexico,” the Financial Times also reported on data that showed that the number of 20ft containers shipped to Mexico from China increased 28% between the first three quarters of 2022 and the same period of 2023.\n\nEarlier this year, the United States became particularly concerned about an increase in steel and aluminum exports from Mexico.\n\nIn a meeting in February with Mexico’s then economy minister Raquel Buenrostro, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai “stressed the urgent need for Mexico to take immediate and meaningful steps to address the ongoing surge of Mexican steel and aluminum exports to the United States and the lack of transparency regarding Mexico’s steel and aluminum imports from third countries,” according to a statement from Tai’s office.\n\nMexico implemented tariffs on steel nails and balls from China the following month, while the tariffs that took effect in April hit Chinese steel and aluminum among a wide range of other product categories.\n\nFurthermore, Mexico and the United States announced new measures in July to combat the circumvention of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. They included the implementation of a North American “melted and poured” standard for steel and a similar requirement for aluminum in order for those products to qualify for tariff-free shipment to the United States.\n\nThe United States is also concerned about the possibility of Chinese companies making cars, including electric vehicles, in Mexico and exporting them to the U.S.\n\nAs things stand, no major Chinese automakers have plants in Mexico, although some, including EV giant BYD, have plans to establish a manufacturing presence here soon.\n\nCould bilateral trade deals really supersede USMCA?\n\nYes, but it appears extremely unlikely that the three-way North America free trade pact will be terminated anytime soon.\n\nWhile Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican exports to the United States, and declared last month that he would “have a lot of fun” renegotiating USMCA, he has not advocated the termination of the pact he negotiated and signed during his first term as president.\n\n“I terminated NAFTA. That’s a pretty big thing. A lot of people said it would be impossible to do. I got it done, and we have a great deal now,” he said in Detroit.\n\n“What we have to do is make it much better even, and we’ll be able to do that very shortly,” said Trump, who suggested in 2018 that NAFTA could be replaced with bilateral trade accords.\n\nPremier Ford, of course, does not represent the government of Canada, although he said in a subsequent X post on Tuesday that he had spoken to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about “upcoming USMCA renegotiations” and that they “agreed about the need to keep standing up for Canadian and Ontario workers.”\n\nTrudeau himself said Tuesday that “just about all of our partner democracies around the world have expressed varying degrees of concern about Chinese overcapacity.”\n\nIndicating that he wants the USMCA to continue, the prime minister added that Canada would “continue to work with partners like the United States, and hopefully Mexico as well, to make sure that we are united in our desire to protect good jobs.”\n\nFor its part, Mexico is certainly in favor of the continuation of the USMCA, under whose terms it became the world’s top exporter to the United States. President Claudia Sheinbaum has said on repeated occasions that the three North American trade partners complement each other rather than compete with each other economically. Indeed, the economies and supply chains of Mexico, the United States and Canada have become increasingly integrated during the three decades since NAFTA took effect in 1994.\n\nIn a report on Ford’s remarks, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that “booting” Mexico from the USMCA “would be opposed by large companies with business in all three countries.”\n\n“It also would be viewed skeptically by some who see Mexico as a political ally in preserving U.S. congressional backing for North American trade,” CBC said.\n\n“The huge commercial flow across the Mexico-U.S. border, along with the enormous Mexican-American population, creates support for the pact among southern U.S. lawmakers with fewer connections to Canada.”\n\nStill, Mexico’s growing trade relationship with China, as well as the influx of Chinese investment to Mexico, could be highly contentious issues at the USMCA review in 2026, especially if the United States and Canada continue to see their southern neighbor as a “back door” to the North American market.\n\nThe Sheinbaum administration, however, has demonstrated that it is firmly committed to North America and will not allow its trade and investment relationship with China to adversely affect its relationship with the United States – which imports around 80% of all Mexican exports – and Canada.\n\nFor example, Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said last month that Mexico would “mobilize all legitimate interests in favor of North America” amid the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. That war looks set to intensify when Trump returns to the White House in January, and the 47th U.S. president – in an extension of his “America first” ideology – could even ignite a tit-for-tat trade conflict with Mexico by imposing tariffs on Mexican exports, even while the USMCA remains in force.\n\nInteresting times, to say the least, undoubtedly lay ahead, and the USMCA – perhaps in a renegotiated guise – will almost certainly be a part of them.\n\nIndeed, even if all three parties do not confirm their desire to extend the agreement as part of the six-​year review in 2026, the USMCA cannot be immediately terminated.\n\nInstead, Mexican, U.S. and Canadian officials “will meet again in the seventh year, and each year thereafter until the 16th year,” according to an article published earlier this year by Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“If they cannot agree by the 16th year” – 2036 – “the agreement terminates,” wrote Baker Institute nonresident fellow Simon Lester.\n\nWith reports from Bloomberg and CBC","summary":"Accusing Mexico of helping China skirt heavy Canadian and U.S. tariffs, Ontario Premier Doug Ford is calling for an end to the USMCA. \n\n\nThe post Ontario premier suggests Canada end free trade with Mexico appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/canada-mexico-usmca/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GaNJARAXYAA_LuT.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:35:18","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":264660296,"title":"Question for Trump to solve: Just how many million migrants did Joe let in? 8 million? 12? 15?","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has promised to crack down on the southern border and deport those here illegally.\n\nBut the million-dollar question left by the Biden administration: Just how many people is that?\n\nA recent House Judiciary report says that “For almost four years, Americans have watched as President Joe Biden and border czar Vice President Kamala Harris have abandoned the southwest border and welcomed nearly 8 million illegal aliens into the United States.”\n\nBut that 8 million is likely an undercount — and perhaps by a lot.\n\nThe House Committee on Homeland Security estimated in the spring that there would have been 10 million encounters during Biden’s four-year term. And that doesn’t include “got-aways” — people who crossed illegally without ever talking to a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThere are, meanwhile, all kind of “parole” and other programs the Biden administration used without Congressional approval to fly immigrants in directly from South America and other parts of the world.\n\nSo what’s the final figure? 12 million? More?\n\nThe administration refuses to say.\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris was pressed on the number of migrant releases by Bret Baier of during his Fox News interview with the Democratic presidential candidate on October 16, Harris demurred not once but four times.\n\nSimilarly, when Baier asked DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in January for just a percentage of the migrants his department has encountered and released, Mayorkas claimed he knew “the data,” but refused to reveal it.\n\nThat lack of transparency quickly became an issue for school systems across the United States, which had no idea more than a half million migrant students — few of whom had any English competency and many of whom had no formal education — would soon be filling their classrooms.\n\nLikewise, cities far from the border were whipsawed as they struggled to accommodate migrant arrivals because the administration refused to say how many migrants it had released, and how many more would be coming.\n\nConsequently, more than a few of localities had to scramble to cut costs for essential police and fire services to provide for the housing, medical, and educational needs of their burgeoning migrant populations — with no end in sight.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1915, considered one of the great migration periods of American history, 15 million people migrated to the US — many through Ellis Island.\n\nBiden seems to have approached as massive a figure in modern times, but tried to keep it hidden from the American people.\n\nWe won’t be able to calculate the costs of that crisis until Trump takes office and offers a full accounting of unlawful, but government-sanctioned immigration here since 2021.\n\nLying to the American people about what they can see with their own eyes is a poor politics, but more importantly it undermines faith in our democracy.\n\nWhy were voters most concerned about threats to our democracy more inclined to support Trump? Start with everything the administration hasn’t told you about migrants and the border since January 2021.\n\nAndrew Arthur is the fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.","summary":"President-elect Trump has promised to crack down on the southern border and deport those here illegally.

Meanwhile, diversions by shippers to avoid the Red Sea – which has become too dangerous for many operators -- have created complexities and delays for cargo, container and oil tanker shipping. The strikes at American and Canadian ports add to logistical logjams that could persist for weeks.\n\n“Container traffic entering the West Coast is still challenged today and experiencing volumes booked to avoid the Red Sea issues and East/Gulf labor union activity, which continues to test capacity in those markets,” Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics, said in a news release.\n\n“This, coupled with the recent strike in Vancouver, will challenge U.S. West Coast operations as shippers find safe harbour here. This should continue into December.”\n\nThe prospect of tariffs from a Donald Trump administration also has ITS Logistics anticipating further complications.\n\n“Industry professionals can also expect many companies to start to ship ahead of more-than-certain executive actions regarding tariffs,” ITS warns.\n\nThe firm notes that the last time a Trump administration imposed tariffs, exporters tried to get ahead of them with increased exports into the U.S.\n\n“We now must focus attention to how potential tariffs proposed by the newly elected Trump Administration could impact supply chains, shipping costs, and overall trade dynamics in the months ahead,” Brashier said.\n\n“In late 2018, tariffs implemented by the Trump Administration caused a significant amount of vessel and container diversions, congestion, and overall supply chain headwinds that, at the time, led to the most significant challenges ever to North American supply chains. Shippers moved billions of dollars in goods to get ahead of those tariffs.”\n\n-- With files from Canadian Press","summary":"Trump tariffs could add to logistics snarls with frenzied imports, logistics firm warns","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/transportation/vancouver-port-strike-adds-to-north-american-logistics-headaches-9805523","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/deltaport0004-credit-chung-chow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-14 00:33:44","author":"Nelson Bennett","authors":["Nelson Bennett"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":264660782,"title":"Special counsel Smith asks court to pause appeal seeking to revive Trump’s classified documents case","text":"By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Special counsel Jack Smith asked a court Wednesday to pause prosecutors’ appeal seeking to revive the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump in light of the Republican’s presidential victory.\n\nSmith’s team has been evaluating how to wind down the classified documents and the federal 2020 election interference case in Washington before Trump takes office because of longstanding Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.\n\nThe case accusing Trump of hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate had been seen as the most legally clear-cut of the four indictments against Trump, given the breadth of evidence that prosecutors say they had accumulated.

Matt Gaetz is Donald Trump’s pick to become the United States’ next attorney general, the president-elect announced Wednesday—and reactions are pouring in from both sides of the aisle. \n\nIt’s a staggering choice considering the fact that the Florida congressman has been accused of sex trafficking a minor. His friend, former Florida tax collector Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 11 years for the crime, and Gaetz is currently under a House Ethics Committee investigation connected to those allegations.\n\nRepublican congressman and gun-fetishist Thomas Massie had this strange reaction to the news.\n\nMassie seems to be referring to Trump’s demand that the next Senate majority leader allow him “recess appointments” to skip any confirmation hearings and questions from senators. \n\nBut there are some GOP simps who seem ready to rubber-stamp any and all of the wannabe dictator’s bad ideas.\n\n“Matt Gaetz is incredibly bright, articulate, and fierce! He will restore JUSTICE to the Department of Injustice,” wrote Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.\n\nOne year ago, Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin was accusing fellow Republican Gaetz of showing off videos of his sexual conquests, talking about boozing and doing drugs, and being a general douchebag. \n\nNow it seems Mullin got rid of whatever shred of dignity might have been stuck to his shoe. On Wednesday, he said he supports Trump’s choice to lead our country’s law enforcement apparatus.\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty seemed to be setting the stage to support the ethically dubious Gaetz.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote that Gaetz was “her friend” and an “incredible choice” for AG, before rambling about how President Joe Biden weaponized the Department of Justice and the government has “run amok.”\n\nRep. Andy Ogles (who has a boatload of his own ethical failures) posted his support for Gaetz by choosing a photo that centers … Andy Ogles.\n\nBut not every Republican is as “enthusiastic” as the grossly unethical Ogles. Politico’s Meredith Lee Hill reported on Rep. Mike Simpson’s response when asked about whether or not Gaetz has the “experience and character” to be the next AG. \n\n“Are you shittin me, that you just asked that question?” Simpson said. “No! But hell, you’ll print that and now I’m going to be investigated.””\n\nUnintentional cringe comedian and Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told NBC News, “I got nothin’ for you on that,” while Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson gave a noncommittal, “The president gets to pick his nominees.”\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told Semafor that the “FBI and background checks are pretty intense for an attorney general.” North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis offered up an equally unenthusiastic statement. \n\n“I’m all about counting votes, and I would think he’s probably got his work cut out for him,” Thillis said.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski told NBC.\n\n“I don’t know the man, other than sort of this public persona.” said Sen. John Cornyn.\n\nA “shocked” Sen. Susan Collins was at high levels of disappointment on Wednesday.\n\n“This shows why the advice and consent process is so important, and I’m sure that there will be a lot of questions raised at his hearing,” she said. The last time Collins showed concern, she ended up voting to approve accused sexual predator Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court—and hauling in some sizeable campaign donations thanks to her pretend “concern.”\n\nOn the Democratic side of the aisle, Sen.-elect Andy Kim of New Jersey didn’t mince any words.\n\n“I was originally going to hold off on commenting on nominations at this stage but I cannot stay quiet here,” Kim wrote on X. “I don’t need a confirmation hearing to know that Matt Gaetz is not qualified for Attorney General. I will not support his confirmation.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont echoed so many others’ sentiments with his response to Gaetz’s nomination. \n\n“That was in The Onion, right?” Welch asked.\n\nTrump’s ability to kill satire remains undefeated.","summary":"Rep.
