Ricky Ponting’s commentary, everything that could go wrong for Australia in the first Test did go wrong.\n\nIt started with our top order exhibiting a woeful lack of intent which was only matched for inertia by a fielding performance some described as under-primed, and others as possibly sedated.\n\nThen we played Virat Kohli back in to form while gently acclimatising the babyfaced Yashasvi Jaiswal, all while slow-roasting our precious fast bowling cartel to a crisp in the 35 degree sun.\n\nAdd the quicks turning on the batsmen in retaliation, the forgettable debut of Nathan McSweeney and the low point of Marnus Labuschagne’s cafeteria bouncers, and you could be forgiven for thinking India’s first innings was a software glitch.\n\nBy the close of day three we were left praying for a miracle, with many pleading our boys could return the next morning at 3/12 chasing 534 and bravely forfeit so the last two days could be used for public mourning and another Argus Review.\n\nThe fallout has been immense, with Australia’s vibeless defeat seeing everyone including India, an incensed Australian public and even Father Time bearing down on Pat Cummins’ side.\n\nAnd with just over a week until another bowler-friendly nightmare under lights in Adelaide, Australia has 99 problems and the pitch ain’t one.\n\nThe side is legless against Jasprit Bumrah, the only genuine 40-plus average in the batting unit is its median age, and our beleaguered selectors are sandwiched between accountability and a bare cupboard.\n\nOn the other hand, India are burning $100 bills with cigars as they luxuriate in depth, with headliners in Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Mohammad Shami, Ravi Ashwin and Ajay Jadeja all frothing for their turn to blow the toupees off their stagnating opponents.\n\nAnd worst part of this whole calamity?\n\nIt wasn’t that Cummins’ men crashed to a star-studded Team India, nor how easily the tourists have left our plans as ramshackle as the inside of an Airbnb after a bucks party.\n\nIt wasn’t even the sight of the players laughing with their tormentors in the immediate aftermath while the rest of us scratched our eyes out with forks.\n\nNope, it was the whimperish nature of the surrender that shocked the public and sheared through the very heart of Aussie cricket’s hairy chest.\n\nIn simple terms, Australia’s gusto at Optus Stadium was weaker than servo coffee.\n\nThere were teapot stances for days, the bowlers were continually spoken down to by Jaiswal – a kid who looks like he shouldn’t have his red Ps, let alone a Test cap – all while Cummins led like a skipper who desperately needs to grow some hemorrhoids.\n\nBut the most grim aspect?\n\nNot only did India sensationally mug our boys like the tired pensioners they are, they have also held an uncomfortable mirror up to us – the public.\n\nOnly weeks ago, this nation sneered at Dave Warner’s offer to come out of retirement to help Australia through their chronic opener shortage.\n\nPrior to this, he was continually mocked for an extended farewell tour last summer even though it celebrated one of the most decorated batsmen in history, and better yet, left Marcus Harris out of the side for another series.\n\nWhile Warner’s presence alone wouldn’t have breached the 200-odd run gap, imagine having a spark plug on hand like the 112-gamer amid the funeral at Perth?\n\nAustralia would’ve loved someone like the Matraville boy to get under India’s bonnet and remind them they weren’t playing a team of holograms.\n\nWarner’s ways as an uncharitable warhead who’d reflect stress back through bristling strokeplay or session-upon-session of interminable white noise in the field was a far cry from the low-vibrational offerings of the mannequins at Optus Stadium.\n\nPut simply, Warner would’ve awoken Australia from its wallpaper fielding and provided a scoring threat that – respectfully to Usman Khawaja and McSweeney – would’ve been like an autobahn alongside a school zone.\n\nOf course, the NSW boy was long in the tooth when he retired and nobody is suggesting he should be recalled, even though beggars can’t be choosers and we should be pleading for any shot of prune juice available for this constipated line-up.\n\nAnd yes, his unexplained role in Sandpapergate continues to leave a sour taste, with many Australians even remarking that Donald Trump’s recall to the White House was certainly abominable, but at least they weren’t reversing Warner’s captaincy ban.\n\nBut it’s okay to feel an appreciation for the former opener while also acknowledging he was a woodpecker too.\n\nIn a team that is simply too nice with its genteel persona, clean disciplinary record and healthy relationship with its opponents, maybe Warner’s long farewell tour wasn’t long enough.\n\nAnd while nobody is calling for a repeat of Cape Town, nor a competition of who can be fined the highest percentage of their match fee, just a smidge of mongrel in his honour would be nice.\n\nHere’s hoping our boys tip the cap to our junkyard dog in Adelaide by exhibiting a modicum of pluck, lest risk an even more painful lap of honour this summer from India.","url":"https://www.theroar.com.au/2024/11/28/shame-on-you-australia-you-took-dave-warner-for-granted/","image":"https://cdn4.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1905851766-1-1400x800.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28

Ford had made those comments after expressing criticism of Mexico's trading practices. \n\nSo does B.C. align with Ontario, Eby was asked. \"I think that the perspective of premiers, as I understand and we will confirm that (during) this afternoon's call, that our focus, in provinces and territories, our respective priorities is looking after people, supporting people, businesses and jobs in our local communities is job one,\" Eby said. \"That Canada first focus will ensure that we are pointed in the right direction.\" \n\nTorsten Jaccard, assistant professor at UBC's Vancouver School of Economics, questioned Ford's attitude toward Mexico. \"We probably can't have at this point premiers unilaterally calling for tariffs on Mexican exports to Canada,\" he said. \"This needs to be an all-hands-on-deck-kind-of-approach,\" he said in calling for a coordinated approach toward United States involving Mexico, China (which Trump threatens to hit with a 10 per cent tariff) and European allies. \n\nWhen asked about Jaccard's comments and what he meant by a B.C.-first approach, Eby said such an approach prioritizes B.C. families, businesses and workers. \"I'm sure that is the case for every other premier and I'm sure it's the case for the Prime Minister when he thinks about the country,\" Eby said. \"So the discussion about what tactics are going to be used, what coalitions will be built, what responses will come are going to be canvassed in some detail this afternoon.\" \n\nEby added that he won't take any strategy off the table. \"All I'm saying is, my priority is British Columbia. Our priority is British Columbia families and protecting them from these unjustified tarrifs.\" \n\nConservative Party of B.C. Leader John Rustad, meanwhile, has called on Eby to recall the legislature to better protect B.C. ports with provincial funding, then bill Ottawa. \n\nWhen asked about Rustad's demand, Eby said the legislature will return Feb. 18. But he also left open the possibility that it could return earlier pending discussions with the Prime Minister and provincial and territorial leaders. \"If there is some element of our coordinated strategy that requires legislation or legislative response, I won't hesitate to recall the legislature to address that issue.\" \n\nUBC political scientist Stewart Prest welcomed Eby's announcement. \"I think it's good Eby is showing flexibility on the point, given the seeming lack of a sense of urgency from the government since the election,\" he said. He added that the next step is to articulate a provincial strategy, or least an approach — \"a concept of a plan, if you will\" — which includes but goes beyond legislative action. \n\nPrest had said earlier that Rustad was well within his rights to call for the legislature to be recalled. \"It's pretty clear that events are going to move quickly and unpredictably going forward, so we need to take advantage of every opportunity we have to respond,\" he said. \"I don't think the response here is to accept responsibility for America's perceived immigration crisis, because that's simply not the case. But that doesn't mean Canada can afford to simply sit by and do nothing.\" \n\nWhile border security is primarily a federal responsibility, individual provinces can support that, he added. \"We can't solve America's crisis, but we can ensure that we are doing everything we can do at our end. \"","url":"https://www.langleyadvancetimes.com/news/eby-says-bcs-needs-come-first-as-canadas-leaders-chart-response-to-trump-tariffs-7674808","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/todayinbc/2024-november/eby_presser.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 01:04:53","author":"Wolf Depner","authors":["Wolf Depner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.15},{"id":268340214,"title":"Donald Trumps Team Reportedly Preparing Punish Sanctuary Cities Refuse Take Part Mass Deportations","text":"WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump's team is reportedly preparing to punish so-called sanctuary cities, which are mostly Democratic-run areas where cooperation with federal immigration officials is often limited.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump's advisers are discussing how to strip federal resources from those cities if they refuse to take part in mass deportations.\n\nMORE: LA City Council unanimously votes to approve 'sanctuary city' ordinance\n\n\"Let me be clear: There is going to be a mass deportation.

Kennedy Jr. has big ideas for busting public health policy norms.\n\nHis Senate confirmation hearings -- should they happen -- will come with lots of questions about what Kennedy's ideas would look like in practice.\n\nHis new role would mean relinquishing his outsider critic status and working from within a massive government system, leading an agency of 80,000 employees and dealing with everything from drug approvals to food recalls to the pandemic response.\n\nSo, what happens when his motto \"Make America Healthy Again\" collides with one of Washington's largest government bureaucracies?\n\n\"He seems very clear on what it is he wants to get done. I'm just not sure he has an understanding of what it will take to get that done,\" said one former senior HHS official who worked in the Biden administration.\n\nOn vaccines, President-elect Donald Trump's picks of Johns Hopkins University professor Marty Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, former GOP Rep. Dave Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as surgeon general certainly add to Kennedy's ability to make changes -- if they're confirmed by the Senate.\n\nBoth Makary and Weldon have raised questions about vaccine side effects, although they've also at times been supportive overall of the role vaccines play in public health. Kennedy himself has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by numerous studies.\n\nIn their new positions, Makary, Weldon and Kennedy would have the power to select the experts who sit on important FDA and CDC advisory panels. Those panels play a key role in vaccine recommendations and authorizations for the general public, ultimately creating public health guidance for years to come.\n\n\"I think massively, in large part, the health care community would continue to move forward on vaccines as they do now, as they are considered to be one of the massive successes of public health in the last 100 years. And I don't think that would change,\" said Tom Inglesby, a former senior adviser to HHS and the White House during COVID-19 during the Biden administration.\n\n\"But what could change is potentially the cost of vaccines, the access to vaccines, guidance around new vaccines that might come online, and also confusion around public messaging from the federal government about safety and effectiveness of vaccines,\" Inglesby said.\n\nFood and nutrition\n\nWhen it comes to chemicals and the food Americans consume, it's less clear how Kennedy could make changes at HHS, as opposed to the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Agriculture, which have more oversight of areas such as water fluoridation, which Kennedy opposes, or school lunches, which he says he wants to make healthier. He has said, however, that he would gut the entire nutrition department at the FDA.\n\nKennedy could also move around funding -- he's said he'd deprioritize infectious disease research in favor of chronic illness research, for example. As avian flu cases continue to rise -- raising concerns about a new pandemic -- public health experts and former government officials have pushed back strongly on that idea.\n\nBut he has also called for restrictions on food additives, dyes and ultra-processed foods, something he could have direct influence over through the FDA, which determines safe thresholds for the \"Acceptable Daily Intake\" on substances.\n\nKennedy has generally received a more cautious welcome from the public health community regarding his focus on healthy food.\n\n\"There are some things here that are worth working on. You know, if we're looking at the school lunch program in America, 30 million children get more than half of their calories from that program. It would be a wonderful thing to make that the best school lunch program possible,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former CDC acting director.\n\nBut many public health experts are also wary of giving Kennedy credit, for fear it could lend credibility to other false information he promotes. He advocates drinking raw milk, for example, even though the pasteurization process kills off bacteria that can cause serious illness, including the fast-spreading avian flu.\n\n\"One of the dangerous things about RFK Jr. is that there are bits of things he says that are true, and they're mixed in. And it makes it really hard to sort out what things you should follow because they're based on fact, and which things are not,\" Besser told ABC News, where he was former chief health and medical editor.\n\nExperts also question Kennedy's ability to counter powerful Washington lobbies -- one of his stated main goals -- in a Trump administration focused on working with big business on deregulating industries.\n\nAbortion access\n\nAnother area where Kennedy could be out of line with the Trump administration is abortion access. Kennedy has said he supports legal abortion access until fetal viability (despite an earlier comment on the campaign trail that he later walked back about supporting a 15-week ban) and that such decisions should be up to women.\n\nMany abortion rights advocates still expect the Trump administration to quickly move to rescind protections and halt legal fights the Biden administration initiated after the fall of Roe v. Wade -- but are hopeful that Kennedy and the broader administration would not attempt sweeping bans.\n\n\"[Trump's] obviously waffled on this and other issues a thousand times so I'm not going to trust every word he says, but I do think there's the possibility that he and his administration has seen that actually, abortion access is very popular,\" said Katie O'Connor, senior director of abortion policy at the National Women's Law Center.\n\n\"We have seen that over the past three elections, and there could be pushback if this administration does something to further restrict abortion access.\"\n\nThere are certainly members of Trump's orbit who would support broader restrictions on abortion, but Trump himself has said he would not sign a federal ban if Congress passed one.\n\nSome of the policies O'Connor expects to see rolled back would include the Pentagon paying for service members who need to cross state lines to get an abortion because of where they were stationed, as well as expanded access to abortion pills through telemedicine.\n\nAs HHS secretary, Kennedy could undo these rules and also build on the first Trump administration's efforts. He could expand protections for health care providers who don't want to perform abortion procedures, allowing more providers to deny care, and make it more difficult for private insurers to cover abortion, leaving it more expensive for patients, O'Connor said.\n\nLarge-scale bans, were they executed, would focus on removing access to the medication abortion pill called mifepristone, either by attempting to take medication abortion off the market by way of the FDA approval process, or employing a very old law called the Comstock Act to prohibit the pills from being mailed.\n\n\"I do hold out hope that this administration doesn't want to expand political capital on abortion,\" O'Connor said.","url":"https://abc7news.com/post/what-policies-could-rfk-jr-change-hhs/15595327/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15595376_112724-cc-ap-rfk-jr-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 01:02:48","author":"Cheyenne Haslett","authors":["Cheyenne Haslett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.032},{"id":268339790,"title":"Eby Says Bcs Needs Come First As Canadas Leaders Chart Response To Trump Tariffs 7674808","text":"B.C.

Currently Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace its battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia’s growing military, the official added.\n\nThe White House has pushed more than $56 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s February 2022 invasion and expects to send billions more to Kyiv before Biden leaves office in less than months.\n\nBut with time running out, the Biden White House is also sharpening its viewpoint that Ukraine has the weaponry it needs and now must dramatically increase its troop levels if it’s going to stay in the fight with Russia.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett in a statement said the administration will continue sending Ukraine weaponry but believes “manpower is the most vital need” Ukraine has at the moment.\n\n“So, we’re also ready to ramp up our training capacity if they take appropriate steps to fill out their ranks,” Savett said.\n\nThe Ukrainians have said they need about 160,000 additional troops to keep up with its battlefield needs, but the U.S. administration believes they probably will need more than that.\n\nMore than 1 million Ukrainians are now in uniform, including the National Guard and other units.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been hearing concerns from allies in other Western capitals as well that Ukraine has a troop level problem and not an arms problem, according to European officials who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomatic conversations.\n\nThe European allies have stressed that the lack of depth means that it may soon become untenable for Ukraine to continue to operate in Russia’s Kursk border region. The situation in Kursk has become further complicated by the arrival of thousands of North Korean troops, who have come to help Moscow try to claw back the land seized in a Ukrainian incursion this year.\n\nThe stepped-up push on Ukraine to strengthen its fighting ranks comes as Ukraine braces for President-elect Donald Trump to take office on Jan. 20. The Republican said he would bring about a swift end to the war and has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue the vital U.S. military support for Ukraine.\n\n“There are no easy answers to Ukraine’s serious manpower shortage, but lowering the draft age would help,” said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “These are obviously difficult decisions for a government and society that has already endured so much due to Russia’s invasion.”\n\nUkraine has taken steps to broaden the pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military.\n\nIn April, Ukraine’s parliament passed a series of laws, including one lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25, aimed at broadening the universe of men who could be called on to join the grinding war.\n\nThose laws also did away with some draft exemptions and created an online registry for recruits. They were expected to add about 50,000 troops, far short of what Zelenskyy said at the time was needed.\n\nZelenskyy has consistently stated that he has no plans to lower the mobilization age. A senior Ukrainian official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ukraine does not have enough equipment to match the scale of its ongoing mobilization efforts.\n\nThe official said Ukrainian officials see the push to the lower the draft age as part of an effort by some Western partners to deflect attention from their own delays in providing equipment or belated decisions. The official cited as an example the delay in giving Ukraine permission to use longer-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory.\n\nThe Ukrainians do not see lowering the draft age to recruit more soldiers as a substitute for countering Russia’s advantage in equipment and weaponry, the official said.\n\nSome Ukrainians have expressed worry that further lowering the minimum conscription age and taking more young adults out of the workforce could backfire by further harming the war-ravaged economy.\n\nThe senior Biden administration official added that the administration believes that Ukraine can also optimize its current force by more aggressively dealing with soldiers who desert or go absent without leave.\n\nAP White House correspondent Zeke Miller and AP writer Hanna Arhirova in Kyiv contributed to this report.","summary":"Ukraine has taken steps to broaden the pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/11/27/us-urges-ukraine-to-draft-18-year-olds-to-bolster-russia-fight/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sjm-ne-War_214548902.jpg?w=1024&h=653","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 01:01:48","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":268339606,"title":"New Ohio Law Restricts Transgender Students Access To School Restrooms Bathroom Bill Sparks Outcry","text":"Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act” on Wednesday, prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms, locker rooms, or overnight accommodations aligning with their gender identity. Dubbed the \"bathroom bill,\" the law applies to public and private schools and colleges, taking effect in 90 days.The legislation mandates that facilities be designated exclusively for males and females based on biological sex assigned at birth. While it lacks enforcement mechanisms, it exempts school staff, emergencies, and caregivers assisting young children or those with disabilities.Supporters defend 'privacy and safety'The bill’s sponsor, Republican State Senator Jerry Cirino, defended it as essential for privacy and safety, stating: “It revolves around safety, security, and, I think, common sense. It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable.” Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue, praised the law, saying, “Common sense is on a winning streak in America today. No student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex.”Critics condemn 'Anti-trans bathroom bill'Opposition to the law has been swift and strong. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio labeled it an “anti-trans bathroom bill,” arguing it compromises transgender students' safety. Jocelyn Rosnick, the ACLU's policy director, called it a “cruel invasion of students’ rights to privacy.” Equality Ohio's executive director, Dwayne Steward, criticized the measure, warning it puts vulnerable youth at greater risk. Both groups pledged to continue advocating for transgender students' rights.Broader context of transgender rights debateOhio joins 11 other states that have enacted similar bathroom restrictions, with 26 states restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. Earlier this year, Ohio passed laws limiting gender-affirming care and barring transgender athletes in women’s sports.The national debate over transgender rights intensified during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, which included promises to restrict transgender participation in women’s sports and limit gender-affirming healthcare. With Trump’s election win, Republican lawmakers plan to push similar measures in state legislatures convening in early 2025.While proponents argue these laws protect privacy and safety, critics say they unfairly target marginalized communities. Legal challenges loom, as the US supreme court prepares to review Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care, a decision that could affect similar laws nationwide.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-ohio-law-restricts-transgender-students-access-to-school-restrooms-bathroom-bill-sparks-outcry/articleshow/115749879.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-115749908/115749908.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 01:00:45","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.338},{"id":268341448,"title":"WSJ's Peggy Noonan shares recent encounter with Trump after avoiding him for 8 years: 'He was hilarious'","text":"Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan spoke about her recent encounter with President-elect Donald Trump after purposefully avoiding him for eight years, revealing the concern she had that his \"charming\" personality would cloud her judgment. \"I never met Trump until two or three weeks ago,\" Noonan said in a recent conversation with The Free Press founder Bari Weiss released Tuesday. \"In 2015 and 2016, when he was deciding to or had decided to run for president- was running, his office and his aides did what they would do with anybody else in journalism, which was reach out and say, ‘We want to know you. We want to meet you. Come on in, meet the boss, have lunch.’ And I always said, 'No, I don't want to.'\" \"And the reason was, I had a feeling that up close he would be charming and funny, and that there would be something endearing, and that it would mess with my swing as an observer,\" she explained. \"I didn't want to see him up close.

'Don't go.' But then I corrected myself,\" Noonan said. \"I've been writing about him for eight years. I have occasionally clubbed him like a seal. He has occasionally clubbed me.

And he said, 'You've never met Trump?!?' And he went, ‘Whoa,’ like, 'Oh, we're gonna have a drama here.' And suddenly I thought, ‘Oh, gosh, maybe it will be a drama.’ You know how Trump acts, like, when he's gonna be horrible- I mean, up close,\" she continued. \"So anyway, at a certain point, the doors fly open and the entourage comes in, and there's Trump, who in person in that blue suit and the tie is huge, and the hair is huge, everything is huge. And he, like, blows by others, and he just says to me, ‘You are wonderful. You are the most remarkable woman.’\" \"And then he sat down with us… He went on and off the record. But off the record, he was hilarious, rude, inappropriate, said things about foreign leaders that should not be said to a bunch of journalists. And I just sat back and thought by the end, 'Honey, your intuition was right. If you'd met him in 2015, you would have loved him and not seen him,'\" Noonan added.

They prey on fear. They prey on anxiety. They prey on all of the elements that contribute to uncertainty in society, and they entrepreneur fantasy outcomes and conspiracy outcomes.\n\n“I personally find it deeply repulsive.”\n\nMr Williams went on to express his “dismay” that “this can be a source of public entertainment when it’s really treating the public as plunder for entrepreneurs that are really quite malevolent.”\n\nHarsh words, there.\n\nMr Williams spoke to ABC radio in Melbourne this morning. Host Raf Epstein asked him to speak further about his views on Mr Rogan.\n\n“I’m aware of his ubiquitous presence in many of the elements of podcast land. I wasn’t aware, until yesterday, that he had three billion followers; I might have to admit to having some scepticism as to that number,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“But he’s obviously been a very influential character in America.”\n\nIt’s unclear where Mr Williams got that “three billion” figure, or whether he was perhaps exaggerating for rhetorical effect.\n\nMr Rogan has about 14.5 million subscribers on Spotify, and his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience averages about 190 million downloads per month. He has a further 17 million or so subscribers on YouTube. Hardly in the billions, but also, pretty much unrivalled.\n\nMr Epstein pointed out that about 50 million people had watched Donald Trump’s pre-election interview with Mr Rogan, recorded and posted in late October. The closest parallel for Kamala Harris, Mr Trump’s opponent, was her interview with the Call Her Daddy podcast.\n\n“Are you worried that podcasts that don’t provide the scrutiny that you might get on the ABC, that they are the future, and that we really are going out of fashion?” he asked.\n\n“Well, I would hope that the best the best antidote to misinformation and, more alarmingly, disinformation-” Mr Williams began.\n\n“And we should clarify both those terms. Misinformation relates to false information that is spread often due to ignorance or mistake or in good faith, which actually is not done with an intention to deceive people. But disinformation is quite the opposite. It’s the deliberate spreading of false information.\n\n“I think the best antidote is an abundance of truthful information, and validated information, and verified information.”\n\nThe ABC boss’s beef with Mr Rogan appears to be rooted in his remarks to listeners during the Covid pandemic, and indeed in its aftermath, when he expressed scepticism about vaccines for the virus.\n\nThe Covid vaccines were widely available to Americans, for free, from April of 2021 onwards. About half of the country’s 1.2 million deaths from the virus happened after that, and the unvaccinated were overwhelmingly more likely to die.\n\n“I mean, Joe Rogan did an enormous, in my view, an enormous amount of damage back in 2020 and 2021, when he was particularly virulent in many of his remarks about vaccinations,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“Vaccinations for the young, in particular. And he was taken on by Anthony Fauci, very severely, in a very famous public stoush.”\n\nDr Fauci, a long-serving director of America’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the government’s top advisers during the pandemic, became an object of scorn on the political right, and particularly among those who opposed health restrictions.\n\n“I don’t think people have unlimited license to say what they want, simply because they believe something to be so,” argued Mr Williams.\n\n“We must perform to higher standards. We must perform to standards that have regard to facts. We have to perform the standards that actually have scientific validity.\n\n“I think Joe Rogan at times, not uniformly, but at times, breaks those rules.”\n\nMr Williams went on to lament the hostile response he’d received from Mr Rogan’s fans after his remarks at the Press Club.\n\n“What fascinates me is you say something negative about Joe Rogan – and I have been swarmed with the most unbelievably vicious responses. I got one this morning that said that I should stay in my lane and watch out, and you read it and you think, ‘What are you saying to me?’” he said.\n\n“Where is this super sensitivity deriving from? You make a comment in response to a legitimate question from a journalist. You answer it concisely and give an honest answer in terms of what your own perception of Mr Rogan is. And suddenly I get this huge pile-on from people in the most aggressive way, saying that I have a warped out look on the world, that I am an embarrassment to our nation, that I am in some way unhinged, that that I am a supreme example of of of arrogance and disconnection with Australian society.\n\n“I have to say to you, Raf, I just don’t get it.”\n\n“Do you think they’ve got glass jaws?” asked Mr Epstein.\n\n“Their whole body is made of glass. How can people react in such a, frankly, demonic fashion? I really stand back in disbelief,” said Mr Williams.\n\nAsked whether podcasts were “a threat” to the ABC, he answered in the affirmative.\n\n“Of course they’re a threat to the ABC. I think they’re a threat to all views that are contrary into their own,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“If they represent the newfound mainstream, our society is has deep troubles, and the only response that is available is to back education and knowledge.\n\n“Knowledge is the is the antidote to this kind of hysterical rubbish.”","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/radio/huge-pileon-abc-boss-kim-williams-shocked-by-response-to-his-remarks-about-joe-rogan/news-story/55c2fbeceffa7beef432b5b856c35d18","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3119d5388b712a8cf95f0bc6f13b1b6c","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:58:54","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":268340624,"title":"Amid tariff threats, Mexico looks to develop: the mañanera recap","text":"Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat was the dominant issue at President Claudia Sheinbaum’s Wednesday morning press conference.\n\nEconomy Minister Marcelo Ebrard spoke about the potential impact of a 25% tariff on Mexico’s exports to the United States (read Mexico News Daily’s report here) and Sheinbaum fielded several questions on the incoming U.S. president’s plan to tax goods sent north from Mexico.\n\nA group of CEOs and business group leaders also attended the president’s mañanera to witness the signing of a document to formally create the government’s Advisory Council for Regional Economic Development and Relocation.\n\nNew council is a public-private initiative \n\nSheinbaum said that the government’s Advisory Council for Regional Economic Development and Relocation is a collaboration with the Business Coordinating Council and “other private sector chambers.”\n\nShe said that the council’s work will focus on the development of the government’s “well-being hubs” – 10 industrial corridors spanning all 32 federal entities of Mexico where 100 industrial parks are slated to be built.\n\nSheinbaum reminded reporters that she first presented the initiative during the campaign period leading up to the presidential election in June and noted that the plan is to build industrial corridors that focus on the “productive vocations” of the regions in which they are located.\n\nFor example, the priority sectors of a corridor running mainly along the Gulf of Mexico coast will be petrochemicals, fossil fuels, lumber, fruit production and fishing.\n\nSheinbaum said that the work of the new advisory council, in conjunction with government ministries, will be to support and promote the various industrial corridor projects “that form part of what we call Plan Mexico.”\n\n“It’s a development plan for the country that represents well-being for Mexicans and sustainability – protection of the environment, in other words,” she said.\n\nIn a post to LinkedIn, the CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico (AmCham), Pedro Casas Alatriste, announced that AmCham had been invited to join the new advisory council.\n\n“Our mission is ambitious and clear,” he wrote before citing the following objectives.\n\nAttract new investment projects to Mexico.\nFoster the growth of local suppliers.\nDrive sustainability initiatives.\nBoost international academic exchanges.\nStrengthen Mexico’s development bank to increase small and medium enterprises’ participation in global trade. \n\n“This council represents an unprecedented opportunity for the public and private sectors to unite for the country’s progress.

This is our moonshot,” he added.\n\nMexican officials to speak with Trump’s team soon, Sheinbaum hopes\n\nSheinbaum told reporters that Foreign Affairs Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente is “already in contact” with members of Trump’s team and suggested that Mexican officials could speak with them in the coming days to discuss the president-elect’s tariff threat and other issues.\n\nShe noted that Thanksgiving is coming up, but said that “the idea” is to “communicate” with Trump’s team “in these days.”\n\nBeyond Trump’s pledge to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican exports on the first day of his second term as U.S. president, Sheinbaum said that the two parties would discuss migration, violence and the illegal trafficking of weapons to Mexico.\n\nIn response to a subsequent question, the president walked back her suggestion that a meeting with Trump’s team would happen soon.\n\nThe “best time” for the meeting “will be found,” she said, adding that it will “ideally” take place before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nEconomy Ministry is preparing reciprocal tariffs to impose ‘if necessary’ \n\nAt her Tuesday morning press conference, Sheinbaum said that U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports would be met by reciprocal tariffs on U.S. exports to Mexico.\n\nOn Wednesday, she declined to specify whether Mexican tariffs would apply across the board or target specific U.S. industries or products, only saying that the Economy Ministry was preparing duties to impose “if necessary.”\n\nSheinbaum once again expressed confidence that Mexico and the United States will reach an agreement to avert the imposition of a 25% blanket tariff on Mexican exports.\n\nIn 2018, Mexico imposed tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and apples in response to U.S. tariffs on Mexican steel and aluminum.\n\nA year later, Mexico managed to avoid blanket tariffs threatened by Trump by agreeing to ramp up enforcement against migrants traveling though Mexico to the country’s northern border.\n\nMexico has ‘very good relations’ with China \n\nAsked about the government’s plan to reduce Mexico’s reliance on imports from China, Sheinbaum stressed that Mexico has “very good relations’ with the east Asian nation and asserted that the government’s objective is simply to “recover” domestic manufacturing capacity that was “lost” over the years.\n\nIt’s not a matter of taking a position against China but rather adopting “a policy of national development,” she said.\n\n“It has nothing to do with one nationality or another,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nMexico favors trade with countries with which it has free trade agreements, but that doesn’t mean goods can’t be imported from other nations, she said.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"On Wednesday, President Sheinbaum introduced the press corps to a new advisory council meant to help her develop Mexico's industry sustainably.\n\n\nThe post Amid tariff threats, Mexico looks to develop: the mañanera recap appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/mexico-sheinbaum-development/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1007800_Conferencia-Sheinbaum-Integrantes-CADERR-15_web-Daniel-Augusto-Cuartoscuro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:57:45","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":0.097},{"id":268337758,"title":"Locals Put Politics Aside At Thanksgiving 58176192","text":"Want to break bread without breaking up the family this Thanksgiving? Try leaving politics at the door.\n\nThis month’s presidential election was particularly polarizing and the internet is rife with stories of people planning to skip holiday gatherings or being uninvited to get-togethers due to who voted for who. For example, a CBS News/YouGov poll found 1 in 10 people have changed their plans to avoid gathering with people who voted for a different presidential candidate than they did. But experts say friends and family members of all political ideologies can enjoy one another’s company by focusing on other topics and being grateful for the positives in their lives.\n\nThat’s the sentiment shared by folks across Franklin County and the North Quabbin region who were interviewed by the Greenfield Recorder ahead of Turkey Day.\n\nOrange resident Ann Reed said she is looking forward to again having Thanksgiving in Grafton, where her daughter lives and is hosting a gathering of friends and family. Passionate about her small-government views, Reed said her daughter is a theater professional and has many liberal friends in the arts world.\n\n“There have always been people who find it very intellectual to argue politics at the dinner table. I have always found it to be uncouth and ungrateful and a Heimlich maneuver waiting to happen,” she said with a laugh. “We’ve just enjoyed the holiday.” \n\nReed mentioned seeing some younger women online talking about removing their fathers from their lives for voting for President-elect Donald Trump. She said this hurt her on a personal level because her father died in 1973.\n\n“I would give anything to have Thanksgiving with my own father,” she said fighting back tears. “He did not live to walk me down the aisle, meet my children or have me make Thanksgiving dinner for him.” \n\nHer father, Arnold E. Fallon, was a U.S. Marine veteran and pharmacist who she said made Thanksgiving a special occasion for many years.\n\nReed said those in her family’s social circle have always had more to talk about than politics and they simply pass the time with lively conversation and witty exchanges. In fact, she recalled a time when there was a Democrat, a Republican, a Libertarian and an Independent in her four-member immediate family “and it was never a problem.” \n\nAthol resident Susannah Whipps said she hosts Thanksgiving for about a dozen family members in the house once owned by her parents, who have died.\n\n“I feel the responsibility of having a homebase still for family members. We’ve got family members along a wide spectrum of political ideologies and have different feelings about the election,” she said, adding that, to avoid having awkward breaks in conversation, she has asked her guests to brainstorm and share funny or moving stories about her parents and grandparents. “You can put the battles aside.” \n\nWhipps knows a thing or two about seeing all sides of a political debate, as she is the only unenrolled member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Originally a Republican, she left the party in 2017 because nearly two-thirds of her constituents are unaffiliated with a major political party and she wanted to put people over politics.\n\nA classically trained chef with a degree from Johnson & Wales University, she said the only heated debate allowed at her Thanksgiving table is whether her guests prefer canned cranberry sauce over her homemade chutney. Whipps will be sworn in for her sixth term in January.\n\nDavid Lewis, chair of the Greenfield Republican Town Committee, said he and a friend plan to attend the Thanksgiving meal at Living Waters Assembly of God at 450 Davis St. in Greenfield. He said the meal is offered to the entire community and he is certain there are guests every year with differing opinions, and politics is never dredged up.\n\n“I think, just don’t even talk about it. It’s over. It’s done with, the election. And we all have to move on to the next thing,” he said.\n\nLewis mentioned he has lived at The Weldon apartments in Greenfield for 18 years, and he and his neighbors with different political affiliations meet for a coffee hour every Wednesday. He said politics come up commonly but there is never any disdain or resentment.\n\n“We just agree to disagree,” Lewis said. “We don’t throw things or get violent.” \n\nGreenfield resident Sandra Boston said her Thanksgiving guests will consist of people who share her progressive values, but she would still prefer politics take a rest.\n\n“First of all, be much more interested in asking what’s going on in their life rather than who they voted for,” she said.\n\nBoston advised that people should tread lightly if they broach the subject of politics and always remember that young children “will pick up on the energy” if the environment becomes inhospitable. She mentioned her oldest son is a Trump supporter living in Virginia and though they seldom see eye-to-eye, their email exchanges remain kind and affectionate.\n\n“We always end it with, ‘I love you,’” she said.\n\nBoston mentioned she belongs to a local chapter of Braver Angels, a citizens’ organization aimed at depolarizing American political culture by fostering conversation between liberals and conservatives. The Greenfield group has met at the Greenfield Public Library once a month since 2017. \n\n“It’s the only place in my daily life where I sit down with someone of the other political persuasion for an hour and a half and listen. The point of it is to ask questions in order to understand. You know, ‘Tell me more about why you see it that way,’” she said. “We’re not here to change anybody’s minds — we’re here to understand.” \n\nBoston mentioned she is a teacher of communication skills, offering eight-week classes in conscious communication.\n\n“Don’t try to change anybody’s mind. The point of being family and seeking unity is being able to hold the difference. Have respect for the person even if we don’t have respect for the opinion,” she said. “People don’t want to keep talking to you if you try to tell them they’re wrong.” \n\nThe Poynter Institute, a global nonprofit, published an article about how to avoid political arguments at Thanksgiving.

They prey on fear. They prey on anxiety. They prey on all of the elements that contribute to uncertainty in society, and they entrepreneur fantasy outcomes and conspiracy outcomes.\n\n“I personally find it deeply repulsive.”\n\nMr Williams went on to express his “dismay” that “this can be a source of public entertainment when it’s really treating the public as plunder for entrepreneurs that are really quite malevolent.”\n\nHarsh words, there.\n\nMr Williams spoke to ABC radio in Melbourne this morning. Host Raf Epstein asked him to speak further about his views on Mr Rogan.\n\n“I’m aware of his ubiquitous presence in many of the elements of podcast land. I wasn’t aware, until yesterday, that he had three billion followers; I might have to admit to having some scepticism as to that number,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“But he’s obviously been a very influential character in America.”\n\nIt’s unclear where Mr Williams got that “three billion” figure, or whether he was perhaps exaggerating for rhetorical effect.\n\nMr Rogan has about 14.5 million subscribers on Spotify, and his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience averages about 190 million downloads per month. He has a further 17 million or so subscribers on YouTube. Hardly in the billions, but also, pretty much unrivalled.\n\nMr Epstein pointed out that about 50 million people had watched Donald Trump’s pre-election interview with Mr Rogan, recorded and posted in late October. The closest parallel for Kamala Harris, Mr Trump’s opponent, was her interview with the Call Her Daddy podcast.\n\n“Are you worried that podcasts that don’t provide the scrutiny that you might get on the ABC, that they are the future, and that we really are going out of fashion?” he asked.\n\n“Well, I would hope that the best the best antidote to misinformation and, more alarmingly, disinformation-” Mr Williams began.\n\n“And we should clarify both those terms. Misinformation relates to false information that is spread often due to ignorance or mistake or in good faith, which actually is not done with an intention to deceive people. But disinformation is quite the opposite. It’s the deliberate spreading of false information.\n\n“I think the best antidote is an abundance of truthful information, and validated information, and verified information.”\n\nThe ABC boss’s beef with Mr Rogan appears to be rooted in his remarks to listeners during the Covid pandemic, and indeed in its aftermath, when he expressed scepticism about vaccines for the virus.\n\nThe Covid vaccines were widely available to Americans, for free, from April of 2021 onwards. About half of the country’s 1.2 million deaths from the virus happened after that, and the unvaccinated were overwhelmingly more likely to die.\n\n“I mean, Joe Rogan did an enormous, in my view, an enormous amount of damage back in 2020 and 2021, when he was particularly virulent in many of his remarks about vaccinations,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“Vaccinations for the young, in particular. And he was taken on by Anthony Fauci, very severely, in a very famous public stoush.”\n\nDr Fauci, a long-serving director of America’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the government’s top advisers during the pandemic, became an object of scorn on the political right, and particularly among those who opposed health restrictions.\n\n“I don’t think people have unlimited license to say what they want, simply because they believe something to be so,” argued Mr Williams.\n\n“We must perform to higher standards. We must perform to standards that have regard to facts. We have to perform the standards that actually have scientific validity.\n\n“I think Joe Rogan at times, not uniformly, but at times, breaks those rules.”\n\nMr Williams went on to lament the hostile response he’d received from Mr Rogan’s fans after his remarks at the Press Club.\n\n“What fascinates me is you say something negative about Joe Rogan – and I have been swarmed with the most unbelievably vicious responses. I got one this morning that said that I should stay in my lane and watch out, and you read it and you think, ‘What are you saying to me?’” he said.\n\n“Where is this super sensitivity deriving from? You make a comment in response to a legitimate question from a journalist. You answer it concisely and give an honest answer in terms of what your own perception of Mr Rogan is. And suddenly I get this huge pile-on from people in the most aggressive way, saying that I have a warped out look on the world, that I am an embarrassment to our nation, that I am in some way unhinged, that that I am a supreme example of of of arrogance and disconnection with Australian society.\n\n“I have to say to you, Raf, I just don’t get it.”\n\n“Do you think they’ve got glass jaws?” asked Mr Epstein.\n\n“Their whole body is made of glass. How can people react in such a, frankly, demonic fashion? I really stand back in disbelief,” said Mr Williams.\n\nAsked whether podcasts were “a threat” to the ABC, he answered in the affirmative.\n\n“Of course they’re a threat to the ABC. I think they’re a threat to all views that are contrary into their own,” said Mr Williams.\n\n“If they represent the newfound mainstream, our society is has deep troubles, and the only response that is available is to back education and knowledge.\n\n“Knowledge is the is the antidote to this kind of hysterical rubbish.”","summary":"ABC chairman Kim Williams has been grilled in more detail about his criticism of megastar podcaster Joe Rogan.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/radio/huge-pileon-abc-boss-kim-williams-shocked-by-response-to-his-remarks-about-joe-rogan/news-story/55c2fbeceffa7beef432b5b856c35d18?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3119d5388b712a8cf95f0bc6f13b1b6c","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:50:42","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":268336298,"title":"Eby Says Bcs Needs Come First As Canadas Leaders Chart Response To Trump Tariffs 7674808","text":"B.C.

The US West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 4 cents to $68.82.

Crude stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 22, the EIA added, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 605,000-barrel draw. \n\nMarket sources, citing the American Petroleum Institute, had said on Tuesday that oil inventories fell by 5.94 million barrels and fuel inventories rose last week. \n\n“It is surprising to see gasoline inventories building so much and implied demand not really budging week-on-week, given expected record travel this Thanksgiving,” said Kpler analyst Matt Smith. On Tuesday, both benchmarks had settled lower after Israel agreed to a ceasefire deal with Lebanon’s Hezbollah, effective Wednesday after both sides accepted the agreement brokered by the US and France. \n\nA ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah held on Wednesday after the two sides struck the deal, a rare feat of diplomacy in the Middle East, wracked by two wars and several proxy conflicts for over a year. “The real question will be for how long it (the ceasefire) will truly be honoured,” said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial. \n\nSupporting prices, sources from the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia have said the producer group is discussing a further delay to the oil output increase set for January. \n\nThe group, which produces about half the world’s oil, had aimed to gradually ease production cuts through 2024 and 2025, but weaker global demand and rising output outside OPEC+ have cast doubt on that plan. The decision will be made at the Dec. 1 meeting. \n\nHeads of commodities research at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said oil prices are undervalued, citing a market deficit and risk to Iranian supply from possible sanctions under US President-elect Donald Trump. “With the President-Elect Trump’s sanctions soon to come, many think Iran will be targeted, which could slow their exports substantially,” BOK’s Kissler said. Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on all products coming into the US from Mexico and Canada. Crude oil would not be exempt from the trade penalties, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Oil industry analysts and traders warned the move would likely raise oil prices for US refiners, squeezing margins and driving up the cost of fuel. \n\n“We expect WTI to trade within the range of $65-$70 a barrel, factoring in weather conditions during the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, a potential increase in shale oil and gas production under the incoming Donald Trump administration in the US and demand trends in China,” said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, part of Nissan Securities","summary":"NEW YORK: Oil prices held steady on Wednesday as a large, surprise build in US gasoline stocks offset easing supply concerns from a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.  \n\n\n\nBrent crude futures rose 2 cents to $72.83 a barrel by 11:43 a.m. ET (1643 GMT).

He's determined and, in the death threats, cautious but defiant. In a recent Fox News interview, he noted that he and other incoming Trump administration officials have been receiving death threats.\n\nMr. Homan points out that, among other things, the negative press is making matters worse.\n\n\"I have not taken this serious up to this point,\" Homan told Fox News anchor Gillian Turner on \"The Story\" on Wednesday, referring to previous death threats made against him and his family. \"Now that I know what's happened in the last 24 hours. I will take it a little more serious. But look, I've been dealing with this. When I was the ICE director in the first administration, I had numerous death threats. I had a security detail with me all the time. Even after I retired, death threats continued and even after I retired as the ICE director. I had U.S. marshals protection for a long time to protect me and my family.\"Homan explained that what \"doesn't help\" the situation is the \"negative press\" around Trump. \n\nThe legacy media in particular has been adamantly anti-Trump and against any of Trump's appointees, and some of the rhetoric can't be helping; it's important to remember that, in the months before the election, President Trump was the target of not one but two assassination attempts, and was actually shot in one of them.\n\nHoman lays the blame on the \"hate media.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the Cabinet, but, you know, I've read numerous hit pieces. I mean, you know, I'm a racist and, you know, I'm the father of family separation, all this other stuff. So the hate media doesn't help at all because there are some nuts out there. They'll take advantage. So that doesn't help.\"\n\nThe US Code on this issue is clear; 18 U.S. Code § 1751 - Presidential and Presidential staff assassination, kidnapping, and assault; penalties states in part:\n\n(a) Whoever kills (1) any individual who is the President of the United States, the President-elect, the Vice President, or, if there is no Vice President, the officer next in the order of succession to the Office of the President of the United States, the Vice President-elect, or any person who is acting as President under the Constitution and laws of the United States, or (2) any person appointed under section 105(a)(2)(A) of title 3 employed in the Executive Office of the President or appointed under section 106(a)(1)(A) of title 3 employed in the Office of the Vice President, shall be punished as provided by sections 1111 and 1112 of this title.(b) Whoever kidnaps any individual designated in subsection (a) of this section shall be punished (1) by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, or (2) by death or imprisonment for any term of years or for life, if death results to such individual.(c) Whoever attempts to kill or kidnap any individual designated in subsection (a) of this section shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.\n\n\"Any term of years\" is a little vague, but \"..or for life, if death results\" is pretty clear.\n\nSee Related: Trump's One-Word Answer on Using Military for Mass Deportations: 'TRUE!!!'\n\nSo Much for a Peaceful Transition... Biden Opens Door for Illegal Immigration Even Wider\n\nGranted, a lot of these threats are almost certainly coming from keyboard warriors who aren't about to attempt any real action. But if there are ten thousand such out there, that number may contain one who might actually attempt something, and while the president and his cabinet and staff picks' security details have to get everything right every time, a would-be assassin only has to succeed once. We very nearly saw the effects of that last summer in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Tom Homan is up to the task. While he states he is being cautious, with himself and his family, he is also determined to do this difficult job. In the Fox interview, Homan also stated that he won't be intimidated, telling Gillian Turner \"I'm not going to shut up, and I'm not going to go away.\"\n\nThe right man for the job. This seems appropriate.","url":"https://redstate.com/wardclark/2024/11/27/tom-homan-taking-death-threats-a-little-more-serious-n2182563","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/317/641801d6-45eb-459b-b200-40e1a51b9f16.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:44:51","author":"Ward Clark","authors":["Ward Clark"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":268339320,"title":"Former Rear Adm. breaks down Trump's Russia, Ukraine special envoy pick","text":"Former Rear Adm. breaks down Trump's Russia, Ukraine special envoy pick\n President-elect Donald Trump selected retired three-star army Lt.

Trump’s victory raises significant concerns about the health, resilience, and underlying integrity of American democracy.\n\nFor many, his return to power represents a failure of democratic institutions to uphold the values and safeguards that are meant to protect the public good.\n\nTrump’s re-election symbolises not only a functioning system but a democracy in distress, a system still operational, yet fundamentally “busted.”\n\nAmerican democracy is built on the concept of shared principles: respect for the rule of law, an informed electorate, and elected officials accountable to the people.\n\nYet Trump’s re-election is a signal that populism and personality-driven politics are overtaking these norms. Trump’s brand of populism thrives on deepening divisions rather than bridging them, turning democracy into a contest of “us versus them.”\n\nThis approach undermines the collaborative spirit that should characterize democratic governance, making public discourse more polarized and less about policy or constructive debate.\n\nInstead, Trump’s appeal hinges on identity and resentment, which deepens divides within American society and transforms politics into a zero-sum game. One of the pillars of a strong democracy is the public’s trust in its institutions.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump frequently criticised and attacked key democratic institutions: the judiciary, intelligence agencies, and the electoral system.\n\nBy casting doubt on these institutions, he sowed distrust and turned segments of the population against the very structures designed to uphold democratic order.\n\nA democratic system relies on leaders, who respect the checks and balances of power, but Trump’s re-election suggests that the American people may be willing to overlook breaches of accountability for the sake of perceived strength and conviction.\n\nTrump’s dismissive attitude toward oversight weakens democratic accountability and sets a precedent that future leaders could exploit, potentially leading to a concentration of power that threatens the foundation of democracy itself.\n\nDemocracy depends on an informed electorate, and public discourse relies on a foundation of shared facts and truth. However, Trump’s re-election signifies the alarming power of disinformation in American politics.\n\nHis rhetoric, which often includes false claims, conspiracy theories, and attacks on credible sources, weakens the role of truth in public life.\n\nThe widespread dissemination of misinformation has created alternate realities, where facts are subjective and beliefs are reinforced by echo chambers.\n\nThis deterioration of a shared reality hampers effective democratic engagement and discourages constructive dialogue.\n\nTrump’s victory, therefore, highlights the troubling impact of disinformation on American democracy, where leaders can capitalize on confusion and manipulate public perception to serve political ends.\n\nAmerican democracy has long held ideals of civil discourse and respect for political decency, even among opponents. Trump’s style of governance, however, prioritises insults, personal attacks, and inflammatory language.\n\nThis approach has eroded the norms of political decency and encouraged a confrontational and aggressive style of politics that undermines respectful dialogue.\n\nBy fostering an atmosphere of hostility and division, Trump’s return to office legitimises incivility and incites further polarization.\n\nThis breakdown in civil discourse poses a significant threat to democracy, as the ability to debate issues and find common ground diminishes in an environment of mutual contempt. One of the dangers of Trump’s reelection is that it cements a shift away from policy-centered elections to personality-driven politics.\n\nTrump’s campaign strategy relies less on detailed policy proposals and more on his brand, charisma, and persona. This shift is detrimental to democracy because it diverts attention from meaningful policy discussions that address pressing issues like healthcare, education, and climate change.\n\nWhen elections become about personalities rather than policies, voters are deprived of the information necessary to make informed choices. This style of politics turns democratic elections into popularity contests, where spectacle overshadows substance.\n\nThe result is a weakened democracy, where leaders are chosen for their appeal rather than their ability to govern effectively. Trump’s approach to leadership has shown a willingness to sidestep democratic norms, and his re-election risks normalising this behaviour.\n\nFrom disregarding the media as “the enemy of the people” to seeking loyalty from officials over independent judgment, Trump’s first term was marked by actions that many saw as authoritarian.\n\nA second term could further erode the checks and balances that are fundamental to American democracy, setting a precedent for future leaders to act with impunity.\n\nThis shift toward authoritarian tendencies threatens to transform American governance from a system of accountability to one of concentrated power, reducing the role of Congress, the judiciary, and other critical institutions.\n\nTrump’s re-election has significant implications for America’s role in the world, particularly its influence as a democratic leader.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump questioned the value of alliances like NATO, withdrew from international agreements, and expressed a preference for unilateral action.\n\nHis approach signalled a retreat from the values of multilateralism and cooperation, isolating America from traditional allies.\n\nAmerica’s global leadership has long been a stabilising force, promoting democracy and human rights worldwide. Trump’s return could further weaken these relationships, emboldening authoritarian regimes and eroding America’s credibility as a champion of democratic values.\n\nThis shift not only threatens international stability but also risks diminishing the global respect that American democracy has historically commanded.\n\nThe economic policies Trump promotes, which prioritise tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation, contribute to growing inequality within American society.\n\nEconomic inequality is a fundamental issue that fuels political discontent and resentment, particularly among working- and middle-class Americans who feel left behind.\n\nA democracy that does not address economic disparities risks losing legitimacy, as citizens perceive the system as serving the elite rather than the common good.\n\nTrump’s policies, which exacerbate these divides, signal a democracy out of touch with the needs of everyday people and undermine the foundational principle of equality in representation and opportunity. One of the most concerning outcomes of Trump’s re-election is its impact on civic engagement.\n\nHis rhetoric around voter fraud and “stolen” elections discourages faith in the democratic process and fosters cynicism. When citizens feel that their votes may not count or that the system is rigged, they may disengage from participating altogether.\n\nDemocracy relies on an active and engaged citizenry, but Trump’s influence risks driving people away from the democratic process.\n\nHis re-election is a setback for civic engagement, as disillusionment grows among those who see the system as failing to reflect their voices and interests.\n\nTrump’s re-election signifies that while American democracy is still operational, it is also faltering. The foundations of the system, trust in institutions, respect for truth, and commitment to accountability, are being strained by a style of politics that prioritises personality over policy, division over unity, and power over accountability.\n\nHis return to office is a sobering reminder that democracy is not immune to decay; it requires continuous reinforcement and vigilance.\n\nThe United States now stands at a crossroads. Trump’s victory reveals the vulnerabilities within the democratic system and calls for a reassessment of its core values and structures.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a recommitment to democratic principles, an investment in civic education, and a renewal of efforts to build a more just, equitable, and resilient society.\n\nDemocracy may be running, but if the issues highlighted by Trump’s reelection are not addressed, the path forward will be fraught with instability and division.\n\nFor American democracy to endure, it must confront and correct these critical failings, lest it continue to operate in a weakened, “busted” state.","summary":"ShareThe re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States marks a troubling moment in the evolution of American democracy.

Biden has an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion in PDA already authorized by Congress that he is expected to use before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\r\n\r\nThe United States has not exported landmines in decades, and their use is controversial because of the potential harm to civilians. Although more than 160 countries have signed a treaty banning their use, Kyiv has been asking for them since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022 and Russian forces have used them on the front lines.\r\n\r\nRussian forces currently are making gains in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers said this week.\r\n\r\nThe United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians.\r\n\r\nTrump on Wednesday tapped Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who presented him with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, to serve as special envoy for the conflict.

I pushed back, noting that the depths of his dishonesty have been well-documented by fact-based news organizations. Soon-Shiong didn’t apparently appreciate that.

Ruh roh!\n\n\"I'm not a media hater,\" Jen O'Malley Dillon starts off this hilarious whine, nor should she be. No presidential candidate in American history ever had the media as fully incorporated into the campaign, running interference for Kamala Harris while painting Donald Trump as The Prince of Darkness at every turn. That included making excuses for her refusal to engage reporters, and even when Harris did, getting the easiest possible treatment. CBS' 60 Minutes even edited her responses to make her sound more coherent.\n\nNevertheless, Dillon has decided that the media torpedoed her client by falsely portraying her as afraid of interviews. Er ... sure, Jen. Duane covered this earlier, but this is just too irresistible:\n\nKamala Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon claims that the campaign was up against insurmountable odds, as if they didn't have all of the media on their side.\"Being up against a narrative that we weren’t doing anything or we were afraid to have interviews is completely… pic.twitter.com/NiqamfMdt7— Catch Up (@CatchUpFeed) November 27, 2024\n\n\"Being up against a narrative that we weren’t doing anything or we were afraid to have interviews is completely bullsh*t, and also, like, took hold a little bit. And we just gave us another thing we had to fight back for that Trump never had to worry about.\"\n\nTrump never had to worry about it because Trump never hesitated to do interviews. He also held numerous press conferences, not press avails, where he took questions extemporaneously. Trump did podcasts, establishment media interviews, and call-ins constantly throughout the campaign. Trump has never been accused of being afraid of a microphone, and for good reason.\n\nDillon claims that Harris did plenty of interviews, which is nonsense, and then complained about the questions she got as \"process-y.\" That is an apparent reference to repeated attempts to get Harris to explain her 180-degree shifts on policies across the board from the progressive agenda to Bidenism. That's not \"process\" -- candidates are supposed to be able to answer questions on policies. It wasn't just Bret Baier who tried to get answers on Harris' policies; Dana Bash asked twice for explanations on Harris' shifts and got two non-responses, and ABC News kicked off the one debate by attempting to pin her down too, to no avail.\n\nHarris never did answer those questions except to chant her mantras, \"My values have not changed,\" and of course, \"I was raised in a middle-class household.\" She was objectively terrible at it, and has been for years before the election. There's a reason why Joe Biden pushed Harris off the stage and out of reach of the media after her June 2021 interview with NBC's Lester Holt, the \"I've never been to Europe either, ha-ha\" debacle. \n\nNo one knows this better than Dillon, either. Touré told MSNBC's Joy Reid on Monday that Dillon began attempting to push Harris off the ticket in 2023 to get a more competent running mate for Joe Biden:\n\nThis is going to piss a lot of people off that helped on the campaign—and it should!“When I spoke to elite Democratic people they kept bringing up the name Jen O’Malley Dillon (Kamala Harris’s campaign chair)… who in 2023 was leaking to the media that Kamala should be replaced… pic.twitter.com/fjQIVFSY6l— Christopher Webb (@cwebbonline) November 26, 2024\n\nAfter off the record conversations with five people with direct knowledge of the insides of the Harris campaign, there is a consensus on what really went wrong and the person who may deserve the most blame. The who is Jen O’Malley Dillon, the 48 year-old campaign chair of the Harris campaign. I was told, “She was essentially running the campaign.” The what-went-wrong of it all is obviously multi-faceted but one issue is that Harris was forced to run for the Presidency with a team that was constructed around someone else, Joe Biden, a team that included someone who was such a Biden loyalist that she had leaked negative stories about Harris in an attempt to hurt her political future. That person is Dillon.\n\nRemember all the chatter coming from inside the Democrat tent about switching out running mates? I certainly do, and I certainly remember why. As far back as February 2023, the New York Times ran through the nightmare scenario of a late Biden withdrawal with Harris still in harness, and even her impact if Biden could make it through another election:\n\nBut the painful reality for Ms. Harris is that in private conversations over the last few months, dozens of Democrats in the White House, on Capitol Hill and around the nation — including some who helped put her on the party’s 2020 ticket — said she had not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country. Even some Democrats whom her own advisers referred reporters to for supportive quotes confided privately that they had lost hope in her.Through much of the fall, a quiet panic set in among key Democrats about what would happen if President Biden opted not to run for a second term. Most Democrats interviewed, who insisted on anonymity to avoid alienating the White House, said flatly that they did not think Ms. Harris could win the presidency in 2024. Some said the party’s biggest challenge would be finding a way to sideline her without inflaming key Democratic constituencies that would take offense. ...Now with Mr. Biden appearing all but certain to run again, the concern over Ms. Harris has shifted to whether she will be a political liability for the ticket. Given that Mr. Biden at 80 is already the oldest president in American history, Republicans would most likely make Ms. Harris, who is 58, a prime attack line, arguing that a vote for Mr. Biden may in fact be a vote to put her in the Oval Office.\n\nSeems pretty prescient in retrospect. Did Dillon brief the NYT on this scenario? The article references \"dozens\" of Democrats speaking out about the need to replace Harris at that time, a move that Democrats likely regret not making now. Dillon may be blaming the press for undercutting Kamala when she herself enabled it in the first place, if Touré's sources are accurate. \n\n*- As opposed to Old Man Withers, the ever-popular villain ...","url":"https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2024/11/27/team-kamala-chair-media-falsely-painted-her-as-afraid-to-do-interviews-n3797403","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/308/fb3221d1-67ba-465b-9915-fe393086cec8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:36:52","author":"Ed Morrissey","authors":["Ed Morrissey"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":268334112,"title":"While Some Democratic Billionaires Vow To Fight On Others Are Ready To Give Up N3797423","text":"What is a billionaire Democrat to do after dumping money into a campaign that lost badly? The answers to that question vary. Some are doubling down and getting ready to fund Resistance 2.0.\n\nPierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay and a backer of progressive groups spearheading anti-Elon Musk campaigns, is behind a new initiative led by Democrats aiming to champion the second Trump resistance, records reveal...In September, Omidyar’s Democracy Fund, a private foundation steering the left-wing billionaire’s fortune, routed $500,000 to the Governors Action Alliance to support “coordinating and strengthening the work of governors to address specific threats to American democracy,” Democracy Fund’s grants database shows.\n\nAlso vowing to fight on despite the loss is Alex Soros, son of George Soros.\n\nMr. Soros, a 39-year-old history Ph.D., acknowledged in a brief interview the widespread worry of some Democrats that the party’s donors might withdraw from politics.“I’m always concerned about that,” he said. But was he still committed to progressive giving after Mr. Trump’s victory? “Of course,” he said as he walked to a black S.U.V. waiting to whisk him away. “Have I not made that clear?”\n\nBut other billionaires aren't so sure. Reid Hoffman, co-founder of Linked In (pictured above) is said to be thinking about leaving the country.\n\nMr. Hoffman, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on politics over the last few years, has told friends and allies that he is weighing a move overseas, according to three people with knowledge of the talks who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.Mr. Hoffman, who declined to comment through a spokeswoman, has helped pay for some of the most aggressive private litigation against Donald J. Trump, and he is worried about retribution from a president who has promised to go after his political opponents, including major Democratic donors.\n\nPeople who advise Democratic billionaires on how to spend their money are also in disagreement about what to do next. Seth London who advises big donors wrote a memo to party officials begging them to learn the lesson of the 2024 election, which in his view was that identity politics are poison.\n\n“Parts of the Democratic establishment accepted as gospel the myth that elections are won by mobilizing the ‘base’ through appeals to group, not individual, identities,” London wrote in the 3½-page memo, which I obtained.Calling for a new cadre of “Common Sense Democrats,” London said the reform movement should “begin with a complete rejection of race- and group-based identity politics and a wholesale embrace of a politics centered on delivering the American dream through simple, concrete action.”\n\nBut another adviser to limousine liberals seems to have given up on politics all together.\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn, another influential adviser to top Democratic donors who formerly helped guide Mr. Hoffman himself, had a darker, more nihilistic takeaway. Two days after Election Day, he wrote an email to his network saying that “The Second American Republic (1868-2024) is over.”...On Tuesday, he sent a second note suggesting he was largely giving up on American politics. “With federal power dominated by anti-Enlightenment forces, our focus will shift to supporting humanist ideals globally,” he said.\n\nIt's hard to get a real sense of what all of this might mean in a future election, but at least for the moment it sounds like some billionaire donors are stepping back from politics while others are going to be pushing back against the kind of far-left extremism that helped doom Harris' campaign. There will of course be some billionaires who never stop giving to far left causes but if there are fewer of them going forward that's good news for the country.","url":"https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2024/11/27/while-some-democratic-billionaires-vow-to-fight-on-others-are-ready-to-give-up-n3797423","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2015/125/4147213f-56de-4083-b915-af75c4ecee62.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:36:52","author":"John Sexton","authors":["John Sexton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":268337448,"title":"Trump's cabinet nominees targeted with bomb threats, 'swatting'; FBI swings into action","text":"Several of Donald Trump's cabinet and administration picks were targeted in recent hours with actions including bomb threats and \"swatting,\" a spokesperson for the U.S.-president elect said on Wednesday (November 27).

He hopes to hit 100,000 UK sales well before Christmas. Such is his enthusiasm for his cause that he was kicked off the Channel 4 US election night show for ‘banging on about his book’. ‘I’ve been in the Gulf, where I didn’t sell very many copies, but in Paris I sold a lot,’ he explains. Australia is next.\n\nOne memorable stop was Argentina, where he met Javier Milei. The local press excitedly reported that he’d agreed to set up a meeting between the Argentinian President and Mick Jagger. How is he getting on? ‘I haven’t yet swung it,’ he admits. ‘I feel it’s got to happen… he is an absolutely fantastic guy and he loves the Rolling Stones – he loves Britain by the way.’ Jagger has yet to comment on the idea.\n\nJohnson is enthusiastic about Milei’s programme to cut government waste. ‘We all in Europe need to learn from what he has to say about the size of the state and government departments, and Argentina is a particular case,’ he says. ‘But nobody in the UK or most western European economies could say that we’re immune from this problem. The state is too big and we need to fix it.’\n\nOf course, when Johnson was in No. 10 the opposite happened: the state swelled, in large part as a result of the pandemic – and the tax rises required to pay the Covid bill. Does he think much about what would have happened in his premiership if it had not been hit by Covid a few months in? ‘Yes, I do,’ he says. ‘I think it’s very sad.’\n\nBut he goes on to say that he suspects that even without lockdown and partygate, he might well have been pushed out of No. 10 prematurely. ‘Look, I think that they would have tried,’ he says. ‘I was – as I have been before in my life – the utensil for my beloved party to win but then, once I’d won, I was much more disposable than I believed and that’s a tricky position to be in.’\n\nThis is the narrative of Johnson’s memoirs – a valiant if naive leader has his time in office cut short by pesky MPs who couldn’t stay off Twitter. He wrote the book after leaving office, when ‘you can recollect in tranquillity and you can more or less piece together what happened’. There are some moments of self-reflection. Johnson writes that he is no longer sure the draconian lockdowns he imposed were the right move.\n\n‘The pandemic was a nightmare for me,’ he says. ‘I think we were fairly good at communicating some pretty unbelievably complicated policies but I think that honestly I found the pandemic a nightmare because I was genuinely uncertain as to the efficacy of some of the things that we were doing.’ But he stops short of regretting the whole thing – and says rules were needed. ‘Fraser [Nelson]… the late lamented editor,’ he pauses. ‘Well, we rejoice at the arrival of his successor, my long-standing buddy Michael [Gove]… but Fraser took a very anti-lockdown position and he kept citing Sweden and so on. Actually I don’t think the comparison was very fair… the Swedes implemented the same sorts of measures, they just did it without quite as much legal coercion and they also have a very different type of society in Sweden.’ In contrast, Johnson says, the Brits ‘needed some rules, even if those rules were not demonstrably efficacious in themselves’.\n\nIt’s often pointed out that Johnson the freedom-loving columnist would have railed against many of the things he ended up doing in office: tax rises, lockdown and an anti-obesity drive. How does he think his columnist brain would have marked his record? ‘Well, very highly obviously, because I’ve had the opportunity. There is a miraculous doctrinal coherence,’ he says. ‘So, look, Boris Johnson the prime minister delivered something that Boris Johnson the columnist had been campaigning on for 20 or 30 years, which was the absence of democracy in our relations with the European Union, or Community as it was when I first started writing about it, and that was a pretty significant thing to do.\n\n‘A lot of people still rant about that and say it was all wrong… I expect a lot of Spectator readers read some of your more timid columnists and think it was the wrong thing to do.’\n\nHe suddenly switches back to editor mode – suggesting a ‘series of articles trying to understand and explain why European economies remain so stagnant and so incapable of innovation by comparison with the United States’. Regarding the US, a decision looms for Keir Starmer as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Will the UK hug the EU closer or pick up negotiations for a free trade deal with the world’s biggest economy? For Johnson – who says Trump is ‘a kindly and a thoughtful man’ – the answer is simple: ‘Sorry, but who has got the faster growth rates?’\n\nUnder successive Tory prime ministers, however, the UK-US deal made no progress, partly because of regulatory hurdles to do with chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef. Johnson insists he could have overcome the obstacles. ‘The problem I had was I came in in 2019 and Trump, if you remember, loses in the end of 2020, so we only have a year to get it going… We would have been capable of closing the free trade deal but then Joe [Biden] came in.’\n\nWith Trump 2.0 fast approaching, Johnson suggests Starmer lay on a state dinner to build ties with the Donald. And he has an unorthodox proposal for resolving the meat impasse. ‘Here’s what The Spectator should do. Since we’re against anti-scientific mumbo-jumbo, right, The Spectator believes in logic and freedom and evidence, yes? Right? Get Bruce Anderson to have a huge slap-up beefsteak dinner. Half the guests have American or Canadian hormone-treated beef, because this is one of the biggest sticking points in the deal. And get some British… Now British beef will be absolutely delicious and first-rate – but the American beef… I’m sorry to say the Canadians eat about 60 per cent more beef than us but they also live a lot longer, and they have hormones in their beef, so I’m just saying.’\n\nLike Johnson, the current Prime Minister has been accused of spending too much of his premiership abroad: ‘Never-Here Keir’ and so on. Does he sympathise with Starmer’s current plight?\n\n‘Look, he probably does need to focus on what’s going on here. Honestly I think that it’s been epically bad,’ he says. ‘It sort of feels to me that they organically, institutionally didn’t believe they were going to win the next election, right, so it feels to me like Starmer was put in as the placeholder for Wes Streeting or whoever… Wild Wes. And now they’re stumbling around.’\n\nAnd what about Starmer’s opponent Kemi Badenoch? Johnson did not endorse a candidate for the Tory party leadership but is effusive – she is ‘actually doing a very good job right now’: ‘I warm to her because she seems to me to have a kind of impatience and zap about her that is refreshing. Starmer really is crasheroony snoozefest stodgerama by comparison. I think she can score a lot of runs, I really do.’\n\nIf Labour keeps going the way it is, Johnson predicts a one-term government. But will the Tories benefit from Labour’s misfortunes? Couldn’t Nigel Farage be the real winner? ‘No, I think [his chances are] zero, zero, zero,’ he says, before launching into a monologue about his own success in stopping Farage. (The problem in 2024: ‘They [the Tories] got rid of their visionary leader and that’s obviously my opinion and I’m entitled to it.’)\n\nWere Johnson in the Commons now, he would be facing a vote on assisted dying. How does he see this issue that has divided Starmer’s government? ‘I was in church the other day and a woman turned to me after the end of the service. She said “Please, please, please, whatever you do, vote in favour of this measure”. I was really wrung out by her because she said she had a terminal condition and she wanted the comfort of knowing that her end, when it came, would be dignified and painless.’\n\nBut Johnson says the current legislation is not the solution. ‘I wouldn’t vote for this bill, I think they need to go back to the drawing board. They need something that is humane and compassionate but would not lead to the industrialisation of state-sponsored suicide. I worry that we would be tending in that direction, even if this bill wouldn’t usher that in overnight. I worry that there are other jurisdictions where we can see where it’s going.’\n\nJohnson sounds like a man with unfinished business in politics. He likes to keep everyone guessing. His go-to reply to leadership speculation these days is to say that his chances are ‘about as good as my being blinded by a champagne cork’. What about simply returning as an MP under Badenoch? He deviates, distracts – and asks me: ‘What was the question again? Oh yes, me! Look, I think… so I think the point about politics… I did 15 years of pretty big jobs from the mayoralty onwards and loved it, but all the times I had to make a big step, like to be mayor or to be prime minister, it was really only because the Conservative party had run out of all other ideas for their candidate.’ The suggestion is that he will only come back if the party needs him. Yet it’s clear he could be unleashed once more.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/i-was-much-more-disposable-than-i-believed-an-interview-with-boris-johnson/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/boris-on-highland-cow-jumping-over-the-moon.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:31:45","author":"Katy Balls","authors":["Katy Balls"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":268334006,"title":"US Tells Ukraine To Lower Conscription Age To 18","text":"The outgoing US administration of President Joe Biden urged Ukraine Wednesday to reduce the minimum conscription age to 18 from 25 to tackle a manpower shortage as Russian forces press in.The call for Kyiv to boost its ranks came amid speculation that incoming president Donald Trump will take a new approach that could include pushing Kyiv into a peace deal with Moscow.A senior Biden administration official said that Ukraine was facing an \"existential\" recruitment crunch as it confronts a much larger enemy with more advanced weapons, and with its stocks of volunteers dwindling.\"The simple truth is that Ukraine is not currently mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace their battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia's growing military,\" said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Pressed on what Washington considers an appropriate minimum age, the official replied that \"we think there's real value in them considering lowering the recruiting age to 18\" -- in line with the US benchmark.Struggling to contain the Russian invasion launched in February 2022, Ukraine has already lowered the minimum age of mobilization from 27 to 25.Biden's White House later clarified that it was not talking about making the huge flow of US military aid to Kyiv dependent on a conscription age change.\"We're absolutely going to keep sending Ukraine weapons and equipment.

Biden has an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion in PDA already authorized by Congress that he is expected to use before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\nThe United States has not exported landmines in decades, and their use is controversial because of the potential harm to civilians. Although more than 160 countries have signed a treaty banning their use, Kyiv has been asking for them since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022 and Russian forces have used them on the front lines.\n\nThe landmines that would be sent to Ukraine are \"non-persistent\" landmines, with a power system that lasts for just a short time, leaving the devices non-lethal. This means that - unlike older landmines - they would not remain in the ground, threatening civilians indefinitely.\n\nRussian forces currently are making gains in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the 2022 invasion, taking an area half the size of London over the past month, analysts and war bloggers said this week.\n\nThe United States expects Ukraine to use the mines in its own territory, though it has committed not to use them in areas populated with its own civilians.\n\nTrump on Wednesday tapped Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who presented him with a plan to end the war in Ukraine, to serve as special envoy for the conflict. Quickly winding down the Ukraine war was one of Trump's central campaign promises, though he has avoided discussing how he would do so.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"U.S. President Joe Biden&apos;s administration is preparing a $725 million weapons package for Ukraine, two U.S. officials said on Wednesday, as the outgoing president seeks to bolster the government in Kyiv before leaving office in January.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/joe-biden-preparing-725-million-weapons-package-for-ukraine-report-285475.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-11/og8a16n_joe-biden_625x300_28_November_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-28 00:30:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":268332152,"title":"Wall Street Stocks End Lower After Inflation Data","text":"Wall Street&apos;s main indexes have closed lower, with the Nasdaq leading declines, as technology stocks slumped on Thanksgiving eve on worries the Federal Reserve may be cautious about rate cuts after stubbornly strong US inflation data. Data showed consumer spending increased solidly in October, suggesting the US economy maintained its strong pace of growth, but progress on lowering inflation appeared to have stalled. Traders added to bets the Fed will lower borrowing costs by 25 basis points at its December meeting, according to CME&apos;s FedWatch. However, they anticipate the central bank leaving rates unchanged at its January and March meetings.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 22.85 points, or 0.38 per cent, to end at 5,998.78 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 113.80 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 19,061.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 136.31 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 44,723.23. Dell slumped 12 per cent and HP dropped almost 6 per cent after downbeat quarterly forecasts, weighing on the Information Technology sector, which dropped 1.2 per cent. The sentiment spread to megacaps such as Nvidia and Microsoft, while the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index ended 1.8 per cent lower. The Russell 2000 index was sluggish after hitting a record high earlier in the week. It ended 0.1 per cent higher. Investors also assessed data earlier in the day which showed the economy grew at a solid clip in the third quarter. Weekly jobless claims fell again last week, leaving the door open for another rate cut from the Fed in December. \"Inflation has proven to be a little stickier than the Fed would have liked, which may give them pause with respect to cutting rates,\" said Scott Welch, chief investment officer at Certuity. \"There are questions around the effects of Trump&apos;s stated tariff policy, which, if implemented could be pretty inflationary and so the Fed is going to have to balance itself between the economic data and the incoming administration&apos;s policy agenda.\" Minutes from the Fed&apos;s November meeting, released on Tuesday, showed policymakers were uncertain about the outlook for interest-rate cuts and how much the current rates were restricting the economy. The benchmark S&P 500 was on track for its biggest one-month rise in a year and its sixth month of gains out of seven, as markets price in the view that Trump&apos;s policies will benefit local businesses and the overall economy.

But with key Canadian industries dispersed among certain provinces and regions — forestry and energy in western Canada, auto-manufacturing in Ontario, for example — it creates potential for conflict about which industries to protect. The unpopularity of Trudeau my also hurt Canada's negotiating position.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith, meanwhile, has publicly refused to describe the tariffs unjustified, and urging the federal government to address border issues. \n\n\"It's important to recognize that these tariffs are absolutely unjustified,\" Eby said, before noting provinces including B.C. have consistently raised concerns about border security with Ottawa.\n\n\"Now, it's being raised by (Trump),\" he said. \"It doesn't justify the tariffs.

Your whole family is going to die … I’m going to put a hole in your face.”\n\nHe brandished what federal authorities said “appears to be a white AR-15-style rifle with a 30-round magazine inserted into it” in several of the videos while making the alleged crazed threats against the once and future president. \n\nIn one video from Aug. 23, Tamayo-Torres appeared to be filming himself from a Trump rally at the Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Ariz., and said he’d watched the former president and Secret Service agents kidnap his daughter to sell her into prostitution.\n\nIn addition to the charges for threatening a president, authorities charged him with making false statements while purchasing a firearm after he allegedly lied on federal forms last year — indicating on the form he had no felony history, when in fact he was convicted of assault in 2003. \n\nEvidence from Tamayo-Torres’ Facebook indicated he possessed a tactical shotgun, another rifle and high-capacity magazines, according to court documents.\n\nTrump has been the target of several assassination plots in the lead-up to the Nov. 5 election before Tamayo-Torres’ arrest, including a July attempt by Thomas Crooks, who shot the then-candidate in the ear and killed a bystander before he was killed by a Secret Service sniper at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nJust two months later, would-be assassin Ryan Routh was caught hiding in the bushes of Trump’s Florida golf course with a rifle while the president-elect was golfing nearby. \n\nRouth was thwarted at the last moment after Secret Service agents spotted the barrel of his rifle in the brush. \n\nTamayo-Torres is expected to be sent back to Arizona to face charges.","summary":"The feds arrested an Arizona man who allegedly threatened to “put a hole” in President-elect Donald Trump’s face — after months of posting deranged videos in which he threatened to gun down the first family while brandishing a rifle.
