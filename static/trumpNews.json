The tariff would rise to 25 per cent from 1 June if no agreement is reached.\n\nThe threatened measures follow a joint statement by the eight European states backing Greenland, while Ireland’s Prime Minister warned that the European Union would retaliate if U.S. tariff threats materialise.\n\nReuters reports that the move has rekindled fears of geopolitical disruptions reminiscent of the “Liberation Day” tariffs in April 2025, which sent shockwaves through global markets.\n\nAnalysts say investor sentiment may be tempered by past experiences, as markets showed resilience despite previous threats. “Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now, and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, according to Reuters.\n\nThe dispute has triggered safe-haven demand, with gold remaining near record highs. “Markets at this point are expected to reopen this week in ‘risk-off’ mode,” said Tony Sycamore, IG market analyst. “This latest flashpoint has heightened concerns over a potential unravelling of NATO alliances and the disruption of last year’s trade agreements with several European nations, driving risk-off sentiment in stocks and boosting safe-haven demand for gold and silver,” he added.\n\nEuropean stocks, however, remain near record highs, with Germany’s DAX and London’s FTSE posting gains of more than three per cent this month. Defence stocks have been among the biggest beneficiaries, jumping almost 15 per cent as geopolitical concerns mount, Reuters reports.\n\nTina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, described the situation as a re-escalation of the U.S.-EU trade conflict. “The U.S.-EU trade war is back on,” she said, noting that Trump’s latest move comes just as EU officials and the South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement.\n\nWhile markets are on edge, experts say the overall impact may be limited. “Investor sentiment has proven quite resilient in the face of continuing unthinkable sorts of developments,” Fordham added.\n\nReuters highlights that the euro may face pressure in the coming days as Asian trading begins, while the impact on the dollar is less clear, given its status as a safe-haven currency amid geopolitical tensions.","summary":"Global markets face renewed volatility as the US threatens tariffs on eight European nations, re-escalating US-Europe trade tensions and boosting safe-have\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/global-markets-face-volatility-amid-us-europe-trade-tensions/","url":"https://punchng.com/global-markets-face-volatility-amid-us-europe-trade-tensions/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/30095038/European-Stock-Market-AFP1-1080x630.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-19 01:18:31","author":"Punch Newspapers,Temitope Aina","authors":["Punch Newspapers","Temitope Aina"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":394020880,"title":"Greenland needs US for defense because 'Europeans project weakness,' US Treasury Secretary argues","text":"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. needs to protect Greenland because Europe projects \"weakness\" in defense of the president's renewed calls to acquire the country.

China has previously slammed the US president for using it as a \"pretext\" for his Arctic ambitions, while Russia has consistently opposed the region's militarization, framing it as a zone for peaceful cooperation.\n\n\"Trump is really worried about the US continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,\" one official told NBC. Another senior administration official stated the goal is \"solidifying\" the hemisphere under US leadership, with securing Canada's northern border being a key part of that vision.\n\nHowever, officials were clear that unlike the explicit pursuit of Greenland, there is no discussion of purchasing Canada or stationing US troops on the ground along its northern border. The focus is instead on pressuring Canada to bolster its own capabilities and deepen bilateral military cooperation, including enhanced joint training, increased patrols, and updated early-warning systems in Canada.\n\n\"They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,\" one official said. \"The status quo is not enough.\"\n\nThe warnings from US officials have fueled existing fears in Canada that the country could become Washington's next target following the shock abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and President Trump's talk of seizing Greenland, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nOn a recent visit to Beijing, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that dealing with China had become \"more predictable\" than the complex relationship with Washington. Carney has also publicly echoed European allies, stating Greenland's future is a matter for Greenland and Denmark alone and expressing \"concern\" over Trump's tariff threats related to the island.","url":"https://www.canadastandard.com/news/278816667/trump-worried-about-canada-arctic-nbc","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/1010e45/cadcf461-557f-4b9d-aeab-b40f2670d72c/0/OTBmYThjNTgtYTV-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-19 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.311},{"id":394019462,"title":"Comprehensive India-Canada Free Trade Agreement should be \"trade without tariffs\": Veteran Canadian journalist Terry Milewski","text":"New Delhi [India], January 18 (ANI): Veteran Canadian journalist Terry Milewski has underlined the need for a comprehensive India-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a stronger push for people-to-people ties, as he spoke about the future direction of bilateral relations amid evolving global geopolitics.\n\nIn an interview with ANI, Milewski said the key outcome of a possible visit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to India should be 'a comprehensive free trade agreement where India and Canada set an example of what it should be,' adding, 'It should be trade without tariffs.'\n\nEmphasising that the FTA must go beyond limited trade openings, Milewski said, 'We need a comprehensive free trade agreement where India and Canada set an example of what it should be. It should be trade without tariffs. Why should there be any tariffs at all?'\n\nLinking trade policy to broader political and economic realities, he said, 'It's not about what's right and wrong. It's what they will go ahead and do,' adding that the global environment is being reshaped by expanding strategic competition and uncertainty.\n\nMilewski also cautioned against viewing the current improvement in ties as a full resolution of disputes. 'The vaunted rapprochement between India and Canada, in my submission, doesn't really exist. It's an illusion that both governments find convenient,' he said.\n\nHe added that the dispute that triggered the downturn in ties remains unresolved, saying, 'They have not decided to settle dispute which began the precipitous decline in relations which happened when Trudeau accused the Modi government of murder.'\n\nThe diplomatic chill between the two nations began in 2023 when India expressed concerns over Canada's perceived leniency towards Khalistani separatist elements and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that Indian agents were involved in the killing of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside a gurdwara the same year.\n\nCommenting on how both sides are managing the relationship, Milewski said, 'Both governments have decided to let it be,' adding, 'They're just going to have to go with the undecided, unsettled, dispute in the background.'\n\nReferring to possible diplomatic engagement, Milewski said, 'It's reported pretty widely that in the next couple of months, Carney may come to India,' and added that if such a visit takes place, he would like to see India build a memorial to Air India 182 victims.\n\n'For one thing, I think that it shouldn't happen at all unless and until the Indian government itself raises the money and builds a memorial to the victims of Air India 182,' he said, adding, 'We have four memorials in Canada.'\n\nHighlighting the importance of deeper engagement at the societal level, Milewski said, 'People-to-people exchanges between India and Canada are enormously fruitful. It's wonderful for Canada,' but added that ties have become 'mired in a completely wrong dynamic of crime.'\n\n'I'd like to see a vast improvement in the quality and style of people-to-people exchanges, an intermingling of two wonderful people, the Canadians and the Indians,' he said.\n\nMilewski also spoke about the shifting international environment and Canada's evolving foreign policy outlook, saying, 'We've had our heads snapped two or three times already in this interview by the things that have happened since Trump arrived on the scene.'\n\nOn the emerging global scenario, he said, 'The overturning of the old world order and its by the new world order,' adding, 'I don't think it's going to get better soon. It's going to get worse.'\n\nThe remarks come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has stated that Ottawa, to diversify its global trade landscape, will be doubling non-US exports by the next decade.\n\nIndian High Commissioner to Canada Dinesh Patnaik has said that Carney is set to visit India in the coming weeks to expand bilateral trade with New Delhi, after over two years of strained diplomatic relations.\n\nSpeaking to CBC's 'Power & Politics', Patnaik on January 13 said Carney's visit is aimed at diversifying Canada's trading partners amid high tariffs imposed by the United States on its largest trade partner.\n\nBoth India and Canada are facing high tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on their exports, including 50 per cent tariffs on India and 35 per cent tariffs on Canada, the report said.\n\n'In a shifting global trade landscape, Canada's new government is focused on what we can control. We're going to double our non-US exports over the next decade -- to secure new opportunities for Canadian businesses, and create tens of thousands of new careers for Canadian workers,' Carney said in a post on X on Monday.\n\nPatnaik said Carney's visit is expected after India tables its Union Budget on February 1, describing the renewed engagement as a sign that 'trust is back in the system.'\n\nHe added that diplomats are working to 'catch up' on initiatives delayed due to a 'slight gap' in relations.\n\nPatnaik reiterated that the Indian government has denied any involvement, saying, 'We have always said it's preposterous, absurd. It's something we don't do,' and that 'there is no case against the Government of India.'\n\nThe envoy further said Canada's approach is changing under the current leadership, stating, 'There's a new prime minister who is changing the way Canada behaves,' as quoted by CBC.\n\nIn November last year, Carney accepted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to visit India in early 2026, according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nFollowing the return of high commissioners in August 2025, the two prime ministers agreed to increase diplomatic staffing to meet growing consular demand and strengthen people-to-people ties. They also agreed to support reciprocal knowledge transfer as part of ongoing engagement between the two countries.\n\nCarney welcomed the progress being made in the law enforcement dialogue between India and Canada.\n\nIndia and Canada have agreed to begin negotiations on a high-ambition Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) following a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa.\n\nThe planned CEPA talks aim to raise bilateral trade to USD 50 billion by 2030.

Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel explicitly called the tariffs an act of \"blackmail,\" urging Washington to withdraw the \"ridiculous proposal\" before it takes effect. German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said Berlin \"must not allow itself to be intimidated,\" adding that \"a line has been crossed.\"\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen posted on social media that \"Europe will not be blackmailed.\" Underscoring the universal support for Denmark, she said this is now \"an issue that reaches far beyond our own borders.\"\n\nCALL FOR IMMEDIATE RETALIATION\n\nMomentum to push back was gathered at the EU level. Valerie Hayer, president of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, urged EU leaders to activate the bloc's never-used \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" dubbed an \"economic nuclear weapon.\" The mechanism would allow immediate retaliation, including punitive tariffs, market bans, financial sanctions, and the suspension of U.S. patents and licences, without recourse to the United Nations or the World Trade Organization.\n\nNoting that the United States exports more than 500 billion U.S. dollars of goods to the EU each year, making the bloc Washington's largest market, Hayer warned that Trump \"should think twice,\" stressing that the EU is \"not afraid to use deterrence for our defense.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, a report by Financial Times said that EU capitals are considering hitting Washington with 93 billion euros (107.68 billion U.S. dollars) worth of tariffs or reviving the \"Anti-Coercion Instrument.\"\n\nDescribing the tariffs as \"unacceptable,\" French President Emmanuel Macron's office also confirmed that the president would request the same course of action if Washington follows through on its threat.\n\nAfter meeting his Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide, in Oslo, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he had \"no doubt about the support from Europe,\" even in the face of a costly tariff war. \"We must do everything we can to implement the principles,\" Rasmussen added. Meanwhile, Eide said, \"We will not yield to pressure.\"\n\nBROADER CHORUS OF REBUKE\n\nBeyond the directly targeted states, other European countries joined the criticism of the U.S. move. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, speaking during a visit to South Korea, called the tariff threats \"a mistake.\"\n\nAfter separate calls on Sunday with Denmark Prime Minister Frederiksen, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, as well as Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer repeated that it is wrong to apply tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies.\n\nOn Saturday, Starmer said Britain's position on Greenland is very clear: \"it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,\" branding the U.S. threat \"completely wrong.\"\n\nIreland's Foreign Minister Helen McEntee emphasized the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. \"There can be no lasting peace and security in a world where these principles are ignored and undermined,\" she said.\n\nThe Croatian government said allies should respect each other and acknowledge the fact that Greenland is part of Denmark. \"In this context, we express our solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" it said, adding that additional tariffs would upset the balance of EU-U.S. trade relations and weaken the trans-Atlantic partnership.\n\nThe unified European pushback sets the stage for a potential escalation. With calls to arm the EU's economic \"bazooka\" and repeated warnings against blackmail, Europe has signaled an unusually firm willingness to risk a tit-for-tat economic confrontation over Greenland's sovereignty.\n\nSince returning to the Oval Office in 2025, Trump has repeatedly voiced a desire to \"obtain\" Greenland and has recently ramped up his threat.

Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel explicitly called the tariffs an act of \"blackmail,\" urging Washington to withdraw the \"ridiculous proposal\" before it takes effect. German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said Berlin \"must not allow itself to be intimidated,\" adding that \"a line has been crossed.\"\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen posted on social media that \"Europe will not be blackmailed.\" Underscoring the universal support for Denmark, she said this is now \"an issue that reaches far beyond our own borders.\"\n\nCALL FOR IMMEDIATE RETALIATION\n\nMomentum to push back was gathered at the EU level. Valerie Hayer, president of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, urged EU leaders to activate the bloc's never-used \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" dubbed an \"economic nuclear weapon.\" The mechanism would allow immediate retaliation, including punitive tariffs, market bans, financial sanctions, and the suspension of U.S. patents and licences, without recourse to the United Nations or the World Trade Organization.\n\nNoting that the United States exports more than 500 billion U.S. dollars of goods to the EU each year, making the bloc Washington's largest market, Hayer warned that Trump \"should think twice,\" stressing that the EU is \"not afraid to use deterrence for our defense.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, a report by Financial Times said that EU capitals are considering hitting Washington with 93 billion euros (107.68 billion U.S. dollars) worth of tariffs or reviving the \"Anti-Coercion Instrument.\"\n\nDescribing the tariffs as \"unacceptable,\" French President Emmanuel Macron's office also confirmed that the president would request the same course of action if Washington follows through on its threat.\n\nAfter meeting his Norwegian counterpart, Espen Barth Eide, in Oslo, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said he had \"no doubt about the support from Europe,\" even in the face of a costly tariff war. \"We must do everything we can to implement the principles,\" Rasmussen added. Meanwhile, Eide said, \"We will not yield to pressure.\"\n\nBROADER CHORUS OF REBUKE\n\nBeyond the directly targeted states, other European countries joined the criticism of the U.S. move. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, speaking during a visit to South Korea, called the tariff threats \"a mistake.\"\n\nAfter separate calls on Sunday with Denmark Prime Minister Frederiksen, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, as well as Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer repeated that it is wrong to apply tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies.\n\nOn Saturday, Starmer said Britain's position on Greenland is very clear: \"it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,\" branding the U.S. threat \"completely wrong.\"\n\nIreland's Foreign Minister Helen McEntee emphasized the fundamental principles of the UN Charter. \"There can be no lasting peace and security in a world where these principles are ignored and undermined,\" she said.\n\nThe Croatian government said allies should respect each other and acknowledge the fact that Greenland is part of Denmark. \"In this context, we express our solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" it said, adding that additional tariffs would upset the balance of EU-U.S. trade relations and weaken the trans-Atlantic partnership.\n\nThe unified European pushback sets the stage for a potential escalation. With calls to arm the EU's economic \"bazooka\" and repeated warnings against blackmail, Europe has signaled an unusually firm willingness to risk a tit-for-tat economic confrontation over Greenland's sovereignty.\n\nSince returning to the Oval Office in 2025, Trump has repeatedly voiced a desire to \"obtain\" Greenland and has recently ramped up his threat. In a social media post on Saturday, he said the United States would levy a 10-percent tariff from Feb. 1 on goods from the eight targeted countries. He warned the rate would rise to 25 percent on June 1 and remain in place until a deal is reached for the \"complete and total purchase\" of Greenland.","url":"https://www.unitedkingdomnews.net/news/278816555/european-countries-rally-against-us-tariff-over-greenland","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/83454a0/bdec170a-f594-4bcd-82a8-0341800b4544/0/CbsbeeE000021-20260119-CBMFN0A001-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-19 00:00:00","author":"Financial Times","authors":["Financial Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.032},{"id":394018674,"title":"\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations\": European countries express solidarity with Denmark, Greenland","text":"Copenhagen [Denmark], January 18 (ANI): Several European countries came together and expressed support and solidarity with Denmark and Greenland amid the threat by US President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on eight European nations untill it is allowed to acquire Greenland.\n\nA joint statement by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom--shared by the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, mentioned that exercise 'Arctic Endurance' does not pose a threat to anyone and that the countries stand in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.\n\nThe statement highlighted that the threat of tariffs undermines transatlantic relations and risks a dangerous downward spiral.\n\n'As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest.

Gavin Newsom is responding – opening more than 200 California state parks for free to honor Dr. King while calling out Trump’s move. Last month, the Trump administration reshaped when Americans can enter national parks for free, scrapping Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth and National Public Lands Day from the 2026 calendar. In their place, the administration added a slate of historically themed or presidentially themed dates. Flag day – which also happens to be Trump's birthday – becomes a fee-free day for the first time, along with Constitution Day, the 110th anniversary of the National Park Service and the birthday of Theodore Roosevelt. Newsom announced Friday that, ahead of the 100th anniversary of Black History Month, he is directing California State Parks to offer free admission at more than 200 participating parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP SUES TRUMP FOR REPLACING NATIONAL PARK PASS PHOTO WITH HIS OWN IMAGE \"While Trump works to erase Dr. King’s legacy, California will honor it,\" Newsom said in a press release. \"Dr. King taught us that ‘darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.’ While the Trump administration tries to erase his legacy and turn national parks and monuments into places of exclusion and fear, California answers with light.\" \"That’s why I’m announcing free entry at California State Parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2026 – because Dr. King’s legacy deserves to be honored, not erased,\" Newsom continued. \"I’m encouraging all Californians to get outside on MLK Day, spend time in nature, reflect on Dr. King’s legacy, and reaffirm our commitment to advancing civil rights for all.\" Free entry applies to vehicle day-use fees only and is available at more than 200 participating California state parks statewide, according to the governor’s office. NATIONAL PARK GIFT SHOPS ARE ORDERED TO PURGE BIAS-DRIVEN DEI AND WOKE MERCHANDISE Free vehicle entry is being made possible by the California State Parks Foundation rather than taxpayer dollars. The foundation’s investment is intended to keep the state parks running while also planting seeds for a lifetime of connection to the state’s \"natural and cultural treasures,\" Newsom’s office said. Democratic leaders framed the move as a direct rebuke of the Trump administration’s actions. TRUMP ADDS HIS BIRTHDAY AS FREE NATIONAL PARK DAY WHILE AXING MLK DAY AND JUNETEENTH \"As the federal government eliminates fee-free park days for holidays that celebrate Black history, California continues to revel in the glory of our civil rights pioneers,\" state Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson said. \"Opening our parks for everyone to enjoy encourages loved ones to come together, give back, and honor Dr. King’s legacy while enjoying the natural beauty of the Golden State.\" Some of the parks offering free entry include Big Basin Redwoods, Half Moon Bay, Sugarloaf Ridge, Doheny, Wildwood Canyon Park Property, Folsom Lake, Bidwell Mansion and Lake Oroville. Some parks will still require a fee, including off-highway vehicle recreation areas, parks with per-person or tour fees such as Hearst Castle and locations operated by partner organizations.

While Operation Midway Blitz, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration enforcement operation targeting criminal illegal immigrants, was launched in honor of Katie Abraham's death, Abraham also warned illegal immigrants to \"do things the right way.\" \"If you want to really be part of America and come in here, then you have got to do things the right way,\" said Abraham, who is featured in a video for The American Border Story, a national initiative exposing the human impact of America’s border crisis. \"There has got to be an orderly process where people have to understand how to behave here,\" he told Fox News Digital, before describing the silence he experienced from state leadership that compounded the pain of his loss even further. MOM PRAISES HOUSE FOR PASSING KEY IMMIGRATION BILL, BASHES CROCKETT FOR DISMISSING DAUGHTER'S MURDER \"I received utter silence and indifference from my governor,\" said Abraham. \"Katie got disrespect and silence.\" Abraham said neither Pritzker, Sen. Dick Durbin, Sen. Tammy Duckworth nor his state or local representatives have reached out to him since she was killed. Abraham even recalled attending a congressional Oversight Committee event in 2025 at which Pritzker and other sanctuary state governors testified, when Katie’s case was cited. \"We were sitting several feet away from him in Congress, and he didn’t spend two seconds – didn’t even look in our direction,\" he said. \"Father to father – I expected him to care.\" \"I wanted him to say, ‘Things got out of control. We’re working on it.’ I wanted leadership and wanted him to acknowledge Katie’s life. She was worth five seconds of his time,\" he added. Katie died in the early morning hours of Jan. 19, 2025, when police said a drunk illegal alien slammed into the vehicle she was riding in with friends and fled the scene. A second young woman, Chloe Polzin, 21, of Deerfield, died the following day from her injuries. \"They were at a stoplight in front of the hospital and were barreled into from the rear at almost 80 mph by an illegal immigrant who was drunk driving,\" Abraham said.

She had this way of bringing people in and making them feel seen.\" She loved sports and the water, he said, and had her entire life ahead of her but will now never see her get married, and he said he will, \"never walk her down the aisle or see her children.\" Abraham said the driver, Julio Cucul-Bol, is a Guatemalan national using a Mexican alias. Authorities said Cucul-Bol had previously been deported from the U.S. He was arrested near Dallas while on a bus heading to Matamoros, Mexico. Police said he was found with fake Mexican identification under the name Juan JaHaziel Saenz-Suarez. Cucul-Bol was sentenced to 30 years in prison after accepting a plea deal for charges including leaving the scene of a crash resulting in death, aggravated DUI resulting in death and reckless homicide. MEET THE MINNESOTANS KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THAT WALZ, DEMS NEVER HELD PRESS CONFERENCES OR VIGILS FOR The Department of Justice (DOJ) had charged him with possessing a false Social Security card, possessing a false permanent resident card, making a false statement on a bank application and false use of a passport. \"The issue was that when he came into the U.S. there were no background checks. There were no health checks,\" Abraham said. \"He had HIV. That’s in the court transcripts and court documents.\" Cucul-Bol could not read or write and spoke neither English nor Spanish – rather, he spoke a Mayan language, according to Abraham. \"He wasn’t working and wasn’t productive. This was also not his first foray into drunk driving,\" he said. Abraham said his criticism surrounds weak policy, which he hoped would be \"rational policy and some common sense,\" he said. \"If you’re going to nullify federal law, you better have a process to fill that void.\"Abraham called for practical policies that protect victims and the broader public while also supporting immigrants who come legally and with good intentions. He added that, so far, the main progress has been federal agencies like DHS and ICE stepping in to assist communities despite facing resistance from multiple sides. \"ICE has to go out on the streets now, because Illinois won't cooperate,\" he said. \"You can’t throw out the welcome mat to anyone and everyone, unchecked and unvetted, and then wash your hands of the consequences.\" ANGEL FAMILIES THANK TRUMP IN NEW THANKSGIVING VIDEO FOR HIS BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS: 'WE APPRECIATE YOU' Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a lawsuit against the federal government over Operation Midway Blitz, alleging that President Donald Trump’s administration violated Tenth Amendment protections through what the suit described as \"unlawful and violent\" enforcement tactics.

Another day devoted to others, serving their community, nourishing their faith, another day of school holidays.

We have tried to pursue that, and it hasn’t been successful,” Albanese told ABC Radio Melbourne. “So we accept the reality.”“We’re not a government that puts things up over and over again to see them defeated,” he said, rejecting the possibility of further negotiation with the Greens, who have demanded the race-based reform be expanded to include other protected groups.Albanese said Labor would only pursue changes that had a chance of passing this week, and then would shift focus to the rest of its agenda.“If the parliament changes, then the laws can change. But you deal with the parliament that the Australian people voted for.

On that test, a majority of Australians now believe Albanese failed.More than half of respondents in the latest Resolve Monitor poll – 56 per cent – rate his response to Bondi as poor. Just 32 per cent say it was good. It is a savage assessment of a leader who, until recently, had prided himself on being trusted and steady.You can read the full piece here.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the government will continue its push to ban controversial Islamic organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir despite watered-down legislation making the effort harder.“The truth is that getting rid of the racial vilification laws makes it more difficult, but we’ll be banning them because they’re an organisation which promote hatred as an organisation as part of their ideology,” Albanese told ABC Sydney this morning.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra.Alex EllinghausenThe government’s original omnibus antisemitism bill, which included hate speech and gun reforms in a single piece of legislation, did not win the support of the Coalition or the Greens. Labor needs the support of either group to pass the legislation in the Senate.Two separate pieces of legislation going to the same areas are set to be introduced into Parliament this afternoon. Hate speech provisions have been watered down in the new offering.Albanese said Hizb ut-Tahrir should have been banned earlier, but “the law didn’t allow us to do so”.“We list as terrorist organisations a range of explicit organisations such as Hezbollah, that makes it illegal for the display of Hezbollah flags for people to be members or engage with Hezbollah,” Albanese said.“This organisation, that essentially has a very dangerous ideological position, promotes extremism … we want to have the power to be able to list it and to outlaw it,” he said.AdvertisementPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has said he is worried by the rise in popularity of One Nation, saying the party appeals to “grievance” and its members are a “pretty divisive lot”, as the minor party soars in the polls.“I’m a believer in mainstream politics, and that the parties of government are important. I’ve served this country pretty well. I look at overseas where you have a real fragmentation, and you might have five or six parties in government, and it’s unstable,” Albanese told KIIS FM this morning.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Not all of them will receive support. I think that’s unfortunate. But, we took the recommendations of the envoy on antisemitism, and we’re about implementing them,” he said.Minister for Health Mark Butler said Australia was considering US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join his “board of peace” initiative aimed at resolving conflicts globally, including rebuilding Gaza.“We’re considering that request, we only just received it,” Butler told Nine’s Today.US President Donald Trump has offered an invitation for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to join his “board of peace”.

The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to US national security.\n\n“We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland,” the group said. “Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\nThere are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading.\n\nIt was unclear, too, how Trump could act under US law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a US Supreme Court challenge.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from the divisions between the US and Europe. She added in a post on social media: “If Greenland’s security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.”\n\nTrump’s move was also panned domestically.\n\nUS Sen. Mark Kelly, a former US Navy pilot and Democrat who represents Arizona, posted that Trump’s threatened tariffs on US allies would make Americans “pay more to try to get territory we don’t need.”\n\n“Troops from European countries are arriving in Greenland to defend the territory from us. Let that sink in,” he wrote on social media. “The damage this President is doing to our reputation and our relationships is growing, making us less safe. If something doesn’t change we will be on our own with adversaries and enemies in every direction.”\n\n‘These tariffs will hurt us’\n\nSix of the countries targeted are part of the 27-member EU, which operates as a single economic zone in terms of trading. It was not immediately clear if Trump’s tariffs would impact the entire bloc. EU envoys scheduled emergency talks for Sunday evening to determine a potential response.\n\nThe tariff announcement even drew blowback from Trump’s populist allies in Europe.\n\nItaly’s right-wing premier, Giorgia Meloni, considered one of Trump’s closest allies on the continent, said Sunday she had spoken to him about the tariffs, which she described as “a mistake.”\n\nThe deployment to Greenland of small numbers of troops by some European countries was misunderstood by Washington, Meloni told reporters. She said the deployment was not a move against the US but aimed to provide security against “other actors” that she didn’t name.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that “no intimidation or threats will influence us, whether in Ukraine, Greenland or anywhere else in the world when we are faced with such situations.” He added that “tariff threats are unacceptable and have no place in this context.”\n\nJordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in France and also a European Parliament lawmaker, posted that the EU should suspend last year’s tariff deal with the US, describing Trump’s threats as “commercial blackmail.”\n\nTrump also achieved the rare feat of uniting Britain’s main political parties — including the hard-right Reform UK party — all of whom criticised the tariff threat.\n\n“We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a longtime champion and ally of Trump, wrote on social media. He stopped short of criticising Trump’s designs on Greenland.\n\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who leads the centre-left Labour Party, said the tariffs announcement was “completely wrong” and his government would “be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nThe foreign ministers of Denmark and Norway are also expected to address the crisis Sunday in Oslo during a news conference.

In a joint statement the countries said they will \"stand united and coordinated\" in their response and in \"full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\".\n\nIt came after the erratic US President warned he will slap 10% tariffs on countries including the UK for opposing his desired takeover of the territory. In an incendiary move, he also threatened to hike the levies on NATO allies to 25% on June 1 if a deal to buy Greenland is not reached in time.\n\n Over the weekend Keir Starmer criticised the move as \"completely wrong\" in rare public criticism of the US President. The Prime Minister had been planning a cost of living focused speech in the North West on Monday - but the intervention has been delayed. \n\nHe is instead expected to address the international developments over the weekend in a press conference from Downing Street on Monday. Mr Starmer will set out the UK's approach to working with allies while making clear his aim to protect the security and living standards of the British public.\n\nThe statement on Sunday by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK said: \"As members of Nato, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise Arctic Endurance conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.

We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.\"\n\nBut some including the Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey have urged the PM to cancel the King's upcoming state visit if the President presses ahead with the threat. He said: \"The PM must tell Trump in no uncertain terms: if he goes ahead with these outrageous tariffs and keeps bullying Greenland, there’ll be no state visit to the US in April. The UK must not be a doormat for an extortionist, or reward Trump’s behaviour with the pageantry he craves.\"\n\n Tory MP Simon Hoare added: \"The upcoming State visit of HM The King to the US must now be cancelled. The civilised world can deal with Trump no longer. He is a gangster pirate.\" \n\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy insisted on Sunday the UK's position on Greenland is non-negotiable - despite Donald Trump's threats. She said: \"Our PM has been unequivocal, it is the position of the UK that the future of Greenland depends on the wishes of the people of Greenland and the people of the kingdom of Denmark.\"\n\nBut she told Sky News that Britain will not descend into a \"war of words\" with Trump's America and ramp up the temperature. Pressed on whether the UK could delay King Charles's US state visit as a result, Ms Nandy dismissed the idea.\n\nShe said: \"Our position on Greenland is non-negotiable. We've made that very clear and we'll continue to make that clear. President Trump's position on Greenland is different. Notwithstanding that it is in our collective interest to work together and not to start a war of words. And were I to come on your show and say we're going to try and persuade the King to delay his visit because we're very cross - I'm not really sure where that will get us.\n\n\"What we will do is continue to be clear about the UK's position and what is in our interests and act in our interests.\" On Sunday, EU ambassadors were also summoned for emergency talks over the US President's threats.","summary":"It came after the erratic US President Donald Trump warned he will slap 10% tariffs on countries including the UK for opposing his desired takeover of Greenland","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/breaking-keir-starmer-hold-downing-36572551","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article36572554.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Sir-Keir-starmer.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 22:30:00","author":"Ashley Cowburn","authors":["Ashley Cowburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.241},{"id":394012088,"title":"Trade war looms as EU and UK unite against Trump","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is attempting to rescue the UK-US special relationship after Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on nations which oppose him taking control of Greenland.\n\nIn a phone call with the US President last night, the Prime Minister told Trump he was “wrong” to apply tariffs on allies trying to defend the Nato alliance, and that Britain would stand firm in its position on Greenland.\n\nStarmer will echo this message in a hastily arranged statement and press conference in Downing Street on Monday following the weekend’s transatlantic turmoil.\n\nBut he will also try to salvage his personal friendship with Trump, built over more than a year, and stress the importance of maintaining the UK-US alliance for the British national interest.\n\nThe US President’s announcement on Saturday – without prior warning to the Prime Minister or other European leaders – that he would impose tariffs on all exports to the US of 10 per cent from 1 February, rising to 25 per cent in June, triggered the worst crisis in British-American relations in decades.\n\nStarmer was urged to cancel the King’s state visit to the US this spring, which is timed to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nLib Dem leader Ed Davey said the state visit should be dropped if the tariffs go ahead. The UK must not “reward Trump’s behaviour with the pageantry he craves,” he said.\n\nThe leaders targeted by the tariff threat – the UK, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands – issued a joint statement warning that Trump’s actions could trigger a “dangerous downward spiral” in transatlantic relations.\n\nIn his statement and press conference in Downing Street, the Prime Minister will set out the UK’s approach to working with its allies, including the UK’s commitment to Nato, and how Britain will be led by its values.\n\nHe will make clear his determination to work at home and abroad to protect the security, living standards, and future of the British people.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed that Starmer spoke to Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, as well as Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, before his phone call with Trump.\n\n“In all his calls, the Prime Minister reiterated his position on Greenland. He said that security in the High North is a priority for all Nato allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests,” she said.\n\n“He also said that applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is wrong.”\n\nHow UK could follow EU’s ‘bazooka’ of retaliatory trade tariffs\n\nDespite Starmer’s strategy of remaining close to Trump, he could align with the EU, which is set to trigger its anti-coercion trade “bazooka” of retaliatory measures for the first time.\n\nThis could see the EU-US trade deal scrapped while the US President’s threatened tariffs could trickle through to UK prices for medicines, food, drink and cars.\n\nTrump’s move followed the arrival last week of small military contingents from several European countries to Greenland as part of a Danish-led Nato exercise aimed at reinforcing Arctic security. European governments insist the deployments are defensive and directed at growing Russian and Chinese activity in the region – not at the US.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron struck a defiant tone, saying Europe would not be intimidated “in Greenland, in Ukraine, or anywhere else”, and calling Trump’s tariff threat unacceptable.\n\nHe called for the EU to activate its so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument that can block US companies from the single market. The Élysée Palace said he coordinated with key EU leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, as well as Starmer.\n\nThe tool, adopted in 2023, known as a “trade bazooka”, allows the EU to respond to instances of “economic coercion” by other countries, like tariffs, with its own retaliatory measures. The Financial Times reported that the EU’s “bazooka” could be as much as $93bn (£60bn) in tariffs on the US.\n\nThere were also warnings from the European Commission and from MEPs that the US trade deal with the EU, agreed last summer, would not be approved while Trump continued to issue threats against Greenland. Implementing the US-EU trade deal would be “very complicated” in light of Trump’s threats, EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič said.\n\nWhile the UK has yet to clarify the implications of its own trade deal with the US, agreed last May, it is likely that Starmer would also suspend it if Trump follows through with his tariff threats.\n\nAn awkward test of Starmer’s post-Brexit strategy\n\nFor the UK, the dispute presents an awkward test of its post-Brexit strategy towards Washington. Starmer, who has sought to position Britain as a bridge between the US and Europe, condemned the tariff threat as “completely wrong” and said it would be raised directly with the White House.\n\nThe UK had hoped that a bilateral trade understanding with Washington would insulate it from Trump’s more confrontational trade policies.\n\nHowever, Britain now finds itself grouped with EU states facing the same penalties – reinforcing concerns that even close alignment with the US offers no protection from sudden economic pressure.\n\nWarnings from European leaders mark a major shift in Europe’s approach to Trump, whose return to office has been characterised by aggressive tariff threats, wavering support for Ukraine, and repeated demands that European Nato members dramatically increase defence spending.\n\nEven Meloni, one of the European leaders with the closest ties to Trump, denounced the threat, saying, “it is a mistake, and I do not agree with it.”\n\nUntil now, most EU capitals have opted for caution, fearing that retaliation could prompt the US to scale back its military commitments to Europe. Trump’s explicit linkage of tariffs to territorial demands, however, has shaken that calculation.\n\n“I can’t remember when it was as bad as this between Europe and America,” said one EU diplomat. “But this moment could be our breaking point, when we finally say ‘no.’”\n\nMedicines, cars, food and drink costs could rise\n\nDavid Henig, director at the UK Trade Policy Project, warned that lost trade as a result of US tariffs would have an economic impact in the UK, even if the majority of UK trade is services.\n\n“Aviation, pharmaceuticals, cars and whisky are obvious products in the firing line from 10 per cent and particularly 25 per cent tariffs. In the past, Trump has exempted the first two for US reasons, so this may happen again. Nonetheless, there is a clear worry for the UK.”\n\nMarco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade, added: “The implication is that it is a cumulative tariff, so one that is on top of the existing tariffs. This means that UK products sold into the US market will be more expensive.\n\n“UK businesses could decide to absorb some of the cost increases so their products remain competitive in the US market but much of that has happened already [due to existing tariffs].\n\n“How quickly it impacts consumers depends on stock already in the marketplace but the impact of these sorts of announcements are pretty quick on consumers.”","url":"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/trade-war-trump-looms-eu-uk-unite-4178182","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SEI_281320611.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C677px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 22:30:00","author":"Jane Merrick","authors":["Jane Merrick"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":394016994,"title":"'Trump is a menacing racketeer using blackmail and threats to get what he wants'","text":"Gangster Donald Trump’s great Greenland grab is a blessing in disguise for Keir Starmer.

(AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to American control of Greenland, setting up a potentially dangerous test of US partnerships in Europe. \n\nDenmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff, Trump said in a social media post while at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. \n\nThe rate would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States, he said.\n\nThe Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to US national security.\n\n“The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them,” Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nThe tariff threat could mark a problematic rupture between Trump and America’s longtime NATO partners, further straining an alliance that dates to 1949 and provides a collective degree of security to Europe and North America. \n\nTrump has repeatedly tried to use trade penalties to bend allies and rivals alike to his will, generating investment commitments from some nations and pushback from others, notably China.\n\nTrump is scheduled to travel on Tuesday to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he likely will run into the European leaders he just threatened with tariffs that would start in little more than two weeks.\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Trump’s move was a “surprise” given the “constructive meeting” with top US officials this week in Washington.\n\nThe European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the head of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said in a joint statement that tariffs “would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.” \n\nThey said Europe would remain “committed to upholding its sovereignty.”\n\n Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

Only a little more than one-third of voters, 35 percent, said that the economy had improved over the past 12 months. By a 12-point margin, Americans said that they feel constrained by cost-of-living pressures.\n\nAnd a CBS poll found that a broad majority — 74 percent of Americans — say their incomes were not keeping up with rising costs despite Trump’s insistence that inflation is “almost nonexsistent.”\n\nTrump’s personal performance numbers continue to plunge. The Journal’s poll found the president’s disapproval rating at 54 percent, its highest rating ever, while his issue-based polling numbers continue to drop and suggest that he now faces criticism from voters on topics like the economy and even immigration where historically the president has seen his highest trust ratings.\n\nOn border security, Trump enjoyed his only positive rating of any issue that the Journal asked about. On immigration more broadly the president was four points in the negative, and on the economy and trade policy the president was 10 points in the negative. On inflation, the percentage of voters who disapprove of Trump’s performance was 17 points higher, while 65 percent of respondents on the CBS poll gave him a disapproving grade in the same category.\n\nHis lowest marks came in response to his handling of health care in a poll that was conducted just days before the White House released the “Great Healthcare Plan”, a framework for legislation to respond to the expiration of subsidies for plans on the Affordable Care Act that drove premium prices lower for millions of Americans.\n\nLed by Trump, Republicans refused for months to negotiate with Democrats on an extension of the subsidies and now face the prospect of being unable to pass any legislation to replace them through the House and Senate.\n\nThese poll numbers follow criticism levied upon the president for months by some of his own followers and former allies. Skeptics of the president’s deep involvement in peace talks aimed at ending wars in Europe and Asia reacted with horror as the president escalated a deadly campaign of military strikes against small boats in the Caribbean to include a raid that resulted in the capture of Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s president, and his extradition to the United States on drug trafficking charges.\n\nNow, the president is publicly threatening military action to seize the territory of Greenland if Europe and Denmark in particular refuse to acquiesce to his desire to buy it.\n\nHe has also suggested repeatedly on Truth Social that he could use military force to intervene in Iran on behalf of anti-government protesters amid reports of hundreds slain by security forces. Trump told reporters Wednesday that he was informed that “the killing in Iran is stopping, and there’s no plan for executions,” suggesting that he would not launch an attack.\n\nThe president’s foreign policy remains broadly unpopular as a result, even though the Journal’s polling indicated that a slim majority approved of the raid to capture Maduro, who is now awaiting trial in New York. Nearly half of respondents supported the operation, and 47 percent opposed it.\n\nOn “foreign policy,” the president is 11 points in the negative in the Journal’s issue-based polling and his handling of Russia-Ukraine in particular is 14 points in the negative.\n\nWhen asked whether the president went “too far” in threatening the governments of Colombia, Cuba and other countries, 53 percent said yes.\n\nOnly 17 percent said the president was not going far enough, and 27 percent said the president’s warnings about further military action in Central and South America were on the money.\n\nVoters are wholly uninterested in getting involved in Iran. According to CBS, 67 percent of U.S. adults oppose the idea of using military force against the regime, while only 33 percent support that plan. \n\nOverall, the CBS poll found that 53 percent of Americans believe that Trump is too focused on events overseas.\n\nThe president was largely absent from shutdown negotiations in the fall, when Democrats attempted to force Republicans on board with an extension of health care subsidies for millions of Americans before the year-end deadline.\n\nAt the same time, then-Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly attacked her party for lacking a plan to deal with rising health insurance premiums and deductible costs. Republicans battled that criticism, but the White House shelved its own plans to call for an extension of the subsidies altogether.\n\nThe CBS poll was conducted between January 14-16, among 2,523 U.S. adults with a 2.3 percentage point margin of error. The Journal’s poll was conducted Jan. 8-13 among 1,500 registered voters, with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.","summary":"Trump is too focused on bullying Denmark and threatening war across the hemisphere, polls find","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-polls-economy-venezuela-iran-b2902866.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/16/18/43/SEI281035089.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HRCm6ZYs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-18 22:22:05","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":394020904,"title":"Keane warns Iran's leadership to take Trump 'at his word' as military assets move into region","text":"Retired Gen.

Witnesses and human rights groups have described government forces opening fire on protesters in the streets and from rooftops. More than 3,000 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA). CNN cannot independently verify this figure.\n\nOne protester in Tehran told CNN how waves of people from the capital had flooded the streets, unarmed, in recent days as government forces fired down from rooftops and military drones flew overhead.\n\n“They were aiming with lasers and shooting people in the face” the eye-witness said, speaking anonymously for security reasons.\n\n“They massacred people… They killed our most beautiful, most gorgeous and bravest, our kids.”\n\nThe Iranian government has often blamed “foreign” agents for the deadly protests in the country, without providing evidence.\n\n“By harming the people, they (the ‘rioters’) killed several thousand of them,” Khamenei said.\n\n“Some were killed with a force that was inhuman … completely savagely,” the Iranian leader continued. “These actions were part of the sedition’s pre-prepared blueprint.”\n\nThe protester in Tehran said protesters lit fires to counter teargas and blocked streets to prevent motorbike attacks by the Basij, Iran’s large volunteer paramilitary group established by Khamenei and often used to suppress demonstrations.\n\n“The only weapon the people had was stones which they didn’t even have a chance to throw,” they said.\n\n“I know there is a high chance I will be killed but I will still go because I want to take back Iran.”\n\nEarlier in the week, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi pushed back against the reported death toll of “thousands,” telling Fox News’ Bret Baier that the number was actually in the hundreds and that suggestions otherwise were part of a “misinformation campaign.”\n\nIn his Saturday speech, Khamenei declared that “the US must be held accountable.”\n\nDuring the unrest, Trump encouraged protesters to keep up the demonstrations and “take over” the country’s institutions, assuring them that “help is on its way.”\n\n“We consider the US President a criminal, both for the casualties and damage, and for the slander he leveled against the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said, according to a translation of speech excerpts on his website.\n\n‘A sick man’\n\nTrump responded swiftly, calling for new leadership in Iran and referring to Khamenei as a “sick man” who should “run his country properly and stop killing people.”\n\nIn a Saturday morning interview with Politico, Trump said Khamenei is guilty, “as the leader of a country,” of “the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before.”\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian came to Khamenei’s defense on Sunday, saying any aggression directed at the supreme leader would be seen as “all-out war” against Iran.\n\nKhamenei recognized in his Saturday speech that Iran’s economic situation is “truly difficult” but called for people to unite “in defending the Islamic system and beloved Iran.” He called on government officials to redouble their efforts in supplying essential goods, livestock feed and other essential commodities.\n\nCiting Monday’s pro-government rallies across Iran, Khamenei claimed Saturday that the protests have been “extinguished.”\n\nState of the Internet\n\nAmid the protests that were met with a violent crackdown by security forces, the Iranian government shut off internet connections on January 8. But on Saturday morning, there was a “slight rise” in connectivity, according to cybersecurity watchdog NetBlocks.\n\n“Overall connectivity remains at (about) 2% of ordinary levels and there is no indication of a significant return,” NetBlocks added in a statement on X.\n\nIran’s semi-official Mehr News Agency reported Saturday that the internet has been restored to “some subscribers,” saying the shutdown was enacted due to what it described as “terrorist unrest” and to “ensure the security of the country and its citizens.”\n\nSome international landline calls and local text messages also appeared to be working again, a Tehran resident told CNN on Saturday. Internet connection itself remains patchy in the country, the resident said.\n\nFate of the protesters\n\nIn the Saturday address, Iran’s supreme leader vowed consequences for those who took part in the “riots” but did not elaborate on what their punishments would be.\n\n“We will not lead the country into war, but we will not let go of the domestic criminals and — more importantly — the international criminals,” he said. “This matter must be pursued using our own methods and the correct approach.”\n\nMore than 24,000 protesters have been arrested, according to HRANA. CNN cannot independently verify that figure.\n\nBut fears mounted for the fate of some protesters after Tehran’s prosecutor said last week that some of them could face the death penalty for their actions, according to semi-official Tasnim News Agency.\n\nEarlier in the week, the State Department said Iranian authorities planned to execute one protester, Erfan Soltani. His family later said his execution was postponed, and Trump said he had received assurances that there was no plan for executions in Iran. Iran’s judiciary, though, said Soltani had not been sentenced to death.\n\nIn his interview with Fox News, Iran’s foreign minister also indicated that there were no plans to hang protesters.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments, Tehran Prosecutor Ali Salehi neither confirmed nor denied an intention to execute that many people. “Our response is firm, deterrent and swift,” he told Iranian state media.\n\n“At present, a large number of cases have resulted in indictments and have been referred to the courts,” he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2026 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The protests came as Trump announced new tariffs on several European countries until a deal is reached for his administration to control the island.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 Danes gathered at Copenhagen’s City Hall Square to push back against Trump’s threats, with many people in the crowd donning parody hats mimicking Trump’s signature, bright-red MAGA cap that instead reads “Make America Go Away.”\n\nThe caps also read “Nu det NUUK,” a play on Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, and means “Now it’s enough.” On the side of the cap is the Greenland flag and the country’s own spin on the MAGA slogan.ay. \n\nThe caps have become so popular they’re reportedly sold out in Denmark.\n\nLarge crowds of protesters wore the hats Saturday while chanting “Greenland is not for sale” while others held banners reading “Hands off Greenland” along with Greenland’s flag. \n\n“We have to support Greenland. We are Danes, Greenland are Danes, even though they’re Greenlanders, and we just have to stick together,” protester Susanne Kristensen told NBC News. Greenland is an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nSome of the demonstrators expressed fears over speaking out against Trump, worrying they may be barred from visiting the United States as a result. But others said they have no interest in visiting until Trump leaves office. \n\n“I won’t go there until he’s out,” Kristensen added, according to NBC News. \n\nAnother demonstrator, Almond, 57, told NBC that he had never protested before but felt he had “to do something.” \n\n“I’ve actually never done this before, demonstrating, but this is very important to me,” he said. \n\nThousands of Greenlanders trekked through snow in Nuuk Saturday to show support for their own self-governance, but just as they finished, Trump announced plans to charge a 10 percent import tax starting in February on goods from eight European countries that oppose his plans to take control of Greenland.\n\nThe bloc is also considering restricting US companies from its market in response to the threats, according to the Financial Times.\n\n“I thought this day couldn’t get any worse but it just did,” Malik Dollerup-Scheibel told the Associated Press during what many described as the island’s biggest protest, drawing in nearly a quarter of Nuuk’s population. “It just shows he has no remorse for any kind of human being now.”\n\nRallies were also held across the Danish realm, as well as in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut in Canada’s far north. \n\nTrump says Greenland would be key to U.S. security due to its strategic location — and he has not ruled out using U.S. military using force to take it.\n\nAs a result, European nations last week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark’s request. \n\nGreenland, which is home to some 57,000 people, has been governed from Copenhagen for centuries. While it has gained significant autonomy, it remains part of Denmark, which oversees its defense and largely funds its administration.\n\nApproximately 17,000 Greenlanders live in Denmark, according to Danish authorities. \n\nAll parties in Greenland’s parliament favor its independence and prefer remaining a part of Denmark rather than the U.S., according to Reuters. \n\nMeanwhile, only 17 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, with large majorities of Democrats and Republicans opposing using military force to take the island, according to Reuters.","summary":"Thousands of people turned out across Denmark and Greenland to protest Trump’s efforts to seize the island","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/greenland-maga-hat-make-america-go-away-b2902855.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/18/18/38/TOPSHOT-DENMARK-GREENLAND-POLITICS-DIPLOMACY-s3bfq9lm.jpeg?crop=8392.5,5595,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a0WHNL58-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-18 21:21:28","author":"Isabel Keane","authors":["Isabel Keane"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":394018728,"title":"Trump's voice in new Fannie Mae ad generated by AI, with his permission","text":"New York, Jan 19 (AP) What sounds like US President Donald Trump narrating a new Fannie Mae ad actually is an AI-cloned voice reading text, according to a disclaimer in the video.\nThe voice in the ad, created with permission from the Trump administration, promises an “all new Fannie Mae” and calls the institution the “protector of the American Dream”.\nThe ad comes as the administration is making a big push to show voters it is responding to their concerns about affordability, including in the housing market.\nTrump plans to talk about housing at his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where world leaders and corporate executives meet this week.\nThis isn’t the first time a member of the Trump family has used AI to replicate their voice, First Lady Melania Trump recently employed AI technology firm Eleven Labs to help voice the audio version of her memoir.\nIt’s not known who cloned President Trump’s voice for the Fannie Mae ad.\nLast month, Trump pledged in a prime-time address that he would roll out “some of the most aggressive housing reform plans in American history”.\n“For generations, home ownership meant security, independence, and stability,” Trump’s digitised voice says in the one-minute ad aired Sunday.\n“But today, that dream feels out of reach for too many Americans not because they stopped working hard but because the system stopped working for them.” Fannie Mae and its counterpart Freddie Mac, which have been under government control since the Great Recession, buy mortgages that meet their risk criteria from banks, which helps provide liquidity for the housing market.\nThe two firms guarantee roughly half of the USD 13 trillion US home loan market and are a bedrock of the US economy.\nThe ad says Fannie Mae will work with the banking industry to approve more would-be homebuyers for mortgages.\nTrump, Bill Pulte, who leads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and others have said they want to sell shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a major stock exchange but no concrete plans have been set.\nTrump and Pulte have also floated extending the 30-year mortgage to 50 years in order to lower monthly payments.\nTrump appeared to back off the proposal after critics said a longer-term loan would reduce people’s ability to create housing equity and increase their own wealth.\nTrump also said on social media earlier this month that he was directing the federal government to buy USD 200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are anxious about home prices. Trump said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have USD 200 billion in cash that will be used to make the purchase.\nEarlier this month, Trump also said he wants to block large institutional investors from buying houses, saying a ban would make it easier for younger families to buy their first homes.\nTrump’s permission for the use of AI is interesting given that he has complained about aides in the previous Joe Biden administration using autopen to apply the former president’s signature to laws, pardons or executive orders. An autopen is a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person’s authentic signature.\nHowever, a report issued by the House Republicans does not include any concrete evidence that autopen was used to sign Biden’s name without his knowledge.

U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt also gave an address, which focused on the importance of gender equality.\n\nOn Saturday, the UNGA — which has since moved to New York City — celebrated its 80th birthday in the same London Methodist hall, near the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. This time, attendees addressed global uncertainty during the second term of President Trump.\n\n\"2025 was a profoundly challenging year for international cooperation and the values of the UN. Aid was slashed. Inequalities widened. Climate chaos accelerated. International law was trampled,\" said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres in his speech.\n\nGuterres highlighted the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, calling them \"vicious and cruel beyond measure.\" He also raised alarm at the high levels of military spending around the world.\n\nIn recent weeks, Guterres has warned that many U.N. agencies are underfunded, with more than half of countries failing to pay their agreed contributions – including the United States. That limits the U.N.'s work, which includes distributing humanitarian aid, and helping tackle climate change.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump issued an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from 66 international organizations, including 31 U.N. agencies.\n\nGuterres, who is in his final year in the job, has repeatedly criticized Russia for violating the U.N. Charter by invading Ukraine in February 2022. He also has criticized the United States for its military operation in Venezuela to capture President Nicolás Maduro, and its deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.\n\n\"We should not, even at anniversaries, sugarcoat that the United Nations and its principles are not only under pressure, but under heavy attack,\" said Annalena Baerbock, president of the U.N. General Assembly, in her speech. \"Not all of us are singing from the same songbook anymore.\"\n\nBaerbock, who is German, said she took inspiration from the optimism from the founders of the U.N. General Assembly 80 years ago. \"As much as the world needs the United Nations today, the United Nations currently needs you to stand up for it, to defend it, and to get engaged with it,\" she said.\n\nAfterwards, experts spoke in panels about the issues of the day, from global peace to gender equality. Among the speakers at the event was Lord Robertson, a former British politician, who used to be secretary general of NATO.\n\n\"We face the prospect of going back to the era before the United Nations, and that was a wild world where disputes between nations were usually resolved by war and by conflict rather than through deliberation and negotiation,\" Robertson told NPR.\n\nRobertson will also celebrate his 80th birthday this year — just like Trump — and he said that while the U.N. can be slow and bureaucratic, it has helped make the world safer during his lifetime.\n\n\"We need to somehow make sure that [China's] President Xi, [North Korea's] President Kim Jong Un, the ayatollahs in Iran and President Donald J. Trump recognize that multilateralism is in the interests of all of us,\" Robertson said. \"The alternative is a return to open warfare and a Wild West of international relations.\"","summary":"On Saturday, the UNGA celebrated its 80th birthday in London.

President Donald Trump and others in his administration have defended the agent, identified as Jonathan Ross, saying his life was in danger and that Good “weaponized” her vehicle against him. Some Democratic lawmakers and others have described Good’s killing as “murder” and called for the agent to be prosecuted.\n\nNoem also appeared to confirm that Ross was put on three standard days of administrative leave following the shooting. \n\n“We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration,” Noem told CBS News Sunday. \n\n“There always is [a review of the actions]. Every law enforcement officer knows that when they step up and take the oath to defend the public.”\n\nAlso on Sunday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, said in a separate interview that the FBI is not investigating the shooting of Good. Blanche previously told The Independent that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.”\n\nGood’s killing has sparked ongoing protests in Minnesota with thousands of immigration enforcement agents surged to the state in response. \n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, have criticized the Trump administration for shutting state authorities out of the investigation into Good’s death and for the large federal presence on their streets. \n\nNoem fired back Sunday at remarks made by Walz, who claimed that Ross was the “only one” not under investigation for Good’s death. Frey and Walz are reportedly facing a Department of Justice investigation for allegedly obstructing the efforts of federal immigration authorities in the state.\n\n“I would not listen to Gov. Walz, he has a very bad track record,” Noem said. “I’m not going to be taking any advice from him on how we implement the law and protect people.”\n\nBrennan also asked about the officer’s condition, after DHS claimed that Ross sustained “internal bleeding” during the incident on January 7, drawing admonishment from Noem.\n\n“Tell me about the officer, Jonathan Ross,” Brennan asked. “He was struck; he was hospitalized.”\n\nNoem replied: “Don't say his name. I mean for heaven's sakes, we shouldn't have people continue to dox law enforcement when they have an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against them.”\n\nHowever, a new report from NewsNation cited senior Trump administration officials who said it was Noem who was originally responsible for key details about the agent’s background being released, that led to him being identified.

He pointed out that American presidents have pursued the island for more than a century.\n\nThe United States already has a longstanding treaty with Denmark, which allows the U.S. government to operate as many military bases on the island as it sees fit.\n\nThe White House has intensified efforts to incorporate Greenland into the United States in recent weeks, capping a whirlwind first year in which Trump sought to reassert U.S. influence across the Western Hemisphere, with the possibility of trying to buy the island from Denmark of putting American boots on the ground.\n\n“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday, claiming that Russia and China will take over absent American action. “Anything less than that is unacceptable.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt recently said that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option.”\n\nThis week, senior administration officials met at the White House with emissaries from Denmark and Greenland, which the Europeans characterized as unproductive. After the summit, Trump announced plans to slap a 10 percent tariff on Denmark and other European nations, which will be “payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.”\n\nEuropean and NATO allies have wholeheartedly opposed Trump’s attempt to acquire the Danish territory.\n\nOn Sunday, eight European nations — including the U.K., France and Denmark — released a joint statement condemning the president’s latest levies, claiming they “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\nOn Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron released a statement appearing to compare Trump’s Greenland threats to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us — neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote on X.\n\nEuropean officials are now weighing a response to Trump’s latest tariffs. This week, a European Parliament member said the E.U. will reject a 15 percent tariff deal negotiated with Trump last summer.\n\nA number of other high-profile Republicans have denounced Trump’s attempts to seize the island.\n\nRep. Michael McCaul, a former chair of the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security committees, warned that a military invasion of the island would “press a war with NATO itself.”\n\n“It would end up abolishing NATO as we know it,” he told ABC’s This Week Sunday.\n\nRep. Mike Turner, a former president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, said Trump’s attempts to acquire Greenland is “not art of the deal,” referencing the president’s book.\n\n“This is more the dating game,” he told CBS Face the Nation Sunday. “This certainly isn’t the type of language that someone should be using and trying to ask someone to join you in a partnership.”\n\n“There’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said earlier this week.\n\nKentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, Thune’s predecessor, said that military action against the territory would be “an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm,” which would risk “incinerating” NATO alliances.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, also traveled to Copenhagen this week to reassure Danish officials that U.S. military action lacks congressional support. \n\nMany congressional Republicans, though, have offered Trump their full-throated support.\n\n\"When it comes to Greenland, I want to commend President Trump for being single-mindedly focused on America first,” Texas Senator Ted Cruz told Fox News Sunday. “I believe it is overwhelmingly in America's national interest to acquire Greenland ... The whole history of America has been a history of acquiring new lands and new territories.”\n\nPolls show that there is little public appetite for taking over Greenland, with a recent Ipsos survey revealing that just 17 percent of Americans support Trump’s plan. \n\nAt the same time, support for such an acquisition — which would dwarf the Louisiana Purchase — is even more muted in Greenland, where protests have erupted with a call that the island is “not for sale.”\n\nA poll commissioned by Danish newspaper Berlingske last January found just 6 percent of Greenlanders would support joining the U.S.","summary":"Former VP and other GOP officials warn against president’s threats that risk ‘fracturing’ NATO alliances","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mike-pence-greenland-republicans-trump-b2902833.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/18/20/13/Screenshot-2026-01-18-at-3-26-44-PM.png?crop=1909.5,1273,x405.1,y3.4&trim=3,611,357,405&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a0WHNL58-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-18 20:18:17","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":394012824,"title":"Wall Street ends little changed before long weekend","text":"US stocks ended nearly flat on Friday in a choppy session ahead of the ‍long weekend, and all three major indexes posted losses for the week as fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off.\n\nHealthcare fell 0.8 per cent and led declines for the day among S&P 500 ​sectors.

Renzo Humanchumo Castillo, a Peruvian- American who was detained for close to a year by Venezuelan authorities, told Fox News Digital that his Venezuelan wife, Rosa Carolina Chirino Zambrano, as well as her friend and the taxi driver they were with, were released after being imprisoned and charged with espionage due to their contact with him. He spoke with Zambrano following her release, he said, their first contact since December 2024 when they were confronted by Venezuelan authorities near the country's border with Colombia. TRUMP PLANS TO MEET WITH VENEZUELA OPPOSITION LEADER MARIA CORINA MACHADO NEXT WEEK \"It was surreal,\" Castillo recalled of the conversation. \"She got teary, you know, but she was like… 'hey baby, I'm out.' Now my main concern is how do I get her here with me.\" Castillo, who lives in Southern California, was detained after crossing the border into Venezuela, along with his wife and her friend, who were in a taxi. After being questioned at length by Venezuelan authorities, he was charged with terrorism and conspiring to kill Nicolas Maduro, then the country's president, who was recently captured by U.S. forces in a daring military operation. \"They got me as a professional hitman sent by the CIA, and (that) I was there to overthrow the government and kill Maduro and Diosdado (Cabello),\" Castillo said. Diosdado Cabello, known as the \"octopus,\" runs Venezuela's security apparatus and is considered one of the country's most feared government figures. The U.S. has accused him of narco-terrorism and several other crimes. The State Department has issued a $25 million reward for his arrest and conviction. \"Cabello, he presented me on the news, and then he put me on a chart saying that I came here to overthrow the government,\" Castillo said. \"Me and some other Americans.\" After spending months in Venezuela's notorious \"El Rodeo\" prison, Castillo was freed in a prisoner swap in July 2025. However, his wife remained in detention. FROM SANCTIONS TO SEIZURE: WHAT MADURO'S CAPTURE MEANS FOR VENEZUELA’S ECONOMY Castillo said he was initially questioned by Venezuelan authorities who accused him of being a \"commando\" or some kind of military operator. A search of his cell phone only heightened their suspicions when they found images of him wearing a protective vest and other tactical gear. However, Castillo said he works in private security and executive protection and has never served in the military. The gear was used for work, he said. He was eventually detained and transferred to \"El Rodeo\" where he endured beatings and other forms of torture, he said. In one instance, he was hung by his arms like a piñata and beaten. \"They had me hanging. And like my feet were still kind of touching the floor,\" he said. \"They just hit me for maybe at least five to eight hours, just hanging… just not even questions anymore. But you can feel the joy, how much they wanted to hit me, hurt me, you know?\" Castillo got in trouble several times while at the prison, he said, for speaking out of a window in his cell where he would sometimes get updates on events outside the facility. Stressed about not knowing what happened to his wife, he went on a hunger strike in an effort to write a letter to her, he said. TRUMP TO MEET WITH VENEZUELA’S OPPOSITION LEADER AFTER PRAISING ‘TERRIFIC’ MADURO LOYALIST Castillo met Zambrano during a visit to Peru to reunite with old classmates from grade school. One night, he went to a bar with friends where the pair met and struck up a friendship. That was followed by multiple trips to Peru, where she lived, before they got married. On his last journey, the couple met in Colombia and traveled via road to her home country to meet his in-laws for the first time, Castillo said. After crossing the Colombia-Venezuela border, they were separately detained and their misfortune began. Since Zambrano is a Venezuelan citizen, she was not part of the prisoner swap that freed her husband. Despite now being free, she remains under the watchful eye of the Venezuelan government, Castillo said. In the meantime, Castillo is working to get Zambrano to California. He said he plans to reach out to the State Department. Despite his wife's citizenship status, his optimism heightened following Maduro's capture earlier this month. \"It was that moment when, inside of me, I felt I was going to be able to see my wife again,\" he said. \"The chances of me seeing my wife again just went from like, from nothing to like a hundred. It really lifted my spirit.\" 3 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM TRUMP'S PUSH TO PUT US OIL FIRMS BACK IN VENEZUELA \"It took Americans and it took foreigners to be kidnapped for the world to put eyes on Venezuela,\" he said. On Tuesday, Venezuela's interim government released at least four Americans imprisoned during Maduro's regime. The release was the first involving U.S. citizens since Maduro's capture by U.S. forces. \"We welcome the release of detained Americans in Venezuela,\" a State Department official said Tuesday. \"This is an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities.\" On Wednesday, Acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez said she spoke with President Donald Trump by phone during a \"long and courteous\" conversation. The pair discussed a \"bilateral work agenda for the benefit of our peoples, as well as pending matters between our governments.\" On Truth Social, Trump said topics of discussion included oil, minerals, trade and national security.

Reagimi nga izraelitët erdhi pas njoftimit të së shtunës të Bordit Ekzekutiv të komitetit për Gazën, i cili përfshin ministrin e jashtëm turk dhe një zyrtar të Katarit, ish-kryeministrin e Mbretërisë së Bashkuar Tony Blair dhe dhëndrin e Trump, Jared Kushner.\n\nBordi i Paqes, i cili është pjesë e planit 20-pikësh të Trump për t'i dhënë fund luftës Izrael-Hamas, pritet të mbikëqyrë përkohësisht drejtimin e Gazës dhe të menaxhojë rindërtimin e saj. Struktura e saktë mbetet e paqartë, ndërsa dy organe të larta të ndara janë zbuluar zyrtarisht, të dyja nën Bordin kryesor të Paqes.\n\nNjëri është \"Bordi Ekzekutiv themelues\", me një fokus të nivelit të lartë në investime dhe diplomaci. Tjetri, \"Bordi Ekzekutiv i Gazës\", është përgjegjës për mbikëqyrjen e të gjithë punës në terren të një grupi tjetër administrativ, Komitetit Kombëtar për Administrimin e Gazës (NCAG).\n\nDeri më tani, i vetmi anëtar izraelit në Bordin Ekzekutiv të Gazës është Yakir Gabay, një biznesmen i lindur në Izrael dhe që tani jeton në Qipro. Shtetas palestinezë nuk ka në asnjërin bord të lartë.\n\nMinistri i Sigurisë Kombëtare i Izraelit, i ekstremit të djathtë, Itamar Ben-Gvir, shkroi në X: \"Rripi i Gazës nuk ka nevojë për ndonjë komitet administrativ për të mbikëqyrur rehabilitimin e tij - ai duhet të pastrohet nga terroristët e Hamasit\".\n\nZyrtarë nga Katari dhe Turqia, të cilët kanë qenë kritikë ndaj veprimeve ushtarake të Izraelit në Gaza, janë konfirmuar anëtarë të panelit këshillues. Bordi Gjithëpërfshirës i Paqes do të përbëhet nga udhëheqës botërorë, me Presidentin Trump si kryetar të tij.\n\nOKB-ja vlerëson se rreth 80% e ndërtesave në Gaza janë shkatërruar ose dëmtuar dhe familjet që i kanë mbijetuar luftës tani po përballen me motin e dimrit dhe mungesën e ushqimit dhe strehimit.\n\nOlga Cherevko nga zyra e koordinimit të ndihmës së OKB-së tha se shpërndarja e toneve të ndihmës dhe riparimi i rrugëve në muajt që nga hyrja në fuqi e armëpushimit ishin më shumë një \"ndihmë e përkohshme\" sesa një zgjidhje. Izraeli thotë se po lehtëson ndihmën humanitare dhe ka fajësuar OKB-në për dështimin në shpërndarjen e furnizimeve që janë tashmë në Gaza. Ai argumenton se çdo kufizim është i projektuar për të ndaluar Hamasin të infiltrojë dhe të shfrytëzojë përpjekjet e ndihmës. /CNA","url":"https://www.cna.al/kosova-bota/izraeli-kundershton-zgjedhjet-e-trump-per-drejtuesit-e-bordit-te-paq-i452567","image":"https://media.cna.al/cna.al/media3/-1200-630-1768765944x9de0a540-f47d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ffjpg-1-643.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-18 19:45:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"al","sentiment":-0.88}]}
