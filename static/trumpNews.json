Wade era. Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care. In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mike Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said, “There can be no place for extremism in women’s health care.” In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows, “I have always supported women’s access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.” And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says, “I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.” It’s a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women’s lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions. The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans’ campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP’s failure to grasp the political power of women’s reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters. “The Republicans have always known they’re actually on the wrong side of this issue,” said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party’s shift “wouldn’t surprise me.” With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women’s access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades. On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it’s best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He’s also distanced himself from the far right’s longtime goal of a national abortion ban. With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party’s ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president’s ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer: “We are not going back.” The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration. Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. Voters didn’t always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement’s push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November’s promised “red wave” of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority. By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That’s an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision. In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares: “I’m pro-choice.” Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars “lying about Republican candidates’ positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.” “Republicans can’t let Democrats lie any longer — they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.” Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views — past and present. “Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,” said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats. House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars’ worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races. Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris’ example. Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed, “We’ll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.” Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions. Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court — a historic accomplishment — during the former president’s term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority. First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans. One of the nation’s leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide. But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue. “Voters have a right to know where I stand,” Lawler said.

Among the posts Robinson is accused of making on the site, \"Nude Africa,\" includes one where he called himself \"a black NAZI.\" In another post, made during the Obama administration, Robinson allegedly wrote, \"I'd take Hitler over any of the sh** that's in Washington right now!\"Robinson is the first black lieutenant governor of North Carolina and is running with former President Donald Trump's endorsement. Some Republicans have called on Robinson to suspend his candidacy by the state's deadline at the end of the day Thursday, although he has said that he intends to remain in the race.When reached for comment, Robinson's campaign directed Newsweek to the lieutenant governor's video message shared to social media, in which he called CNN's story \"tabloid trash\" and denied being behind the comments.Stein, on the other hand, is running with the backing of current North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat and surrogate for Vice President Kamala Harris who has reached his two-term limit in office. Stein has held the lead for weeks in the race against Cooper, including in a poll released Thursday by Emerson College and The Hill, which found that 48 percent of likely voters support the Democrat.In comparison, Robison earned 40 percent of likely voters' support, while 10 percent of the 1,000 respondents said they were undecided. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points and was conducted between September 15 and 18.Earlier in the month, in a poll by Quinnipiac University, Stein was leading the race 51 percent to 41 percent, based on the responses of 940 voters between September 4 to 8. A Fox News poll conducted between August 23 to 26 gave Stein an even greater lead, finding that the Democrat was leading Robinson 54 percent to 43 percent out of 1,000 registered voters.Newsweek reached out to Stein's campaign for further comment Thursday evening.Robinson has been caught making inflammatory comments prior to Thursday's report from CNN. In a 2019 Facebook post, the GOP candidate said that abortion in America was about \"killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down.\" In 2021, prior to being elected lieutenant governor in 2022, Robinson described \"homosexuality\" and \"transgenderism\" as \"filth\" while speaking before a church.Cooper told Politico back in August that he had withdrawn from being considered for Harris' running mate because he feared that Robinson could build momentum in North Carolina in his absence.\"If I were to be out of state at a campaign event, if I had been the vice-presidential nominee, he could claim he was acting governor,\" Cooper said at the time.","summary":"Polling shows that Stein, a Democrat, is leading in the polls for North Carolina's next governor.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/josh-stein-chances-beating-mark-robinson-polls-1956683","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476448/josh-steins-chances-beating-mark-robinson.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:54:53","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":256828990,"title":"‘Uncommitted’ Pro-Palestine Voting Group Says It Won’t Endorse Harris, ‘Opposes’ Trump Presidency","text":"A pro-Palestine group that pushed for thousands of “uncommitted” votes against the president in Michigan’s primary election has said it will not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris even as it urges voters to reject former President Donald Trump. The group added that it “opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing.” The Uncommitted National Movement is also urging its supporters against voting for third-party candidates, seeing that as another path to a Trump victory. The pro-Palestine group is frustrated that Harris did not respond by its self-imposed Sept. 15 deadline to meet with Palestinian American families who have lost loved ones during the Israel–Hamas war or to discuss plans to block arms shipments to Israel. They also pushed for a Palestinian speaker at August’s Democratic National Convention (DNC), which never came to fruition. “For months, we have urged Vice President Harris to shift her Gaza policy so we could mobilize voters in key states to save lives and our democracy. The DNC and the Vice President’s campaign fumbled even a small gesture to unite our party ahead of November by rejecting the simple request of a Palestinian American speaker,” the group added. Michigan is a critical battleground in the race for the Electoral College. Previously considered part of the “blue wall” of northern states that have leaned toward Democrats in recent decades, Trump won the state in 2016 by roughly 10,000 votes, but Joe Biden won it back in 2020 with a margin of more than 2 percent. That Democratic support, however, saw cracks in February when more than 100,000 people cast “uncommitted” votes against Biden in Michigan’s presidential primary to protest his military and humanitarian support for Israel. The state has one of the country’s largest populations of Arab American voters. The “uncommitted” campaign was continued in other states nationwide throughout the 2024 presidential primary cycle. While Harris has recently been empathetic about the situation for Palestinians in Gaza, she has remained committed to Biden’s foreign policies and has said she supports Israel’s “ability to defend itself” while pushing for a hostage and cease-fire deal. “We are doing the work of putting the pressure on all parties involved to get the deal done … And I support the need for Palestinians to have dignity, self-determination, and security as we move forward and get a two-state deal done,” she said during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia on Sept. 17.","summary":"Earlier this year, 100,000 voters in Michigan cast 'uncommitted' votes in the Democratic primary.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/uncommitted-pro-palestine-voting-group-says-it-wont-endorse-harris-opposes-trump-presidency-5727039","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/25/id5637576-Michigan-Uncommitted-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:50:36","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":256828392,"title":"Harris, Oprah to campaign in Detroit","text":"Harris, Oprah to campaign in Detroit Oprah Winfrey will join Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Detroit, Michigan, Thursday.

Messages tied to Robinson on the site also expressed his proclivity for \"tranny on girl\" porn.Robinson has refused to drop out of the race, potentially harming Trump's hopes of winning the Tar Heel State, which is considered a battleground this year despite leaning Republican in recent election cycles.Additionally, a Michigan judge ruled on Wednesday that Robert F.

Zelenskyy will also meet US Vice President Kamala Harris. During the meeting, the leaders will discuss the state of war between Russia and Ukraine, including Kyiv’s strategy planning and the US’ support for Ukraine’s defence against Russia amid the ongoing war. In a statement, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “On Thursday, September 26, President Biden will meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine at the White House. Vice President Harris will also meet separately with President Zelenskyy at the White House.”“The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine’s strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. The President and Vice President will emphasize their unshakeable commitment to stand with Ukraine until it prevails in this war,” she added. During his meeting with Biden, Zelenskyy will present Ukraine’s Plan for Victory. The Ukrainian President expects to discuss the details of this plan and the US’ support for Ukraine in its right to freedom. He will address the United Nations General Assembly and meet world leaders on the sidelines of UNGA. In a statement, the Ukrainian President’s Office stated, “Next week, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the United States. The President of Ukraine will address the UN General Assembly and meet with representatives of American defense and energy companies, and the Ukrainian community. The Head of State will hold bilateral negotiations with leaders of countries and international organizations on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.”“Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with US President Joe Biden to present the Plan for Victory.

During his visit, Ukraine’s President will meet representatives of the US Congress from both parties and former US President Donald Trump.It is pertinent to note that the US has been providing assistance to Ukraine since its war with Russia began in 2022. The United States has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Earlier this month, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that Biden will meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his counterpart from Ukraine, this month, and that Washington is preparing a “substantial” round of further help for Kyiv.“I do think we need a comprehensive strategy for success in this war, and that is what President Zelenskyy says he is bringing,” Sullivan said.Notably, Sullivan delivered his remarks via videolink at the Yalta European Strategy conference in Kyiv, Al Jazeera reported.“So we are very much looking forward to sitting down and talking that through, and President Biden is eager for that conversation,” he said.Sullivan said that the recent events in the region are of “unique concern.” In addition, the White House advisor stated that Biden is attempting to place Ukraine in the “best possible position to prevail” in his remaining months in office, Al Jazeera reported. Notably, Biden is not running for reelection, and his tenure expires in January.“President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those negotiations,” he said.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/09/us-president-biden-to-meet-ukrainian-counterpart-zelenskyy-next-week-discuss-war-situation-white-house/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/us-president-biden-to-meet-ukrainian-counterpart-zelenskyy-next-week-discuss-war-situation-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:31:18","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.162},{"id":256827928,"title":"Election authorities in swing states refute claims of noncitizen voting","text":"ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Battleground state election officials from both parties are pushing back against a falsehood that has proven pervasive ahead of the 2024 reaction: that noncitizens are voting in widespread numbers. Secretaries of state, election directors, and county officials from six swing states detailed how they ensure that only Americans vote in presidential elections during a conference aimed at stressing the integrity and functionality of the country’s election system. The comments came as former President Donald Trump and his GOP allies have talked up efforts to crack down on noncitizens voting, which is already illegal. “I worked for years researching the noncitizen issue, and found that it occurred very, very, very infrequently,” said Al Schmidt, the Republican secretary of the commonwealth in Pennsylvania, detailing his review of the voter rolls in Philadelphia, where he served as an election commissioner, and later the commonwealth itself. The handful of noncitizens who did appear on the voter rolls had registered when interacting with the Department of Transportation. Schmidt said they changed the computer screen prompts so that noncitizens wouldn’t be asked if they wanted to register to vote, and went on to verify the citizenship status of those who had registered despite data indicating they were a noncitizen at one point. In Michigan, automatic voter registration ensures that voters who are providing documentation to get their driver’s license “are showing whether or not they’re citizens and if they are, if they, for example, present a green card or some other document that shows they’re not a citizen, they’re marked in our state voter registration database,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Benson, a Democrat, said the “myth of noncitizen voting” was part of a broader “narrative” being pushed that there are ineligible voters on the rolls. “There is an effort to promote a narrative that somehow there are scores of ineligible voters registered, ineligible people on our registration list,” Benson said, citing a spate of lawsuits alleging bloated voter rolls in battleground states. “And then related to that, of course, is that the myth of noncitizens participating in federal elections.” The officials — brought together by longtime election lawyers Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg and nonprofits Keep Our Republic and Pillars of The Community, which seek to support the American election system — spent hours Thursday talking about everything from voter registration to result certification. In Arizona, voters must show documentary proof of citizenship to cast a ballot in state elections; those who don’t show proof but swear to their citizenship are able to vote in federal elections. A system quirk recently discovered nearly 100,000 Arizona residents who registered to vote before the documentary proof of citizenship requirement was required. Maricopa County has sued seeking clarity on whether those voters can vote in state and local elections this fall. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, stressed the proactive audits his office has taken to verify citizenship. He advised other states to implement photo ID requirements and constitutional amendments that would explicitly state that only citizens can vote. “We can say there’s not noncitizen voting, but it’s out there,” he said of the narrative. “And so over 20 months ago, I was the first person in the country that do a 100% citizenship verification of our voting rolls.” Raffensperger said his efforts help voters trust the integrity of the election. “When I come back to my fellow Georgians and say, folks, noncitizens are not voting here in Georgia, we’re finishing up our second audit. We’ll have that result in a few weeks, so that we can have high confidence that only American citizens are voting in our elections,” he said. Republicans at the national and state level have fueled unfounded noncitizen voting claims in the run-up to this year’s presidential election. House Speaker Mike Johnson has championed legislation to require documentary proof of citizenship nationally, while Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has made baseless claims of millions of migrants registering the vote. Election officials said Thursday they were taking steps to debunk conspiracy theories ahead of the 2024 election. Some said they’re producing elections differently this year, hoping to undermine misinformation before it begins by considering the optics and visuals in their work. “Sometimes it’s just good procedure, and it increases your transparency too, when you effectively label containers so that they know what’s in that container, especially if it’s not a clear container,” said Karen Brinson Bell, North Carolina’s top elections official. “It’s just taking steps to think about, how do we convey the checks and balances and the processes that we have in place?” Not all conspiracy theories can be prevented, though, countered Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer. A conservative blog has repeatedly reported based on the county’s livestreams that Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a state official, was inside the county’s tabulation center, though she was not. (In Arizona, tabulation is done at the county level.) “I talked to HR about this, and I said, can we just keep out any lady with sort of shorter length, light brown hair? And we were told we couldn’t do that,” joked Richer, a Republican. Still, he said, county staff try not to make “unforced errors” by doing anything that might be misconstrued — like bringing pens into the tabulator center or entering the ballot counting area alone. “We kind of operate under the tagline that perception is the new reality,” said Kim Pytleski, a clerk from Oconto County, Wisconsin. “We act intentionally, when we’re doing things at the polling place. So when we’re breaking a seal, which is part of our protocol to do, we are being vocal about it: ‘We’re breaking seal 1234.'”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. — Battleground state election officials from both parties are&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Election authorities in swing states refute claims of noncitizen voting first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/election-authorities-in-swing-states-refute-claims-of-noncitizen-voting/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Battleground-state-election-officials-push-back-against.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:27:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":256828558,"title":"Democrat Nearly Doubles Lead in Arizona Senate Race, Poll Shows","text":"Democratic Arizona Senate candidate Ruben Gallego has nearly doubled his lead over Republican candidate Kari Lake for independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema's soon-to-be vacant seat, according to the two most recent Morning Consult state polls.The latest Morning Consult poll of 474 likely voters was conducted primarily after the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, from September 9 to September 18.

That advantage is now completely gone.\" As for why this is happening, he argued, \"Some of it is culture, some of it is Trump‘s macho brand, a lot of it is the economy.\" He also noted that young men’s college enrollment is down and their involvement in the labor force lags behind, even compared to a few years ago. \"And then on top of that, you have the anti-wokeism, and the pronoun stuff, and the things that just appeal to young men- and then Donald Trump, he plays golf with Bryson DeChambeau, he goes on Theo Von, he talks about ZYNs,\" Hamby added. Democrats, he argued, have failed to appeal to young men in the same way. \"And, you know, Democrats, I‘m sorry, like, they haven‘t had a cool guy candidate in a while,\" he said, adding that while Walz can appeal to men, a lot of them are the kind of male voters who wear \"The Future is Female\" shirts and are already going to vote Democrat. GEN Z INFLUENCERS RAVE ABOUT TRUMP VP PICK JD VANCE: ‘HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN OVER MY GENERATION’ Bash noted that the Harris campaign hasn’t given up entirely on young men, playing a \"White Dudes for Harris\" commercial being used in a $10-million ad buy on digital platforms. Washington Post national politics reporter Maeve Reston noted that the ad is centered on economic issues in a way that appeals to younger men. But, citing her own experience on the ground, she said, \"It was really striking at her rallies, like, just looking out into that crowd and seeing how female it is.\" Reston described it as being difficult at Harris rallies to find men to talk to \"because there was a lot of those guys that are, like, in ‘The Future Is Female’ shirt that were brought there by their wives. But it wasn‘t the same thing as like any Obama campaign, for example, where you had sort of like the curious onlookers that were last in the room, kind of checking her out.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"White men are not a monolith, to borrow a phrase,\" Hamby said. \"A White suburban guy outside of Philly might care about crime, a reason Kamala Harris is struggling in Pennsylvania. She‘s doing worse among White college-educated men in the suburbs than Biden did in 2020.\" Wisconsin, he argued, is another story, claiming White men there vote more like the type of man who wears a \"The Future is Female\" shirt. He said that White college-educated men in places like Madison tend to vote for Democrats at \"North Korea-level margins.\" \"There are different kinds of voters in these different states,\" he added. \"The race is very close and all these states are very different.\"","summary":"Journalist Peter Hamby spoke on CNN about how former President Trump is successfully appealing to young men in a way the Democratic Party is failing to do.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/journalist-tells-cnn-democrats-advantage-young-men-completely-gone","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/Puck-News-journo.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 23:21:27","author":"Alexander Hall","authors":["Alexander Hall"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":256827980,"title":"New poll shows Harris with edge in key battleground state","text":"New poll shows Harris with edge in key battleground state New polling from the New York Times shows Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump deadlocked nationally, but the vice president has the edge in the closely-watched battleground state of Pennsylvania.

The agent opened fire, but the suspect escaped, before being arrested nearby. Neither Trump, nor anyone he was with, were harmed. And there's a lot we still don't know about the 58-year-old who's now in custody, charged with gun offences. But the awful sense of deja vu over what was quickly assessed as a second apparent attempt in two months to take the former president's life doesn't just prompt concerns about the level of protection he's being provided with. It also raises troubling questions about the ongoing threat posed by political violence in the United States. A blame game Trump avoided casting political blame in the immediate aftermath of the first assassination attempt, in Pennsylvania, briefly arguing that he wanted to use the moment to work towards national unity. But he didn't hold back this time, telling Fox News the suspect \"believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it\". \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country — both from the inside and out,\" he said. Trump had last week argued in his debate with Vice-President Kamala Harris that he \"probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me\". \"They talk about democracy, 'I'm a threat to democracy'. They're the threat to democracy,\" he said. Democrats have repeatedly argued a second Trump term would threaten US democracy, pointing to his handling of the January 6 Capitol attack and to comments such as his statement that he wouldn't be a dictator, \"other than day one\". Both President Joe Biden and Harris expressed relief that the former president wasn't injured in the latest incident, and they each spoke to him on the phone in the days afterwards. But the vice-president later criticised Trump over his own rhetoric, accusing him of \"spewing lies\" in relation to unfounded claims that migrants are eating pets in Springfield, Ohio. \"We've got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America engaging in that hateful rhetoric that, as usual, is designed to divide us as a country,\" she told an event hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). Authorities in Springfield have reported more than 30 bomb threat hoaxes since rumours, amplified by Trump on the debate stage, took hold, prompting police officers to be deployed to local schools. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said many of the threats had come from an unnamed foreign country, and were being treated as \"one more opportunity to mess with the United States.\" But Harris again referenced the situation in Springfield in that same NABJ event when she argued there were \"far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe\". \"Not everybody has Secret Service,\" she said. Trump, however, says he's planning a visit to Springfield in the next two weeks, telling supporters in New York, \"You may never see me again, but that's OK.\" \"'Whatever happened to Trump?' 'Well, he never got out of Springfield,'\" he said. Calls for calm as campaigning continues Both Biden and Harris have again argued this week that there's \"no place\" for political violence in the US. But FBI director Christopher Wray told Congress, in the wake of the first attempt on Trump's life in July, that it was \"out of control\". \"We get thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of tips reported to us and the language that's out there is just mind-bogglingly hateful,\" he said at the time. Only this week, an Alaska man was charged with threatening to assassinate Supreme Court justices, and suspicious packages were mailed to election officials in more than 15 states. And earlier this year, a man was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to kidnap former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi, and for attacking her husband with a hammer. The attack at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, led to intense scrutiny of the Secret Service, and a stepping up of protection. The suspected second attempt has sparked a new debate over how the agency is funded. But with less than two months to go until election day, both candidates are ploughing ahead with their campaigns – as Americans nervously hope there won't be any further scares. One to watch: A weekend trip to Delaware As the end of Biden's first and only term in the White House approaches, the president appears to be in the mood for reflection. So much so that he's invited the Australian prime minister, among others, to his personal residence and his old high school. The president will host the leaders of the Quad grouping, made up of the US, Australia, Japan and India, in Delaware this weekend. The White House argues \"foreign policy is personal\", and that Biden is seeking to build on the relationships he's developed with each leader over his time in office. But Washington's press corps has complained that the media is being kept out of his Wilmington home, where one-on-one meetings will take place outside of the main Quad gathering. \"I can't remember a time where this president has had a bilateral meeting on US soil and the press and therefore the American people were blocked from seeing it,\" White House Correspondents' Association president Eugene Daniels said in a statement. Amid political pressure at home, Anthony Albanese has stressed the speedy nature of his visit to the US. But in what could be his last official in-person meeting with Biden, it's likely to be a memorable trip.

The recent editorial did a good job detailing the costs associated with bond measures. It is not free money and comes from the state’s general fund. Proposition 4 would increase California’s payments for environment-related bonds to about $1.8 billion of an overall $311 billion budget. Prop 4 is a wise investment. Natural hazard mitigation saves $6 on average for every $1 spent, and California’s Natural Resources Agency estimates that the cost of climate change to our state will be more than $200 billion by 2050. Perhaps the question we should be asking is: Are we spending enough now to deal with an increasingly expensive future? Forty percent of Proposition 4 expenditures must directly benefit lower-income or climate-vulnerable communities. It also requires regular public spending reports. California needs bold, big-scale climate funding plans. If not now, when? Vote yes on Proposition 4.

Since the beginning of his rallies, Donald Trump has been spewing hate and verbal violence. He blames Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for the attempts on his life; but, with his totally unfounded descriptions of Haitian immigrants eating neighbors’ pets, he has thrown the town of Springfield, Ohio, into chaos with the Haitian people fearing for their lives. I agree with Rep. James Crow, D-Colorado, that political violence has become pervasive and normative in our nation, and I lay its source and continuance at the feet of Trump. Rosemary Everett Campbell GOP’s hateful speech is backfiring on them Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have not campaigned on scary, false stories about immigrants consuming neighbors’ pets, the execution of newborn infants, communism taking over our country, etc. Donald Trump and JD Vance have used such hateful, violent rhetoric that they’re inciting hate mongers and especially unbalanced people to arm themselves. Some are apparently ready to become violent and stalk candidates. I shudder to think of what can happen in the next month and a half before the election, let alone after. Consider the prediction Trump made about a “bloodbath” if he loses. His hateful comments appear to be backfiring. He and Vance need to shut down the hate. Lynda Martinez San Jose Harris, Trump should focus on real issues Gas and grocery prices are still too high, and food prices are still going up. On top of that, there’s no sign the wars in Ukraine or Israel might ever end. As election time draws near, what are Kamala Harris and Donald Trump worried about? Harris is worried about keeping abortions legal, and Trump thinks immigrants might be eating my cat. Seriously, both of them need to stick with the issues most important to voters right now.

The Trump supporters were seated behind the stage at Tucson Music Hall in Arizona last Thursday as the Republican nominee bashed the cost of living and pitched a new policy to eventually end taxes. After the rally, six people said they were left with irritated eyes and needed medical care. ‘As soon as we left and we stepped outside my eyes were burning,’ Mayra Rodriguez, a former Hillary Clinton supporter turned Trump fan, told KVOA. Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump gestures with two fists while speaking during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona (Picture: Reuters) After getting back to her home in Phoenix, Rodriguez went to a hospital. ‘The emergency room staff, from the triage nurse to the PA (Physician Assistant) asked are you sure you didn’t get sprayed with something your symptoms look like you got sprayed with something,’ she said. Rodriguez on Friday said that she was almost blind. ‘I can’t see anything when I try to open my eyes. I see a bright light. It hurts, it hurts a lot to open my eyes. I have this cold cloth I put on and take off constantly,’ she said. ‘It’s horrible.’ Doctors were not able to diagnose the illness. By Tuesday, her vision began improving. Rodriguez suspected that the reaction may have been allergies – until she heard that a few others who sat near her experienced similar symptoms. They included her sister and brother, who called the sensation ‘unbearable’. Rodriguez reported the incident to the Trump campaign. ‘The Trump campaign has been collecting information,’ a campaign spokesperson finally stated on Tuesday. ‘We remain committed to the countless patriots that attend our high-energy, high-impact rallies across the country.’ A Secret Service spokesperson said there was no related threat to Trump. Rodriguez, who backed 2016 Democratic nominee Clinton and sat behind her at an event at the time, was one of 48 people selected to be on stage with Trump, Newsweek reported. Those who were seated on the left side did not report any injuries. Trump is known to care deeply about his rallies, as evidenced with his frequent mentions of his crowd size.

We can’t let them make 25 and 30%.” The average credit card interest rate was 21.5% as of this past May, according to data provided by the Federal Reserve. Rates had surged starting in early 2022 amid red-hot inflation coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit card interest rates have never dipped to 10% in the Fed’s dataset, which dates back to 1994. But critics warned Trump’s plan would most hurt those he professed to help. “Government-imposed price controls on credit card interest rates would harm all cardholders, especially the lowest income Americans who these measures are intended to help,” a banking industry insider at the Consumer Banking Association told The Post Thursday. “This will result in credit cards only being given to consumers who have high income and credit scores who post little risk to card issuers.” Peter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management argued that “Trump just proposed his own version of price controls.” “That would destroy the industry and millions of Americans would lose their credit cards,” he added. “There are heavy losses in credit cards from people who don’t pay. So they need the high interest rates to offset that. There is also a lot of fraud.” Trump and his allies had slammed Harris after she unveiled a plan to crack down on so-called price gouging in the food industry last month. The 45th president blasted her as a “Marxist” and suggested her proposal was “communist” in practice. Back in 2019, several pols, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) backed a measure to cap credit card interest payments at 15%. “We have opposed similar interest rate cap proposals in the past,” said a spokesperson for the American Bankers Association, an industry group representing banks and their employees nationwide. “They would result in the loss of credit for the very consumers who need it the most. Instead, these consumers would be forced to use less-regulated, more risky alternatives including payday lenders and loan sharks.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request from The Post to clarify how it would bring about a credit card rate cap. Ahead of the Long Island rally, Trump also pledged that he’d dramatically slash the price of car insurance. “Your Automobile Insurance is up 73% — VOTE FOR TRUMP, I’LL CUT THAT NUMBER IN HALF!” he posted on X. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced the first major rate cut since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As he previously hinted, Powell opted to go big and slash the Fed’s benchmark interest rate target by a whopping 50 basis points — half a percentage point — to a range between 4.75% and 5%, down from 5.25% to 5.50%. The Fed’s benchmark target rate is closely watched because it can impact other key interest rates.","summary":"\"Trump just proposed his own version of price controls,\" one economist said.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/us-news/trump-pitches-capping-annual-credit-card-rates-at-10-we-cant-let-them-make-25-and-30/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-yfeaivsxq-1726785479891.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726771111&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:58:20","author":"James Franey,Ryan King","authors":["James Franey","Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":256826880,"title":"NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy questions Kamala Harris’ faith-based tweet about abortion rights","text":"Legendary NFL coach Tony Dungy challenged a tweet from Vice President Kamala Harris about abortion rights. Harris has been unapologetic about her stance on abortion rights for women, and she continued with a post on X Thursday. \"One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: The government, and certainly Donald Trump, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\" she said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Dungy, the first Black head coach to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the modern era and second all-time, is a man of faith and questioned Harris. \"Dear VP Harris: I hear you make this statement all the time,\" Dungy wrote in a quote tweet. \"Exactly what ‘faith’ are you talking about when you say you don’t have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)? \"Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general ‘faith’ that says we’re good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What ‘faith’ are you talking about?\" HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES ‘NO EXCEPTION,’ MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE Harris has pledged that if Congress were to pass a bill to reinstate the protections that Roe v. Wade guaranteed, she would \"proudly sign it into law\" if elected president in November. Meanwhile, Trump commended the United States Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade, which has allowed states to handle the issue. Dungy also reposted former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson’s quote tweet over a Sept. 17 Harris tweet, which said, \"A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school. This is exactly what we feared when Roe vs. Wade was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans prevent doctors from providing basic medical care.\" \"Amber Thurman’s tragic death was caused by complications from legal abortion drugs and gross medical malpractice,\" Watson responded. \"She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia’s pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate. \"Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.\" On Dungy’s tweet, one commenter wrote, \"I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.\" \"I guess you didn’t see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote ‘Yes’ on it,\" Dungy replied. Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying, \"I’ll be voting no.\" Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances. \"President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,\" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, said after his NBC News interview. Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump’s abortion platform would make no exception \"even for rape and incest.\" \"A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,\" Harris said. \"Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.\" Trump said moments before Harris’ statement he does believe \"strongly\" in exceptions for abortion. \"I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,\" Trump said during a debate. \"I believe strongly in it.

Kennedy Jr. is being investigated for collecting dead whale","text":"GLENDALE, ARIZ. -- A federal law enforcement agency confirmed it's opened an investigation into Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The former independent presidential candidate disclosed the investigation on Saturday while campaigning outside Phoenix for Donald Trump. Kennedy’s daughter recalled the whale incident in a 2012 interview with Town and Country magazine, which recently resurfaced and was shared extensively on social media. Kathleen Kennedy said when she was 6 years old, her dad got word that a dead whale had washed ashore. He got a chainsaw, cut off the whale’s head and strapped it to the roof of their minivan for a five-hour drive home. “Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kathleen Kennedy recalls. “We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.” A spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service confirmed Monday that authorities investigating but declined to elaborate, citing a policy against commenting on open investigations. The agency, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, enforces federal laws including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Kennedy told a crowd of Trump supporters in Glendale, Arizona, that he received a letter “saying they were investigating me for collecting a whale specimen 20 years ago.\" Without confirming or denying he took the severed whale head, Kennedy said the deadline to bring charges passed long ago. He implied without evidence that the investigation was tied to his endorsement of Trump. Kennedy repeatedly declined to elaborate on the investigation when questioned by reporters after his appearance, saying the media only wants to talk to him about “gossipy nonsense.” “I’m not interested in feeding that feature of the mainstream media,” Kennedy said. The whale carcass is the latest bizarre episode involving Kennedy and a dead animal. Last month, Kennedy said he once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.","summary":"A federal law enforcement agency confirmed it's opened an investigation into Robert F.

The order suspended typical purchasing and contracting procedures to “enable departments to respond more efficiently to emerging risks, including civil unrest, cyber threats, and potential acts of violence.” The Republican mayor has been vocal in rejecting GOP smears claiming that recent Haitian migrants in Springfield were eating local pets. Trump has promised a visit to the town beset by bomb threats in recent days, though Rue told reporters earlier this week that a visit from Trump could strain the city even further. Trump has dismissed threats that followed his presidential debate claims that residents were \"eating the cats.\" Vance, who shared the rumors of pet-eating before Trump took them to primetime, admitted the story was a fabrication. Still, Rue says the stories the Trump campaign tells could pose very real risks. Haitians living in Springfield told Salon earlier this week that they were feeling the effects of the rhetoric, noting that they feel the need to stay inside when possible. “We are addressing these threats with the seriousness they warrant and are taking immediate steps to ensure the security of both our community and our employees.

Amid all of this, Fallon recently highlighted the moment when Vance broke the 'first rule of fake news,' which was parodied on his show, The Tonight Show. On Monday, September 16, the comedian said, \"JD Vance admitted that he created the false claim about immigrants eating pets to create media attention. Trump was like, ‘Everyone knows the first rule of fake news is not admitting to fake news.’\" Adding on he said, \"But besides being overtly racist and making Trump look like a total fool at the debate, no harm done, right?\" according to the HuffPost. For context, the commentary came after Vance spread unverified claims about Haitian immigrants eating the pets of the residents of Springfield, Ohio. \"Clearly these rumors are out there because constituents are seeing it with their own eyes, and some of them are talking about it,\" Vance previously told NBC’s Kristen Welker. Vance also controversially stated that immigrants are spreading diseases and increasing the crime rates in the states. On Sunday, September 15 during an appearance on CNN, news presenter Dana Bash told Vance that the Clark County sheriff and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources had reported that there had been only two calls to 911 in the past 11 months complaining about Haitian immigrants stealing geese from parks. When Bash inquired if he had ever been to Springfield, he said, \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do, Dana, because you guys are completely letting Kamala Harris coast,\" per the HuffPost. When the journalist and news presenter asked him if he would openly admit that he spread the rumors for political gains, Vance responded with an even more confusing analogy. \"I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it. But yes, we created the actual focus that allowed the American media to talk about this story and the suffering created by Kamala Harris’ policies,\" while claiming that his source of the dogs and cats being eaten story was based on undocumented information. As such, Fallon's take on Vance has once again stirred the conversation behind the actual motivation of such stories. In a previous string of jokes cracked on the Trump-Vance campaign, the late-night show host claimed that Trump must be wishing to for a certain arrangement with his running mate, just in case of a fallout. The reports of a little disagreement and the ex-POTUS being furious with Vance inspired Fallon to joke, \"This is why I always sign a prenup,\" as reported by the Independent, leaving the listeners in stitches.","summary":"The commentary by Jimmy Fallon came after JD Vance spread the lies about immigrants eating the pets of the residents of Springfield, Ohio.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/jimmy-fallon-catches-jd-vance-slipping-and-breaking-the-first-rule-of-fake-news","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/716265/uploads/6516dfa0-766f-11ef-b4a6-d7f7e3751d2d_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:33:01","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":256827960,"title":"What Happened to Elon Musk","text":"Elon Musk has said some shocking things online in recent days, even by his standards. He amplified conspiracy theories about the presidential debate, promoted false claims about the Democrats, and wrote a now-deleted post suggesting that it was suspicious that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala” (in follow-up posts, Musk claimed that he was just joking). I spoke with my colleague Charlie Warzel, who covers technology, about how Musk, a man once known primarily for his inventions and contributions in Silicon Valley, became a mouthpiece for the MAGA movement. From the Fringes Lora Kelley: Elon Musk has been crossing into the worlds of conspiracism and disinformation for a while—but he seems to be taking things even further lately. Why might he be going this far? What’s in it for him? Charlie Warzel: It’s complicated, but it’s also deceptively simple. We can’t be inside this guy’s head, but he does seem to truly feed off of and love attention. Musk has been moving in a right-wing direction for a long time. But his purchase of Twitter and how he mishandled it—with advertisers, and de-verifying users—really alienated people and accelerated his turn. Many people used to think of him as the Thomas Edison of the 21st century. He was branded as this innovator and savvy businessman. When he walked into Twitter and made a mess of it, he lost cachet among this group of people who saw him as a genius. Now he’s trying very hard to appeal to the only people who really care about him anymore—including those who reside in the far right corners of the internet. Lora: Why is Musk getting so involved in this presidential election, and with Trump (who apparently said he would give Musk a role leading a government-efficiency commission if he wins)? Is he making some kind of play to be a great man of history, or is he after power in a potential Trump administration? Charlie: Elon Musk basically bought Donald Trump at the top. He endorsed him moments after the first assassination attempt, when Trump was riding a wave of positive attention, when Joe Biden was still in the race and it looked like Trump was probably going to dominate him. So much has changed since Musk endorsed Trump in July. If he were truly a savvy political operator, he would be hedging his bets right now, saying I can’t fully alienate myself from one political party, because I have all these government contracts and so many other interests that I need to be able to at least sit in a room with with Democrats. I think the fact that he has effectively just become the in-house social-media team for Donald Trump speaks to the fact that he’s not just making a political calculation. He’s not playing a game of 3-D chess. It seems to me that he’s truly radicalized. Here’s a guy who has, like, six jobs and has decided to spend most of his time tweeting propaganda for a political candidate and hosting him on his platform. Does he want another job? It’s entirely possible. But I really think what he wants more than anything else is to be that sort of Rupert Murdoch person for this political group. He seems to be trying to fit himself into the role of power broker. Lora: In some ways, Musk’s turn feels surprising. But has he always sort of been like this? Charlie: I started covering Musk in the 2010s. And there were signs of this stuff—picking the fight with the cave diver, the way he would dismiss claims around Tesla, irresponsibly tweeting in ways that had the power to move stock prices. He was a loose cannon and showed a lot of signs of his disregard for the rule of law and authority. But for most people, that was overshadowed by the image of Elon Musk, the great innovator. Because of his background and fame in tech, everything that he does that seems outrageous becomes newsworthy. Media organizations don’t cover everything that Alex Jones says, because Alex Jones has been a conspiracy theorist since the beginning. But when Musk muses trollishly about the assassination of Kamala Harris, as he did last weekend on X, it is covered in this way of: What happened to this guy? Not only did his previous branding keep people from really seeing what he’s become until it was too late. But it’s also keeping him in the public eye. It allows him, like Trump did in 2016, to garner this outsize attention. There’s this real urge to try to make narrative sense of him. Lora: How has Musk’s audience shaped his actions? Charlie: When you’re captured by your audience, you behave in a certain way—in Musk’s case, tweeting a lot and being a troll—and you attract an audience as a result. And then the audience, over time, starts to own you, because you are performing for them. You’re allowing the audience to dictate what it is that you do and say, because you’re so hungry for approval. Musk has found this group of people who are giving him the attention he wants for doing this. And in the classic social-media way, he’s got to keep coming up with ways to delight them. That usually means increasing the intensity of his posts. If he tweets a conspiracy theory, and people laud him as a truth teller, then next time, that conspiracy theory has to be a little more extreme. You become the person that your followers want you to be, instead of thinking for yourself. Lora: Musk has this devoted audience on X—but is he changing people’s minds, on or beyond social media? In what ways is Musk actually influential? Charlie: I don’t get the sense that he is influential in terms of changing minds on social media. It seems like he delights people who already believe all this kind of stuff. Where he is influential is dragging things from the fringes into the mainstream news cycle. He has this massive amplification account—he has the most followed account on the platform, which he obviously also owns. Musk is chained to X, following all kinds of right-wing garbage accounts. He sees it; he amplifies it. It is deemed as newsworthy because of who he is. And then a fringe-y talking point is front-page news. That, I think, is his influence.

A federal judge denied Combs bail yesterday, saying the bail proposal set forth by his defense attorneys was \"insufficient\" in addressing the court's concerns.

No pillows in prison Notorious for poor living conditions, staffing shortages, inmate violence, and power outages, the Brooklyn prison is currently the only federal correction centre serving the nation's largest city. This after the Federal Bureau of Prisons shuttered its Manhattan complex shortly after multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019. Asked about the current conditions at the MDC, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said that the agency \"takes seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody\" and as such they \"review safety protocols and implement corrective actions when identified as necessary\". The Bureau of Prisons appointed an Urgent Action Team earlier this year \"to take a holistic look at the challenges at MDC Brooklyn\", spokesperson Emery Nelson said in an email. \"The team's work is ongoing, but it has already increased permanent staffing at the institution (including COs and medical staff), addressed over 700 backlogged maintenance requests, and applied a continued focus on the issues raised in two recent judicial decisions,\" Nelson said.

Constructed in the 1990s to address overcrowding in New York City prisons, the Metropolitan Detention Center houses inmates awaiting trials in Brooklyn and Manhattan federal court. \"He's waking up on a steel bed with a one-and-a-half-inch mattress, no pillow, in an eight by 10-foot cell that I can assure you is disgusting,\" Cohen told CNN yesterday. Cohen, who was incarcerated at the prison in 2020 said that prisoners in the facility's Special Housing Unit, where Combs is housed, basically have a three by five-foot space within which to move. \"There's no books at the early part, so he is really dealing with a lot right now,\" Cohen said of what can be expected in Combs' first days at the facility. Prison described as 'Hell on Earth' In June, one inmate awaiting trial on gun charges, Uriel Whyte, was stabbed to death by another inmate, according to a Bureau of Prisons news release. A month later, inmate Edwin Cordero died in a fight that broke out inside the prison. Cordero's lawyer told The New York Times that his client was \"another victim of MDC Brooklyn, an overcrowded, understaffed and neglected federal jail that is hell on earth.\" In January 2019, a prolonged power outage plunged the correctional facility into crisis, leaving inmates in near-total darkness for a week, exposing them to frigid temperatures that swept the Northeast. The incident prompted a Justice Department investigation assessing whether the Bureau of Prisons had \"adequate contingency plans\" to address inmate living conditions. According to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the prisoners, inmates were reportedly confined to their cells for days on end, and forced to endure non-functioning toilets inside cells and other unsanitary conditions. The Bureau of Prisons settled that lawsuit last summer by compensating 1,600 inmates a total of approximately $10 million for enduring frigid and inhumane conditions as a result of the power outage.","summary":"Described as &quot;disgusting&quot; with &quot;horrifying&quot; conditions, the detention centre music mogul Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs now calls home is a far cry from the Miami and Los Angeles mansions he once lived in.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/sean-diddy-combs-denied-bail-glimpse-inside-new-york-prison-metropolitan-detention-center/dcaee72a-c7ca-42c4-a229-f784cdacd8f5","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/v8NgT1Yq6uU3ZSIJybEsAlf1l0w=/0x29:1600x929/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F3749cc3c-6c66-435d-9040-04caed21ab49","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:30:57","author":"9News","authors":["9News"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":256827500,"title":"Fired ‘Hannity’ producer is Fox News' newest accused sexual harasser","text":"Ailes, who died in 2017, was forced out of the network after the allegations became public—but not years before, when Fox executives first became aware of his conduct. The network also kept harassment allegations against former Fox News star Bill O’Reilly under wraps for years and spent millions in payouts so that women alleging abuse from the host of “The O’Reilly Factor” would not file lawsuits Steve Doocy, the longtime co-host of “Fox & Friends,” was also accused of harassment in Carlson’s suit. He is still hosting the show. Eric Bolling, who co-hosted “The Five,” left the network in 2017 amid allegations that he sent unsolicited lewd photos to co-workers, which he has denied. Fox News also paid out a $4 million settlement in 2020 to the former assistant of Kimberly Guilfoyle, who also was a co-host on “The Five.” “[Guilfoyle] apparently subjected her to deeply unprofessional things - forcing her to see her naked, forcing her to see pornographic material, forcing her to see pictures of the male anatomy of various men that she knew,” NPR’s David Folkenflik reported. Guilfoyle, who has been dating Donald Trump Jr. and spoke at the 2020 and 2024 Republican National Conventions, denied the allegations. The most well-known person with a history of sexual abuse and harassment who is affiliated with Fox News is Donald Trump. At least 18 women have accused Trump of groping them, making lewd comments, and sexually assaulting them and in 2023, a jury found Trump liable for the sexual abuse of advice columnist E. Jean Caroll and awarded her $5 million. Before becoming a Republican presidential candidate in 2015, Trump appeared on “Fox & Friends” in a regular slot to provide commentary on politics and promote the racist “birther” conspiracy theory against then-President Barack Obama. He still calls into various shows, including “Fox & Friends,” to give rambling diatribes. Fox News’ toxic actions against women are not confined to behind-the-scenes interactions. The network has frequently produced and aired openly sexist and misogynistic content from a wide array of hosts and correspondents during its 28-year history Recently, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, Fox host Jesse Watters said, “We don’t know who she is.

Kennedy Jr. after he allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The former independent presidential candidate disclosed the investigation on Saturday while campaigning outside Phoenix for Donald Trump. Kennedy’s daughter recalled the whale incident in a 2012 interview with Town and Country magazine, which recently resurfaced and was shared extensively on social media. Kathleen Kennedy said when she was 6 years old, her dad got word that a dead whale had washed ashore. He got a chainsaw, cut off the whale’s head and strapped it to the roof of their minivan for a five-hour drive home. “Every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car, and it was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kathleen Kennedy recalls. “We all had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us.” A spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service confirmed Monday that authorities investigating but declined to elaborate, citing a policy against commenting on open investigations. The agency, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, enforces federal laws including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Kennedy told a crowd of Trump supporters in Glendale, Arizona, that he received a letter “saying they were investigating me for collecting a whale specimen 20 years ago.” Without confirming or denying he took the severed whale head, Kennedy said the deadline to bring charges passed long ago. He implied without evidence that the investigation was tied to his endorsement of Trump. Kennedy repeatedly declined to elaborate on the investigation when questioned by reporters after his appearance, saying the media only wants to talk to him about “gossipy nonsense.” “I’m not interested in feeding that feature of the mainstream media,” Kennedy said. The whale carcass is the latest bizarre episode involving Kennedy and a dead animal. Last month, Kennedy said he once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York’s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city a decade ago.

The company closed down nearly 6%, at $14.70, as the six-month lockup period preventing insiders from selling the stock expired after Trump Media merged with blank-check company Digital World Acquisition Corp to take it public. Trump, the majority owner with a 57% stake now valued at around $1.7 billion, said last week that he has no intention of selling his position — a move that would effectively devalue the stock. The Republican presidential nominee and other large investors, who collectively own more than 20 million shares, were free to sell the stock after the closing bell. Trump Media debuted on the Nasdaq to great fanfare in March, with the share price soaring to more than $60. But It has suffered volatile swings during his run for the White House as incumbent Joe Biden dropped out and Kamala Harris got the Democratic nomination. The latest polls show Trump and the Vice President are virtually tied in the major swing states. Trump launched Truth Social in February 2022 after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol. He’s since been reinstated to both — and endorsed by X owner Elon Musk — but he still mostly posts on his own platform. While Truth Social sought to capitalize on the outrage over Trump’s bans, it has struggled gaining traction.

With polls showing a tight race against Donald Trump, whose campaign remains resilient despite a rocky debate performance and race-based immigration attacks, Winfrey aims to mobilize voters ahead of the November election. Having endorsed Harris and spoken at the Democratic convention last month, she will headline the event in Farmington Hills. The event, titled “Unite for America 2024,” will feature Winfrey and Harris on stage in front of a local audience, discussing the election’s stakes and the importance of voting. Winfrey emphasized her goal: “What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote — and that’s my intention in hosting this event. My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote.” Earlier on Thursday, a pro-Palestinian grassroots organization, Uncommitted National Movement, announced it would not endorse Harris but urged supporters to vote against Trump. The movement, which originated in Michigan and garnered over 101,000 votes in the state’s presidential primary, expressed concerns about the U.S. handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the vice president’s unwillingness to commit to significant policy changes if elected. The group has called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. What Time Does the Livestream Start? The event is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET. Harris campaign advisers report that nearly 200,000 people have signed up to watch the livestream, and they hope to reach even more viewers through streams on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch accounts for both Winfrey and Harris. Everyone can join online at YouTube.com/@Oprah. What Will Trump Be Doing? Trump will be in Washington to participate in the “Fighting Anti-Semitism in America” evening event alongside Miriam Adelson, co-owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a significant donor to the Republican Party.

The allegations are concerning, but we don’t have any facts,” said Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC), answering a question about whether Robinson should drop out of the race. “Not good,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) in response to the report, according to reporting from the Huffington Post. Rep. Deborah Ross (D-NC) said Robinson wasn’t “fit to lead” the state even before the news broke. “Every week we are learning more and more about Mark Robinson’s racist, sexist, antisemitic, and homophobic beliefs,” Ross said in a post on X. “He wasn’t fit to be governor before this story, and it’s even more clear today that he isn’t fit to lead our state.” The language in the CNN report about Robinson could pose new challenges for Trump as he appears at campaign events Thursday regarding “fighting anti-semitism in America.” The former president will visit North Carolina on Saturday, speaking at a rally in Wilmington about inflation. Trump has invited Robinson to campaign events in the state in the past.

But the pair, joined by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, met in the Oval Office on May 31, 2022 to discuss inflation, photos and videos from the meeting show. The president made the inaccurate claim during remarks at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., the day after the Fed announced a decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. Touting his own respect for the independence of the central bank, Biden said \"By the way, I've never once spoken to the chairman of the Fed since I became president.\" Asked about the apparently inaccurate recollection by a reporter at Thursday's White House press briefing, Council of Economic Advisors Chair Jared Bernstein said Biden had been referring only to discussions about interest rates. \"The president was saying that he has not spoken to Chair Powell about interest rates,\" said Bernstein. \"He did not pressure Powell and has never done so.\" But the error undercut Biden's critique of Republican former President Donald Trump, who has threatened to challenge the independence of the Federal Reserve if he is elected to a second term. \"Unlike my predecessor, I respect the Federal Reserve's independence as they pursue its mandate to bring inflation down. That independence has served the country well,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It would also do enormous damage to our economy that independence was ever lost.\" Even in his 2022 Oval Office meeting with Powell, Biden stressed the importance of the Fed's independence in addressing inflation. \"My plan to address inflation starts with a simple proposition: Respect the Fed. Respect the Fed's independence,\" Biden said at the time. \"My job as president is not to not only nominate highly qualified individuals for that institution, but to give them the space they need to do their job.\" Trump, the Republican nominee for president, said in August that presidents should \"have at least [a] say\" about the Fed's decisions on interest rates. \"Yeah, I feel that strongly,\" Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago press conference on Aug. 8. \"I think that in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\" The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Trump advisors were putting together a plan that would inject Trump into the Fed's interest rate decision-making process, if the Republican returns to the White House in January.","summary":"President Joe Biden was criticizing Republican nominee Donald Trump for threating the Federal Reserve's independence.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/19/biden-fed-jay-powell-meeting-oval-office.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107069217-1654019493681-gettyimages-1241020201-AFP_32BM7XF.jpeg?v=1726772161","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:22:46","author":"Josephine Rozzelle","authors":["Josephine Rozzelle"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.089},{"id":256829390,"title":"NC Lt.

North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the state’s Republican nominee for governor, denied the heavily sourced reporting published on Thursday by Politico and CNN, respectively. Robinson spoke out just around the same time that local media reported he was being urged by GOP leaders to drop out of the race for his alleged online activity that took place more than a decade ago. MORE: MAGA Republican Mark Robinson’s Hateful History Of Spewing Conspiracy Rhetoric According to the Carolina Journal, “Sources with direct knowledge” said that “Robinson is under pressure from staff and members of the Trump campaign to withdraw from the governor’s race.” That report was followed by one from CNN that uncovered “a series of inflammatory comments on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago, in which [Robinson] referred to himself as a ‘black NAZI!’ and expressed support for reinstating slavery.” According to CNN, “Robinson said he enjoyed watching transgender pornography, a review of archived messages found in which he also referred to himself as a ‘perv.’” More from CNN: The comments, which Robinson denies making, predate his entry into politics and current stint as North Carolina’s lieutenant governor. They were made under a username that CNN was able to identify as Robinson by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address between the two. Many of Robinson’s comments were gratuitously sexual and lewd in nature. They were made between 2008 and 2012 on “Nude Africa,” a pornographic website that includes a message board. The comments were made under the username minisoldr, a moniker Robinson used frequently online. Robinson listed his full name on his profile for Nude Africa, as well as an email address he used on numerous websites across the internet for decades. Also on Thursday, Politico reported that one of Robinson’s advisers confirmed that “An email address belonging to North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson was registered on Ashley Madison, a website designed for married people seeking affairs.” CNN is expected to televise an interview with Robinson on Thursday evening. Robinson on Thursday said without proof that all of the aforementioned reports were lies devised by his political opponents, including and especially Josh Stein, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in North Carolina. Claiming “the news media is at it again,” the gubernatorial candidate said in a video posted on social media vaguely that the “half-truths” being reported “are not the words of Mark Robinson.” He said Stein and his “opponents are desperate to shift the focus here from the substantive issues and focus on what you are concerned with to salacious tabloid trash.” In case you missed it, Robinson is the same person who in July seemingly called for political violence when he said “some folks need killing” in reference to alleged violent criminals who haven’t yet been granted due process and “liberals” who are simply of a different ideology. Ironically, Trump was grazed in the ear during a failed assassination attempt in Western Pennsylvania eight days later. That apparent incitement of political violence is part of Robinson’s legacy of being hateful and spreading nonsensical conspiracy theories. He described COVID-19 as a “globalist” conspiracy to destroy Trump; he called members of the LGBTQ+ community “filth” and falsely linked homosexuality to pedophilia; and, of course, he leaned into his role as a “Black friend” to the white-and-aggrieved world of MAGA by suggesting it’s actually Black Americans who owe reparations for slavery. If history is any indication, Robinson will not be dropping out of the gubernatorial race in which he is polling behind Stein. Back in October 2021, when he told a North Carolina church congregation that “There’s no reason anybody anywhere in America should be telling any child about transgenderism, homosexuality—any of that filth,” Robinson resisted calls for him to resign. “Let me tell you plainly right here and right now: I will not back down, I will not be silent, and I will not be bullied into submission,” Robinson said at the time. Thursday evening is the deadline for gubernatorial candidates to drop out of the race in North Carolina. This is America. SEE ALSO: Rep.

As Donald Trump’s youngest son, he is used to having his every move shadowed by secret service agents. As revealed by DailyMail.com, Barron spent his high school years at Palm Beach’s elite Oxbridge Academy with agents by his side and his university life is destined to be no different. Clearly visible in this video, his cadre of agents bookend him through the halls and lecture theatres of NYU, a constant presence both several steps before him and several steps behind. According to one classmate, Barron’s guards have been forced to turn away some more curious students seeking a selfie with their famous peer. The student told DailyMail.com: ‘Some people were trying to talk to him and take pictures of him when they first saw him. He’s been quiet in class so far. ‘There were several guards outside the door before class and we had to show them our IDs.’ Students have previously complained about the intrusion extra security might cause to their daily lives, with all forced to present valid student ID to get on campus and lines forming to get into the business school. But if the Trump camp had any concerns that Barron might be the target of hostility in the notoriously liberal school it seems they need not worry as, one student said, ‘Nobody wants to bother or harass him. I wish him the best in college.’ The former president first shared the news of Barron’s college choice with DailyMail.com saying, ‘It’s a very high-quality place. He liked it. He liked the school.’ Trump, 78, also revealed that his son considered his father’s alma mater, The Wharton Schoolk of Buisiness at the University of Pennsylvania, before ultimately opting for NYU. ‘I went to Wharton and that was certainly one we were considering. We didn’t do that. We went for Stern,’ he said. ‘He’s a very high aptitude child, but he’s no longer a child. He’s just passed into something beyond child-dom. He’s doing great.’ But while he may not be a child anymore, Barron’s decision to attend a college that will see him continue to live at home in his father’s Fifth Avenue Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan pleased his mother Melania, 54, greatly. Fiercely protective of her son, Melania’s desire to keep him close is understood to have played a part in Barron’s decision-making process. When he was a child, and younger adolescent Barron had the extra security blanket of being enrolled in Oxbridge Academy under the pseudonym ‘Jack’. It is unclear whether similar measures have been taken to protect Barron’s student record and grades from any security breach at NYU. Only 1 in 20 applicants to NYU’s School Stern of Business are successful, with tuition for the undergraduate program starting at roughly $62,700 a year and class sizes varying between 45-100. Barron, who has been described as bright and charismatic by his high school peers and who has expressed political ambitions of his own, must complete a cohort leadership program and commerce and culture class in his first semester. He will make up his credits by studying microeconomics, statistics, global cultures, natural science, or an elective course during his fall classes. According to sources, Barron has yet to sign up to any extracurricular activities, skipping the ‘Stern Spotlight’ event in the first week of class, which showcases clubs and societies. But his father told DailyMail.com that he may well pursue his passion for soccer – he was once spotted wearing an Arsenal shirt at the White House and played midfield for a local DC league when he was younger. Barron also skipped the first week of welcome parties as he tried to keep a low profile outside of class. He can most often be found sitting quietly in Stern’s student lounge between classes and has been attending lectures in person two days a week for his business course. Barron is Melania and Trump’s only child, born one year after their 2005 wedding. He spent his early childhood in New York before moving with his father’s presidency to Washington DC. Before relocating he took his entire class from New York’s Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School on a tour of the White House in 2017, the year his father took office. He went on to attend St Andrew Episcopal School in Maryland and played for DC United’s under 12 soccer team, meeting the franchise’s biggest star, former England striker Wayne Rooney. He remained largely out of the spotlight during his father’s presidency but, DailyMail.com has been told, over the course of his teens he has quietly blossomed into an engaging and charming young man. In May, he hosted the Iranian American business mogul and podcaster Patrick Bet-David at a swank dinner at his father’s Florida home of Mar-a-Lago. Bet-David, who is worth $450 million, later told listeners of his PDB podcast that his young host was, ‘sharp, funny, sarcastic, tough – not weak’. Barron appeared at a Trump campaign rally on July 9 in Miami where he confidently mirrored his father’s fist pumping pose and lapped up a standing ovation. He was not present four days later when gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate his father but, Trump revealed, he watched the horrific events unfold on live television. He didn’t attend the subsequent Republican National Convention, but he got a shout-out from his father at the July 18 event as he told delighted convention-goers, ‘We love our Barron.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt&#8217;s hard to blend into the crowd when you&#8217;re six foot nine. &#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Barron Trump Turns Heads at New York University with Secret Service in Tow, Named Campus Heartthrob&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/barron-trump-turns-heads-at-new-york-university-with-secret-service-in-tow-named-campus-heartthrob/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/19/20/89884319-0-image-m-29_1726774581855.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:21:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.155},{"id":256825678,"title":"Trump says he’s met pilots better than Tom Cruise when grilled on aliens at Area 51","text":"Former President Donald Trump said he knows pilots better than Tom Cruise, as the former president was grilled about the existence of aliens. Whether Trump knew the A-lister has a pilot’s license or the former president was referring to Cruise’s character in the Top Gun series is up for debate. Trump made the remarks on Wednesday while appearing on Gutfeld!, a Fox News late-night talk show hosted by Greg Gutfeld. Fox News panelist Kat Timpf presented the former president with the line of questioning on the secretive military base. “Can I please ask a question, just because I’m never gonna be allowed in a room with a president again?” she said during the president’s appearance. Gutfeld gestured for her to continue. “Are there aliens at Area 51?” she said. Trump responded: “I’ll tell you, it’s a funny thing because I think that might be a question that I get more than any question. It is the craziest thing.” “I don’t think I’m a believer,” Trump continued. “But I have interviewed pilots that look – I like Tom Cruise – but better than Tom Cruise.” Cruise is a licensed pilot, but one of his most famous roles is as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in Top Gun. It's unclear if the Republican nominee for president was referring to the fictional fighter pilot or Cruise’s actual flying skills when making the comparison. The actual pilots told him, Trump recounted, that: “’All I know, sir, is there was a round object that was going four times faster than my F-22,’ which is a very fast plane.” Trump added: “Four or five guys I’ve interviewed, solid people, great pilots for the US Air Force, etcetera, they’ve seen things that they cannot explain.” Tyrus then asked the former president if he’d be willing to “put tariffs on them” on aliens, if they are real and visit from outer space.

GOP gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson linked to explosive comments on porn site","text":"Sept. 19 (UPI) -- North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, called himself a \"Black Nazi\" and supported reinstating slavery in comments made on a pornographic website, CNN reported Thursday. Robinson, a Black conversative who has long described himself as a devoted Christian opposed to abortion and has voiced hostility towards transgender people, also said he enjoyed watching transgender pornography in anonymous comments made on the \"Nude Africa\" website more than a decade ago, according to CNN's report published Thursday afternoon. Robinson, who has been enthusiastically endorsed by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, denied making the comments in a statement issued to the broadcaster, calling the report \"tabloid trash.\" Shortly before the report came out, he posted a defiant video on social media in which he vowed to continue his campaign even as some of his fellow North Carolina Republicans have reportedly urged him to drop out of his race against North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein. Most polls already showed Robinson decisively trailing Stein, likely hindering Trump's chances to win the crucial state. CNN linked the comments made on Nude Africa under the user name \"minisoldr\" to an identical user name employed by Robinson on many different websites and applications across the Internet over the years, including on Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and elsewhere. The user name was also linked by CNN to an email address frequently used by Robinson. Many of the comments made by \"minisoldr\" on the pornographic website were lewd and sexually explicit and directly contrast with Robinson's frequently inflammatory public positions as a far-right conservative who is vehemently opposed gay and transgender rights. For instance, in comments on Nude Africa, Robinson discussed how much he liked transgender pornography. \"I like watching tranny on girl porn! That's f***ng hot! It takes the man out while leaving the man in! And yeah I'm a 'perv' too!,\" he wrote. He also wrote about secretly \"peeping\" on women in public gym showers for sexual gratification as a 14-year-old. In racially inflammatory comments, \"minisoldr\" maligned the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., attacking him so vehemently and in such racially charged terms that he elicited reactions from other users who accused him of being a white supremacist. In a 2010 post, Robinson reportedly wrote, \"I'm a black NAZI!\" and later wrote that he supported the return of slavery, saying, \"Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few.\" \"Let me reassure you -- the things that you will see in that story, those are not the words of Mark Robinson,\" Robinson said in the his video, adding he is \"staying in this race.\" That denial, however, has not prevented other North Carolina Republicans from pressuring him to step aside, according to state political sources who spoke to the Washington Post. Should Robinson drop out, it would be too late to print up new ballots and so votes cast for him would instead go to a replacement designated by the state's Republican Party.","summary":"North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt.

Ocasio-Cortez (also known by her initials AOC) lambasted O'Brien in a tweet following the non-endorsement, reminding her 13.2 million followers that the union boss \"has been boosting Republicans all year while supporting anti-worker, anti-choice candidates.\" She added that Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to save the Teamsters' pension fund when the 2021 American Rescue Plan came before the U.S. Senate.

The union praised Harris for her record on \"pension relief, changes to the National Labor Relations Board, infrastructure investment [and] supporting the Protect the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.\" \"The NY-14 Teamsters mentioned here have actually voted overwhelmingly to endorse Harris-Walz.

Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt tweeted a statement Thursday with the names of all of the Teamsters shops backing the Democratic ticket, which also include multiple union locals in battleground states like Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is leading a delegation for Donald Trump to Nebraska, where the senator is making a last-ditch effort to convince a critical mass of the state’s Republican lawmakers to change how Nebraska awards Electoral College votes, a shift that could turn the state into a winner-takes-all situation. Unlike most states, Nebraska splits up all five of its Electoral College votes — two go to the winner of the popular vote in the state and the other three are split up among Nebraska’s three congressional districts and are awarded to whoever wins the popular vote in each district. Maine is the only other state with a similarly unusual method of allotting votes. The revived push by Trump allies to convince Nebraska to change its system is a pellucid attempt to prevent Vice President Kamala Harris from winning the Electoral College vote from the state’s 2nd Congressional District, which includes the city of Omaha. Democrats were awarded a vote in 2008 and 2020 for winning the popular vote in that district. Trump allies, led by far-right online provocateur Charlie Kirk, already attempted to change the way Nebraska divvies up votes earlier this year, when President Biden was running for reelection. But Republicans in the state legislature failed to pass the bill that would’ve made the switch. Republicans are clearly nervous about Harris carrying the Omaha-based district in November — her running mate Tim Walz, who was born near Omaha, held a jam-packed rally there last month — which could help her secure the presidency. The stakes are high, per The Hill: If Harris loses Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, she could still win the presidency by winning the other states won by President Biden in 2020 — as long as she also wins the single electoral vote from Nebraska’s 2nd District. This would give her exactly 270 electoral votes. Graham reportedly made a trip to Nebraska this week, at the request of Nebraska GOP Sen. Pete Ricketts and Gov. Jim Pillen, who are both supportive of the change. Similarly, Republican members of Congress from Nebraska put out a letter on Wednesday calling on lawmakers back home to bring the bill back up for consideration before the election. “As members of Nebraska’s federal delegation in Congress, we are united in our support for apportioning all five of the Nebraska’s electoral votes in presidential elections according to the winner of the whole state,” the letter, addressed to Pillen and Nebraska Speaker of the Legislature John Arch, said. “It is past time that Nebraska join 48 other states in embracing winner-take-all in presidential elections.” Speaking to reporters on Thursday after his meeting with Pillen and Ricketts, Graham said he was hopeful his efforts to resuscitate the previously-failed effort would be fruitful. “The whole fate of the country and the world could hinge on one electoral vote,” he told reporters, according to CBS News. “I hope the people in Nebraska will understand this may come down to a single electoral vote. And I just don’t believe a Harris presidency is good for Nebraska.” Pillen is reportedly willing to bring lawmakers back for a special session to try to pass the bill again before Election Day, per CBS: “As I have also made clear, I am willing to convene the Legislature for a special session to fix this 30-year-old problem before the 2024 election,” the governor said, though he noted that he must first receive indication that there’s enough support among state senators. Early voting in Nebraska begins on Oct. 1, but the secretary of state said a switch to a winner-take-all system could be implemented anytime before Election Day on Nov. 5, according to a report from KOLN.

But she's still Oprah.\"She still has an immense degree of respect and ability to convene people,\" Craig Garthwaite, a professor of strategy at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management who co-authored the study, told Bloomberg News this week.Several grassroots groups, including White Dudes for Harris, Win With Black Men, South Asians for Harris, and Republicans for Harris will be involved in Thursday's virtual rally at 8 p.m. ET, which will be streamed across YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch.Speakers will discuss why they are supporting the Vice President, as well as why voting matters.\"What is essential to me is getting people motivated to vote – and that's my intention in hosting this event,\" Oprah Winfrey said in a press release. \"My goal is to get people excited about the privilege and power of the vote.\"Oprah call can reach undecided votersGreco, from the Italian-American group, told Newsweek that Oprah's event with Harris on Thursday needs to \"extend\" a sense of enthusiasm to those undecided voters around them — and Harris needed to help with that by being clear on policy.\"In several of the swing states, but also for most voters, it's going to be the economy, the kitchen table issues, what the candidates can do for their bottom line and will their lives be better as a result,\" Greco said.He referred to his culture as an example, saying that the core family values Italian Americans hold dear could be tapped by Harris by touting her economic policies focused on childcare and taxes. In doing that, he believes this could win over undecided voters, male and female alike.\"In those swing states like Pennsylvania, I think Italian Americans, it's 15% of the population,\" Greco said. \"If you can even just capture 5% of that, in an election where 10,000 or so can be can flip a county or a whole state, I think it's worthwhile to make the effort.\"","summary":"Over 140 grassroots groups are rallying virtually Thursday night with Oprah, in a play for swing state voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/oprah-kamala-harris-undecided-voters-livestream-1956605","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476345/oprah-kamala-harris-call.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:11:27","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.155},{"id":256825782,"title":"Kamala Harris Pins Hopes on Oprah Moment","text":"Is Oprah Winfrey the secret sauce Kamala Harris needs to win?

A couple hundred thousand others are expected to be tuning in on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitch. The event is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET.

And the appalling attack on Representative Gabrielle Giffords? In 2011 a lone madman shot Giffords in the head. It was a terrible attack on Giffords and on American democracy. The idea that anyone would dare to influence the process of government by violence was condemned by all. Yet in the ensuing attempt to cast the blame wider some Democrats settled on Palin. Palin’s political action committee had earlier released a list of target seats which were in their sights. One of them was Giffords’ seat. Of course the idea of “targets” and “crosshairs” is fairly standard campaign rhetoric. But the Democrats — and the Democrat media — decided that Palin was in fact guilty of incitement. It is a really dirty game to play, and Palin has said later how appalled she was by it all. There are indeed madmen out there and aside from the smear it is the sort of thing that would torture a person’s conscience. Was there someone out there who did take this literally? Well how come when it comes to attacks on Republican lawmakers and two exceptionally near-miss attempts to assassinate former President Trump there are so few people applying a similar standard? After the first assassination attempt on Trump in July, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi) had to fire one of his aides after she posted on Facebook, “I don’t condone violence but please get you some shooting lessons so you don’t miss next time ooops that wasn’t me talking.” Meanwhile Jack Black’s Tenacious D bandmate, Kyle Gass, was asked during a performance to make a wish. “Don’t miss Trump next time” was the “hilarious” response. But even in July wiser voices realized that America — as well as the former President — had avoided disaster by a hair’s breadth. The more recent attempt, this weekend, saw that restraint go out the window. After another shooter tried to kill Trump — this time on the former President´s golf course in Florida — Lester Holt of NBC said: “Today’s apparent assassination attempt comes amid increasingly fierce rhetoric on the campaign trail.” Ah — so it was Trump that brought it on himself, apparently! Isn’t “victim-blaming” meant to be one of the great sins of our age? Not if it relates to Trump, it seems. The same day David Frum of The Atlantic magazine wrote: “Trump and his running mate have spent the past week successfully inciting violence in Springfield, Ohio. Today they want to present themselves as near-victims of violence — in this case, of violence completely unrelated to themselves and at a very safe distance from themselves.” I don’t know whether I’d count having another rifle barrel pointed at you as “a very safe distance.” But on and on they have gone this week. On Tuesday’s edition of “The View” Whoopi Goldberg opined “Let’s stop this thing. You know, let’s stop this both sides stuff. Because it’s not correct. It is not both sides, it is one clear side, and you can point to many, many reports. You can point to all kinds of stuff that’s been reported. You guys have to pull it back. This is not us or them, this is you got to stop doing what you’re doing, JD [Vance] and what you’re doing, Mr. [Trump], because you are not helping the situation.” Was Whoopi? I wonder. Meantime perhaps the most deranged person in American media, Joy Reid of MSNBC, said on her show on Monday, “The irony of it is the actual violence we’re seeing comes much more disproportionately from MAGA themselves.” Again and again the Democrat media tried to say that it was Donald Trump’s fault. Most of these people have been in a sticky corner since the Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt. People who have spent recent years insisting that Trump is “literally Hitler” had to say “I still think he’s literally Hitler, but I´m glad he hasn’t been killed.” This time they’ve changed the tune slightly. Now the line seems to be “If he doesn’t want to keep being shot then he should change his ways.” Don Lemon was on his old network of CNN this week saying that “If Donald Trump wants Kamala Harris and others to stop saying that he is a threat to democracy, then he should stop threatening democracy.” Will some Democrats realize that wild rhetoric can come from all sides and that the rhetoric problem is not one-sided? In 2022. Chris Hayes of MSNBC claimed of the Supreme Court, “They can do whatever they want unless someone stops them. There’s no other conclusion now but that the Supreme Court is — I fear — an acute threat to American representative governance and democracy.” Yesterday the Department of Justice indicted a man from Alaska for threatening to torture and kill six conservative Supreme Court Justices. I doubt that man takes direction from Chris Hayes. But by the rules of this game anyone would be free to claim that. Tone it down? Who wants to go first? Iran, Iran, Iran! Remember all the years of “Russia, Russia, Russia” when it was claimed that Vladimir Putin was so powerful he could even swing US elections? Well why there is not more talk about an actual threat? That is — “Iran, Iran, Iran.” Two years ago we learned of an Iranian plot to assassinate former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former national security advisor John Bolton on American soil. This July we learned that the US Intelligence Agencies had got wind of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Trump. Presumably because of the hard line all three men took on the revolutionary Islamic mullahs in Tehran. Now this week we learned that the Iranians recently hacked Trump’s election campaign and sent information they had gleaned to members of the Democrat campaign team. The Democrats insist that they haven’t made any use of this material. But it is hard to unsee something once you have seen it. Especially if it useful to you. So why are we not hearing about Iranian election interference? Or, come to that, the “interference” of trying to murder American officials on US soil? Is it because it isn’t useful? Or doesn’t fit the plans of those same people who were so keen to say “Russia, Russia, Russia”?","summary":"Democrats and the media have yet to tone down their charged rhetoric against former President Donald Trump — despite two near-miss assassination attempts.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/19/opinion/when-will-democrats-stop-the-violent-rhetoric-that-has-conservatives-under-threat/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-mogoolelm-1726782914306.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726768561&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:05:31","author":"Douglas Murray","authors":["Douglas Murray"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":256826674,"title":"Harris to livestream with Oprah, Trump to address Israeli-American group","text":"Both major presidential candidates are gearing up their campaign efforts.

The group, which emerged during the Democratic primaries and opposes the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, advocates for a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to U.S. arms transfers to Israel. Harris’ campaign did not address the group’s decision directly but reiterated her commitment to resolving the Gaza conflict while ensuring Israeli security and addressing Palestinian rights.Harris will also campaign in Wisconsin and Georgia on Friday, focusing on the case of Amber Thurman, a young mother who died after complications related to an abortion pill. Harris argues that Thurman's death highlights the consequences of Trump’s judicial appointments and restrictive abortion laws.Trump is set to hold a rally in North Carolina on Saturday, a crucial battleground state.The candidates’ campaign activities come in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s unexpected half-point interest rate cut. This significant move could alter the economic landscape just weeks before the election. Trump criticized the rate cut as indicative of a failing economy, while White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the Fed’s independence and the administration’s respect for its decisions.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are stepping up their campaign efforts.

The entire Democratic Party, plus its allies in the larger political world and in the legal system, plus the entertainment industry, plus much of the media — haven’t they thrown everything they have at former President Donald Trump? With all that firepower, how is Trump still standing, let alone tied with Harris? More pointedly, why isn’t Harris winning by a big margin? The last three polls in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls have Trump and Harris tied (New York Times), Harris up by 2 points (Fox News), and Trump up by 2 (Rasmussen). The seven key states look like this, from the RealClearPolitics average: North Carolina, Trump +0.1; Nevada, Harris +0.2; Pennsylvania, Harris +1.0; Wisconsin, Harris +1.2; Arizona, Trump +1.6; and Michigan, Harris +1.7. Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue! It’s fair to call it tied in every way. And the reason that seems remarkable is that in the last year, Democrats or their allies have: 1. Indicted Trump in connection with the 2020 election and Jan. 6. 2. Indicted Trump a second time in connection with the 2020 election. 3. Indicted and convicted Trump in connection with the 2016 election. 4. Indicted Trump in connection with classified documents. 5. Changed candidates in peak election season when Trump was leading. 6. Given Trump’s new opponent, Harris, overwhelmingly positive news coverage. 7. Given Trump overwhelmingly negative news coverage. 8. Sued in multiple jurisdictions to use the 14th Amendment to remove Trump from ballots. 9. Filed and won a lawsuit aimed at destroying Trump’s business empire. 10. Filed a lawsuit using special, unprecedented legal maneuvers to accuse him of sexual misconduct 25 years earlier. Finally, of course, two unstable individuals have tried to kill Trump, one shooting him in the ear on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the other lying in wait to kill him on Sept. 15 before being caught by the Secret Service. Looking at the list, it’s a wonder Trump is still standing, much less that he is tied in a presidential contest. And yet he is. Some of the attacks on him have backfired, but some have hit their marks. It’s certainly reasonable to argue that the relentless lawfare, and then the assassination attempts, have taken a toll on Trump. At times that should have been high season for campaigning, he has been stuck in a courtroom or hunkered down for his own safety. That would be a draining experience for anyone, Trump included. Yet the race is tied. Trump is very much in it. Yes, you can make arguments about current divisions in the electorate and 2024 as a base election, but it’s still just plain remarkable. On the other side, Harris was handed the Democratic nomination after a secretive group of party insiders muscled President Joe Biden out of the race. She has not had to go through the grueling 18-month process of primaries, caucuses, campaigning, travel, more travel, speeches, gaffes, interviews, town halls, glad-handing, and all of the exhausting stuff that makes up a serious presidential campaign. “The short campaign benefits Kamala Harris in a lot of ways,” senior campaign adviser and Obama veteran David Plouffe said during the Democratic convention. He was right. Perhaps most of all, Harris has escaped the level of scrutiny that has been a feature of Trump’s life for eight years. News reports indicate it is her plan to keep that up through Election Day, which, with the help of some compliant allies in the media, she might succeed in doing. Yet for all that, Harris is not leading the race. Why isn’t she ahead by 10 points? Fifteen? More? Fill in whatever theory you like. But the fact is, given everything that has happened, it is nothing short of astonishing that this race is dead even so close to the election.","summary":"WHY ISN&#8217;T HARRIS WINNING BY A LOT?&#160;It&#8217;s been more than a week since the Harris-Trump presidential debate, and Thursday saw a spate of post-debate polls on the state of the race.

It's one of a handful of states that could be the tipping point again in November.Harris holds a narrow polling lead in Wisconsin less than two months until Election Day, according to the leading polling averages. But surveys of the Badger State have also been better for Trump this time around compared to four years ago, when polling data suggested he could lose the state by nearly 10 points. Biden ultimately carried Wisconsin it by less than a single percentage point — far too close, if you were a Democrat.Polls underestimated Trump more in Wisconsin than in any other state in 2020, and a similar polling error this year would be devastating to Harris' chances of winning the state. But two political experts from Wisconsin told Newsweek the infamous 2020 polling error likely cannot be replicated, as pollsters have changed their methodology since the last presidential race.Follow Newsweek's live blog for election updates.FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed Biden leading in the stateby 8.4 points, while Real Clear Politics' average showed him up by 6.7 points, on Election Day four years ago. Ultimately, Biden only won Wisconsin by 0.63 points, or about 20,000 votes.As of September, FiveThirtyEight's aggregate has Harris up by 1.6 points, and RealClearPolitics' average has Harris up by 1.2 points — well within the 2020 polling error.Edward J. Miller, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and co-director of the Center for the Small City, told Newsweek the polling difference may be attributed to pollsters adjusting their methodologies from 2020 and is simply better reflective of where the race actually is, rather than Trump winning over a substantial number of voters who opposed him four years earlier.Trump may be facing a particularly chilly reception from Republican voters in the Milwaukee area, Miller said, noting that the former president isn't \"drawing much more\" support from voters who previously backed Democrats in the state.\"There are some Republicans down there... that opposed him. This is moreso than in northern Wisconsin and rural areas,\" Miller said.Although suburban counties outside of Milwaukee still backed Trump in 2020, Democrats have made gains in the region in recent years.Henrik M. Schatzinger, a professor of political science at Ripon College outside Green Bay, told Newsweek that there is a \"sizable\" group of his supporters who don't participate in polls but who only make their voices known at the ballot box. Trump's stronger 2024 polling in the state may be due to pollsters adjusting their methodologies based on past results, he said.\"For pollsters, this is an issue about weighting and sampling, where you have to make statistical adjustments. In the last few years, we have also seen adjustments as to how pollsters contact participants. They now use a better mix of contact methods and approach people via text messages, phone, postcards, and QR codes. It remains to be seen if these adjustments have been effective this year,\"Schatzinger said.Another reason his polling may be stronger this time is because Republicans have been investing heavily in the state, including by holding convention in Milwaukee.The state is also demographically key to both candidates, as it is likely to reflect their support among white voters without bachelor's degrees.\"This group of voters makes up 58 percent of registered voters, which is a higher share than any of the seven battleground states. To win the election, you need to get sufficient support from white working-class voters, and there is no better test case for this than Wisconsin,\" he said.Several pollsters that gave Biden a more comfortable lead in 2020 show the race as being much closer in 2024.An Emerson College poll, conducted among 1,000 likely voters from September 15 to 18, found Trump with a single-point lead over Harris (50 percent to 49 percent). But the same poll from around the same time in 2020 found Biden with a 6-point lead over Trump (51 percent to 45 percent). That poll surveyed 823 likely voters from September 6 to September 8 of that year.Elsewhere, a Marist College poll, conducted among September 12 to September 17, 2024 found Harris leading Trump by a single point in Wisconsin (50 percent to 49 percent). A Marist poll conducted from September 20 to September 24, 2020 among 727 likely voters showed Biden up 10 points (54 percent to 44 percent).Notably, the Marquette Law School poll, viewed as the gold standard for Wisconsin, did not show Trump gain from 2020.A Marquette poll released earlier this month showed Harris up four points (52 percent to 48 percent). It surveyed 738 likely voters from August 28 to September 5. For comparison, a Marquette poll from August 30 to September 3, 2024 showed Biden with a 4-point lead (48 percent to 44 percent). It surveyed 688 likely voters.Political scientist Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball wrote a week ago that Wisconsin \"stands out as having had unrealistically optimistic polling for Democrats in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.\" However, he noted it is unclear whether the polls will have the same error in November.\"Maybe Trump will be understated again: if so, he is almost certainly going to win the election given how close the polls are now. Maybe Harris will be understated: if so, she is in a great position to win given that she appears to already lead in enough states to win 270 electoral votes, albeit barely,\" he wrote.With only 10 Electoral College votes, Wisconsin is smaller than some other battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Georgia or North Carolina but could very well end up being the tipping point state again in November, according to Schatzinger from Ripon College.Still, Trump and Harris both have numerous paths to 270 without winning Wisconsin, as they could win various combinations of other swing states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina or Pennsylvania to make up for a loss in the Badger State.Democrats remain focused on their so-called \"blue wall,\" hoping to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as their easiest path to 270. Some political analysts view Pennsylvania as Harris' must-win state, as losing there would more severely complicate her path and make her entirely dependent on the Sun Belt states.In Wisconsin, making appearances on the ground is crucial to winning over the states highly engaged voters, Miller said. Specifically, candidates must get out of their comfort zones and visit areas away of their voter bases in the state—rural areas for Trump and Madison and Milwaukee for Harris—to narrow the margin in places they are unlikely to win.He noted that Wisconsin prides itself on having one of the highest turnouts in the country, and that the student population in places like La Crosse and Stevens Point could end up crucial for Harris.Hillary Clinton barnstormed those counties in the 2016 primary, then largely failed to return for the general election. She ended up losing Wisconsin by less than a point, and thus the election, to Donald Trump.","summary":"The former president is polling better in Wisconsin now than he was in 2020, when he lost by less than a point.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-wisconsin-polling-tipping-point-1956567","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2476414/wisconsin-vote.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-19 22:03:14","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":256825136,"title":"Fox News Poll: Voters think Harris did better than Trump in debate","text":"It’s been over a week since Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump squared off in the second presidential debate of the cycle (Harris’ first), and while voters aren’t thrilled with either individual’s performance, they think Harris performed better. That’s according to the latest Fox News Poll released Thursday. Using a letter grade scale, on average voters give Harris a C for her performance, while they give Trump a C-. FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS However, the details are in the individual letter grades. By a 12-point margin, voters are more likely to give Harris an A (30%) than Trump (18%). Meanwhile, by 12 points, voters are more likely to give Trump a failing grade (36%) than they are Harris (24%). Among the partisans, on average, Democrats give Harris a B+, while Independents award her a C, and Republicans rate her a D. For Trump, Republicans give him a B average, Independents a D+, and Democrats…a resounding F. At the first presidential debate in June, Trump got an overall C average. He held steady with Republicans (B average in June) while he faltered with Independents (C-) and Democrats (D). FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES Still, both candidates performed better than President Joe Biden did in the June debate, which subsequently led to calls for him to step down as the nominee.
