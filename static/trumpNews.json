It's in the audacity to say, we will go there.\n'It's in our collective spirit, not just in the highest times, but in the hardest, in the darkness, and the trouble, and the struggle.'\nFrom there, viewers were also shown glimpses of some of the recent weather-related disasters hitting America - from Hurricane Helene to the Los Angeles fires.\n'I's there, in our unity, that we form hope, we find strength,' he said as a famous image of firefighters raising the American flag amid the 9/11 rubble appeared. 'Sure the huddle is just a rough circle, a simple oval, a crowd of 11, or a country or more than 300 million, on the field, and across the land.

What did we overcome? When did we grow? How did we rise?\n'The only way, together. Isn't that union at the core of this day? And this glorious, chaotic, exasperating experiment that is us?\n\n'The only way, together. Isn't that union at the core of this day? And this glorious, chaotic, exasperating experiment that is us?' Pitt says in the ad\n\nPitt is just one of the many big names appearing on small screens today throughout the Super Bowl\n'As we convene with our circles today, as we witness a piece of our culture play out, we honor the ways these players compete, so their teams might prevail.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy TERRY ZELLER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:23:34 GMT, 9 February 2025 |Updated:00:46 GMT, 10 February 2025 \n\nBlue Ivy, Beyoncé's stylish daughter, totally stole the show at Super Bowl 2025, rocking her mom’s signature look like a pro. \nThe 13-year-old, already a budding fashion icon in her own right, turned heads in a chic, oversized leather jacket paired with casual cargo denim.\nHer curly hair framed her face perfectly, paired with dark sunglasses and a bold cheetah-print purse.\nBlue Ivy was joined by her father Jay-Z and younger sister Rumi, 7, marking their second consecutive year attending the big game, this time witnessing the showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nNot in attendance were Beyoncé and Rumi's twin Sir.\nThis Super Bowl appearance comes right after fans started buzzing about the 2025 Grammys, thinking Jay-Z might’ve tried to warn Beyoncé about a possible wardrobe mishap before her acceptance speech. \n\nBlue Ivy, Beyoncé's stylish daughter, totally stole the show at Super Bowl 2025, rocking her mom’s signature look like a pro\n\nThe 13-year-old, already a budding fashion icon in her own right, turned heads in a chic, oversized leather jacket paired with casual cargo denim\nAt the Grammys, Beyoncé’s album Cowboy Carter took home several major awards at the 2025 Grammys, including Album of the Year, Best Country Album, and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.\nDuring her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, she was joined by Blue Ivy on stage. \n'Wow, I want to thank God that I'm able to still do what I love after so many years. Oh, my God, I'd like to thank all of the incredible country artists that accepted this, this album we worked so hard on it,' Beyoncé said. \n\n Super Bowl commercials pay celebrities millions \n'I’d like to thank my beautiful family, all of the artists that were collaborators,' she added, noting collaborators like Linda Martell and Miley Cyrus. \n'Thank you. This wouldn’t have been this album without you. Like to thank God again and my fans. And I still am in shock, thank you so much for this honor.'\nAs Beyoncé gave a heartfelt speech to the star-studded crowd, eagle-eyed viewers noticed that the underwire of her stunning Schiaparelli gown was poking out - and looked rather uncomfortable.\nSinger Chauntee Ross was quick to spot the malfunction and posted a video about it on TikTok, which has since been viewed 1.9 million times.\nIn the 17-second clip, Chauntee zooms in on her television screen and Beyoncé's cleavage and shouted: 'Who dressed her? Her bra wire's popping out!'\n\nAt the Grammys, Beyoncé’s album Cowboy Carter took home several major awards at the 2025 Grammys, including Album of the Year, Best Country Album, and Best Country Duo/Group Performance and during her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, she was joined by Blue Ivy on stage (R:Beyonce in 2023)\n\nHer curly hair framed her face perfectly, paired with dark sunglasses and a bold cheetah-print purse\n\nBlue Ivy was joined by her father Jay-Z and younger sister Rumi, 7, marking their second consecutive year attending the big game , this time witnessing the showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles\n\nNot in attendance were Beyoncé and Rumi's twin Sir\n\nJay-Z took a few fun photos of Rumi\n\nBlue Ivy got in on the action too\n\nBeyonce and Blue Ivy stunned at the premiere of Mufasa: The Lion King in December\n\nMany were quick to comment on the post, as one person claimed: 'As someone who makes dresses I immediately saw that the dressmaker forgot to do the few top stitches after inserting wires.'\n'I felt so bad for her!! We've all been there girl but not on the Grammys,' another TikTok user said.\nBut fans are convinced that the hitmaker was aware of the mishap - and husband Jay-Z had even tried to warn her about it when he whispered something in her ear before she went onstage.\nBeyoncé was seen attempting to subtly adjust her gold dress, but unfortunately the white underwire was still on show as she accepted her accolade from Taylor Swift.\nPosting a short clip of the moment on X, formerly Twitter, someone wrote: 'JAY-Z telling his wife Beyoncé that the underwire of her bra was showing before she went on stage.'\nOthers were quick to comment on the video as one person said: 'That's real love always looking out for each other.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBeyonce's girl Blue Ivy looks just like mom at Super Bowl 2025 with Jay Z as rarely seen daughter Rumi joins\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nTaylor Swift opts against Chiefs colors as she dons white suit to take in Super Bowl with her A-list posse\n\nIs that you Beyonce?

Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday. He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country. And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them, Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan. A Canadian government source told Reuters that Ottawa would not react to Trump's steel and aluminum tariff announcement until it has more information or sees a written order from Trump. Trump also said that while the U.S. government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in U.S. Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake. Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management, Trump said of U.S. Steel. Nippon Steel declined to comment on the latest announcements from Trump. QUOTA QUESTIONS Trump during his first term imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil. Former President Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what will happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements. Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80% in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices. A Missouri aluminum smelter revived by the tariffs was idled last year by Magnitude 7 Metals. According to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data, the largest sources of U.S. steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam. By a large margin, hydro power-rich Canada is the largest supplier of primary aluminum metal to the United States, accounting for 79% of total imports in the first 11 months of 2024. Mexico is a major supplier of aluminum scrap and aluminum alloy. The Trump administration is threatening to attack the aluminum and steel sectors - sectors where the United States depends largely (on others). Quebec exports 2.9 million tons of aluminum to them, that is, 60% of their needs. Do they prefer to get supplies from China?, Francois Legault, premier of Quebec - a major aluminum supplier, said on X. All this shows that we must begin to renegotiate our free trade agreement with the United States as soon as possible and not wait for the review planned for 2026. We must put an end to this uncertainty. MATCHING RATES Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday or Wednesday to provide detailed information on the reciprocal tariff plan, adding that he first revealed on Friday that he was planning reciprocal tariffs to ensure that we're treated evenly with other countries. The new U.S. president has long complained about the EU's 10% tariffs on auto imports being much higher than the U.S. car rate of 2.5%. He frequently states that Europe won't take our cars but ships millions west across the Atlantic every year. The U.S., however, enjoys a 25% tariff on pickup trucks, a vital source of profits for Detroit automakers General Motors , Ford and Stellantis' U.S. operations. The U.S. trade-weighted average tariff rate is about 2.2%, according to World Trade Organization data, compared to 12% for India, 6.7% for Brazil, 5.1% for Vietnam and 2.7% for European Union countries. BORDER STEPS In a separate Fox News interview, Trump said Canada's and Mexico's actions to secure their U.S. borders and halt the flow of drugs and migrants are insufficient ahead of a March 1 tariff deadline. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on all Mexican and Canadian imports unless America's two largest trading partners take stronger actions. He paused the tariffs until March 1 after some initial border security concessions from the two countries, with Mexico pledging to add 10,000 National Guard troops to its border and Canada deploying new technology and personnel and taking new anti-fentanyl steps. Asked whether Mexico's and Canada's actions were good enough, Trump replied: No, it's not good enough, Trump said. Something has to happen, it's not sustainable, and I'm changing it. Trump did not say what Canada and Mexico needed to do to avoid broad tariffs on March 1.","summary":"President Donald Trump announced plans to impose new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports and introduce reciprocal tariffs on other goods. The announcements come ahead of a Monday confirmation, with significant implications for U.S. trade relations with Canada, Mexico, and major aluminum suppliers.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-to-announce-25-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-in-latest-trade-escalation/articleshow/118101203.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118101217,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-80824,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:44:47","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":288775834,"title":"Lady Gaga leaves fans in tears as she delivers a heartfelt Super Bowl 2025 performance in New Orleans","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Feb 10th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Swift is joined by Ice Spice and Este Haim as she dons white suit to take in Super Bowl with her A-list posse\n\nAs Trump blasts 'terrible' Meghan, her Prince Charming Harry takes a swipe at 'crises, uncertainty and weak moral character in the world'… who COULD he be talking about?\n\nGino D'Acampo 'made vile sexual remarks about Holly Willoughby as it's claimed ITV ignored complaints after being 'warned' about star's behaviour a DECADE ago\n\nYoung Labour MP is unmasked as second Westminster member in vile WhatsApp group in which racist, sexist and anti-Semitic messages were exchanged\n\nKremlin bizarrely demands consular access and a face-to-face meeting with Sergei and Yulia Skripal… seven years after Putin's goons botched assassination attempt on them in Salisbury\n\nI was raped by Ronnie Kray.

The Mirror US can exclusively reveal that the singer-songwriter, who turned heads at The Grammy's in a thigh-flashing mini-dress, is shelling out an estimated $650k for her plush pad for the duration. She's said to be renting the property from a designer.\n\nThe sprawling mansion is a gated property and offers incredible privacy. Set on a vast estate, the ivory detached house boasts its own luxurious drive and is nestled against an idyllic backdrop.\n\nThe 2025 Super Bowl sees the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles. Top celebrities including Taylor Swift will be in attendance as rapper Kendrick takes to the stage during half-time.\n\n Meanwhile, Taylor and Brittany Mahomes, wife of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have been spotted together frequently over the past year, not just at Kansas City Chiefs games but also dining out in NYC. The 35 year old, who's dating Travis Kelce, has been building relationships with the partners of his teammates, including Brittany. \n\nThe pair were first spotted dining together before a Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets, and later seen watching the match from a box at MetLife Stadium. They continued to be seen at other games, with Taylor introducing Brittany to some of her closest friends in NYC, including Selena Gomez, Sophie Turner and Gigi Hadid.\n\nRumours circulated that their friendship had hit a rocky patch due to differing political views - Taylor being an outspoken supporter of Kamala Harris during the last election, while Brittany showed her support for Donald Trump. However, they quickly quashed these rumours when they were seen embracing at a Kansas City Chiefs game amid the election race.\n\nOn September 30, 2023, Taylor and Brittany enjoyed a meal at Emilio's Ballato, an Italian restaurant in NYC, along with Sophie Turner and Blake Lively. A source told People: \"They dined in a private room. Everyone had a blast. They all got along and were just laughing all night over drinks and delicious food.\"\n\nThe two friends were then regularly seen together at NFL games and on October 13 they shared a hug at Arrowhead Stadium while cheering for their partners.\n\nLike this story?

If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vance wrote on X on Sunday morning.\n\nThat post came hours after Musk said overnight that the judge who ruled against him should be impeached.\n\n“A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!” said Musk, who has been tasked by President Donald Trump with rooting out waste across the federal government.\n\nMusk also shared a post from a user who had suggested that the Trump administration openly defy the court order.\n\n“I don’t like the precedent it sets when you defy a judicial ruling, but I’m just wondering what other options are these judges leaving us,” the person had written, in part.\n\nThe court order against Musk barred his team temporarily from accessing a Treasury system that contains sensitive personal data, such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. Musk and his team say they are simply rooting through government systems to identify waste and abuse at the direction of the Republican president.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller called the ruling “an assault on the very idea of democracy itself.”\n\n“What we continue to see here is the idea that rogue bureaucrats who are elected by no one, who answer to no one, who have lifetime tenure jobs, who we would be told can never be fired, which, of course, is not true, that the power has been cemented and accumulated for years, whether it be with the Treasury bureaucrats or the FBI bureaucrats or the CIA bureaucrats or the USAID bureaucrats, with this unelected shadow force that is running our government and running our country,” Miller said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”\n\nThe pushback comes as the administration’s efforts to dismantle government agencies and eliminate large swaths of the federal workforce are being held up by the courts. Judges have also blocked Trump, at least temporarily, from moving forward with mass federal buyouts, from placing thousands of USAID workers on leave and from implementing an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S.\n\nEarly Saturday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued, alleging the Trump administration allowed Musk’s team access to the Treasury Department’s central payment system in violation of federal law.\n\n“We’re very disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling, but we have a long way to go,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. He added: “No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision.”\n\nThe payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans’ benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans’ personal and financial data. A hearing is set for Feb. 14.\n\nDemocrats have been sounding alarms over Musk and Trump’s efforts, including efforts to halt spending that has already been appropriated by Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is the body in charge of spending.\n\n“I think this is the most serious Constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly, since Watergate,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on ABC’s “This Week.” “This is a red alert moment when this entire country has to understand that our democracy is at risk.”\n\nMurphy expressed concern that the courts are ill-prepared for the onslaught they are facing.\n\n“The pace of this assault on the Constitution in order to serve the billionaire class, it is absolutely dizzying. And so, you have to run a full-scale opposition,” Murphy said. “Ultimately, you’ve got to bring the American public into this conversation because we need our Republican colleagues in the House and in the Senate ultimately to put a stop to this. You cannot just rely on the court system.”\n\nRepublicans, who have largely stood in lockstep behind the president since he was sworn in for a second term, did so again on Sunday.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan blasted the court ruling for the Treasury Department case while arguing that the president should be able to implement his agenda as he sees fit.\n\n“I assume we will argue this out in court, like the other 17 or 18 decisions we have seen in the last several days. That all is going to get argued out in court. And, frankly, we knew the left, we knew the Democrats were going to do this,” the Republican said on CNN’s “Inside Politics.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON &#8212; Top Trump administration officials are openly questioning the judiciary&#8217;s authority&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vance and Musk challenge court authority as Trump&#8217;s plans encounter legal resistance first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/vance-and-musk-challenge-court-authority-as-trumps-plans-encounter-legal-resistance/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1739147883_rewrite-this-title-Vance-and-Musk-question-the-authority-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:38:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":288774590,"title":"Investors return to new-look ME, but Trump causes some concern","text":"LONDON/JERUSALEM: A historic shake-up of the Middle East is starting to draw international investors, warming to the prospects of relative peace and economic recovery after so much turmoil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s proposal that the US take over Gaza may have thrown a curveball into the mix, but the fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, Bashar al-Assad’s ouster from Syria, a weakened Iran and a new government in Lebanon have fed hopes of a reset.\n\nEgypt, the region’s most populous country and a key negotiator in the recent peace talks, has just managed its first dollar debt sale in four years.

It acknowledges the complexities, but it is a welcome possibility as Israel readies its first major debt sale since the truce was signed.\n\nMichael Fertik, a US venture capitalist and CEO of artificial intelligence firm Modelcode.ai, said the easing of tensions had contributed to his decision to open an Israeli subsidiary.\n\nHe is eager to hire skilled local software programmers, but geopolitics have been a factor too.\n\n“With Trump in the White House, no one doubts the United States has Israel’s back in a fight,” he said, explaining how it provided predictability even if the war re-ignites.\n\nHaving largely stayed away when Israel ramped up spending on the war, bond investors are also starting to come back, central bank data shows.\n\nEconomy Minister Nir Barkat told Reuters in an interview last month that he will be seeking a more generous spending package focusing on “bold economic growth.”\n\nThe snag for stock investors though, is that Israel was one of the best performing markets in the world in the 18 months after the October 7, 2023 attacks. Since the ceasefire - which has coincided with a sizable US tech selloff - it has been in retreat.\n\n“During 2024, I think we learned that the market is not really afraid of the war but rather the internal political conflict and tensions,” said Sabina Levy, head of research at Leader Capital Markets in Tel Aviv.\n\nAnd if the ceasefire buckles? “It is reasonable to assume a negative reaction.”\n\nSome investors have already reacted badly to Trump’s surprise Gaza move.\n\nYerlan Syzdykov, head of emerging markets at Europe’s biggest asset manager Amundi, said his firm had bought up Egypt’s bonds after the ceasefire deal, but Trump’s plan - which foresees Cairo and Jordan accepting 2 million Palestinian refugees - has changed that.\n\nBoth countries have baulked at Trump’s idea but the risk is, Syzdykov explained, that the US president uses Egypt’s reliance on bilateral and IMF support to try to strong arm the country given its recent brush with a full-blown economic crisis.\n\nReducing the attacks by Yemen’s Houthi fighters on ships in the Red Sea also remains crucial. The country lost $7 billion - more than 60% - of its Suez Canal revenues last year as shippers diverted around Africa rather than risk ambush.\n\n“Markets are unlikely to like the idea of Egypt losing such (bilateral and multilateral) support, and we are taking a more cautious stance to see how these negotiations will unfold,” Syzdykov said.\n\nOthers expect the rebuilding of bombed homes and infrastructure in Syria and elsewhere to be an opportunity for Turkey’s heavyweight construction firms.\n\nTrump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has said it could take 10 to 15 years to rebuild Gaza. The World Bank, meanwhile, puts Lebanon’s damage at $8.5 billion, roughly 35% of its GDP.\n\nBeirut’s default-stricken bonds more than doubled in price when it became clear in September that Hezbollah’s grip in Lebanon was being weakened and have continued to rise on hopes the country’s crisis is addressed.\n\nLebanon’s new President Michel Aoun’s first state visit will be to Saudi Arabia, a country seen as a potential key supporter, and one that likely sees this as an opportunity to further remove Lebanon from Iran’s sphere of influence.\n\nBondholders say there have been preliminary contacts with the new authorities too.\n\n“Lebanon could be a big story in 2025 if we make progress towards a debt restructuring,” Magda Branet, head of emerging markets fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, said.\n\n“It is not going to be easy” though she added, given the country’s track record, the $45 billion of debt that needs reworking and that Lebanese savers could see some of their money seized by the government as part of the plan.","summary":"LONDON/JERUSALEM: A historic shake-up of the Middle East is starting to draw international investors, warming to the prospects of relative peace and economic recovery after so much turmoil.\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s proposal that the US take over Gaza may have thrown a curveball into the mix, but the fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war, Bashar al-Assad’s ouster from Syria, a weakened Iran and a new government in Lebanon have fed hopes of a reset.\n\n\nEgypt, the region’s most populous country and a key negotiator in the recent peace talks, has just managed its first dollar debt sale in four years.

The pop star showed up to Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans on Sunday, and the fans there gave her a loud chorus of boos when she was shown on the Caesars Superdome jumbotron. SIGN UP FOR TUBI AND STREAM SUPER BOWL LIX FOR FREE Swift didn't look as if she was too familiar or comfortable being booed by a large crowd as her expression turned to visibly nervous confusion once the chorus began. Swift is attending her second Super Bowl after showing up at last year's big game in Las Vegas to cheer on her boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Many NFL fans have come to be critical of the constant displaying of Swift during broadcasts and on jumbotrons dating back to last season. Her booing by the crowd also coincided with a heavy barrage of boos that welcomed the Chiefs as a team when they ran through the tunnel prior to the game. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Swift, as Kelce's girlfriend, has quickly become an iconic figure within the Chiefs franchise. But Swift's football roots are with the Eagles, as she grew up an Eagles fan in Pennsylvania. Swift and her father abandoned this fandom when she started dating Kelce last season, so the crowd treated her accordingly in New Orleans. And before Swift was booed relentlessly by the Superdome crowd, that same crowd gave a raucous cheer to President Donald Trump when he was shown on screen prior to the game. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump was standing in between New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson and Trump's daughter, Ivanka, during the national anthem, which also received a loud roar from the crowd before kickoff. Swift infamously endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election on Sept. 10. Days after Swift announced her endorsement, Trump sent a post on Truth Social that read \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" The crowd in the Superdome on Sunday seems to be more aligned with Trump on that argument.

From neigbouring Canada to Mexico, to Panama, Brazil, and even Africa, the last two weeks have not been the best for many world leaders who are still trying to work out how to deal with the man inside the White House. Many are afraid of him, some feel intimidated, and few are bewildered and flabbergasted.If there is one president that is set to impact world politics for good and also possibly for bad in the next few years, Donald Trump would clinch the top spot. And make no mistake about it, by the end of his second term in 2029, if eventually he decides not to pursue a third term ticket (he has already joked about it), America and nay, world politics would never be the same.Trump’s return to power after a four-year hiatus has seen him firing on all cylinders. Even at 78, age has not showed any sign of slowing him down. He is also out with a vengeance against those whom he perceives as enemies who facilitated his 2020 presidential election loss to Joe Biden.Trump is the first convicted felon in America’s history to occupy the White House, having been found guilty of 34 counts of felony in the Stormy Daniel, hush money, record-falsification case. But that does not bother him as he has told his supporters that he is the most prosecuted president in history. His sentencing was put off after he became president-elect. Over 77 million Americans believe in him and cast their votes for him in the last elections.From his first day in office, Trump showed that he meant business about making ‘America GREAT again.’ However, with the ways he is going about it, it is in doubt whether America would be as great as he has promised or it would be brought to its knees in the next couple of years.The 47th president of the United States of America is a dealer in government, no, cancel that, he is a bully in the White House. It appears that there is no president or prime minister that would not be ‘bullied’ for the ‘benefit’ of Americans. There is no institution that cannot be downgraded so far as President Trump does not believe in what they stand for.He has signed dozens of executive orders freezing all foreign assistance, removing illegal immigrants from the United States, firing civil servants, and asking Elon Musk to “cut the fat out of the unnecessary bureaucracy and trim the federal departments.”He is banning automatic citizenship of children born in the States by illegal immigrants, he has recognised only two genders – male and female, withdrawn the USA from the World Health Organisation (WHO), and has stopped the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) from communicating with the WHO.He has also withdrawn America from the UNESCO and from the Climate Change Convention. Mercifully, he has not withdrawn yet from the UN and its specialized organizations and NATO. Although, some of these actions requires legislative support, and some, constitutional amendments, Trump does not care. One of such is the birth-right issue. Any child born in the United States of America automatically becomes an American citizen. It is so recognised by the constitution of the United States. To change the law would require two-third majority of the states in the US to effect it. But Trump wants an end to the policy. Already, a federal judge has blocked the order – albeit, temporarily.He has bullied the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and the President of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum into negotiating how they intend to stop illegal migrants from getting into the United States as well as the curtailment of illegal drugs shipments into the USA. His desire is to make Canada the 51th States of the USA and he does not care if his action and utterances is against international laws and conventions. Trump has unilaterally changed the Gulf of Mexico into the ‘Gulf of America’. He has set his sights on Greenland, an Arctic Island under the control of Denmark as well as The Panama Canal, a critical waterway in world trade. Trump is interested in the Canal as he believes that China has surreptitiously taken over control of the area.Before he was sworn-in, Trump vowed to send illegal migrants back to their respective countries. From his first day in office, he has done just that. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has fulfilled that key campaign promise of Trump in his first week in power by removing 7,300 illegal immigrants from the United States. The move is part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration and a direct response to President Donald Trump’s vow to increase deportations, especially targeting violent criminals in the country. Many of those deported were in handcuffs and ferried back to their countries in military aircrafts.Columbia and Guatemala initially rejected the poor treatment of her citizens but after being threatened and bullied with economic sanctions, both nations had to relent. Indeed, a trade war could have had crippling consequences for Colombia, which counts the United States as its largest trading partner. That is largely due to a 2006 free trade agreement that generated $33.8 billion in two-way trade in 2023, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon’s response to Trump’s national emergency declaration on immigration. The Pentagon had said that it would provide flights for the deportations of more than 5,000 immigrants held by U.S. authorities in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California.His controversial plan to move Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan and Egypt and for the USA to take over Gaza has been condemned, with many Palestinians vowing not to leave their ancestral homes.Hear him: “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent. The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area…” Trump said, without explaining why they could not let Gazans rebuild Gaza.Expectedly, Trump’s stunning realty-centric proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including America’s ally, Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.Some aides of Trump have suggested that the US President was merely grandstanding and his remarks were aimed at galvanizing other Arab states to come up with solutions rather than leave Palestinians in the lurch. “It’s going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions,” Trump’s National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said in one TV interview.Many world leaders are still in shock by his audacious proposal. Where he gets such a power is still not clear to many. Indeed, Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was really angry when he said that Donald Trump was elected to govern the United States, and not “to rule the world.”“I respect the election of President Trump, who was elected by the American people to govern the United States, but he was not elected to rule the world. The U.S. president has to maintain democratic and civilised relations with the rest of the world”, Lula noted, with reference to Trump’s intention to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.On the home front and using Elon Musk, Trump has reinstated service members dismissed for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine; stopped the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, DEI, programmes across federal government establishments, paused federal grants and loans, tried to entice millions of federal workers to resign in a bid to drastically reduce the size of the federal work force, and to push out people who do not support his political agenda. In return, the administration offered roughly two million federal workers the option to resign but be paid through the end of September.Aside granting pardon to the January 6 rioters in the US, he has ordered the Acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to compile a list of all agents and FBI staff who worked on the January 6 investigations. He has shut down USAID office across the globe and put Marco Rubio in charge. Now, there are talks that he would allow less than 10 per cent of USAID workforce back to their jobs.In Africa, Trump has falsely accused the South African government of “confiscating land” from white farmers. But President Cyril Ramaphosa said his country has not seized land and urged Trump to mind his business. “We won’t be bullied by Trump”, he said. Without any consultation, Trump ordered air strikes against the Islamic State in Somalia.Coming home to Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu has been advised to get a long spoon while eating on the same table with Trump. Bolaji Akinyemi, former external Affairs Minister, said that Tinubu must learn to avoid getting into trouble with Trump. Already, the Foreign Affairs Ministry and NIDCOM are making preparations on how to receive Nigerians who may be deported back to the country by Trump.Americans voted for Trump and he is acting on what he promised during his campaign. Although prices of foodstuffs have been on the increase since the clampdown on illegal migrants began as many farm workers are being repatriated, Americans should be ready to endure the necessary pains.His conduct when it comes to international politics is where he may have his fingers burnt. You don’t become a bully at international fora, no matter your military might. Trump might think that he is just doing deals to better the lot of the American citizens, but it should be clear to him that the correct terms for what he is doing are coercion and extortion. He is a bully both in the USA and in the international arena. He should be reminded however that there are known bullies in world history and the end of some of them wasn’t that palatable.\n\nAs for those of us in Nigeria, having enjoyed the movie ‘Coming To America’ and with most having literally lived the American dream, the rest of us should simply get our popcorn ready to watch the ongoing season film, ‘Coming from America’.See you next week.","summary":"President Donlad Trump is yet to spend one month in office as the 47th President of the United States of America but his actions and pronouncements are being felt in all corners of the globe.

Their hard work, dedication, and tenacity is admirable, and their individual journeys are as inspiring as the drive and determination that has led them to this extraordinary moment,” he said in a message shared by the White House.\n\nFootball is also, Trump noted, the nation’s most popular sport.\n\n“For good reason — it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities,” the president said.\n\nThe Super Bowl itself, Trump said, is an annual American family tradition that somehow “transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom heroically defended by our military service members, law enforcement officers, and first responders.”\n\nAhead of his appearance at the Superdome in New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX and a highly anticipated matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and returning champions the Kansas City Chiefs, Trump sat down with Fox News’ Bret Baier. That’s when he learned he was the first sitting U.S. president to attend the big game.\n\n“I’m very surprised to hear that. I would have assumed many presidents came,” Trump said.\n\nStill, Trump said, since his inauguration the country has taken on “a whole new life,” and so his appearance at what could be the most widely viewed telecast event in history “is a good thing for the country. It’s an iconic day.”\n\nHe also used the occasion to express condolences to the victims and families of those killed or injured during a New Year’s Day terrorist attack on Bourbon Street.\n\nWhile many people would travel to New Orleans to celebrate this year’s Super Bowl, Trump called on everyone to “remember that 14 families will be missing a loved one who was tragically murdered during a senseless terrorist attack while celebrating the New Year on Bourbon Street.”\n\n“Our thoughts are also with the 35 individuals injured during the attack whose lives were changed forever that fateful night, and our prayers will remain with them for continued strength, comfort, and healing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the White House, upon arrival to Caesars Superdome on Sunday, the President was scheduled to participate in a meet and greet with the honorary coin toss participants, which included family members of the victims from the New Year’s terrorist attack and members of the New Orleans Police Department.\n\nAlthough Trump’s visit to the Super Bowl represents the first time a sitting president made it to the game, it’s not the first time Trump has attended an NFL season finale. The former reality star, who briefly and unsuccessfully dabbled in professional football ownership before his career in politics began, attended Super Bowl XXVI in 1992, when the former Washington Red Skins beat the Buffalo Bills 37-24.\n\nTrump was coy about who he thought might win this year’s Vince Lombardi Trophy in the days leading up to the championship game, but told Fox News he’s leaning toward the Chiefs due to quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ history of winning high-pressure games.\n\n“I guess you have to say that when a quarterback wins as much as he’s won, I have to go with Kansas City,” Trump said. “He’s a great, great quarterback.”","summary":"“I’m very surprised to hear that.

We are well placed, we are well prepared,' he told ABC News Breakfast on February 4.\n\n'The Americans run a trade surplus with us, they have done since the Truman Administration I think in 1952, a substantial trade surplus. \n\n'Our relationship is mutually beneficial, and all of the conversations that we'll have with our American counterparts will be about making sure that this really key economic relationship continues to be beneficial to both sides.'\n\nIn 2023, the United States had a $US17.7billion goods trade surplus with Australia, which would be worth $A27.2bilion at today's exchange rate of 63 US cents. \n\nTrump's announcement will affect steel workers at Port Kembla (BlueScope staff pictured), near Wollongong, and Whyalla, in South Australia , along with aluminium manufacturers in Newcastle \n\nGrim reality of what Trump's savage tariff trade war could mean for ALL Australian families\n\nThe United States is Australia's third biggest two-way trading trading partner, but only the fifth biggest export market behind China, Japan, South Korea and India, who are bigger buyers of Australian iron ore and coal.\n\nThe Australian share market's benchmark S&P/ASX200 was 0.5 per cent weaker on Monday morning, following the announcement. \n\nWhile Trump had campaigned to reintroduce hefty tariff barriers in 2024, he had also given hints since coming to office that tariffs could be used as a negotiating tactic. \n\nDuring his first term in the White House, he repeatedly expressed concerns about American trading partners that sold more goods to the U.S. than it bought from them. \n\nThe Trump Administration's wider-ranging tariffs in 2025 are set to mark the most punitive import restrictions since the 1930 Smoot Hawley Tariff Act.\n\nChina imposed heavier tariffs on Australia during the Covid pandemic despite having a free-trade deal with Australia since 2015, after then prime minister Scott Morrison called for an inquiry into the organ's of Covid. \n\nDonald TrumpMalcolm Turnbull\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nPresident Donald Trump announces sweeping new tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum: What it means for you\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Australian steel and aluminium will be slapped with 25 per cent tariffs - with no exemption applying like it did in 2018.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14378797/President-Donald-Trump-announces-sweeping-new-tariffs-Australian-steel-aluminum-means-you.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95034917-0-image-a-7_1739143428905.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:23:31","author":"Editor,Stephen Johnson","authors":["Editor","Stephen Johnson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.07},{"id":288775820,"title":"Is Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship dead?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CARLY JOHNSON and EVE BUCKLAND FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:01 GMT, 10 February 2025 |Updated:00:21 GMT, 10 February 2025 \n\nBlake Lively was noticeably absent from Super Bowl LIX amid rumors her ugly legal battle with Justin Baldoni has led to a 'falling out' between her and BFF Taylor Swift. \nLively was famously part of Swift's Super Bowl squad in 2024 along with Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and Keleigh Sperry as they cheered on Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs from a VIP suite at Allegiant Stadium.\nBut this year, Lively was nowhere in sight as Swift made her grand entrance to New Orleans' Caesars Superdome, where the Chiefs faced off against the Philadelphia Eagles.\nSwift swapped Lively out for Este Haim and Ice Spice got an invite back as she took her seat inside the 83,000 seat stadium. \nLively's absence from Sunday's big game further fuels speculation that the explosive It Ends With Us lawsuits have put her 10-year friendship with Swift in jeopardy.\nA source recently told TMZ that Swift 'feels used' by Lively after Baldoni claimed in his $400 million lawsuit that Lively used Swift to intimidate him at a meeting with her husband Ryan Reynolds about edits she had made to a rooftop scene in their film, It Ends with Us. \n\nBlake Lively was noticeably absent from Super Bowl LIX amid rumors her ugly legal battle with Justin Baldoni has led to a 'falling out' between her and BFF Taylor Swift\n\nSwift arrived to the Super Bowl 2025 dressed in white\n\nIce Spice (left) and Este Haim (right) were among the A-list celebs joining Swift at the game - but Blake was not in attendance \nIn his suit, filed last month, Baldoni said Swift showed up and made him feel like he 'needed to comply with Blake's direction for the script'.\nLively compared herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi in a series of text messages to Baldoni in which she referred to Reynolds, 48, and her best friend as her 'dragons'.\nNow it has been claimed Swift 'resents' Lively for 'calling her one of her dragons and leveraging her name', with a source claiming to TMZ that she was blindsided over the meeting with Baldoni.\n\nEXCLUSIVE How Taylor Swift tried to 'tone down' Blake Lively years before Justin Baldoni legal nightmare \nThe source claimed Swift came to Lively's apartment when she was told by the actress and had 'no idea' that Baldoni would be there.\nThe source said Baldoni was about to leave after the two hour meeting when Swift walked in and was introduced to him for the 'first and only time.'\nSwift told Baldoni how excited she was to see the movie 'because he was her friend's boss' according to the source.\nThey also claim Swift believes Lively 'timed' her meeting with Baldoni so she would arrive before he left.\nSwift was also said to be 'baffled' by Lively calling her a 'dragon' adding: 'It's weird to say that about a friend.'\nIt was further claimed by the source that Swift has learned Lively has been 'inappropriately leveraging her name for a long time, like telling a young actress that Taylor 'cast her,' which simply did not happen.'\n\nLively was famously part of Swift's Super Bowl squad in 2024 along with Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and Keleigh Sperry as they cheered on Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs from a VIP suite at Allegiant Stadium; seen in 2024 \n\nA source recently told TMZ that Swift 'feels used' by Lively after Baldoni claimed in his $400 million lawsuit that Lively used Swift to intimidate him at a meeting with her husband Ryan Reynolds about edits she had made to a rooftop scene in their film, It Ends with Us \nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Taylor Swift, Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni for comment. \nAlso on Thursday, numerous sources insisted to Us Weekly that Swift had 'no involvement' in the making of It Ends With Us.\n'Taylor has always been Blake's friend, but Taylor doesn't have any involvement in the case. She wasn't part of the movie,' one insider claimed.\n'Taylor was not a producer on the film and had no creative involvement.' \nAnother source pointed out that Swift was on her Eras Tour while the film was shooting in 2023 and 2024.\n'Taylor never even saw the film or a single scene from it until the movie was in theaters. She is not relevant to the case,' they added.\nA different source told the outlet that dragging Swift into Lively and Baldoni's legal battle is 'unnecessary.'\n'While she and Blake are friends, this case is now a legal matter for the courts to resolve. Dragging Taylor into it is unnecessary and misrepresents what really happened,' they said.\nThis comes after insiders claimed Swift tried to help her close friend Lively 'tone down' her 'ballsy' nature years before the actress' legal roller coaster with Baldoni.\nThe Gossip Girl alum is currently locked in a bitter battle with her It Ends With Us co-star whom she accused of sexual harassment and launching a smear campaign against her in a bombshell lawsuit last year. \nBaldoni now countersuing both Lively and her husband Reynolds for $400 million, and shocked the world when he dragged Swift into the explosive legal feud. \n\nLively compared herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi in a series of text messages to Baldoni in which she referred to Reynolds, 48, and Swift as her 'dragons'\nThe messy spat between Lively and Baldoni has seen her past behavior come under scrutiny as the public casts judgement with each new update.\nInsiders claim Swift had tried to advise her pal about going 'full throttle' in the years before the saga.\n'Taylor Swift admires that Blake Lively is a ballsy chick who speaks her mind, swears like a trooper and refuses to be controlled by anyone,' a source told DailyMail.com.\n'That's the real reason they bonded and became firm friends when they first met 10 years ago.'\nThey continued: 'Taylor saw her doppelgänger in Blake. The main difference between them is that Taylor is more subtle. Blake has always gone full throttle about everything. She never holds back and that's what has caused the tide to turn on her.\n'Taylor has tried to help tone Blake down in the past, but she now knows it's never going to happen.' \nThey finished: 'Right now, while they're still close, there's a slight shift because of the It Ends With Us drama. Taylor doesn't like the fact that she's been dragged into it.'\nThe idea of Swift pulling back came as a shock to fans of the pair who have been friends for a decade, celebrating milestones together, with Swift even name dropping Lively's children in her music.\nIn fact, the singer's music became a part of the legal back and forth after Baldoni claimed in the lawsuit Lively leveraged her friendship with the Grammy-winner to get her way behind the scenes.\nAccording to Baldoni's lawsuit, Lively threatened to withhold approval of the film trailer if she did not get extra time working on a cut of the movie with her own personal editor. \nHe claimed in the suit that the actress threatened to 'change her mind' about reaching out to Swift to secure the use of her hit 2020 track My Tears Ricochet.\n\nThe singer's music became a part of the legal back and forth after Baldoni claimed Lively leveraged her friendship with the Grammy-winner to get her own way behind the scenes\n\nBaldoni claimed Lively threatened to 'change her mind' about reaching out to Swift to secure the use of her hit 2020 track My Tears Ricochet\nThe track, which is from Taylor's folklore album, was eventually used in the trailer but Baldoni alleged that Lively tried to use her friendship with the singer to make sure her demands were met. \nAn alleged text exchange with a Sony executive read: 'Blake is calling Taylor to approve the song. She of course just reached out saying she is asking for time with [REDACTED] her editor. We know it was conditional on signing contract – but asking if you will reconsider – so [REDACTED] can release this trailer and Blake does not change her me re calling Taylor Swift.'\nBaldoni noted that they agreed to her demands in order to move forward as planned. The exchange allegedly took place in May 2024.\nSwift appeared to rally around Lively when rumor of a troubling rift between the actress and Baldoni first started bubbling by August.\nShe was pictured arriving at Swift's Rhode Island property, taking solace at the $17 million, eight bedroom estate alongside her husband Reynolds, to escape the frenzy. \nAt the time Lively was being called out for her 'tone deaf' marketing, apparently dismissing interview questions about domestic violence – a major theme in the movie – in favour of telling people to grab their 'florals' and head to the cinema. \nOthers accused her of using the attention to plug her alcohol brand Betty Booze.\nResurfaced interviews showing the actress being 'rude' to reporters also went viral on social media.\nLively and Swift were last pictured together in October on a double date with Deadpool actor Reynolds and Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce in Manhattan. \n\nSwift appeared to rally around Lively when rumor of a troubling rift between the actress and Baldoni first started bubbling by August (pictured 2023)\nThe outing came two months before she filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department in which she accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and creating a toxic environment on the set of It Ends with Us.\nAt the same time, the New York Times released a story based on her legal filing that accused him of orchestrating a smear campaign against her. \nSwift was then pulled into the roller coaster saga when Baldoni fired back with a stinging counter suit against Lively and Reynolds in which he accused the Hollywood couple of conspiring to trash his reputation.\nIt Ends with Us was a box-office hit, earning $351 million worldwide despite a $25 million budget.\nBased on the best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover, no update has been made about an adaptation of the sequel book, It Starts with Us.\nBaldoni, Lively and the NYT have all denied the claims levelled against them. \nJustin BaldoniTaylor SwiftBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nIs Taylor Swift and Blake Lively's friendship dead?

The Speaker previously attended a UFC event with Trump last year.\n\nBut his appearance alongside the president is given special meaning this weekend as Johnson is now facing one of his toughest political battles as Speaker — a bid to craft budget legislation that will satisfy all sides of the Republican Party, from the president to the disparate groups that make up the House and Senate Republican caucuses.\n\nJohnson is coming up against a government funding deadline in mid-March, while also seeking to craft a long-term funding bill that can unify his caucus in the House and pass the chamber without Democratic votes. It’s a difficult prospect as just a three-vote margin splits the two parties in the lower chamber; Johnson cannot afford any defections or absences, given the unlikely prospect of Democrats voting for the GOP’s spending cuts.\n\nThe Speaker could push for a continuing resolution to fund the government past the March deadline, then push forward with a plan to rely solely on Republican votes for the party’s budget plan — or simply seek to push something through before that March 14 funding drop-off. Neither option looks particularly easy, with Democrats stating that the GOP should not assume that the opposition party would bail out the House Republican caucus and supply Democratic votes to make up for Republican budget hawks who refuse to support Johnson’s plan.\n\nIn January, he said that Republicans were hoping for final passage of the bill in April.\n\nJohnson, like Kevin McCarthy before him, cut deals with Democrats to avert shutdowns throughout 2024, despite holding control over the lower chamber. A handful of Republicans have stated their opposition to what they viewed as insufficient efforts by leadership to cut spending, while others have opposed the continuing resolution process on principle.\n\nStill, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and others have taken issue with the assertion from Johnson on Friday that the Democrats had abandoned negotiations entirely.\n\n“Leader Jeffries and others seem to be trying to set up some sort of government shutdown,” Johnson told reporters in the Capitol, adding:“We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the top-line number, but so far as I know, they’ve been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so.”\n\nJeffries and Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro said that Democrats had sent a new offer to Republicans for their party’s support for a bill to fund the government within the past few days.\n\nJim McGovern, the top-ranking Democrat on the Rules Committee, said: ““First of all, [Johnson]’s full of s‑‑‑. He’s a liar. And he’s a total shill for Donald Trump and Elon Musk.”\n\n“So he can blame anybody he wants … but we’re not walking away from the table,” the congressman said. “They’re not interested in hearing from us at this particular point. Maybe they will be in March.”\n\nThis weekend Johnson said that the GOP’s budget bill, designed to be passed through the filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process, was still days away from being unveiled. He cautioned that the slim margin in his chamber necessitated more work on the legislation.

The pre-recorded gig, which took place on Bourbon Street, was a tribute to the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed 14 lives.\n\nAlthough Kendrick Lamar is the official halftime entertainment for the 2025 Super Bowl, fans watching at home loved the pre-match cameo from Lady Gaga and took to Twitter (X) to hail the pop legend. \"I love that Lady Gaga comes around every so often to show us she’s absolutely 1 of 1 vocally,\" one penned. \"She just absolutely killed that performance.\"\n\nAnother gushed: \"Lady Gaga absolutely slayed it at the Super Bowl! Her piano performance of \"Hold My Hand\" in New Orleans was a gut - wrenching, soul - stirring ode to the heartbreak of 2025's tragedies. With every note, she tugged at the heartstrings of the crowd, turning the stadium into a space of collective reflection. It wasn't just a song; it was a powerful, poignant moment that'll be etched in Super Bowl history forever.\"\n\n\"She looks and sounds like a literal angel,\" a third declared online as another praised the Oscar winning singer and wrote: \"Hold my Hand was so appropriate, she’s such a sweet gal.\" One fan was moved to tears, admitting online: \"I'm crying that was so beautiful.\"\n\n Lady Gaga's performance comes as Donald Trump becomes the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl game. Earlier this week, Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs superstar, stirred up some controversy among his girlfriend Taylor Swift's fans when he expressed his excitement about playing in front of Trump.\n\nDespite Taylor's public criticism of Trump and her endorsement of his political opponent Kamala Harris during the previous election, Travis welcomed the news of Trump's attendance. \"That's awesome, it's a great honour,\" the 35 year old said. \"No matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life. Having the president there, it's the best country in the world and that's pretty cool.\"\n\nDuring the presidential race, Taylor and Trump had a public disagreement after Taylor endorsed Harris, leading Trump to post on his social media platform Truth that he \"hated\" the singer. However, Trump later admitted that he liked Travis \"even though he may be a liberal and probably can't stand me! \" \n\nTrump also commended Travis' teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who similarly welcomed the news of Trump's presence in New Orleans. \"I didn't see that clip but obviously it's cool to hear that he's seen me play football and respects the game that I play,\" Patrick commented. \"It's always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone in the top position in our country.\"\n\n Like this story?

Nowhere is that more evident than in the coveted luxury suites inside the Caesars Superdome, where the price of entry alone can soar into the millions.\n\nIn New Orleans, where the Kansas City Chiefs are set to face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2025, the battle for these exclusive skyboxes has reached fever pitch.\n\nLast year, an associate of a local taxi driver made what some might call the investment of a lifetime—he mortgaged his home to secure a Super Bowl suite for $225,000. Fast forward to last week, and he sold it for a staggering $1.6 million.\n\nThere is no ticket in American sports more sought after than a seat at the Super Bowl, and this year, the 165 luxury suites inside the Superdome are the most exclusive of them all. \n\nThe least expensive start at around $500,000—though those come with an obstructed view—while the most coveted boxes near midfield command up to $3 million. And it’s not just about the game itself.\n\n\"It’s a whole weekend,\" Simon David of Confirmed360 tells Daily Mail. \"Everything is taken care of. There’s no waiting in line, no inconvenience. Just pure indulgence.\"\n\nThat indulgence extends far beyond the stadium. In the days leading up to the game, the city is abuzz with celebrity arrivals, lavish parties, and high-end experiences designed for the ultra-wealthy. \n\nFrom private jet charters—where passengers can dine on anything from McDonald’s to Nobu—to exclusive swamp tours with Louisiana’s famous alligators, no request is too extravagant.\n\nDonald Trump, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Kim Kardashian will enjoy the best of New Orleans’ famed hospitality, including a curated menu inside the suites featuring gumbo, shrimp, ribs, and decadent chocolate caramel popcorn.\n\nWith over 800 private jets expected to land in New Orleans over Super Bowl weekend, airspace has become so congested that some flights are being rerouted to airports in Mississippi. But for the elite clientele of companies like Confirmed360, every detail is meticulously planned.\n\nFor some, the draw of the Super Bowl is purely social— \"They just have to be seen at the game,\" David explains—while others are in it for the sport, like Olivia Culpo, who secured a suite last year to watch her husband, 49ers star Christian McCaffrey, play against the Chiefs.\n\nDemand for these suites intensifies as the playoffs progress, but the real frenzy begins in the two weeks between Championship Sunday and the Super Bowl. \"Once the teams are confirmed, it’s an all-out scramble,\" David says. \"Nobody wants to be the one to tell a celebrity like Taylor Swift that all the suites are gone.\"\n\nAnd it’s not just about scoring a seat—many VIPs have very particular demands. Some require extra tickets for their security detail. Others ask for their suite to be stocked with rare wines, fine bourbons, or even a private chef. \"We’ve had people request magicians, pop-a-shot machines, or even former players to watch the game with them,\" David reveals.\n\nOf course, some high-profile guests insist on complete privacy. \"No pictures, no autographs, and sometimes, they want to know exactly who else is in the suite before agreeing to sit there,\" he adds. \"The last thing we need is someone who doesn’t get along with another guest.\"\n\nWith suites selling for anywhere from $750,000 to over $1.8 million, ensuring an unparalleled experience is key. That’s why companies like Confirmed360 warn clients away from the $500,000 suites with obstructed views. \"We don’t like to recommend those,\" David says. \"We want to exceed expectations.\"\n\nMany of the best suites, particularly those with prime midfield views, are reserved by the NFL and its partners, with any remaining spots offered first to long-time suite holders before hitting the secondary market. The most coveted? A $3 million, 45-person suite that has become one of the hardest tickets to secure.\n\nFor those who want an even more immersive experience, there are plenty of additional perks to consider. This year, guests can take part in a private DJ lesson on the eve of the Super Bowl, standing behind the decks at the Maxim Party before heading to their VIP tables once the party kicks off. Others will enjoy pre-game tailgate access, visits from top chefs, and a never-ending selection of high-end food and drink inside their suites.\n\nOn game day, those lucky enough to secure a suite will indulge in an all-day feast: pre-game charcuterie boards, sliders, salads, and gumbo at kickoff, followed by bread pudding and cake at halftime. Drinks will flow freely, with Don Julio tequila, Crown Royal whiskey, and Bulleit bourbon among the premium spirits on offer.\n\nOnce the game starts, however, there’s one thing even the most elite guests can’t control—the action on the field. And with history on the line for both teams, even the most luxurious suite can’t outshine the spectacle of the Super Bowl itself.\n\nFor those watching from the comfort of their exclusive boxes, it will be an evening of indulgence, extravagance, and pure entertainment. And for the lucky few who secured their spot early, the experience of a lifetime is just beginning.","summary":"A look inside the lavish experience Donald Trump, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Kim Kardashian will enjoy at the New Orleans superbowl.

They argue that the test discriminates against parents from Denmark's Greenlandic Inuit minority, which currently numbers around 17,000, because it fails to account for different cultural and social norms.\n\nThe Danish government has said it will no longer use the FKU in cases involving Greenlandic families – but the memory of high-profile recent cases of Inuit mothers being separated from their children will take a long time to fade.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

The reasons for this are complex. The report found that \"the number of Greenlandic families in Denmark with serious social problems such as abuse and financial problems is greater than the number of Danish families in the same situation\", said the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation. But \"the relationship between Greenlandic families and Danish caseworkers is often worsened by language and cultural differences\".\n\nThe Danish Institute for Human Rights said in 2022 that Greenlandic parents ran a higher risk of obtaining low test scores because of cultural differences and language barriers. \"Misjudgments\" made as a result of the test \"can have far-reaching consequences for both children and parents, as in the extreme they can contribute to the forced removal of a child\".\n\nIn November, a Greenlandic Inuit woman's new-born daughter was \"forcibly removed from her arms\" by Danish social workers hours after she gave birth, said The Times. Keira Alexandra Kronvold had failed the FKU assessment while pregnant – according to her case file, one cause for concern was that different interpretations of facial expressions in Inuit culture would make it hard for Kronvold to raise her child in line with the \"social expectations and codes necessary to navigate Danish society\".\n'Significant U-turn'\nLast month, Denmark announced that the FKU would no longer be used on Greenlandic families, citing doubts \"as to whether a standardised psychological test sufficiently takes into account the Greenlandic culture and language\". Instead, such cases will be handled with the help of a special unit which has Greenlandic cultural expertise. The government has also reportedly agreed to reassess cases where psychological tests may have led to an unfair removal of Greenlandic children.\nThis marks a \"significant U-turn\" in policy, said The Guardian. But some \"questioned the timing\", so soon after Trump's declaration that acquiring Greenland would be an \"absolute necessity\" for the US.\nAka Hansen, an Inuit film-maker who has led protests against the FKU, told the newspaper the abolition of the test was \"long overdue\". \"It's a big surprise to us that all of a sudden they are able to make changes to the law,\" she added.\nGreenland's Prime Minister Múte Egede said this month that the territory had \"had enough\" of being told it should be grateful to Copenhagen for being \"good colonial masters\". If Denmark had treated Greenlanders better historically, he added, perhaps they would not be debating the island's future.\n\nExplore More\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nHarriet Marsden, The Week UK\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nHarriet Marsden is a writer for The Week, mostly covering UK and global news and politics.

Some of these fairytale-like claims were never investigated or punished to deter future offenders.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of dwindling resources that has been exacerbated by the withdrawal of support in certain areas of our healthcare services, it is important that every kobo budgeted for the health sector has to be maximally utilised.\n\nTo this end, the Federal Government has to be deliberate about putting mechanisms in place for public audit and accountability in its US$1.07 billion budgetary appropriation in the health sector.\n\nThe former Vice President specifically queries the Federal Government for not providing comprehensive information on how it plans to expend the over one billion dollars in the primary health sector.\n\nAtiku noted that while healthcare, especially the primary sector deserves rapid investment in order to promote access to quality and affordable health services to Nigerians, it will be immoral of the government not to provide extensive details of how the money allotted for the purpose would be dispensed.\n\n“We have read that the Federal Government has a plan to expend a whooping sum of $1.07 billion in the primary health sector. This amount is in addition to the N2.48 trillion, which had earlier been proposed for the health sector in the initial draft of the budget.\n\n“This development gets even more troubling when the government equally announced that the $1.07 billion it is adding to the health sector at the sub-national level was mainly sourced through foreign loans and a fraction of it being provided through an international donor agency.\n\n“In other words, Nigeria is expected to pay these loans back and it is required that the Nigerian people know the details of these loans and that its expenditure must be conveyed in a policy envelop that will explain how it will be spent,” Atiku noted.\n\nHe says further that the failure of the Federal Government not to commit to a single physical infrastructure in expending the budgetary provision smacks of fraud.\n\nAccording to the government, “the funds will be directed towards improving governance in healthcare and enhancing primary healthcare services nationwide. This financing will support recruitment, training, and retention of healthcare workers and teachers at the sub-national level…”\n\nFor an administration that has been known to have a deficiency of trust in the administration of its humanitarian services, Nigerians cannot take the risk of accepting a shoddy explanation on a budgetary provision that lacks a mechanism of tracking how the money is to be expended.\n\nIt is difficult for Nigerians to believe this current Federal Government given its proclivity to alternative truths – especially on their claims about investments in the social infrastructure.\n\nIt is worrisome that the Tinubu administration continues to lie to Nigerians on the status of our tertiary hospitals when the sorry state of those hospitals lay bare for Nigerians to see.\n\nJust recently, the government began a campaign of improvements in the standard of our tertiary health institutions, but Nigerians know that these teaching hospitals often lack basic amenities such as access to a steady supply of electricity.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Tinubu administration has failed woefully in the health sector because of the poor funding of the sector.\n\nThe major diseases in the primary health sector remain malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS treatment.\n\nIf President Tinubu’s administration meant well in its claim to prioritize the health of Nigerians, his government should explain how it plans to spend this intervention fund in addressing these diseases in the primary health sector.\n\nOn the contrary, what the government announced in its panic response to President Donald Trump’s announcement of the cancellation of American aids for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria was a paltry N5 billion.\n\nIf the Tinubu administration fails to provide a comprehensive framework to safeguard its purported huge investment in the health sector nor subject the appropriations to the scrutiny of the National Assembly, it may be safe to conclude that this is another episode of the administration committing a fraud in the name of public interest.","summary":"Former Vice President of Nigeria Atiku Abubakar has warned that claims of animals such as snakes, termites, gorillas and monkeys swallowing public funds must never be the fate of the funds budgeted for the critical sector of health in the 2025 Budget.

If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" Vance wrote on X on Sunday morning.\n\nThat post came hours after Musk said overnight that the judge who ruled against him should be impeached.\n\n\"A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!\" said Musk, who has been tasked by President Donald Trump with rooting out waste across the federal government.\n\nMusk also shared a post from a user who had suggested that the Trump administration openly defy the court order.\n\n\"I don't like the precedent it sets when you defy a judicial ruling, but I'm just wondering what other options are these judges leaving us,\" the person had written, in part.\n\nThe court order against Musk barred his team temporarily from accessing a Treasury system that contains sensitive personal data, such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. Musk and his team say they are simply rooting through government systems to identify waste and abuse at the direction of the Republican president.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller called the ruling \"an assault on the very idea of democracy itself.\"\n\n\"What we continue to see here is the idea that rogue bureaucrats who are elected by no one, who answer to no one, who have lifetime tenure jobs, who we would be told can never be fired, which, of course, is not true, that the power has been cemented and accumulated for years, whether it be with the Treasury bureaucrats or the FBI bureaucrats or the CIA bureaucrats or the USAID bureaucrats, with this unelected shadow force that is running our government and running our country,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nThe pushback comes as the administration's efforts to dismantle government agencies and eliminate large swaths of the federal workforce are being held up by the courts. Judges have also blocked Trump, at least temporarily, from moving forward with mass federal buyouts, from placing thousands of USAID workers on leave and from implementing an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S.\n\nEarly Saturday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued, alleging the Trump administration allowed Musk's team access to the Treasury Department's central payment system in violation of federal law.\n\n\"We're very disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling, but we have a long way to go,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. He added: \"No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision.\"\n\nThe payment system handles tax refunds, Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits and much more, sending out trillions of dollars every year while containing an expansive network of Americans' personal and financial data. A hearing is set for Feb. 14.\n\nDemocrats have been sounding alarms over Musk and Trump's efforts, including efforts to halt spending that has already been appropriated by Congress. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is the body in charge of spending.\n\n\"I think this is the most serious Constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly, since Watergate,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"This is a red alert moment when this entire country has to understand that our democracy is at risk.\"\n\nMurphy expressed concern that the courts are ill-prepared for the onslaught they are facing.\n\n\"The pace of this assault on the Constitution in order to serve the billionaire class, it is absolutely dizzying. And so, you have to run a full-scale opposition,\" Murphy said. \"Ultimately, you've got to bring the American public into this conversation because we need our Republican colleagues in the House and in the Senate ultimately to put a stop to this. You cannot just rely on the court system.\"\n\nRepublicans, who have largely stood in lockstep behind the president since he was sworn in for a second term, did so again on Sunday.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan blasted the court ruling for the Treasury Department case while arguing that the president should be able to implement his agenda as he sees fit.\n\n\"I assume we will argue this out in court, like the other 17 or 18 decisions we have seen in the last several days. That all is going to get argued out in court. And, frankly, we knew the left, we knew the Democrats were going to do this,\" the Republican said on CNN's \"Inside Politics.\"","summary":"Officials ranging from billionaire Elon Musk to Vice President JD Vance have not only criticized a federal judge's decision early Saturday that blocks Musk's DOGE from accessing Treasury Department records, but have also attacked the legitimacy of judicial oversight, a fundamental pillar of American democracy, which is based on the separation of powers.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/vance-musk-question-authority-courts-trumps-agenda-faces-legal-pushback/15886183/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15886211_020925-ap-jd-vance-img.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:01:00","author":"Jill Colvin","authors":["Jill Colvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":288770424,"title":"Nations and tech firms to jostle for AI leadership at Paris summit","text":"World leaders, tech executives, academics and other experts will gather in Paris on Monday for two days of discussion on the progress and potential of artificial intelligence (AI), as it increasingly becomes a key geopolitical issue.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will host around 80 countries and a wide range of industry figures at the Grand Palais for the AI Action Summit, with animated talks likely over the technology which has quickly become the key innovation in the sector, and potentially a potent political tool.\n\nThe sudden emergence of Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek has already reconfigured the landscape of the sector – showing that the US position as the industry leader in AI might not be guaranteed, and that it may not take billions of dollars in order to reach that level in the first place.\n\nDeepSeek’s low-cost models, which appear to rival OpenAI’s industry-leading ChatGPT, have other nations and smaller firms believing they too can vie for leadership of the AI sector.\n\nAs a result, many see this summit as the chance for different countries and even companies to stake their claim to be the world and industry leaders on the topic.\n\nThe UK Government has recently unveiled its AI Action Plan on how it wants to make the UK a go-to location for developing and powering AI, while an early act of the second Donald Trump presidency has been to announce a 500 billion dollar deal with OpenAI and others to build more infrastructure in the US.\n\nIn addition, the EU has started the rollout of its AI Act, the first major legislation on the issue globally, which begins to set out a framework for how the technology should be developed and released safely.\n\nMeanwhile, in his role as host, President Macron is expected to use the summit to champion Europe, and especially France, as a potential world leader on the technology.\n\nA number of big names are expected to be doing this jockeying in person – US vice president JD Vance is confirmed to be attending, as are OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, highlighting the power the US still has over the sector.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be there, as will senior government figures from China, French officials have said.\n\nBut the likelihood of Elon Musk’s attendance remains unknown – either as part of a US government delegation given his role as an adviser to President Trump, or in a business capacity as the head of his start-up xAI.\n\nAs for the UK, it is understood Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is not attending, but Technology Secretary Peter Kyle will be in Paris, likely with the job of drumming up support for more investment in the UK’s AI sector and beyond.\n\nThe event is set to be littered with panel talks and discussions on topics such as the future of work in a world of AI, sustainability, safety and international collaboration, but what the summit will actually produce in terms of concrete agreements remains unclear.\n\nAt the first summit, hosted by the UK at Bletchley Park in late 2023, the first ever international agreement, albeit non-binding, on the need to develop AI models safely and responsibly – which even great rivals China and the US signed up to – was announced.\n\nThomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, said he did not expect a “major announcement” on a global approach to AI during the Paris summit, but said it was a key moment for talks between leaders and tech giants at a time of geopolitical and industrial instability.\n\n“The AI Action Summit provides a key opportunity to debate the impact of AI on society, political institutions and the environment, and to continue an open dialogue on AI global governance in an increasingly fragmented world,” he said.\n\n“Some claim AI is just mathematics and doesn’t require any regulation at all. Others consider that the European Commission is killing innovation by regulating AI too tightly.\n\n“Let’s face it: AI is such a complex topic with so many political, societal, and environmental consequences, that it deserves a more nuanced debate.\n\n“In my opinion, this is first and foremost a diplomatic move that aims at facilitating the convergence of AI governance, generating debate on the impact of AI on societies.\n\n“It’s unlikely a major announcement will be made, but what matters here is the continuous dialogue on AI global regulation.\n\n“Last but not least, President’s Macron decision to host the summit in Paris also aims at showcasing France’s capabilities and assets in the global AI race to make sure France remains one the leading global destinations for foreign investments in artificial intelligence.”","summary":"The two-day AI Action Summit, hosted by the French president, begins in Paris on Monday amid global political and technological instability.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/nations-and-tech-firms-to-jostle-for-ai-leadership-at-paris-summit-b1210056.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/28/09/28-8bbb47bf976b48b5bc21beb210a8bdce.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:01:00","author":"Martyn Landi","authors":["Martyn Landi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.223},{"id":288770850,"title":"Why the fight for affordable and reliable energy isn’t over","text":"With energy policy reform a Day One priority for President Donald Trump’s Administration, it would be easy to assume that affordable, reliable and cleaner energy will become a reality across the country in short order.\n\nWhile there will be rapid movement on the national level, some on the state and local level are already hard at work to slow that effort down, or kill it, altogether.\n\nAs we have seen in the past, the anti-energy organizations that work to handicap domestic energy production by way of red tape, litigation and all-out bans, will take their battle to states, cities and towns near you.\n\nThey already are.\n\nWith the federal government’s door shut to their priorities, these groups are pushing their plans in more receptive jurisdictions and smaller municipalities in an attempt to overwhelm or bully local officials.\n\nDays after the election, one such national group made it clear: “(O)ver the next few years, you can expect to see environmentalists focus much of their attention on city and state governments. At the same time, the movement will likely intensify pressure on corporate actors, especially the banks and insurance companies … In some ways, that’s a repeat of the environmental movement’s 2017-19 playbook.”\n\nFortunately, there are forward-thinking state governments that recognize affordable, reliable and cleaner energy is possible while preserving the jobs, economic vitality and family-sustaining wages that energy production creates. The leadership in these states is unpersauded by the empty promises of new economies that never materialize, while real jobs and entire industries are killed off, as we are seeing in states like California and New York.\n\nThat is precisely why Consumer Energy Alliance offered to do all we can to help the Governors Coalition for Energy Security (GCES), founded by Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana and former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. As I recently remarked to the CEA Board, the formation of this coalition from this collection of states feels very much like the “dog has (finally) caught the car!” Bringing this state leadership together at such a critical time to help ensure US energy and economic needs are met is what CEA has relentlessly campaigned for throughout its 20-year history: we are proud to offer any assistance the Governors may need.\n\nThis groundbreaking initiative underscores the critical importance of affordable and reliable energy in defining our country’s future. It serves as a testament to the growing recognition that energy policy is not just a matter of environmental stewardship, it’s about economic justice, too – an opportunity for all of society to thrive.\n\n“As states that are power-hungry, we need an all-of-the-above energy approach to securing more energy to drive our economies. I am happy to be working with Consumer Energy Alliance to help move our priorities ahead,” Gov. Landry said in a statement. “We need organizations like CEA who put forward facts and common-sense energy policy, not fears or emotion-driven plans that benefit few, disadvantage many, and do nothing for the environment.”\n\nThe need for affordable and reliable energy cannot be overstated in our rapidly evolving energy landscape. Energy is the lifeblood of our economy, powering everything from homes and schools to factories and hospitals. When energy costs are high or supply unreliable, the ripple effects impact every sector of society. Families struggle with higher utility bills, businesses face increased operational costs, and economic growth is stifled.\n\nThe coalition’s vision aligns closely with CEA’s goal of affordable, reliable and cleaner energy. In the words of the coalition, “we envision a future where every state protects its citizens’ freedoms to choose the energy solutions that work best for them —driving down costs, enhancing reliability, and supporting lasting economic growth. Through innovation, competition, and thoughtful stewardship, we aim to ensure that every American has access to affordable, dependable energy in a way that benefits both the economy and the environment.”\n\nThe states that get energy policy right will, undoubtedly, prove more attractive to businesses – an incredibly valuable attribute today as AI and data centers grow at unprecedented rates, creating a $250 billion a year opportunity. Companies today are looking for stable environments where they can operate efficiently and predictably.\n\nStates such as Georgia – a GCES member – are proof that the right energy policies produce economic growth\n\nPreserving consumers’ freedom to choose the energy they want and need is a fundamental principle that underpins the coalition’s efforts. By promoting fairness and competition in the energy marketplace, states ensure that consumers enjoy access to a variety of energy sources that meet their unique needs. This approach not only drives down costs but also fosters innovation and resilience.\n\nThe coalition is a much-needed bulwark against needless restrictions pushed by anti-energy advocates. It maps a path to a future where every tool is available. A one-size-fits-all approach to energy policy will not suffice. States must be flexible and adaptable, allowing for the integration of new technologies such as next-generation nuclear power and advanced energy systems.\n\nCEA is honored to support the coalition’s mission and advocate for affordable, reliable energy, while pushing for robust environmental stewardship. Fundamentally, this is a pro-people path that helps families, businesses, farmers and the entire U.S. economy – today and into the future.","summary":"It's 'the lifeblood of our economy, powering everything from homes and schools to factories and hospitals'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/why-the-fight-for-affordable-and-reliable-energy-isnt-over/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/oil-drilling-energy-rig-sunset-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:00:56","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":288772432,"title":"Trump’s Announcement of New Global Tariffs Leaves Reporters Scrambling on Air Force One","text":"President Donald Trump has unveiled plans to impose new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports in a major escalation of his global trade shake-up.\n\nJournalists on board Air Force One en route to the Super Bowl were left scrambling on Sunday afternoon as President Trump made the startling revelation.\n\n‘Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25 per cent tariff,’ he told reporters as they all traveled from Florida to New Orleans, sparking a frenzied rush to publish the news while battling limited reception in the air.\n\nAluminum, too’ he added, will also be subject to the trade penalties.\n\nThis will include imports from Canada and Mexico, and will likely extend to other import and reciprocal duties to be announced later in the week.\n\nThese new tariffs, expected to be formally announced Monday, will come on top of existing metals duty imports. \n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum, but conceded to duty-free quotas for certain trade partners, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nTrump also told the reporters on board he would announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately.\n\nThis means Trump intends to impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on American goods.\n\n‘If they are charging us 130% and we’re charging them nothing, it’s not going to stay that way,’ he said.\n\n‘Very simply, it’s if they charge us, we charge them.’\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump was outspoken in his plans to bolster the domestic steel industry by introducing tariffs to encourage industries to produce and buy locally.\n\n‘I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, Trump said at the time, pledging to make U.S. Steel ‘Strong and Great Again.’\n\nThe Steel Manufacturers Association supports Trump’s tariffs, and just last week urged him to consider a tougher approach to steel imports.\n\n‘President Trump and the USTR should strengthen and expand existing tariffs to support American steel manufacturing and close the loopholes and exemptions that have reduced the impact of the tariffs,’ SMA President Philip Bell said.\n\n‘America’s steel industry is the backbone of our economy, building the roads and bridges that make up our infrastructure. Steel is critical to our energy security, in particular our robust oil and gas production. \n\n‘A healthy steel industry is also vital to our national security, supplying the steel used in our munitions, tanks, battleships, and aircraft carriers.’\n\nBell said the domestic steel industry in the United States last benefited from Trump’s presidency in 2018, when he ‘first instituted national security-related tariffs on steel in March 2018. \n\n‘President Trump responded to an industry that was suffering from surges of dumped imports, instituting the tariffs to support manufacturing in America. \n\n‘The tariffs achieved their goals.

Chacun investit massivement et cherche à développer des modèles toujours plus performants. La Chine a marqué un grand coup le 20 janvier en dévoilant DeepSeek-R1, un agent conversationnel aussi puissant que ChatGPT, mais beaucoup plus économe en énergie. Ce progrès accentue la rivalité entre les États-Unis et la Chine, qui cherchent chacun à dominer ce secteur stratégique.\n\nLes États-Unis ont rapidement réagi à l’annonce chinoise. Dès le lendemain, Donald Trump a révélé le projet “Stargate”, un programme gigantesque doté de 500 milliards de dollars sur quatre ans. Ce plan vise à moderniser les infrastructures technologiques américaines et à garantir leur avance en matière d’IA. Cette stratégie s’inscrit dans une lutte d’influence où chaque puissance cherche à garder l’avantage technologique et économique.\n\nCette confrontation rappelle la guerre froide et la course à l’espace du XXe siècle. En 2017, Vladimir Poutine affirmait déjà que le pays leader en intelligence artificielle aurait un pouvoir mondial déterminant. La Chine a rapidement pris cette déclaration au sérieux en lançant un plan ambitieux avec un budget annuel de 60 milliards de dollars dès 2025. De leur côté, les États-Unis ont tenté de ralentir la progression chinoise en interdisant l’exportation de certaines puces électroniques essentielles au développement de l’IA. Pourtant, l’apparition de DeepSeek montre que Pékin rattrape son retard.\n\nL’Europe, bien que présente dans le domaine de l’IA, peine à rivaliser avec les investissements massifs des États-Unis et de la Chine. Le Chips Act, qui prévoit un investissement de 43 milliards d’euros d’ici 2030, reste bien inférieur aux efforts américains et chinois. Toutefois, des entreprises européennes comme la start-up française Mistral tentent de s’imposer sur le marché. L’Union européenne mise aussi sur la régulation avec l’AI Act, une législation visant à encadrer le développement et l’usage de l’intelligence artificielle.\n\nL’intelligence artificielle ne se limite pas à la technologie : elle devient aussi un instrument de “soft power”. Chaque pays développe ses propres modèles qui véhiculent ses valeurs et son idéologie. En Chine, DeepSeek évite les sujets sensibles comme Tiananmen ou Taïwan, tandis que ChatGPT diffuse des idées alignées sur la culture américaine. Cette influence technologique pourrait façonner la perception du monde selon les régions.\n\nPour éviter qu’une poignée de pays n’impose leur vision du monde à travers l’IA, certains experts préconisent un développement plus équilibré. En encourageant la création de modèles adaptés aux différentes cultures et langues, l’IA pourrait mieux refléter la diversité mondiale. Cette approche permettrait de garantir une représentation plus juste et de réduire les biais idéologiques dans les technologies d’intelligence artificielle.","summary":"Depuis l&#8217;apparition de ChatGPT en novembre 2022, les pays du monde entier se lancent dans une course effrénée à l&#8217;intelligence artificielle (IA).

Chris Coons agreed with CNN host Michael Smerconish that funding a \"Sesame Street\" show in Iraq could be a good use of taxpayer funding to teach \"values\" to Iraqi children. Smerconish commented on his title show Saturday about reports that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) gave $20 million to a nonprofit called Sesame Workshop to produce a show called \"Ahlan Simsim Iraq\" in an effort to \"promote inclusion, mutual respect, and understanding across ethnic, religious, and sectarian groups.\" The show began in 2021 and will run until 2027. He asked Coons and his viewers whether they believe this could be an effective use of \"soft power\" despite facing backlash from conservative lawmakers. \"This isn‘t just funding a kids’ show for children, millions of children in countries like Iraq,\" Coons said. \"It's a show that helps teach values, helps teach public health, helps prevent kids from dying from dysentery and disease and helps push values like collaboration, peacefulness, cooperation in a society where the alternative is ISIS, extremism and terrorism.\" RWANDAN PRESIDENT PRAISES ‘UNCONVENTIONAL’ TRUMP, SAYS ‘WE MIGHT LEARN SOME LESSONS’ WITH USAID SHUTDOWN He continued, \"And to your point, it‘s pennies on the dollar. The U.S. Department of Defense has an annual budget of about $850 billion. USAID was spending about $30 billion. It is a small proportion of our total federal spending. And as [political scientist Joseph Nye] would often say, it‘s not just soft power, it‘s smart power.\" Smerconish also appeared to defend funding for the show as he polled viewers for their opinion. \"Nye himself said, in the short term, hard power usually trumps soft power, but the long run effects might be the opposite. Or, as a caller to my Sirius XM radio program said yesterday, who would you rather teach Iraqi kids? Big Bird or al-Qaeda? Disease prevention helps us all, education that fights extremism,\" Smerconish said. Near the end of his show, Smerconish revealed 72% of his viewers supported taxpayers funding the international series. He argued the political controversy surrounding it likely came from \"soundbite\" politics rather than the program itself. \"Now does that make it a better political issue than I said at the outset of the program? No, because I took five minutes to explain exactly what is that program in Iraq for ‘Sesame Street,’ teaching kids to wash their hands and not hate America,\" Smerconish said. \"And as I said to Chris Coons, you know, it‘s a soundbite world in which we‘re living, far easier to be dismissive and say, can you imagine they‘re spending all this money on fill in the blank, EV cars in Vietnam?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Iraqi children’s show was one of several examples Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has used to accuse the agency of wasteful spending and abuse.

We should support the idea of a multipolar world.”\nBrics, which started with Brazil, Russia, India, and China, has since expanded to include South Africa, Egypt, Iran, and most recently Indonesia – making the proposal more urgent in the senator’s view. He said he envisioned the Philippines as “a friend to all nations” and saw its potential as a “neutral venue for talks, especially those involving the settling of disputes”.\n“It is my dream that the Philippines should host talks, not bases,” Pimentel added, referring to the military sites in the country that had hosted American troops under the bilateral Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement.\n\nBut the proposal comes at a charged moment. Tensions between Manila and Beijing have escalated after repeated incursions by Chinese vessels into waters the Philippines claims.\nJust last month, a 165-metre Chinese coastguard ship – nicknamed “The Monster” – patrolled near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. With China already a dominant force in Brics, analysts warn that joining the bloc could undermine Manila’s leverage in its territorial dispute.\nMatteo Piasentini, a lecturer in international relations at the University of the Philippines, warned that such a move might alienate the United States, the Philippines’ key defence ally, without yielding clear benefits.\n“Given the current situation faced by the Philippines, joining Brics will mean sending the wrong signal to a treaty ally, without having serious guarantees by China that tensions in the South China Sea will ease up,” Piasentini said.\nJulio Amador, interim president of the Foundation for the National Interest, echoed this concern. He argued that joining Brics could backfire in the Philippines’ efforts to address its territorial row with China.\n\nAs a key member of Brics, China would not allow the Philippines to raise its concerns over the South China Sea at the bloc’s meetings, said Amador, who is also the founder and trustee of the non-profit policy advisory firm FACTS Asia.\n“The Philippines does need to galvanise international support against China. But how can you do that in a China-led and China-dominated association like Brics?” Amador said.\nBrics’ growing appeal in Southeast Asia has also raised questions about its impact on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ cohesion and future direction.\nIndonesia joined Brics as a full member in January while Thailand and Malaysia are partner states of the bloc. Amador argued that any Philippine move toward Brics could weaken Asean’s ability to serve as a neutral mediator in regional disputes.\n“You have Asean, and only Asean has the convening ability to bring together even opposing powers through the East Asia Summit. So what is the point of joining Brics? Aren’t they weakening Asean?” Amador said.\n\nReactions were mixed about the effect on US-Philippines relations if Manila pursued Brics membership.\nAccording to Amador, the Philippines could work with US President Donald Trump’s administration to supports its own interests in maritime, education, and health projects if it “plays its cards well”.\nBut Piasentini warned that Brics membership could prove counterproductive due to the US “probably growing dissatisfied with other countries’ multi-alignment and hedging”.\nRegardless of any potential accession to the bloc, observers said the Philippines should widen cooperation with countries that had backed its stance on its territorial row while bridging its differences with China.\nAmador cited Vietnam as a “classic case” that Manila could learn from, as Hanoi had also clashed with Beijing over their political differences and recalibrated bilateral ties to its benefit.\n“Vietnam faced the same level of bullying before, yet at the same time, there is no doubt that it is also gaining from Chinese economic investments,” he said.\n“Not all of this is on the Philippines. China also has to come to terms with the fact that we are not going to surrender our rights and our sovereignty in the South China Sea … But right now, we need to lower the levels of mistrust that exists between our two countries.”","summary":"A senator is urging Manila to join the bloc and adopt a more balanced foreign policy amid the ‘inevitable’ march to a more multipolar world.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297899/philippines-brics-would-joining-mend-ties-china","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/08/db5e48eb-910a-41cb-a8d8-2fa3fce6de9f_f5b42d22.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-10 00:00:19","author":"Sam Beltran","authors":["Sam Beltran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":288768770,"title":"Trump 100% disagrees with federal judge's 'crazy' ruling blocking DOGE from Treasury system","text":"President Donald Trump \"100 percent\" disagrees with a federal judge's ruling on Saturday that bars the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing the Treasury Department, he said during an exclusive interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. \"Nineteen states attorneys general filed a lawsuit, and early Saturday a judge agreed with them to restrict Elon Musk and his government efficiency team, DOGE, from accessing Treasury Department payment and data systems. They said there was a risk of ‘irreparable harm.’ What do you make of that? And does that slow you down and what you want to do?\" Baier asked Trump in the interview clip. \"No, I disagree with it 100%. I think it's crazy. And we have to solve the efficiency problem. We have to solve the fraud, waste, abuse, all the things that have gone into the government. You take a look at the USAID, the kind of fraud in there,\" Trump responded. U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York Paul Engelmayer, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, issued a temporary restraining order Saturday that sided with 19 Democratic state attorneys general who claimed that giving DOGE \"full access\" to the Treasury’s payment systems violates the law. The lawsuit was spearheaded by New York Attorney General Letitia James. JUDGE'S 'HOPELESSLY AMBIGUOUS' ORDER BARRING DOGE FROM TREASURY SPARKS CONCERN BESSENT MAY ALSO BE LOCKED OUT The judge's sweeping order, issued Saturday, bars DOGE from accessing the Treasury system until at least Feb. 14, when Engelmayer scheduled a hearing to revisit the matter. The language of the order specifically bars \"political appointees, special government employees, and any government employee detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department access to Treasury Department payment systems or any other data maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information.\" Trump, Secretary Scott Bessent and the U.S. Treasury are named as defendants in the case. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS ELON MUSK'S DOGE FROM ACCESSING TREASURY RECORDS AFTER DEMOCRATIC AGS FILE LAWSUIT Musk, Vice President JD Vance and other conservatives aligned with Trump have slammed the order. \"If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" Vance posted to X on Sunday of the order. Trump spoke with Baier in an exclusive interview with Fox News ahead of the Super Bowl, which Trump will attend. The pair discussed the president's long love of sports and football, as well as politics and DOGE. \"We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that's going to places where it shouldn't be going,\" Trump said when asked about what DOGE has found while auditing federal agencies in search of government overspending, fraud and corruption. PRESIDENT TRUMP PREDICTS ELON MUSK WILL FIND 'HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS' IN WASTE IN NEXT DOGE DIRECTIVES \"Where if I read a list, you'd say, this is ridiculous, and you've read the same list and there are many that you haven't even seen, it's crazy. It's a big scam. Now there's some good money and we can do that through, any one of a number. I think I'd rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department. Let him take care of the few good ones. So, I don't know if it's kickbacks or what's going on, but the people. Look, I ran on this, and the people want me to find it. And I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific,\" he continued. Baier also asked Trump about his recent comments about Canada becoming the U.S.' 51st state and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeay saying last week that Trump's desire to acquire the nation is a \"a real thing.\" TRUDEAU SAYS TRUMP IS SERIOUS ABOUT CANADA BECOMING 51ST STATE: REPORTS \"Yeah, it is,\" Trump said when asked about Trudeau's remark. \"I think Canada would be much better off being a 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada, and I'm not going to let that happen. It's too much. Why are we paying $200 billion a year essentially in subsidy to Canada?

The Modi-Trump meeting's full agenda is still being worked out, they said.Top technology sector entrepreneurs are also expected to engage with Modi.One of the key items on the table will be tariffs, as Trump is expected to unveil reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including India, ahead of Modi's visit. India is reducing tariffs on certain US luxury items to address Trump's concerns over what he called trade imbalances.In the budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a reduction in customs duties on high-end motorcycles, cars and smartphone parts, benefitting US companies such as Harley-Davidson, Tesla and Apple. She also eliminated customs duty on lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles.India is also reviewing tariffs on more than 30 items, including luxury cars and solar cells, as part of its efforts to strengthen economic ties with the US.The leaders are expected to discuss the issue of illegal Indian immigrants in the US as well.Modi is also expected to advocate expanding the H-1B visa programme for skilled workers, citing that it contributes to the US growth story, even as it has pitted many Trump supporters against the president's backers in the tech industry, like Musk. The PM and President are expected to issue a joint statement after their meeting in the White House.Trade & Geopolitics The Prime Minister will hold a bilateral meeting with President Trump in both the restricted- and delegation-level formats, foreign secretary Vikram Misri told reporters on Friday. Senior US administration figures are expected to call on the Prime Minister during the visit. And he will also have an opportunity to interact with business leaders and members of the Indian community. New Delhi anticipates a more intense and continuing discussion on tariffs during the meeting, Misri said. Trump had once called India a tremendous tariff maker. A 'limited scope' or mini trade deal is also on the agenda of Modi's visit, ET reported last month. Such a deal was mooted during Trump's first presidency during 2017-21.Some big corporate houses in India are planning investments across US states. The India-US relationship is critical not only for both countries, but also for geopolitics and global trade. We are at a pivotal moment in the relationship, Mukesh Aghi, president and chief executive of US India Strategic Partnership Forum, told ET.Besides West Asia, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific region, Modi and Trump are also expected to discuss the situation in Bangladesh where extremists and Islamists have been playing a role in governance structure. There are reports from within the US that the previous administration had allegedly played a role in ousting that nation's former prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.

Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 9, 2025, as Gulf of America Day,” reads the proclamation, which Trump inked aboard Air Force One.\n\n“I call upon public officials and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities,” it added.\n\nJust as Trump was signing the order, Air Force One’s captain invited passengers to look out the window and view the “Gulf of America” under its new name “for the first time in history.”\n\nTrump announced he was renaming the gulf Jan. 20 as part of an order to “[restore] names that honor American greatness.” \n\nSecretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said that as of Sunday’s declaration, “map providers” such as Apple and Google would begin updating their information to reflect the new name.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly what “appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities” might be held in honor of the renaming and whether it will be celebrated annually or just this year.\n\nTrump told reporters as he signed the proclamation that he hasn’t spoken to Mexican officials once about the new name.\n\n“Interestingly I’ve never spoken to them about it. It was our call,” Trump said as Burgum held up a map of the United States with “Gulf of America” written broadly across the bottom.\n\n“I’ve spoke to them about many other things but I haven’t really talked to them about it. They’ve never brought it up. I’m a little surprised at that,” the president added.\n\nHis previous name-changing executive order also called on Mt. Denali in Alaska to have the name Mt. McKinley returned and required all government signage, mapping and communications to use that and “Gulf of America” instead of their previous names.\n\nGoogle has said it would comply with the name updates to a point, explaining that users will still see their “official local name” depending on where they are.\n\nTrump was flying over the gulf from Mar-a-Lago in Florida on his way New Orleans to watch the Super Bowl, where he became the first president to attend the football classic.","summary":"\"I call upon public officials and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities,\" President Trump's declaration added.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/09/us-news/trump-proclaims-gulf-of-america-day-while-flying-over-former-gulf-of-mexico-on-way-to-super-bowl/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/98244053.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hiEK8tKM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:56:42","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":288771782,"title":"Jon Batiste Performs Powerful Rendition of 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at 2025 Super Bowl","text":"Jon Batiste is paying tribute to the United States at Super Bowl 2025.\n\n The Grammy winner performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Caesars Superdome on Feb. 9 ahead of the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs as several players, coaches and even President Donald Trump honored the flag.\n\n Baptiste appeared at a piano — decorated with several multi-colored motifs and lines — in an all-black suit with several gold pins and silver jewelry.

If you don't follow the law, you will be prosecuted by the Department of Justice.' \n\nTrump has ordered large-scale immigration operations across the country since he took office on January 20, but the incoming action will be the first to hit LA. \n\nA federal law enforcement source said agents from the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Los Angeles field offices are being called in to assist.\n\n'They needed more bodies,' the official, who spoke anonymously for fear of retaliation, told the LA Times. \n\nThe official added that the timeframe for the raids could change due to the 'chaotic' approach the new Trump administration has shown during its first few weeks. \n\nThey also anticipated pushback from some of the agencies involved in the Democrat-led city, which could also slow the plans. \n\n'Just because certain information is being given doesn't mean it's the administration's plan, because they know some agents are going to be resistant,' the official said. \n\nA former official also confirmed the same news about incoming ICE 'raids' to the LA Times.\n\nThousands of ICE officers were recently dispatched to the San Diego border crossing as they prepared to take '100,000 immigrants' back to Mexico and Central America in one of the biggest migrant raids in recent times. \n\nMarines descended on the area in an attempt to secure the crossing as President Trump ramped up his promise of cracking down on illegal immigration. \n\nAround 1,500 active duty troops were deployed to the nearly 2,000-mile border this week, including 500 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California.\n\nDailyMail.com can now reveal that they have been joined with what has been described as a 'mile long line of DHS trucks and CBP'. \n\nA White House intelligence source said: 'There is a mile long line of DHS trucks and CBP in front of Camp Pendleton right now, ready to do the biggest illegal immigrant grab in recent history. \n\n'The West Coast is this week and the East Coast is next week. It is about to get crazy in California. They need to fill 100,000 spots', meaning arrests is the directive.\n\nThe source continued: 'They are going to be taking 100,000 immigrants back to Mexico, Columbia, El Salvador and Guatemala in this grab.'\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan says he is not satisfied with the pace of migrant deportations - despite ICE's 'unprecedented' number of arrests - and claims the US needs to 'open the aperture up' and carry out 'more deportations'.\n\nThe Pentagon expects additional troops to be ordered to deploy in the next few days as defense and homeland security leaders iron out requests for more support. \n\nIt was also announced on Tuesday that the military would allow ICE to use Buckley Space Force Base in Colorado to detain migrants. \n\nThe US military's Northern Command said in a statement it started providing facilities at Buckley to ICE starting on Monday.\n\nBuckley Space Force Base is located in the city of Aurora, a Denver suburb, which figured prominently during Trump's presidential campaign last year. \n\nTrump said that apartment complexes in Aurora had been taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which was refuted by city officials. \n\nDuring a campaign event there in October, Trump pledged to launch an Operation Aurora targeting gang members \n\nImmigration arrests have reached about 1,000-1,200 per day in recent days, according to ICE, far above the daily average of 311 in fiscal year 2024. But Homan says America needs to carry out 'more deportations' of illegal migrants.\n\n'It was a great start. The first week was unprecedented,' he told Fox News' Jesse Watters of efforts so far, hailing how under Trump's new policies, illegal border crossings have dropped from '10,000 a day to under 600'.\n\n'It's great, it's good, but we're not finished and we need more deportations,' Homan said, adding: 'A lot more deportations and that's what we're working on.'\n\nThe border czar's remark comes just days after he vowed that numbers of daily deportations and arrests will 'steadily increase' as they ramp up efforts to curb illegal immigration.","summary":"Attorney General Pam Bondi promised that her office will 'come after' whomever leaked a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) memo that revealed the location of the next major raids.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14378633/pam-bondi-threat-ice-staff-deportation-raids-memo.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95033101-0-image-m-13_1739144740563.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/24/1796044387590257680/1024x576_MP4_1796044387590257680.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:54:04","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Steel is critical to our energy security, in particular our robust oil and gas production. \n\n'Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff,' he told reporters as they all traveled from Florida to New Orleans , sparking a frenzied rush to publish the revelation while battling limited reception in the air\n\n'A healthy steel industry is also vital to our national security, supplying the steel used in our munitions, tanks, battleships, and aircraft carriers.'\n\nBell said the domestic steel industry in the United States last benefited from Trump's presidency in 2018, when he 'first instituted national security-related tariffs on steel in March 2018. \n\n'President Trump responded to an industry that was suffering from surges of dumped imports, instituting the tariffs to support manufacturing in America. \n\n'The tariffs achieved their goals. American steel manufacturing rose in response.'\n\nBell warned that China is planning to dump more steel in the global market than even the United States can produce annually in an effort to counter their own 'stagnated economy.'\n\nTrump's latest promised tariffs are coming earlier in his presidency than during his previous years in the White House, when he prioritized tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nFinancial markets fell on Friday after Trump first floated his idea of reciprocal tariffs. Stock prices also dropped, with many respondents citing the tariffs as a growing concern. \n\nWhen asked about aluminum, he responded, 'aluminum, too' will be subject to the trade penalties\n\nTrump on Sunday did not offer any further details about the steel and aluminum duties, or the reciprocal tariffs. \n\nBarely a week ago, Trump threatened 25 per cent import taxes on all goods from Canada and Mexico, but paused the policy for 30 days after working with leaders from both nations. \n\nAt the same time, he proceeded to add 10 per cent duties on all imports from China.\n\nAfter crisis talks with Canada's Justin Trudeau, Trump said: 'As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that.\n\n'Canada has agreed to ensure we have a secure Northern Border, and to finally end the deadly scourge of drugs like Fentanyl that have been pouring into our Country, killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, while destroying their families and communities all across our Country.' \n\nCanada vowed to implement a $1.3billion border policy in an effort to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering at the border in exchange for Trump's promise to halt his tariffs for 30 days.\n\nSimultaneously, Mexico also fell in line, agreeing to send 10,000 national guardsmen to the border to stop human trafficking and the flow of fentanyl. \n\nFloridaDonald TrumpCanadaMexico\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump leaves reporters scrambling on Air Force One as he announces new global tariffs\n\nAdd comment","summary":"While on board Air Force One en route to the Super Bowl with a plane full of journalists, President Trump made the startling revelation.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14378709/trump-steel-aluminum-tariff-air-force-one.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95034129-0-image-a-11_1739143030034.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:53:43","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.217}]}
