During the high-profile visit, Putin will hold key meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of the SCO engagements. Additionally, he is expected to join North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during the military parade celebrations.\nIn the lead-up to his visit, President Putin gave a written interview to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, where he discussed the key themes that are likely to dominate the diplomatic meetings. Reflecting on Xi Jinping’s state visit to Russia in May, Putin described it as a “resounding success.”\n“I look forward to holding in-depth discussions with Xi on all aspects of the bilateral agenda,” Putin stated, adding that both leaders would also “exchange views on pressing regional and international issues.” He further praised Xi’s “genuine commitment to advancing our comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation.”\nPutin highlighted the growing economic ties between Russia and China, noting that bilateral trade has grown by approximately 100 billion US dollars since 2021. “In Russia, we deeply value the Chinese leader’s genuine commitment,” he added.\nAccording to Putin, China is now Russia’s top trading partner, while Russia ranked fifth among China’s foreign trade partners last year. Energy remains a cornerstone of their trade relations, with Russia maintaining its status as a leading oil and gas exporter to China.\n“Russia is one of the world’s principal markets for Chinese car exports,” Putin said. “Together, we are building high-tech manufacturing and infrastructure facilities. We also have large-scale plans in the construction materials industry.”\nThe visit may also include discussions on Western sanctions against Russia and recent US tariffs on Chinese goods. While Putin held talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month on the Ukraine conflict, there has been little progress. Meanwhile, hostilities between Russia and Ukraine continue through both direct and indirect attacks.\nChina, for its part, is engaged in ongoing trade negotiations with the US after both countries imposed high retaliatory tariffs on each other earlier this year.","summary":"Putin highlighted the growing economic ties between Russia and China, noting that bilateral trade has grown by approximately 100 billion US dollars since 2021.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/putin-prepares-for-high-profile-china-visit-to-meet-xi-jinping-amid-mounting-us-pressure-ws-l-9537305.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Xi-Jinping-Vladimir-Putin-AFP-2025-02-49309d0dcb3a5d1cce2843dceeaa62e1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:59:46","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.421},{"id":355689926,"title":"Melania Trump humiliated as fake Vanity Fair cover dubs her 'American Queen'","text":"America's First Lady, Melania Trump, has become the target of mounting mockery this week after a fabricated Vanity Fair cover featuring her began spreading across social media platforms. The bogus cover story, which showcased a striking image of Mrs Trump donning a crown, branded her \"The American Queen\" whilst also hailing her as the \"most enigmatic First Lady.\" It further teased an article about her \"Silent Revolution\" - all supported by the strapline: \"Fashion, power & the art of staying silent.\" As soon as the image started doing the rounds online, MAGA followers were swift to heap praise upon it, seemingly missing both the satirical intent behind the design and the fact it was artificially generated. Particularly, branding Melania as America's Queen served as a clear reference to anti-Trump demonstrators, who took to the streets earlier this summer during a series of nationwide \"No Kings\" protests, reports the Express . Whilst MAGA enthusiasts may have been delighted at the thought of Melania taking centre stage, it subsequently came to light that the cover was fabricated and that she had actually declined the opportunity to appear on the magazine's cover. According to Page Six, , she showed no interest and reportedly \"laughed\" when the proposal was put to her back in July. A source close to the First Lady revealed to the magazine: \"She doesn't have time to be sitting in a photo shoot. Her priorities as First Lady are far more important... These people don't deserve her anyway.\" This apparent snub followed threats from Vanity Fair staff to walk out if Mrs Trump was given the coveted cover spot. The magazine's new global editorial director, Mark Guiducci, attempted to charm Mrs Trump back in July, but his employees were so outraged by the idea that many threatened to resign immediately. \"'If [Guiducci] puts Melania on the cover, half of the editorial staff will walk out, I guarantee it, \"a mid-level editor told the Daily Mail on Monday. \"I will walk out the motherf***ing door, and half my staff will follow me... If I have to work bagging groceries at Trader Joe's, I'll do it... It sickens me.\" Adding insult to injury, following the release of the fake cover online, California Governor Gavin Newsom couldn't resist adding fuel to the fire as he released his own AI cover of himself on the cover, mocking the absurdity of the initial image. In his version, which is almost identical, Gavin is seen striking a similar pose to Melania, while also wearing a crown underneath the title: \"The American King, Gavin Newsom's Vocal Revolution.\" It then continues: \"Inside the private world of America's most enigmatic governor\" before concluding with a satirical tagline: \"Hair, Gel and the Art of being so handsome.\" Newsom's press team quickly reposted the image to X, taking a cheeky swipe at Donald Trump by mimicking his distinctive social media style with the caption: \"AN HONOR! THANK YOU! ! !\". This isn't the first time the Democrat has had a laugh at the expense of the Trumps. His new social media strategy of imitating the President has given his poll numbers a significant boost in recent days. Newsome is currently leading the pack among Democratic primary voters for the 2028 presidential election.","summary":"A fake Vanity Fair cover featuring Melania Trump as the cover star has been circulating online, with the First Lady being dubbed &quot;The American Queen&quot; - and it appears even Governor Newsom has been keen to get in on the joke","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/melania-trump-humiliated-fake-vanity-35818019","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35818018.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_First-Lady-Melania-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:59:21","author":"Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":355688898,"title":"Starmer's stinging snub to Trump as he turns down bottle of fancy whisky from US president","text":"The Prime Minister turned down a bottle of whisky gifted to him by Donald Trump during his trip to Turnberry, it has been revealed.\n\nThe two leaders met at the US President's golf club in Ayrshire, Scotland, last month before travelling abroad Air Force One together to the US President's Aberdeenshire golf club. \n\nDuring their talks, key topics of discussion including putting into place a US-UK trade deal the two nations signed earlier this year, alongside the Middle East Crisis, with Donald Trump speaking warmly of their 'special relationship'.\n\nNow, it has been revealed that Sir Kier was given a bottle of 'special edition whisky' by the Turnberry Hotel at a cost of £140, but chose not to keep it. \n\nWhen gifted items of more than £140, ministers can chose to either pay the difference between the value and £140 to buy it, or leave it with their department. \n\nIn this instance, the Prime Minister chose to let the Cabinet Office keep the liquor. He also gifted Trump's Turnberry Hotel a golf club and book, the Prime Minister's gifts registar has shown.\n\nOfficial records have also indicated that David Lammy was gifted more than £32,000 worth of luxury items from the Crown Prince of Kuwait last month, but has chosen to hand the gifts over to the Foreign Office.\n\nThe items given to the Foreign Secretary by Sabah Khaled Al-Hamed Al-Sabah, Crown Prince of Kuwait, in July included a Chopard watch and Cartier pen, alongside FRED jewellery with an estimated value of £18,250, and £2,500 worth of perfume.\n\nA book and tie gifted to the Prime Minister by French President Emmanuel Macron were also shown to have been held by Number 10, alongside a leather wallet received by Lady Victoria Starmer. \n\nSir Keir Starmer was also revealed to have accepted hospitality gifts at a cost of £1,060 from Uefa and the FA in order to be in attendance at the women's Euros final earlier this summer.\n\nIn November last year, it was revealed that Sir Keir Starmer had stumped up more than £6,000 to pay back freebies he has received since entering Number 10.\n\nAmid a fierce row over his and other senior Labour ministers' acceptance of gifts, the PM revealed he would now cover the costs of tickets and other hospitality.\n\nBut Sir Keir is not paying back all the freebies he has received since taking office and will continue to accept donated football tickets.\n\nThe PM has previously argued that, while he continues to have a season ticket at Arsenal, he has been told it is unsafe for him to sit in his normal seats in the stands without a vastly expensive police presence.\n\nThe north London club will instead make arrangements for Sir Keir to watch matches from elsewhere - such as corporate hospitality seats - whenever he attends games.\n\nIn April, it was also revealed that Sir Keir had paid tax n £16,000 worth of free clothing he received from a major Labour donor as he declared a total taxable income of more than £150,000 last year.\n\nThe PM's tax return showed how Sir Keir earned a combined £130,583 in 2023/24 in his role as an MP and Labour leader.\n\n But he also declared £16,000 in 'other benefits', £498 in self-employment income and £5,174 in income from savings.\n\nThis put Sir Keir's total taxable income at £152,255, on which he paid income tax of £54,718.\n\nNo10 sources confirmed the 'other benefits' related to £16,000 of free clothing Sir Keir received from Lord Waheed Alli in the 2023/24 tax year.\n\nThese donations were part of the 'freebies' row that engulfed the PM shortly after he took office in July last year.\n\nStarmer's decision to decline Trump's whisky gift comes as Trump and Scottish First Minister Sir John Swinney engaged in bilateral talks on July 200 regarding a cut to American tariffs on Scotch whisky, which currently stands at 10 per cent. \n\nThe US President was described as showing a 'willingness' to move on the US tarrifs, believed to cost the sector more than £4million per week. \n\nThe First Minister said: 'I think there's a willingness for President Trump to look at the issues that I've set out to him.\n\n'I don't think that was the position a few days ago, because I think President Trump was of the view that the trade deal was done and dusted and that was an end of the matter.'\n\n Adding that there was an 'opportunity' for the two leaders to make progress, Mr Swinney also told the US President that Scotch whisky was 'unique' to the nation, with the tariff acting as a 'significant impediment'. \n\nSwinney was at the centre of a major hypocrisy row after he pledged a donation of £180,000 of public cash for a golf tournament at one of Donald Trump’s Scottish courses.\n\nTaxpayers were also understood to have paid the bill for rooms for John Swinney and his entourage at Donald Trump’s golf resort during the US President’s visit last month.\n\nThe billionaire’s Aberdeenshire hotel charged the First Minister and his officials for their stay, with the Scottish Government picking up the tab.\n\nOfficials refused to say how many rooms were taken or the nightly rate, but it is believed to have been hundreds of pounds.\n\nMr Swinney and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer flanked the President at a dinner at the five-star MacLeod House & Lodge at his Balmedie estate on July 28.\n\nThe First Minister then met Mr Trump for 20 minutes the following morning, before the President played on a new course.","summary":"The two leaders met at Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland, last month before travelling abroad Air Force

Decency","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron’s scathing remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin last week have sparked backlash from Moscow, with Russia’s Foreign Ministry calling the comments “vulgar insults.” Macron made the remarks during an interview with French broadcaster LCI, warning European leaders against placing their trust in Putin.\n“For his own survival, he needs to keep eating… That means he is a predator, an ogre at our gates,” Macron said, characterising the Russian leader in strikingly aggressive terms. The French President’s comments came a week after a multilateral meeting at the White House on August 18, attended by European heads of state, US President Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nThe Kremlin did not remain silent. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova strongly condemned Macron’s language. “This is unworthy of a head of state,” Zakharova said. “The comments cross the line of not just reasonableness, but decency, becoming vulgar insults against Russia and its people,” she added, in reference to Macron’s use of terms like “predator” and “ogre.”\nTensions between France and Russia have remained high since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Paris has emerged as one of Kyiv’s strongest allies, offering both military assistance and financial support. Macron, in particular, has been among the most vocal European leaders in condemning Putin’s actions and questioning his intentions.\nIn a separate statement made on Friday, Macron reiterated his position regarding the timeline promised by Putin for a possible meeting with Zelenskyy. He emphasised that the deadline, set for Monday, is fast approaching. “If that doesn’t happen by Monday… it means that once again President Putin played President Trump,” Macron said.\nThe French president has consistently advocated that providing Ukraine with firm security guarantees is the only pathway to achieving a just and lasting peace, underscoring his continued commitment to supporting Kyiv in the ongoing conflict.","summary":"Tensions between France and Russia have remained high since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/russia-condemns-ogre-remark-against-putin-accuses-macron-of-crossing-line-of-decency-ws-l-9537303.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/03/macron-putin-2025-03-e919d23605220de1568b104e00f5f8b1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:39:23","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":355687822,"title":"Appeals court rules against Trump tariffs, but Supreme Court appeal may soon follow","text":"A federal appeals court ruled against President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Friday, but the ruling won’t take immediate effect because the court is giving the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court. So as with nearly every big issue in American life, the justices may have the last word. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration will appeal. The president said in his own social media post that if the ruling stands it would “literally destroy the United States of America.” The ruling came Friday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. It dealt with five executive orders imposing tariffs “of unlimited duration on nearly all goods from nearly every country in the world,” as the court put it. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously ruled in May that the tariffs ran afoul of a federal law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The government appealed to the Federal Circuit, which upheld the trade court on Friday. “Because we agree that IEEPA’s grant of presidential authority to ‘regulate’ imports does not authorize the tariffs imposed by the Executive Orders, we affirm,” the appeals court said, adding that it wasn’t weighing in on “whether the President’s actions should have been taken as a matter of policy.” The court also said that further review is needed back in the trade court regarding the universal injunction it granted. The appeals court cited the Supreme Court’s ruling in the birthright citizenship case that dealt with that subject in June, after the trade court ruling came out. The Federal Circuit’s ruling on Friday split the 11 judges who heard the case 7-4. The judges also issued an order accompanying the ruling that keeps it from taking effect through Oct. 14. If a Supreme Court appeal is filed by then, the appellate ruling will remain on hold either until the Supreme Court declines review or issues its own ruling. Four judges added a separate opinion that agreed with the majority, but further expressed their view that IEEPA not only doesn’t authorize Trump to issue the tariffs in these executive orders, but that it doesn’t authorize him to issue any tariffs at all. Four other judges dissented, writing that they agreed with the majority that the trade court had jurisdiction, that the plaintiffs had standing to bring a lawsuit and that (if the tariffs are unlawful) the case needs to be sent back to the lower court for further review; but they disagreed with the substance of the lower court’s ruling that the tariffs are unlawful.

Mike Kehoe said Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state’s U.S. House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year’s congressional elections.Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Donald Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.Missouri is the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican-led Texas took up the task first but was quickly countered by Democratic-led California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.Kehoe scheduled Missouri's special session to begin Sept. 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver’s Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.His agenda also includes another Republican priority — a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion-rights and marijuana legalization amendments adopted in recent years.Kehoe cast both items as a defense against liberal politicians and activists.“Missouri’s conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,\" he said in a statement.Democrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a “Trump puppet” attempting to “steal a congressional seat for Republicans” and gut the ballot initiative process.It “marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861,” Aune said in a statement.Missouri is represented in the U.S. House by six Republicans and two Democrats — Cleaver and Rep. Wesley Bell in St. Louis.Cleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Trump.“This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,” Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.RELATED STORY | Texas governor signs new voting maps pushed by Trump to gain five GOP seats in Congress in 2026Missouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democrats left the state for two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats' absence would not prevent a quorum for business. And although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural maneuvers to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.Republicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024, an outcome that aligned almost perfectly with the share of the vote won by the two parties in districts across the U.S., according to a recent Associated Press analysis. Although the overall outcome was close to neutral, the AP’s analysis shows that Democrats and Republicans each benefited from advantages in particular states stemming from the way districts were drawn.Democrats would need to net three seats in next year’s election to take control of the chamber. The incumbent president’s party tends to lose seats in the midterm elections, as was the case for Trump in 2018, when Democrats won control of the House and subsequently launched investigations of Trump. Seeking to avoid a similar situation in his second term, Trump has urged Republican-led states to fortify their congressional seats.In Texas, Republicans already hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats.“Texas is now more red in the United States Congress,” Abbott said in a video he posted on X of him signing the legislation.Newsom, who has emerged as a leading adversary of Trump on redistricting and other issues, tauntingly labeled Abbott on X as the president’s “#1 lapdog” following the signing. Democrats already hold 43 of California’s 52 congressional seats.Voting rights groups filed a lawsuit this week ahead of Abbott’s signing the bill, saying the new map weakens the electoral influence of Black voters. Texas Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new map in court.Some Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that could give them a 7-1 edge when redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the GOP legislative majority ultimately opted against it. Some feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.Republican officials in Florida, Indiana and elsewhere also are considering revising their U.S. House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.In Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republicans have won all four of Utah’s congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.","summary":"Republican Gov.

The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York. But the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.The ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose erratic trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralyzed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.The court’s decision centers on the tariffs Trump slapped in April on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.Trump on April 2 — Liberation Day, he called it — imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the United States — and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did — including the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union — and agreed to lopsided deals with Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.Those that didn't knuckle under — or otherwise incurred Trump's wrath — got hit harder earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits “a national emergency.”In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs — and Trump has made the most of it.The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Joe Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the President’’ under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case.On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that “it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday’s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions “is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court’s decisions,” which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.The government has argued that if Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it’s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin” for the United States.It could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.“While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,” Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” he wrote on his social medial platform.Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot simply be imposed at the president’s own discretion.","summary":"US appeals court deals blow to Trump&#39;s tariffs, ruling he overstepped authority, but tariffs remain in effect pending possible Supreme Court appeal.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-s-tariffs-under-fire-what-s-next-for-trade-policy-after-court-s-ruling","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/donald-trump-announces-new-tariffs-1751942883695-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:35:42","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":355688384,"title":"Lisa Cook’s Attorney Likens Trump to Humpty Dumpty","text":"Following the reportedly abrupt dismissal of a Federal Reserve Board governor by President Donald Trump, the dismissed official promptly filed a lawsuit, pushing a federal judge to recognize the complex legal issues involved. The administration claims mortgage fraud allegations against Lisa Cook justify her removal. Cook’s renowned lawyer drew a comparison between Trump and “Humpty Dumpty” while trying to minimize the significance of the criminal charges her client faces.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee from 2021, initiated Friday’s session by confirming that the Federal Reserve and its legal representative attended as observers, not participants. Cook, also appointed by Biden and having started her 14-year tenure in 2023, is defended by notable attorney Abbe Lowell. Lowell has been involved in high-profile cases, including those of Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, and New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, who faced similar fraud accusations.\n\nAfter Lowell stated his intention to request a preliminary injunction by Tuesday, Cobb acknowledged the significance of Cook’s case, stating it deals with unprecedented issues, particularly regarding the board. The judge questioned Lowell’s reasons for seeking a temporary restraining order.\n\nLowell clarified that the urgency stemmed from uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve, led by Jerome Powell, would enforce Cook’s dismissal. Despite criminal accusations from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte submitted to the DOJ, the Fed had not yet acted.\n\nDescribing Cook as an “exceptionally skilled economist,” Lowell criticized the basis of Pulte’s charges, highlighting their tentative language, such as “appears” and “potentially.” He argued that President Trump relied on these shaky grounds to justify her dismissal, asserting, “What she did was bad.”\n\nThe judge wanted to know what should be done in a circumstance where, as here, the relevant statute does not define cause. In the government’s view, when cause is not defined, the president has the discretion to remove.\n\nLowell answered by spelling out Cobb’s “dilemma” and ultimately her “choice” in the case: consider Trump as like Humpty Dumpty — deciding what words mean when he says them and defining “cause” on his own — or look to Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States.\n\nAs Law&Crime has explained, Humphrey’s Executor established that “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office” were the causes for firing an FTC commissioner, as Congress expressly intended to insulate the independent fair competition agency from being unfairly subjected to politicization. In that case, the estate of William Humphrey sued for back pay, successfully arguing that then-President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not have the power to fire him without cause after policy disagreements.\n\nLowell and Cook have argued that Trump’s attempted firing of her is not only pretextual — in the sense that the mortgage fraud allegations just happened to come up to force her out — but is also rooted in policy disagreements, as both Cook and Powell have incurred the president’s ire by refusing to lower interest rates. In addition, the allegations related to alleged conduct that predated Cook’s confirmation to the job.\n\nWhile Lowell did not take the “absolute” and “extreme” position that any conduct before confirmation can’t amount to cause for firing, he did emphasize that there are certain factors that should be taken into consideration in such cases. Some examples: Were the allegations known at the time of the person’s confirmation? What is the nature of the offense and how does it relate to their office? What’s the evidence? What notice of the allegations and due process was given, and does Pulte tweeting out the allegations “at 11 p.m. at night” meet a notice requirement? And did Cook have a real chance to contest the allegations?\n\nLowell concluded that “whatever it [cause] is, it’s not this” — referring to Pulte’s tweet-storm and claims against Cook over alleged but non-adjudicated mortgage fraud claims. Lowell asserted that the president of the United States — “especially this one” — could have a “bad motive” that would “illuminate there was no cause,” but it might be enough to look at Pulte’s dozens of tweets on the subject.\n\nA lawyer for the government countered that Trump had the discretion to fire Cook and that his non-policy-disagreement-related determination about cause is either not reviewable by the courts or is, at the very least, subject to great deference. For the DOJ, proper cause calls into question an individual’s fitness to serve, and it is up to the president and his determination to make that judgment, not for the court to question it.\n\nThe government then slammed Cook’s brief as noticeably “very careful” in tiptoeing around the elephant in the room and “not to make any representation about what actually happened” as far as allegedly listing multiple houses as her primary residence in documents.\n\n3 strikes and you’re out.\nToday, U.S. Federal Housing sent a 2nd Criminal Referral in the matter of Lisa D.

That’s still not something anyone can do anything about?”\n\nThe DOJ attorney reiterated that to the “extent we’re going to have review at all,” it’s going to be “deferential” to Trump. The lawyer said he just didn’t see the argument that mortgage fraud allegations, for which Cook has still not explained, cannot be cause for removal.\n\n“I just haven’t heard the story Cook wants to share,” the lawyer said, noting that it remains unclear whether the document representations were criminal or negligent, or whether someone else — like a lawyer or accountant — was to blame.\n\nOn rebuttal, Lowell repeated that Trump’s use of the word “cause” next to Article II powers doesn’t make it valid and “enough” a reason to fire Cook, particularly against the backdrop of Pulte tweeting and Trump immediately calling for Cook to resign or be fired.\n\nThe two-hour hearing ended without any decision on the request for a temporary restraining order.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump gestures during a reception for Republican members of Congress&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Lisa Cook&#8217;s Attorney Likens Trump to Humpty Dumpty first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/lisa-cooks-attorney-likens-trump-to-humpty-dumpty/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lisa-Cooks-lawyer-compares-Trump-to-Humpty-Dumpty.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:27:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":355688104,"title":"Appeals court blocks Trump administration from ending legal protections for 600,000 Venezuelans","text":"A federal appeals court on Friday blocked President Donald Trump's plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the United States, saying that plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the Republican administration's actions were unlawful. \n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status designations for Venezuelans while they challenge actions by Trump’s administration in court. \n\nThe 9th Circuit judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of temporary protected status because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it. \n\nThen-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration had extended temporary protected status, commonly known as TPS, for people from Venezuela.\n\n“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” Judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, wrote for the panel. The other two judges on the panel were also nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\nIn an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security blasted the decision as more obstruction from “unelected activist” judges.\n\n“For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,\" the email read. “While this injunction delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.”\n\nCongress authorized temporary protected status, or TPS, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the secretary of DHS to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country. The terms are for six, 12 and 18 months. \n\nThe appellate judges said the guaranteed time limitations were critical so people could gain employment, find long-term housing and build stability without fear of shifting political winds. \n\nBut in ending the protections soon after Trump took office, Noem said conditions in Venezuela had improved and it was not in the U.S. national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program. It's part of a broader move by Trump’s administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are in the country either without legal documentation or through legal temporary programs. \n\nU.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in terminating the protections. Chen postponed the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.\n\nIt is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their U.S. citizen children and even deported. \n\nProtections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.\n\n“What is really significant now is that the second court unanimously recognized that the trial court got it right,” said Emi MacLean, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California representing plaintiffs.\n\nShe added that while the decision might not benefit immediately those people who have already lost their status or are about to lose their status, Friday's ruling “should provide a path for the administration’s illegal actions related to Venezuela and TPS to finally be undone.”\n\nA court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and Supreme Court decision. \n\nA Washington woman who worked in restaurants was deported in June along with her daughters, 10 years and 15 months old, after ICE officers told her to bring her children to an immigration check-in. The father of the baby, who is a U.S. citizen, remains in the U.S. while the woman tries to figure out what to do. \n\nAlso in June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings. \n\n“I am not a criminal,” he said in the declaration, adding that “immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.\"\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. Their country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nAttorneys for the U.S. government argued the Homeland Security secretary’s clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program were not subject to judicial review. They also denied that Noem's actions were motivated by racial animus.\n\nBut the appellate judges said courts clearly had jurisdiction in cases where the actions were unlawful. They declined to address whether Noem was motivated by racial animus.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ron Wyden of Oregon said he plans to force votes on “repealing these harmful, regressive taxes at every opportunity.”\n\nThe ruling complicates Trump’s ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own. Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. His tariffs — and the erratic way he’s rolled them out — have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\n\nBut he’s also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\n“The administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy,” Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\n\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday’s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions “is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court’s decisions,” which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariff authorities to the president.\n\nThe government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it’s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nRevenue from tariffs now totals $159 billion, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin\" for the United States.\n\n“For all the tariffs that have been collected under IEEPA, you’re going to see folks request refunds and more refunds,” said trade attorney Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a former White House economic adviser.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, accused the judges of interfering with the president's central role in foreign policy and vowed to appeal.\n\nThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):\n\n— The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 — “Liberation Day,” he called it — when he imposed “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a “baseline” 10% tariff on just about everyone else. Those tariff rates have since been revised by Trump, in some cases after trade negotiations, and generally went into effect Aug. 7.\n\nThe national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. The president started to levy modified tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a surplus also face the taxes.\n\n— The “trafficking tariffs” he announced Feb. 1 on imports from Canada, China and Mexico and later refined. These were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States. The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\n\nBut Trump’s assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges — at least seven cases. No president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on U.S. adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\nThey also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an “unusual and extraordinary” threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits — in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them — for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs “exceed any authority granted to the President” under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case.\n\nIn the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA’s requirement that they “deal with” the problem they were supposed to address.\n\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\n\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Joe Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\n\nTrump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to tax imports from countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits at 15% for 150 days.\n\nLikewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Sherman and Josh Boak contributed to this story.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

She wants to maybe do panels, and help facilitate it and [talk about how] to protect families from guardianships.

The department oversees a variety of US health agencies, including the CDC. \n\nThe BBC reached out to HHS and representatives for Kennedy. \n\nThe recent turmoil follows the CDC permanently firing 600 employees earlier this month, according to a union representing the workers.\n\nThe wide-ranging layoffs include employees working on the government's response to infectious diseases, including bird flu, as well as those researching environmental hazards and handling public record requests for information. \n\nSince taking office, Kennedy, a vaccine critic, has made a number of funding cuts and changes to how the US recommends and regulates immunizations that have angered public health experts.\n\nHe previously helped run an anti-vaccine group, and has repeatedly stated widely debunked claims about vaccine harm. \n\nIs RFK Jr's divisive plan to Make America Healthy Again fearmongering - or revolutionary?Fact-checking RFK Jr's views on health policy\n\nFormer CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr Debra Houry, one of the officials who resigned this week, told the BBC's Newshour radio programme that Kennedy's policies lacked scientific integrity. \n\n\"I am extremely worried that with continued resignations, terminations, retirements, all because of what's going on through some of these policies, that we are not going to have the capacity to continue to do good science, to respond to an outbreak and to prevent chronic diseases,\" she said. \n\nShe added that the worst case result of Kennedy's policies is the disruption of the vaccine schedule for children, which could lead to the spread of \"preventable diseases throughout the US again, like polio and measles.\"\n\nSeveral Democrat senators have called for Kennedy's resignation, including Georgia's Jon Ossoff - who called the health secretary a \"quack\" - and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nWhite House names RFK Jr deputy as replacement CDC directorFirst human case of flesh-eating screwworm parasite confirmed in US\n\n\"Donald Trump knew Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be a disastrous pick to lead health care in America and he nominated him anyway. Donald Trump made this mistake and now he must fire RFK Jr. immediately,\" Schumer said in a written statement.\n\nSeveral Republicans also expressed unease over the developments at the CDC, with Maine Senator Susan Collins saying there was \"no basis\" to remove Monarez from her position. She asked for a congressional hearing to examine what is happening at the agency. \n\nFellow Republican senator Bill Cassidy, who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee - which vetted Kennedy's appointment - said the panel would conduct oversight over the high-profile departures. \n\nHe also urged a delay on a vaccine advisory committee hearing scheduled for next month, saying there were allegations that the panel lacked a \"scientific process\". \n\n\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" he said. \n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr wrote an open letter to CDC employees after the removal of Monarez and the departure of several top officials, according to US media. \n\n\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC. Your daily efforts—often unseen—save lives,\" he wrote. \n\n\"Reform does not diminish your work; it strengthens it. The American people are ready to believe in this agency again if we show them that integrity, accountability, and science guide every decision,\" Kennedy added.\n\nThe health secretary also said that he wants to rebuild the CDC into \"a guardian of America's health and security.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedv3gg3x6xo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4987/live/c1c88960-8523-11f0-a172-2d379cd1f7b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-30 00:09:09","author":"Ali Abbas Ahmadi","authors":["Ali Abbas Ahmadi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":355687562,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: Aug. 30, 2025","text":"TOKYO - The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nTOKYO - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed on Friday to further bolster economic and security cooperation over the next decade, as Tokyo places greater emphasis on India's growing global role amid challenges.\n\nAfter talks in Tokyo, Ishiba and Modi unveiled a \"joint vision\" outlining their collaboration, with goals of boosting Japanese investment in India to 10 trillion yen ($68 billion) and raising mutual personnel exchanges to 500,000 within five years.\n\nNorth Korea's Kim, Russia's Putin may hold talks in China\n\nMOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin is considering holding talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during an upcoming visit to China for a World War II-related commemoration, a Putin aide said Friday.\n\nYury Ushakov said both Putin and Kim will attend an event in Beijing on Wednesday commemorating the 80th anniversary of China's victory over Japan in the Second World War, and that the two leaders may also meet for bilateral talks while in the country.\n\nNEW YORK - Some American vendors and fans of Japanese anime content are feeling the pinch from price increases on memorabilia after recent U.S. tariff policy changes and fresh levies imposed on imports from Japan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has suspended a tariff exemption for low-cost goods worldwide that was seen as a loophole hurting U.S. manufacturers, while its country-specific tariffs include a 15 percent rate for imports from Japan.\n\nChina plans to modernize military, dominate western Pacific: Taiwan report\n\nTAIPEI - Taiwan's Defense Ministry warned in an annual report on Friday that mainland China aims to fully modernize its military by 2035 and dominate western areas of the Pacific, effectively seizing overall control of the Taiwan Strait.\n\nIn the report submitted to the island's parliament, the ministry said the mainland \"seeks to secure overall force-projection superiority west of the second island chain,\" a strategic line stretching from Japan's Izu Islands to Guam, and \"effectively turn the Taiwan Strait into internal waters.\"\n\nTOKYO - The Japanese government has released simulated video footage of a large Mt.

Kim, who has previously worked alongside the President on prison reform, spoke out on Thursday, August 28, before she took to the stage to receive an honor at Diane Von Furstenberg's DVF Awards in Venice, Italy.\n\n\"In the news, you hear, 'Oh, it's about people who have committed these crimes and they're trying to help out our country.' But then you hear about all of the people who have worked so hard to build our country, and so many people who are such a part of our country getting affected,\" she told the press beforehand.\n\n\"People I know. People my friends know. You want to believe that there's a powerful message in protection, but then you see that it's not really happening like that. It's really tough, but I think that we have to do what we can to protect the people who have really supported and built our country.\"\n\nIn response, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Kim \"misinformed and detached from the very reality of the operations in Los Angeles she has decided to opine on\".\n\n\"These are the violent criminals who Homeland Security, under President Trump and Secretary Noem’s leadership, have removed from Los Angeles’s streets: murderers, rapists, gang members, and child pedophiles,\" she told TMZ, adding: \"Why does Ms. Kardashian continue to do the bidding of criminals at the expense of innocent Americans and brave law enforcement?\"\n\nIn June, Kim took to Stories to criticize President Trump's ICE policies. \n\n\"When we're told that ICE exists to keep our country safe and remove violent criminals - great,\" she wrote. \"But when we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up.

Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end.\n\n“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong.”\n\nIn the post, Mr Trump also said the US will not tolerate enormous trade deficits and unfair tariffs imposed by other countries.\n\n“If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America. At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers, and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products.”\n\nOn Friday night the US attorney general confirmed the administration would appeal the court decision.\n\nThe president has made tariffs a key pillar of foreign policy in his second term, using them to exert political pressure and renegotiate trade deals with countries that export goods to the United States.\n\nHis measures have given the Trump administration leverage to extract economic concessions from trading partners but have also shaken financial markets.\n\nThe court’s decision, which largely upheld a May decision by a specialised federal trade court in New York, does not impact tariffs issued under other legal means, such as Mr Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.\n\nIts ruling allows the tariffs to remain in place until October 14, giving the Trump administration a chance to file an appeal with the US Supreme Court.\n\nMr Trump justified both sets of tariffs — as well as more recent tariffs — under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Act gives the president the power to address “unusual and extraordinary” threats during national emergencies.\n\n“It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the ruling said. “The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs.”\n\nThe 1977 law had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets. Mr Trump, the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, said the measures were justified given trade imbalances, declining US manufacturing power and the cross-border flow of drugs.\n\nThe ruling could deal a devastating financial blow to the US treasury, potentially forcing the government to refund some of the billions of dollars in import taxes it has collected.\n\nIt could also sow chaos in removing a major source of income to help pay for the massive tax cuts Mr Trump signed into law under his One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nRevenue from tariffs totalled $142 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.\n\nMr Trump has previously warned that a ruling upholding that his tariffs are illegal would risk plunging the country into recession.\n\nTaking to Truth Social earlier this month, he wrote: “It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/us-court-rules-donald-trump-235747124.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QHbzUWOYXk6wlIG7zmmO5Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNTAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/eaa4fd20e5e7c929a279683992fb5256","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:57:47","author":"Cameron Henderson","authors":["Cameron Henderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.019},{"id":355683378,"title":"'Still In Effect': Trump Defends Tariffs After Appeals Court Calls Them Misuse Of Power","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his tariff policies in a post on Truth Social, a day after a federal appeals court ruled that he had misused his authority by imposing certain tariffs under an emergency-powers statute. The court’s decision, reported by Reuters, reignited debate over the limits of presidential power in trade policy and prompted swift reactions from Trump and the White House.\n“All tariffs are still in effect!” Trump wrote in the post, reaffirming his administration’s hardline stance on trade. “US will no longer tolerate enormous trade deficits and unfair tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers imposed by other countries, friend or foe.” He further claimed that removing the tariffs would be a “disaster” for the US, arguing it would weaken the nation financially.\nThe President also reiterated that tariffs play a crucial role in supporting American labour and manufacturing. “For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise politicians,” Trump added. He criticised past administrations for allowing foreign countries to benefit at the expense of American workers and reaffirmed his belief that the court would ultimately recognise the economic advantages of the tariff policies.\nTrump’s post was issued in response to Friday’s ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which concluded that Trump had overstepped his authority. The judges stated that only Congress holds the constitutional power to impose taxes, including tariffs. “The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,” the ruling, signed by seven judges, stated.\nDespite the court’s finding of presidential overreach, the panel allowed the tariffs to remain in effect while the legal case proceeds. The ruling specifically challenges two sets of tariffs implemented by Trump. The first is a series of “reciprocal” tariffs imposed on a country-by-country basis. The second involves targeted tariffs on certain goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, which the Trump administration claimed were necessary due to those countries’ alleged failures to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US.\nImportantly, Friday’s decision does not affect other tariffs enacted under different legal frameworks, such as those on steel and aluminium imported from global trading partners. These measures were enacted under provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\nResponding to the court’s decision, White House spokesman Kush Desai issued a statement defending Trump’s actions. “President Trump lawfully exercised the tariff powers granted to him by Congress to defend our national and economic security from foreign threats,” Desai said. “The President’s tariffs remain in effect, and we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.”\nThe administration is expected to challenge the ruling by taking the case to the US Supreme Court. The current makeup of the Court includes six conservative justices and three liberals, with three of the conservatives having been nominated by Trump himself, potentially boosting the administration’s hopes for a favourable outcome.","summary":"The President also reiterated that tariffs play a crucial role in supporting American labour and manufacturing.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/still-in-effect-trump-defends-tariffs-after-appeals-court-calls-them-misuse-of-power-ws-l-9537297.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-REUTERS-Trade-Tariffs-2025-05-c55cebb9b13a15ff3d7cc307e9d85b3d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:45:31","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":355688198,"title":"A conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court justice won’t run again, creating an open seat","text":"By SCOTT BAUER\n\nMADISON, Wis.

(AP) — A conservative justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court said Friday that she will not seek reelection, creating an open race for a seat on the court that’s controlled 4-3 by liberals.\n\nJustice Rebecca Bradley’s decision not to run for a second full term comes after conservative candidates for the highest court in the battleground state have lost each of the past two elections by double-digit margins. Both of those races broke national spending records and the liberal won in April despite heavy spending by billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nLiberal state Supreme Court candidates have won four of the past five races, resulting in them taking over the majority in 2023, breaking a 15-year run of conservative control. Regardless of who wins the April election, liberals will maintain their 4-3 court majority until at least 2028. If they can win next year, their majority would increase to 5-2.\n\nThe open race comes as several high-profile issues could make their way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the coming months, including abortion, collective bargaining rights, congressional redistricting and election rules.\n\nChris Taylor, a state appeals court judge and former Democratic state lawmaker, is the only announced candidate. Conservative Maria Lazar, who is also a state appeals court judge, said she is seriously considering a run for the state Supreme Court and will make a decision “in the next few weeks.”\n\nBradley had said in April that she planned to run again, but ultimately changed her mind.\n\n“I will not seek reelection to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because I believe the best path for me to rebuild the conservative movement and fight for liberty is not as a minority member of the Court,” she said in a statement.\n\nBradley said her warnings about the court being controlled by “judicial activists” went unheeded “and Wisconsin has seen only the beginning of what is an alarming shift from thoughtful, principled judicial service toward bitter partisanship, personal attacks, and political gamesmanship that have no place in court.”\n\n“The conservative movement needs to take stock of its failures, identify the problem, and fix it,” she said.\n\nTaylor has raised over $1 million since getting into the race, her campaign manager, Ashley Franz, said in a statement after Bradley announced her decision.\n\nBradley hadn’t raised any money this year for a potential reelection campaign.\n\n“The incredible support for Judge Taylor shows how important this race is,” Franz said.\n\nBradley, 54, was appointed to the Supreme Court by then-Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and won election to a full 10-year term in 2016.

Never before has a U.S. president attempted to remove a Fed governor.\n\nNext, the Federal Reserve itself appeared to rebuke the president, seeming to ignore his order removing Cook while signaling they would only defer to the judicial branch’s decision about whether Cook would remain in the position to which Joe Biden elevated her. Never before has the Federal Reserve so openly flouted its willingness to defy the elected president of the United States.\n\nFinally, Cook sued the U.S. president in federal court, arguing not only that Trump lacked sufficient authority or proper cause to remove her but that he is lying when he points to allegations of mortgage fraud as the reason for her dismissal.\n\nVery clearly, the old order that governed relations between the White House and the Federal Reserve has broken down.\n\nWhat exactly was the foundation of that order? And what broke it?\n\nThe Conventional Foundations of Fed Independence\n\nReading the responses to this week’s events in the editorial pages of Bloomberg, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal—or from people such as Harvard Law professor Stephen Carter or former Fed honcho William Dudley—you might think that the core of the old regime was a formal legal prohibition on presidents firing Fed officials without cause. They describe this as the linchpin of Fed independence and call upon the court to apply a highly restrictive interpretation of “for cause” to protect Cook and other officials from Trump’s interventions.\n\nThis way of seeing things, however, requires an implausible reading of history and of the text of the law itself. It asks us to believe that the Democratic majority in 1935 that restored the “for cause” provision (it had been mysteriously stripped out of the law governing the Fed in 1933) sought to not only make it virtually impossible to remove unelected Fed officials but also to put the decision of whether they could be removed into the hands of the federal courts. Anyone familiar with the frustrations many Democrats at the time felt at both the Fed—which they blamed for worsening the economic crisis of the Great Depression—and the Supreme Court—which was striking down New Deal legislation regularly—will find that idea beyond the realm of the plausible.\n\nSo, what was it that protected the Fed’s independence? In 2013, Harvard Law Professor Adrian Vermeule published a groundbreaking analysis arguing that agency independence in the United States depends far more on unwritten political conventions than on formal legal protections. His insights about the Federal Reserve’s independence prove more prescient than even he may have realized.\n\nVermeule observed that the Federal Reserve chair and vice chairs have “defined terms but no explicit for-cause tenure protection” in their leadership roles. However, they cannot be removed from their positions as Board members without cause, since all Board members have statutory for-cause protection. A president could theoretically remove someone from the chair position (stripping their leadership role) while they would continue serving as a regular Board member with for-cause protection. As Vermeule puts it, “President Obama could fire Ben Bernanke at will—not as a Board member, but as Chair.”\n\n“Yet there are no cases of Presidents formally removing the Fed Chair. Why not? I suggest that there is a strong unwritten norm protecting the Fed Chair from removal. Whatever the relevant statutes say, it is currently unimaginable that a President would fire the Fed Chair because of disagreements over macroeconomic policy,” Vermeule argued.\n\nIn other words, it was not a formal legal protection that kept presidents from removing Fed chairs. It was the convention that made removing a Fed chair without sufficient cause “unimaginable.” Presidents held back from violating that convention because of fear of reprisal from Congress, particularly the Senate (whose permission the president needs to appoint Fed governors and chairs), and backlash from the public. What’s more, presidents themselves appear to have internalized the convention, believing that overtly interfering with the Fed—as opposed to nudging it or simply criticizing it—was beyond the pale.\n\nIt’s Not Just the Fed Chair Who Needs the Shield Of Convention\n\nVermeule’s argument is persuasive, but it does not go far enough. It is not just the Fed chair and vice chairs that have been protected by convention but the governors as well. While the Federal Reserve Act states that Board members may be removed only for cause by the president, this protection is largely illusory as formal law. The statute provides no definition of “cause,” no procedural safeguards, and no meaningful constraint on presidential interpretation. In a 1901 case—decided not too much earlier than the original enactment of the Federal Reserve Act—the Supreme Court said that a similarly unadorned “for cause” provision was so broad as to make an assertion of cause judicially unreviewable. In other words, if the president says he has cause, then he does—at least as a formal legal matter.\n\nThis is backed up by the history around the restoration of the “for cause” provision in 1935. The chairman of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, Carter Glass, said that the president did not need to bring formal charges against a Fed governor to remove him. He only needed to inform the Senate in writing of the cause. Note that although this is formally weak, Glass thought this was in practice a strong protection for Fed officials that ensured the independence of the Fed.\n\nWhich is to say, the real protection for Fed governors, like the chair, comes from convention rather than law. The political costs of removing governors—congressional retaliation, market disruption, and violation of deeply held norms about central bank independence—provide the actual constraint on presidential power. The “for cause” language creates a legal veneer that makes governors appear more protected than the chair, but both derive their substantive protection from the same conventional mechanisms.\n\nThis means the entire Federal Reserve system’s independence rests on political norms rather than legal guarantees. The central bank that controls monetary policy and wields enormous economic influence operates on conventional protection that could erode under sufficient political pressure.\n\nBreaking the Conventional Peace\n\nFor decades, this conventional system worked through an implicit bargain: the Fed would maintain political neutrality in exchange for operational independence. Presidents might grumble about monetary policy, but they respected the boundaries. The Fed, in turn, avoided actions or statements that could be interpreted as electoral interference.\n\nThat conventional peace shattered in August 2019 when Bill Dudley published a Bloomberg column titled “The Fed Shouldn’t Enable Donald Trump.” Dudley wasn’t just any former Fed official. He had served as both the vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the president of the New York Fed, a position often considered second only to the chair itself and the only regional presidency that has a permanent seat on the FOMC. He didn’t merely suggest the Fed avoid accommodating bad trade policy—he explicitly advocated for electoral interference. He argued that “there’s even an argument that the election itself falls within the Fed’s purview” because “Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy.” Most provocatively, he urged Fed officials to “consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”\n\nDudley understood he was breaking taboos, acknowledging that “Fed officials’ desire to remain apolitical” was now “untenable.” His column urged the Fed to “send a clear signal” that Trump “will bear the risks—including the risk of losing the next election” if he continued his trade policies.\n\nAlthough Dudley was no longer officially part of the Fed, it has long been understood that former Fed officials often function as unofficial voices for views that current officials hold but cannot publicly express—a common pattern in government where former officials test controversial ideas or criticism that would be inappropriate coming from serving officials. A reasonable person could surmise that Dudley was giving voice to a thought that was not uncommon among current Fed officials.\n\nWhile the immediate public reaction to Dudley’s column was critical—Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, wrote a note lambasting the column and referring to its author as “Dudley Deep State” — Fed establishment immediately rallied around this new stance. That same month, all four living former Fed chairs—Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen—published an unprecedented joint op-ed defending Fed independence against Trump’s criticisms. While ostensibly defensive, their intervention represented an extraordinary mobilization of Fed veterans in public political combat, abandoning their traditional restraint about engaging in partisan fights.\n\nFormer Chair Janet Yellen went further, publicly attacking Trump’s economic competence in interviews, stating flatly “No, I do not” when asked if Trump understood macroeconomic policy. She described his focus on bilateral trade deficits as inappropriate and warned that his criticism of the Fed could “undermine confidence” in the institution.\n\nWhile these interventions came from former officials writing in their private capacities, they shattered conventional boundaries around Fed neutrality. The coordinated nature of these interventions signaled to markets, politicians, and other Fed officials that the firewall between monetary policy and electoral politics had collapsed.\n\nThe Institutionalization of Fed Partisanship\n\nWhat happened next suggests the breakdown wasn’t temporary turbulence but a deliberate transformation. Key Fed officials positioned themselves for roles in the new Democratic administration, then institutionalized the Fed’s partisan orientation through an unprecedented revolving door.\n\nJanet Yellen, who had publicly attacked Trump’s economic competence as former Fed chair, became Biden’s Treasury Secretary in 2021. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor since 2014, left the Fed in 2023 to become Biden’s National Economic Council Director, coordinating economic policy across the administration.\n\nThis created an unprecedented situation where recent Fed officials simultaneously implemented fiscal and regulatory policy as Biden administration officials while maintaining close relationships with current Fed officials setting monetary policy. Although there had always been some back-and-forth between the White House and the Fed, the scale of this in the Biden administration and the fact that it included such vocal critics of the rival party’s leader was new and shocking. The conventional separation between fiscal and monetary policy—a key element of Fed independence—dissolved when former Fed officials became the Biden administration’s top economic policymakers.\n\nThe revolving door institutionalized what Dudley had proposed in 2019. Instead of the Fed directly opposing Trump electorally, Fed officials positioned themselves to become part of a Democratic administration, then worked in apparent coordination with their former colleagues still at the Fed. The optics alone shattered the convention of Fed independence from partisan politics, regardless of whether explicit coordination occurred.\n\nThe implications extended beyond rhetoric. The timing of Fed actions around elections created appearances of political calculation. The Fed began aggressive rate cuts in the lead-up to the 2024 election, then abruptly paused cuts after Trump’s victory despite previously signaling continued easing. Their plea that the timing of this was coincidental strained credibility beyond the breaking point. Fed officials’ continued public criticism of tariff policies—while economically defensible—occurred against a backdrop where conventional neutrality had already been compromised. Powell explicitly stated that the Fed went on hold when it “saw the size of the tariffs” Trump imposed, since “all inflation forecasts for the U.S. went up materially” as a result.\n\nNone of these individual actions definitively proves electoral motivation. But conventions aren’t just about formal institutional actions—they’re about maintaining shared understandings that reassure all parties the rules remain stable. Once Fed officials signaled that electoral considerations were legitimate factors in monetary policy, once they made it clear that they were opposed to a Trump presidency, subsequent Fed decisions inevitably carried political implications regardless of officials’ stated motivations.\n\nAfter the Fire: The Ruins of Fed Independence\n\nThe long peace between the Fed and the White House has probably been decisively shattered. This is not necessarily a criticism of America’s approach to central bank independence. After all, the peace lasted for more than a century. The U.S. system, dependent on political norms, was very resilient.\n\nBut even the most resilient systems can breakdown under extreme pressure. The conventional protection that once seemed robust now appears fragile and probably broken. Once former Fed officials began signaling—or explicitly stating—that electoral considerations are appropriate factors in monetary policy, they undermined the very conventions that protected their independence. President Trump, facing a Fed that has abandoned political neutrality, no doubt felt less constrained by the conventional rules that once preserved the institution’s autonomy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s conventional independence was built on a foundation of mutual restraint. Now that the foundation has cracked, it will be difficult to uphold without fundamental structural changes—or a return to the political discipline that made the original convention sustainable.\n\nThe tragedy is that in attempting to resist one president’s pressure, Fed officials may have permanently weakened the institutional protections that shield monetary policy from political interference. They broke the convention that protected them.","summary":"This week saw a series of unprecedented events that may signal the end of the form of central bank independence as we have known it for more than a century.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: How the Fed Destroyed Its Own Independence appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/08/29/breitbart-business-digest-how-the-fed-destroyed-its-own-independence/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/08/lisa-cook-jerome-powell-getty-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:40:17","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":355680764,"title":"Appeals court rules most of Trump's appeals are illegal","text":"Aug. 29 (UPI) -- An 11-member appeals court on Friday struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign goods, declaring they are illegal.\n\nThe court held off mandating its decision because of a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump, in a post on Truth Social, declared: \"The United States of America will win in the end.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Trump does not have the power to invoke the expansive tariffs on most U.S. trade partners, including a baseline 10% and much higher for nations the president called the \"worst offenders.\"\n\nThe 127-page opinion vacated the lower court's injunction, blocking the tariffs altogether and directing the court to re-evaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.

Since taking office, President Donald J. Trump has declared several national emergencies.\"\n\nThey said Trump has departed from the \"established tariff schedules and imposed varying tariffs of unlimited duration on imports of nearly all goods from nearly every country with which the United States conducts trade.\"\n\nIn a separate opinion, the judges paused the ruling from taking effect through Oct. 19 to allow the Trump administration the opportunity to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump declared April 2 as \"Liberation Day\" during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event in the Rose Garden of the White House. The highest tariffs of 50% were placed on sparsely populated Lesotho, France's Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands. Other countries facing some of the highest tariffs were Cambodia (49%), Laos (48%), Madagascar (47%), Vietnam (46%), and Myanmar (44%).\n\nOne week later with U.S. stocks and the bond market reeling, Trump instituted a 90-day pause on all reciprocal tariffs except on China. The 10% baseline that went into effect remained.\n\nNations then negotiated trade deals, including 15% reciprocal tariffs on European Union nations. Britain, which is not part of the EU, has a 10% tariff on most goods.\n\nA 50% on goods from India took effect on Wednesday.\n\nOn July 9, Trump imposed a total 50% tariff in Brazil because of what he called the \"disgrace\" of how former President Jair Bolsonaro has been treated and an \"unfair trade relationship.\"\n\nTariffs are 15% on Japan and South Korea, with 20% on Vietnam, 19% on Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.\n\nRegarding China, a pause was extended on Aug. 11 for 90 days.

Yet many arrivals seem angrier at their newfound liberal hosts than at the dictatorships they fled back home.\n\nEurope’s immigration policies will not work in a multi-ethnic democracy.\n\nToo many immigrants are arriving too quickly, without sufficient diversity, language fluency, skills or familiarity with the customs and culture of their host nations. They often enter with separatist religious and cultural values antithetical to the very place they seek refuge.\n\nYet there is no European plan of civic education to assimilate immigrants and teach them the rules, laws and culture of their hosts.\n\nIt is then no surprise that what follows is ghettoization, resentment and loud attacks on the very nation in which they seek sanctuary, denouncing it as decadent and godless.\n\nIn the past, Europe’s anemic military budgets, reliance on borrowed money, socialism and a once-strong economy papered over these existential challenges of illegal immigration.\n\nOr, as left-wing former German Chancellor Angela Merkel once inanely said of massive illegal influxes into Europe, “Wir schaffen das” (“We can do this”).\n\nBut, of course, Merkel could not.\n\nShe offered zero plans on how to integrate, assimilate and acculturate millions of Europe’s illegal aliens. Now, some 15% of Germany’s population are foreign nationals.\n\nUnfortunately, the statist economies of high-cost Europe are stagnating.\n\nMassive welfare outlays, coupled with a shrinking and aging native population — with a birth rate sinking below 1.4 — are finally slowing economic growth.\n\nCurrent German Chancellor Friedrich Merz put the dilemma bluntly: “The welfare state as we have it today can no longer be financed with what we can economically afford.”\n\nYet the more socialism ossifies, the more popular culture still demands free benefits that a shrinking number of taxpayers can no longer provide.\n\nThe United States is finally taking the opposite approach of cracking down on illegal immigration, deregulating the economy and unleashing high technology to fast-track new frontiers of artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency and genetic engineering.\n\nOften, Europe’s best and brightest — and frustrated — are migrating to greater opportunities and freedom in the United States, further hampering European research and development.\n\nEurope foolishly adopted a self-defeating energy policy to achieve net-zero emissions by subsidizing inefficient wind and solar power while ignoring or shutting down far cheaper natural gas, nuclear and coal-powered electrical generation.\n\nMeanwhile, China, grinning like a Cheshire cat and caring little about its carbon footprint, is eagerly exporting wind and solar systems to the suicidal West.\n\nYet China itself is busy building about two massive coal-fired plants a month, and the largest and most environmentally disruptive hydroelectric projects in the world.\n\nNo wonder average European electricity costs are even steeper than those in failing California. European consumers often cannot afford to turn their heaters and air conditioners on, while businesses cannot compete with industries abroad that enjoy far cheaper power.\n\nTrump has declared that the 80-year postwar order is calcified and that the United States will no longer run huge trading deficits with European Union nations.\n\nInstead, it will demand symmetrical tariffs, further challenging past European mercantile profitability.\n\nThe days of Europe disarming and relying on the United States for defense are also over, given that Russian leader Vladimir Putin, for the third time in 15 years, invaded a neighboring country.\n\nYet Ukraine is not Chechnya or Georgia, but instead on the doorstep of Europe.\n\nSo in panic, a perennially delinquent NATO is not only promising to spend the required 2% of GDP on defense but also increasing arms budgets to 5% of GDP, a higher rate even than that of the United States.\n\nNo one knows how Europeans will afford such massive rearmament.\n\nTo do so would require opening up their economies, adopting far more flexible and traditional energy policies, securing their borders, ending illegal immigration, pruning the welfare state, increasing their fertility rates and dropping the DEI salad bowl while re-embracing the melting pot of integration and acculturation.\n\nWe will soon see whether Europeans can adopt such needed reforms, or find the necessary medicine worse than their current crippling continental disease.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.","summary":"Europe's open borders and leftward tilt has become unsustainable, sparking crime, budget crises and defense challenges.

Republican-led Texas took up the task first but was quickly countered by Democratic-led California, where Governor Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.\nKehoe scheduled Missouri’s special session to begin on September 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic conmgressman Emanuel Cleaver’s Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.\nHis agenda also includes another Republican priority – a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion-rights and marijuana legalisation amendments adopted in recent years.\n\nKehoe cast both items as a defence against liberal politicians and activists.\n“Missouri’s conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,” he said in a statement.\nDemocrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a “Trump puppet” attempting to “steal a congressional seat for Republicans” and gut the ballot initiative process.\nIt “marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861”, Aune said in a statement.\nMissouri is represented in the US House by six Republicans and two Democrats Cleaver and congressman Wesley Bell in St Louis.\nCleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Trump.\n“This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,” Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.\nMissouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democrats left the state for two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats’ absence would not prevent a quorum for business.\nAnd although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural manoeuvres to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.\n\nRepublicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024, an outcome that aligned almost perfectly with the share of the vote won by the two parties in districts across the US, according to a recent Associated Press analysis.\nAlthough the overall outcome was close to neutral, AP’s analysis shows that Democrats and Republicans each benefited from advantages in particular states stemming from the way districts were drawn.\nDemocrats would need to net three seats in next year’s election to take control of the chamber. The incumbent president’s party tends to lose seats in the midterm elections, as was the case for Trump in 2018, when Democrats won control of the House and subsequently launched investigations of Trump.\nSeeking to avoid a similar situation in his second term, Trump has urged Republican-led states to fortify their congressional seats.\nIn Texas, Republicans already hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats.\n“Texas is now more red in the United States Congress,” Abbott said in a video he posted on social media of him signing the legislation.\nNewsom, who has emerged as a leading adversary of Trump on redistricting and other issues, tauntingly labelled Abbott on social media as the president’s “#1 lapdog” following the signing. Democrats already hold 43 of California’s 52 congressional seats.\nVoting rights groups filed a lawsuit this week ahead of Abbott’s signing of the bill, saying the new map weakens the electoral influence of Black voters. Texas Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new map in court.\n\nSome Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that could give them a 7-1 edge when redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the Republican legislative majority ultimately opted against it.\nSome feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.\nRepublican officials in Florida, Indiana and elsewhere also are considering revising their US House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.\nIn Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering.\nRepublicans have won all four of Utah’s congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.","summary":"American Republican Governor Mike Kehoe said on Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state’s US House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year’s congressional elections.\nKehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections.\nIt marked a win...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3323736/missouri-prepares-redraw-electoral-maps-trump-pushes-retain-us-house","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/30/6e7e5bba-1ba3-42a9-b637-6f2a18b2edcc_805fcecd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:32:34","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":355681684,"title":"Letters: State can lead the nation away from political trickery","text":"State can lead nation\nfrom political trickery\n\nIt is sad, but arguably necessary, that California is getting down in the muck of promoting gerrymandering for political gain.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of the upcoming special election, California does have the opportunity to take the high ground here. According to Pew Research, most Democratic and Republican voters are against gerrymandering.\n\nSome alternative approaches:\n\n• Senate Bill 3750, “Redistricting Reform Act of 2024,” addresses the issue through proposed law. Currently dead, but it could be revived.\n\n• Constitutional amendment by Congress, but that’s realistically a difficult path.\n\n• Constitutional amendment by state convention — an amendment to be introduced by a two-thirds vote of state legislatures. Mobilizing public opinion and support would be key to success.\n\nHowever difficult this task may be, California could provide leadership and advocacy.

Lose it once, and it’s gone forever.\n\nMichael Steinberg\n\nProp. 50 is only route\nto fair midterms\n\nI am intrigued by the opposition to Gov. Newsom’s move to redraw districts in California. I am wholeheartedly in favor of the nonpartisan commission under most circumstances, but these are “unprecedented” times. (I’m so sick of that word.) If California voters are willing to “obey in advance,” then we will indeed have a dictator given more and more power by a Congress that consists of a majority of flunkies.\n\nThe only possibility of a fair midterm election for House representatives is if this ballot measure is passed and implemented. The money behind those ads and pamphlets against this measure is totally provided by wealthy Republicans, and the message is being spread by groups who can’t admit the situation we are in right now.\n\nFace it, voters — this is not the America we thought we lived in. Extreme measures are needed to try to right the ship.\n\nMarian Bruns\n\nRedistricting is our\nonly weapon in fight\n\nSo, if I have this straight, according to some writers, Donald Trump can lob a nuclear bomb into the 2026 election, and we’re supposed to just hide under our desks and pretend that nothing has changed — nothing to see here?\n\nThe folks espousing this stance are either totally clueless as to Trump’s sinister march toward dictatorship, don’t care or have signed on to the lunacy of Laura Loomer and other MAGA compatriots.\n\nCalifornia didn’t start this democracy-hating process; Trump did. We cannot afford to lay down our only weapon — Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan. We cannot afford to stomp around in a state of high dudgeon while Trump and his comrades crush our democracy. We must vote for the redistricting plan and take back the House. Then, if we survive as a country, we can fix it later.\n\nRosie Sorenson\n\nScience, humanity offer\nways to live with wolves\n\nRe: “We can coexist with predators. Why kill them?” (Page A8, Aug. 3).\n\nPeter Kareiva, former director of UCLA’s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, wrote an enlightening article for us to learn about living with wolves successfully.\n\nWhen we’re not driven by fear, we realize we need wolves for the valuable “ecosystem services” they provide. In Yellowstone Park, we learned that lesson: In the 1900s, wolves were killed off to a population of zero. With the top predator gone, major disruptions for other wildlife, plants and the health of the ecosystem developed. Wolves were then successfully reintroduced in Yellowstone, starting in 1995, through a wolf recovery program.\n\nWe don’t have to repeat the costly and inhumane mistakes of the past. Managing wolf populations with scientifically based and humane methods requires cooperation between all parties and wise investment of public funds. We know how to do that through solutions that protect both ranchers and wolves.\n\nDeborah Livingstone\n\nRecycling can keep\nplanet safe, healthy\n\nMy name is Maxwell, and I’m a 9th-grader at Hayward Twin Oaks Montessori School. I’m writing to you about recycling, which is an important issue because recycling is good for the environment. A lot of people waste materials such as bottles, cans, glass and cardboard. Instead of throwing these things out, we can use recycling bins. When we recycle, these types of materials can be reused.\n\nThe problem is that Earth has limited resources. When we reuse materials, we are saving the planet. One thing we can do is make sure that schools have recycling bins. We can also make sure students collect and reuse cans, bottles and cardboard for projects.\n\nThanks for your time.

That act gives the president the power to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during national emergencies.\n\n\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"\n\nLawsuits challenge Trump's tariff policies\n\nThe 1977 law had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets. Mr Trump, the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, said the measures were justified given trade imbalances, declining US manufacturing power and the cross-border flow of drugs.\n\nMr Trump's Department of Justice has argued that the law allows tariffs under emergency provisions that authorise a president to \"regulate\" imports or block them completely.\n\nMr Trump declared a national emergency in April over the fact that the US imports more than it exports, as the nation has done for decades. Mr Trump said the persistent trade deficit was undermining US manufacturing capability and military readiness.\n\nHe said the February tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico were appropriate because those countries were not doing enough to stop illegal fentanyl from crossing US borders, an assertion those countries have denied.\n\nThere was little reaction to the ruling in after-hours stock trading.\n\n\"Companies will probably continue to operate as though the tariffs will stay in effect since the court is letting the levies stay in place for now,\" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. He said the Trump administration will probably resort to other powers to impose temporary tariffs.\n\nThe Appeals Court ruled on two cases, one brought by five small US businesses and the other by 12 Democratic-led US states, which argued that IEEPA does not authorise tariffs.\n\nThe Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs, and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited, according to the lawsuits.\n\nThe New York-based US Court of International Trade ruled against Mr Trump's tariff policies on May 28, saying the president had exceeded his authority when he imposed both sets of challenged tariffs. The three-judge panel included a judge who was appointed by Mr Trump in his first term.\n\nAnother court in Washington ruled that IEEPA does not authorise Mr Trump's tariffs, and the government has appealed that decision as well.\n\nAt least eight lawsuits have challenged Mr Trump's tariff policies, including one filed by the state of California.","summary":"But the US president says the ruling is \"incorrect\", and is indicating taking the case to the Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/trump-tariffs-illegal/105715692","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/055f54c88827edc684b504a33ce62d6d?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=576&cropW=1024&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:23:01","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":355682878,"title":"Court sharply criticizes Trump regarding tariffs","text":"A federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Trump wasn´t legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country on earth, largely upholding a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York.\n\nBut the court’s 7-4 decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump slammed the ruling but made it clear that his economic plans were still full speed ahead in a post to Truth Social. \n\n‘ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!

Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean ‘financial ruin’ for the United States.\n\nThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nOne are the sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 – aka Trump’s ‘Liberation Day,’ – when he imposed ‘reciprocal’ tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a ‘baseline’ 10% tariff on just about everyone else. \n\nThe national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. \n\nThe president started to levy modified the tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a surplus also face the taxes.\n\nIt also affects the ‘trafficking tariffs’ he announced Feb. 1 on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. \n\nThese were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over decades, lawmakers have ceded authorities to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\n\nBut Trump´s assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges – at least seven cases. \n\nNo president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on U.S. adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\nThey also note that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an ‘unusual and extraordinary’ threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. \n\nThe United States, after all, has run trade deficits – in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them – for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon´s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. \n\nThe Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.\n\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump´s Liberation Day tariffs ‘exceed any authority granted to the President’ under the emergency powers law. \n\nIn reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges – one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states – into a single case.\n\nIn the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA´s requirement that they ‘deal with’ the problem they were supposed to address.\n\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\n\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term – and President Joe Biden kept – after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\n\nTrump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to tax imports from countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits at 15% for 150 days.\n\nLikewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump had no&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court sharply criticizes Trump regarding tariffs first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/court-sharply-criticizes-trump-regarding-tariffs/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Court-delivers-stinging-rebuke-to-Trump-over-tariffs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 23:17:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.291},{"id":355684472,"title":"Lawyer: Oregon firefighter arrested by Border Patrol during wildfire was on track for legal status","text":"By MARTHA BELLISLE\n\nSEATTLE (AP) — Lawyers are demanding the release of a longtime Oregon resident arrested by Border Patrol while fighting a Washington state wildfire, saying Friday that the firefighter was already on track for legal status after helping federal investigators solve a crime against his family.\n\nHis arrest was illegal, the lawyers said, and violated Department of Homeland Security polices that say immigration enforcement must not be conducted at locations where emergency responses are happening.\n\nHe is one of two firefighters arrested this week while working the Bear Gulch Fire in the Olympic National Forest, which as of Friday had burned about 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) and was only 13% contained, forcing evacuations.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement Thursday that it had been helping the Bureau of Land Management with a criminal investigation into two contractors working at the fire when it discovered two firefighters who they said were in the country without permanent legal status.\n\nThe firefighter, whose name has not been made public, has lived in the U.S. for 19 years after arriving with his family at age 4.

In the 7-4 ruling handed down Friday, the majority upheld the CIT's decision that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) did not authorize a president to impose tariffs.\n\n\"We agree that IEEPA's grant of presidential authority to 'regulate' imports does not authorize the tariffs imposed by the Executive Orders,\" wrote court ruled. The majority opinion says that Trump's tariffs would \"assert an expansive authority\" that is \"beyond the authority delegated to the President by IEEPA.\"\n\nFriday's ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The decision today is a powerful reaffirmation of our nation's core constitutional commitments from our nation's Founders, especially the principle that Presidents must act within the rule of law,\" Neal Katyal, an attorney with the Liberty Justice Center, which represented some of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement.\n\nTrump administration used IEEPA in February to slap tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico. The Trump administration again invoked IEEPA to impose its so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in early April, which included a universal 10 percent tariff on all imports and higher, country-specific tariffs, some of which went into effect in August after being delayed several times.\n\nAs seemed evident during oral arguments, the court's majority was deeply skeptical of the government's claim to broad powers that are not spelled out in the IEEPA law, which notably does not contain the word \"tariff.\"\n\nIf the government's interpretation of the IEEPA statute is correct, the court ruled, that would create \"a functionally limitless delegation of Congressional taxation authority.\" Elsewhere in the ruling, the court said that such a delegation of taxation power would be unconstitutional, even if that were what Congress intended to do.\n\nIn short, the Trump administration's argument for using emergency powers to impose tariffs fails on multiple fronts.\n\nHowever, the appeals court struck down an important aspect of the CIT's earlier decision: its permanent, universal injunction that blocked the tariffs from being collected.\n\nThat injunction was in place for mere hours in May before it was paused by the appeals court, pending the outcome of its review of the underlying case. In Friday's decision, the appeals court vacated that part of the CIT's ruling and ordered the lower court to review that portion of the case in more detail.\n\nThat leaves the tariffs in a chaotic state of limbo. Three courts have now ruled that they were unlawfully imposed, and yet they will remain in place (at least for now).\n\nThat's an outcome that seems to create even more uncertainty for American businesses that are bearing the brunt of the tariffs. Rather than providing relief in the form of a new or renewed injuction, the appeals court has effectively said that Trump is illegally taxing nearly all imports into the country and that Americans will have to continue paying those taxes while the rest of the legal process plays out.\n\nRather than wait for that to happen, Congress should now get involved. It's clear that Trump's tariffs do not have the legal standing to survive in the long term, and lawmakers could save everyone a lot of pain by cancelling the economic emergency that underpins the tariffs.","summary":"Trump went \"beyond the authority delegated to the President,\" the court ruled, but it vacated an injunction that could have provided immediate tariff relief to American

tapping emergency economic powers to impose wide-ranging duties.But the judges allowed the tariffs to stay in place through mid-October -- and Trump swiftly made clear he would put the time to use.The

wide-ranging economic policy tool.It could also cast doubt over deals Trump has struck with major trading partners such as the European Union, and raised the question of what would happen to the billions of dollars collected by the United States since the tariffs were put in place if the conservative-majority Supreme Court does not back him.Friday's case, however, does not deal with sector-specific tariffs that the Trump administration has also imposed on steel, aluminum, autos and other imports.- 'Diplomatic embarrassment'- Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on almost all US trading partners, with a 10-percent baseline level and higher rates for dozens of economies.He has invoked similar authorities to slap separate tariffs hitting Mexico, Canada and China over the flow of deadly drugs into the United States.The Court of International Trade had ruled in May that Trump overstepped his authority with across-the-board global levies, blocking most of the duties from taking effect, but the appeals court later put the ruling on hold to consider the case.Friday's ruling noted that \"the statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.\"It added that it was not addressing if Trump's actions should have been taken as a matter of policy or deciding whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all.Instead, it sought to resolve the question of whether Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs and those imposed over trafficking were authorized, with the document noting: \"We conclude they are not.\"In a supplementary filing just hours before the appeals court released its decision, Trump cabinet officials argued that ruling the global tariffs illegal and blocking them would hurt US foreign policy and national security.\"Such a ruling would threaten broader US strategic interests at home and abroad, likely lead to retaliation and the unwinding of agreed-upon deals by foreign-trading partners,\" wrote Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.Lutnick added that they could also \"derail critical ongoing negotiations\" with partners.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, warned that suspending the effectiveness of tariffs \"would lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment.\"Several legal challenges have been filed against the tariffs Trump invoked citing emergencies.If these tariffs are ultimately ruled illegal, companies could possibly seek reimbursements.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is

Faced with a cash crunch, the company said last week it borrowed the entire $275 million available under its revolving credit facility.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nSpirit's Chapter 11 filing was widely expected after it issued a warning earlier this month that it might not continue to operate if its financial results failed to improve rapidly.\n\n\"Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,\" said CEO Dave Davis.\n\nThe company made the Chapter 11 filing in bankruptcy court in the Southern District of New York. Spirit said it was working productively with its secured noteholders, including with respect to potential financing that may become necessary later in the proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nIndustry analysts and executives say Spirit's troubles stemmed from its failure to fix its bloated cost structure in the first bankruptcy.

The Department of the Interior said the move was necessary to address national security concerns, without providing further details.\n\nIn early August, the Interior Department also cancelled a major wind farm in Idaho, which had been approved in the final days of Biden’s presidency.\n\nMultiple federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy and Commerce, said they are reviewing offshore wind farms approved by the Biden administration along the Atlantic coast.\n\nTrump has regularly lashed out at green energy, and particularly wind power, calling it an ugly and expensive form of energy that “smart” countries do not use.\n\nYet, foreign allies and rivals alike have increasingly embraced renewable energy in an effort to slow the ravages of climate change. China, for instance, has invested heavily in solar and wind energy and has become a leading source for wind turbine parts.\n\nCritics have said Trump’s approach will set the US back behind its competitors.\n\nLast week, as US electricity prices rose at more than twice the rate of inflation, Trump falsely blamed renewable power for the skyrocketing prices, calling the industry a “scam”.\n\nOn Tuesday, he pledged not to move forward with any wind power projects.\n\n“We’re not allowing any windmills to go up unless there’s a legal situation where somebody committed to it a long time ago,” Trump said at a cabinet meeting.","summary":"The cancellation is Trump&#039;s latest move against renewable energy, which the US president has dismissed a

The Associated Press reported that as of July, total year-over-year tariff revenue exceeded $159 billion. Trump imposed the tariffs by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, which allows a president to assume certain new powers under an economic emergency. But during oral arguments, one of the judges hearing the case pointed out that the IEEPA statute doesn't even mention tariffs.\n\nMoreover, Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution stipulates that only Congress has the power to levy tariffs, stating that the legislative branch \"shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\"\n\nShortly after the decision was announced, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to blast the judges (who he deemed \"Highly Partisan\" in his signature style of oddly-placed capital letters) that struck down his tariffs.

Vacancies in Ohio and North Carolina were previously expected to give Democrats an opening to whittle down that majority to almost nothing.\n\nCBS News first reported on Friday that Ernst had informed confidantes of her decision not to run. An official announcement is reportedly coming in the week ahead. The Independent reached out to her office for comment and the report was separately confirmed by CNN. Ernst and her team haven’t yet commented publicly.\n\nHer departure would shake up the Senate map and give Democrats a clear path to a 50-50 Senate, where JD Vance would be needed to break ties and singular Republican defections would tank any movement in the chamber. There’s even a slim but growing possibility of Democrats obtaining an outright majority: besides seats in Ohio and North Carolina, which are vacant and already targeted by well-funded and deeply connected Democratic candidates, the party is eyeing races in Maine, where Susan Collins is facing re-election, as well as in Texas.\n\nIn the Lone Star State, a Republican primary gives Democrats a potential opening. John Cornyn is up for re-election but currently trailing his far-right GOP challenger, Ken Paxton, in the Republican primary field. Cornyn himself has warned that Paxton’s victory could give Democrats a chance to snatch the seat.\n\nMaine is a different story. Susan Collins consistently registers shaky approval ratings in her purple state home, but has a proven track record of winning tough re-election fights and beating Democrats with deep pockets, most recently Sarah Gideon in 2020. A surging grassroots campaign is forming behind Graham Platner, a Marine and Army veteran, while national Democrats are reportedly hoping that the state’s 77-year-old Governor Janet Mills will enter the race instead.\n\nThe loss of an incumbent in Iowa puts the potential outcome of a Democratic Senate for the remainder of Donald Trump’s presidency on the table, though still unlikely. Ernst was already facing several announced Democratic challengers, the leading candidate in fundraising is Nathan Sage, while several other Democrats led him in a straw poll conducted at the Iowa State Fair earlier this month. Any Republican candidate that emerges as the leader to hold the seat for the GOP in 2026 will still likely require a leg up from the national party.\n\nErnst’s own re-election prospects were clearly damaged earlier this year when she was recorded on video at a town hall event telling a voter “we all are going to die...for heaven’s sakes” in response to the voter’s concern about cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits. \n\nRepublican members of Congress, including Ernst, have struggled to sell Trump’s budget reconciliation package — the “big, beautiful bill” — on the campaign trail as a result of voter concerns about new eligibility requirements threatening to throw millions off of both programs.\n\nPolitico reported in July that she was considering retirement, citing her unenergetic fundraising pace. At the time, the outlet reported that Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican representing Iowa’s 2nd district, was highly likely to run for Ernst’s seat if the senator stepped down. She hadn’t issued a comment as of mid-afternoon on Friday.\n\nOther members of the already-crowded Democratic field asserted that Ernst’s reported decision was a result of polling showing the race winnable for Democrats.\n\n“[Joni] Ernst is bowing out of this race, because she knows what we’ve known for a long time — Iowa is WINNABLE!” tweeted the Sage campaign.\n\nThe senator “saw the writing on the wall,” added state Sen. Zach Walls, another Democrat running for the seat. “Iowans are fed up with rising costs and unchecked corruption. And next year, we're going to flip this seat.”\n\nRepublicans just lost their supermajority in the Iowa state senate, following an upset victory by a Democrat earlier this week. And the likelihood that Trump himself has run his last race means that the GOP will no longer have his magnetic presence at the top of the ticket going forward.\n\nTaking control of one or both chambers of Congress next year would allow Democrats to effectively halt Trump’s legislative agenda for the remainder of his term. It would also allow Democrats to wield the power of Congress’ committees and even potentially launch a third push at impeaching the president. By controlling the Senate, Democrats could also prevent the appointment of another conservative Supreme Court justice were a vacancy to occur.\n\nRetaking the upper chamber would also give Democrats momentum heading into 2028, when the party hopes to retake control of the White House. \n\nIn the majority of states the Democrats would need to win next year, that remains an uphill battle. Democrats haven’t won statewide in Iowa since 2008; in Ohio, the party lost Senate races in 2024 and 2022. In Maine, Collins remains the heavy favorite. Texas’ odds hinge on the defeat of Cornyn in a Republican primary and even then Paxton would have the advantage.\n\nNorth Carolina remains the party’s best chance for a pickup. The retirement of Thom Tillis after his vote against his own party’s budget reconciliation bill, legislation supported by the president, eliminates the GOP incumbency advantage in one of America’s most purple states. Democrats are consolidating behind Governor Roy Cooper, the first challenger to defeat a sitting governor in state history, who himself remains popular after two terms.\n\nThe party’s main hope for a 50-50 scenario or an outright majority remains in hoping for a “blue wave” year, propelled by frustrations against the president and a compliant GOP Congress. \n\nIn a new poll this week from Quinnipiac University, Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest point yet for his second term, while the survey also showed Democrats chipping away at his support even among Republican voters. The survey indicated clear issues of concern where Trump remains underwater, uch as his federalized takeover of Washington D.C., and so that remains a clear possibility should Trump continue to be frustrated in his efforts to resolve the nagging concerns of his base.\n\nBut that outcome could also hinge on Democratic leadership in Congress finding its way out of its own swamp of discontent — or stepping aside to let more popular figures in the party take the reins.\n\nThe same Quinnipiac poll in July found Democrats in Congress with their lowest approval rating on record, which is now approaching single digits. Only 19 percent of voters said they supported the job congressional Democrats were doing at the time.","summary":"Democrats may have a clear path to winning a 50-50 Senate and could even win a majority -- if a wave of momentum is on their side, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ernst-senate-democrats-2026-midterms-b2816856.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/29/21/13/GettyImages-2227553595.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/l8Xi3wnY-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-29 22:54:28","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":355676410,"title":"Macron Warns Trump Is Being Played By Putin; White House Defends President’s Peace Role","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron has once again warned European leaders on Friday against placing their trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid growing uncertainty over peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Speaking with visible disappointment over the current state of the conflict, Macron also emphasised the need for firm security guarantees, calling them the only viable path toward a just and lasting peace in the region, stated AFP.\nMacron, who recently participated in a diplomatic visit to the White House alongside a European delegation on August 18, revealed that there had been strong belief among Western leaders that Putin would agree to a bilateral or even trilateral meeting to discuss ending the ongoing war. The proposed talks were expected to involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and potentially US President Donald Trump.\nAccording to Macron, Putin had personally assured Trump that such a meeting would be held within two weeks. However, as the timeline nears its expiration, no official confirmation has been provided by the Kremlin. “If that doesn’t happen by Monday, the deadline set by President Trump, it means that once again President Putin played President Trump,” Macron said.\nMacron made these comments during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Toulon, a southern French city hosting ministerial talks this week. The French President also indicated that both he and Merz may consult with Trump over the weekend to assess the situation and discuss potential next steps.\nWhite House Reacts On Macron’s Comments\nMacron’s remarks sparked a flurry of reactions, including from the White House. During a press briefing, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, was asked whether Macron’s claims were accurate. In response, Miller sidestepped the specifics of the question but expressed strong support for President Trump’s foreign policy record.\n“Such an absurd question. President Trump has achieved seven peace deals in seven months. No president in history has done more to advance the cause of peace. He’s been nominated by multiple world leaders for the Nobel Peace Prize,” Miller said.\nWhat Happens If There Is No Russia-Ukraine Meeting By Monday\nZelenskyy, recalling his White House meeting with Trump and other European leaders, also referenced the looming deadline. He acknowledged that Putin had allegedly committed to holding talks within two weeks. “Two weeks will be on Monday. And we will remind everybody,” the Ukrainian president stated, reinforcing expectations for progress.\nWhile there is public pressure mounting as the deadline approaches, the Russian side has remained ambiguous. On Friday, Russian officials stated that President Putin is still open to discussions. However, they also noted that no formal or high-level preparations for a meeting with Zelenskyy are currently underway.\nDespite Trump’s confirmation on Truth Social soon after the White House meeting that preparations for the peace talks were in motion, the lack of concrete steps has raised questions about Putin’s true intentions.

The decision is expected to have vast implications for Trump's international economic policy tool, which has been a cornerstone of his administration's approach to global trade.The US court's ruling centred on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which granted the president authority to address unusual and extraordinary threats during national emergencies. During the hearing, it reportedly came to the fore that Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices or threatening US economic interests. However, the court found that the statute does not explicitly grant the president the power to impose tariffs, duties, or taxes.The US judges' decision was unequivocal, noting, \"The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.\" The court's ruling has shed light on the limits of executive power and the need for clear legislative authorisation for such actions.Trump's tariffs have been a focused component of his trade policy, which is aimed at renegotiating trade deals and exerting pressure on trading partners. The levies have given the administration leverage to extract economic concessions, but they have also increased volatility in financial markets. Amidst Donald Trump's attempts to push a trade war across the globe, the court's decision has cast a shadow over the legitimacy of these tariffs, undermining their effectiveness.Donald Trump was quick to respond, deeming the US Appeals Court’s ruling as “incorrect” and affirming that the tariffs were still in effect. In a post on Social Truth, Trump said, “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today, a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong. The U.S.A. will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else. If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America. At the start of this Labor Day weekend, we should all remember that TARIFFS are the best tool to help our Workers and support Companies that produce great MADE IN AMERICA products. For many years, Tariffs were allowed to be used against us by our uncaring and unwise Politicians. Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”The court's ruling is a massive setback for US President Trump's executive authority, as it challenges his ability to unilaterally impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Constitution granted Congress the authority to impose taxes and tariffs, and any delegation of that authority must be both explicit and limited. The court doubted Trump's use of IEEPA to justify tariffs, which have consistently ruled that the president's authority is not unlimited.After the US Appeals Court ruling, the case is likely to be appealed to the US Supreme Court, which will eventually decide the fate of Trump's tariff policies. The court's decision will have a massive impact on the future of international trade and the limits of executive power. Further details regarding the latest development on Trump's tariffs are awaited.","summary":"US appeals court rules most of Trump&#39;s tariffs illegal, exceeding presidential authority and challenging the legitimacy of his trade war policies.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-appeals-court-deals-massive-jolt-to-trumps-tariff-tango-rules-most-levies-imposed-are-illegal","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/us-appeals-court-deals-massive-jolt-to-trumps-tariff-tango-rules-most-of-levies-imposed-are-illegal-1756507519265-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-29 22:45:25","author":"Abhishek Tiwari","authors":["Abhishek Tiwari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.193}]}
