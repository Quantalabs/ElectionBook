The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"Bannon, host of the influential War Room podcast and former White House strategist, then made a similar gesture during a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February and saying, \"fight, fight, fight.\"Supporters of Musk and Bannon have also claimed that the pair have made a \"Roman salute,\" which was depicted in 18th and 19th-century art, but there is no historical evidence from ancient Rome that it was a common practice.What To KnowBooker spoke at a Democratic convention in California on Saturday, ending his speech with a gesture where he put his hand over his heart, then extended his hand out to the crowd – much in the way Musk and Bannon did, though not as forcefully as Musk did it.The video was first posted by Richie Greenberg, a San Francisco-based political commentator and former GOP mayoral candidate for the city, and quickly spread among MAGA-social media.Greenberg posted the video with the caption: \"Moments ago, Cory Booker salutes 4,000 CA Democrat Party delegates.\"Collin Rugg, co-owner of conservative news site Trending Politics, reposted the video, adding that he is \"looking forward to the wall to wall coverage from the \"honest\" and totally not biased media.\"Social media influencer Gunther Eagleman wrote that Booker was a \"straight up NAZI,\" adding \"WOW\" and \"HOLY S***!\"Right-wing journalist Nick Sortor similarly piled in with the video, writing that Booker made a \"Nazi salute\" and calling him \"literally Hitler\" for doing so.Booker has garnered much attention since his record-setting speech, remaining on the Senate floor and continuing to speak for 25 hours and five minutes, surpassing the previous record held by Senator Strom Thurmond in 1957.Booker used his time to protest Trump and Republican policies, invoking the late Representative John Lewis of Georgia and the need for \"good trouble\" in times of crisis.The speech earned Booker some goodwill, which was reflected in a recent poll released by AtlasIntel, which found him the fourth-leading candidate among Democratic voters for a potential 2028 presidential nominee, ranking just behind Pete Buttigieg, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Kamala Harris.","summary":"Senator Cory Booker made the gesture at the end of a speech he gave during a Democratic convention in California on Saturday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/maga-accuses-democratic-senator-cory-booker-doing-nazi-salute-2079436","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2654667/senator-cory-booker-new-jersey.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 01:29:56","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":326894952,"title":"Gov.

Read On","text":"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has once again landed squarely in the middle of a political mess—and this time, it involves a supposed assassination plot, a possibly framed immigrant, and a rapidly crumbling narrative. Earlier this week, Noem claimed that an undocumented immigrant, Ramon Morales Reyes, threatened to assassinate President Donald Trump. But the story unravelled almost as soon as it hit the headlines. Handwriting analysts cast doubt on the authorship of the alleged letter, and reports now speculate that the whole thing may have been a setup. Perhaps to stop Reyes from testifying in an assault case where he was the victim. Yes, you read that right.\nThe latest fiasco just added fuel to the ever-growing bonfire of Noem’s political reputation. From memoir mayhem to tribal tensions, it has been increasingly hard to ignore what critics call a pattern of impulsive—and often baffling—behaviour.\nA dog, a gun, and a political firestorm\nLet’s rewind to that memoir: No Going Back. In it, Noem casually confessed to shooting her 14-month-old dog Cricket because the pup was ‘untrainable’, ‘mean’, and dared to attack chickens. Her solution? A gravel pit, a gun, and a one-way ticket for Cricket.\nAs per a report in The Independent, she tried to frame the incident as a tough parenting call. The public, however, was not buying it. Even some supporters called the move cruel and chilling—because nothing says ‘head of national security’ like executing your pet and calling it character-building.\nThe Curious Case of Kim Jong Un\nBut wait—there’s more! The same memoir featured a jaw-dropping (and erroneous) claim that Noem met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. She even boasted about staring down at him thanks to her experience with ‘little tyrants’ from her days as a children’s pastor. Bold flex.\nThe backlash was swift. The Independent report added that her team eventually admitted that the anecdote would be scrubbed from the book and it was!\nTribal Tensions & Cartel Conspiracies\nBack on home turf, Noem managed to offend nearly every Native American tribe in South Dakota. She accused Mexican cartels had infiltrating the tribal lands and accused tribal leaders of profiting off it.\nThe result? All nine tribes in the state banned her from their lands and called out her ‘self-serving’ comments. Noem, never the one to back down, insisted she was just ‘speaking the truth’. However, many saw it as yet another example of her shoot-first, apologise-never style of governance.\nImpulsive or just plain reckless?\nWhether it is executing pets, inventing international diplomacy or playing fast and loose with national security claims, Noem has shown her penchant for headline-grabbing chaos. To her loyalists, she is a maverick. To critics, she’s a cautionary tale.\nLest we forget, she’s in charge of the Homeland Security Department—a massive organisation with over 240,000 employees tackling everything from anti-terrorism efforts to disaster relief. It is a position that requires clarity, composure, and sound judgment. Unfortunately, those qualities don’t always seem to shine through in Noem’s track record.\nWith the Reyes situation falling apart and her decision-making facing yet another round of criticism, many Americans are left questioning: is being bold a replacement for real competence? Or is it time to consider whether just talking a big game is enough—especially when it comes to protecting lives and national security?","url":"https://www.news18.com/viral/is-kristi-noem-fit-to-lead-homeland-security-read-on-ws-l-aa-9361979.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-design-2025-05-31T183318.861-2025-05-c21cbbb1c946b74a34d6b692e5e728a1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 01:00:48","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":326893988,"title":"What does the future hold for the California Democratic Party?","text":"During the 2024 elections, Democrats lost not only the presidential race and control of the U.S. Senate, but here in California, the party also gave up three seats in the state legislature.\n\nSome viewed the losses as a moment of reckoning for the Democratic Party.\n\nDemocratic leaders, in recent interviews and while speaking to large crowds of activists and members of their party gathered in Anaheim this weekend, agree there ought to be some self-introspection — and that there is work to do to win over more voters.\n\nAt the same time, others who attended this year’s California Democratic Party Convention dismissed any notion that the future of the Democratic Party is bleak.\n\nReferencing this year’s convention theme of “California Strong,” California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks said the message the party hopes to convey is that “California Democrats are California Strong, that we are operating from a position of strength as the fourth-largest economy in the world.”\n\n“This party is fighting for Californians,” he continued. “We have an outsized obligation to do that work here in the state that has a huge impact on the nation.”\n\nShifts in voter registration\n\nNo doubt, California remains a solidly blue state overall, with Democrats retaining a 20-point voter registration advantage over Republicans as 2026 barrels closer.\n\nBut fewer Californians are registered as Democrats today than four years ago. Republicans, on the other hand, have picked up more voters.\n\nIn February 2021, shortly after Democrat Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, Democrats accounted for 46.2% of registered voters in California, according to the California secretary of state. As of this February, they represent 45.3% of registered voters.\n\nBy comparison, Republicans made up 24.1% of the state’s registered voters in February 2021. They’re now at 25.2%.\n\nSimilar trends have been observed locally. In Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, the number of registered Democrats during this same time period declined by 0.21% to 1.94% while the percentage of registered Republicans increased between 0.12% and 1.55%.\n\nHicks acknowledged that the state legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, has more work ahead to address affordability issues related to housing and the price of gas and food that are top of mind for many Californians.\n\nThat said, he shrugged off the fact that Republicans managed to flip three legislative seats during November’s election, noting that Democrats continue to enjoy a supermajority in Sacramento.\n\nDuring the 2024 general election, Republicans flipped two seats in the Assembly and one in the Senate. All three of those seats represent communities in Southern California, including an Orange County Senate seat now held by Republican state Sen. Steven Choi of Irvine.\n\nIn the Assembly, Republican Jeff Gonzalez now represents the 36th District, which includes parts of Imperial, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Similarly, Republican Leticia Castillo was elected to represent the 58th District, which takes in parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\n\nDespite those GOP gains, Democrats continue to claim 60 of the 80 Assembly seats and 30 of the 40 Senate seats.\n\n“California Republicans have run around and said, ‘Oh, we’re taking over California.’ Winning two seats and having 20 members in the … Assembly, I don’t think there’s anything to necessarily be proud of. You got a long way to go,” Hicks said.\n\nCorrin Rankin, chair of the California Republican Party, said in response that Republicans are just getting started.\n\n“Flipping three seats was just the beginning,” Rankin said in a statement. “The 2024 election made one thing clear: Voters are done with Democrat mismanagement. Californians are ready for change, and Republicans are ready to lead.”\n\nPrioritizing midterm elections\n\nGiven that the party already has a supermajority in the state legislature, Hicks indicated that the California Democratic Party’s priority and focus in 2026 will be the congressional midterm elections.\n\nHe also said that the party plans to engage with young voters by going to high school and college campuses.\n\nDemocrats are hoping to wrest back control of at least one of the houses in Congress to thwart Republicans’ attempts to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda, they said this weekend.\n\nRep. Dave Min, D-Irvine, said Democrats should focus on the economy in order to boost support for the party.\n\n“We need to think about how we talk about economics, with a real plan to help people who are struggling,” Min said in an interview.\n\nIn addition, Min, the son of Korean immigrants, said Democrats cannot abandon core values like diversity and inclusiveness.\n\nHe wasn’t so concerned that the number of registered Democrats in the state has declined while the GOP has gained members. He suspects that a year from now, the Republican Party will have lost members due to, he said, voter dissatisfaction with actions by the Trump administration, including cuts to Medicaid, mass deportations of immigrants and cuts at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n“These policies are all deeply unpopular, and I’m predicting right now that you’re going to see a stark turnaround,” Min said.\n\nOne of Min’s House colleagues, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of Los Angeles, urged Democrats to “stay in the fight” during a fiery speech on the convention floor Saturday.\n\nShe even offered a strategy, which drew cheers from the crowd.\n\n“Democrats,” she said. her voice rising, “We need to stay focused and fearless, go into red districts with resolve.”\n\n“Phone bank like you’re bidding for Beyoncé tickets.”","summary":"The

senjata sementara yang disokong Amerika Syarikat (AS).\n\nBagaimanapun utusan khas Presiden Donald Trump ke Asia Barat, Steve Witkoff menyifatkan maklum balas kumpulan itu sebagai 'sama sekali tidak boleh diterima'.\n\nHamas bersedia membebaskan 10 tebusan hidup serta menyerahkan mayat 18 lagi tebusan sebagai pertukaran kepada tahanan Palestin di penjara Israel. \n\nNamun, Hamas tetap menegaskan tuntutan agar perang dihentikan sepenuhnya dan tentera Israel berundur dari Gaza namun syarat itu ditolak Israel.\n\nSeorang pegawai Hamas menggambarkan maklum balas itu sebagai 'positif' tetapi memerlukan sedikit pindaan, tanpa memperincikan bentuk perubahan diminta.\n\nDalam pada itu, Perdana Menteri Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, berkata kerajaannya bersetuju dengan cadangan Witkoff, namun Hamas terus menolak. \n\n\"Israel akan terus berusaha membawa pulang semua tebusan dan menewaskan Hamas,\" katanya.\n\nCadangan yang dikemukakan mengesyorkan gencatan senjata selama 60 hari dan pertukaran 28 daripada 58 tebusan dengan lebih 1,200 tahanan Palestin, selain kemasukan bantuan kemanusiaan ke Gaza.\n\nPegawai kanan Hamas, Basem Naim, menafikan kumpulan itu menolak cadangan terbabit, tetapi menuduh Israel tidak mematuhi apa yang sudah dipersetujui dan mendakwa Witkoff berat sebelah terhadap Israel.\n\nSeorang pegawai Palestin yang rapat dengan rundingan memberitahu Reuters, Hamas mahu pembebasan tebusan dilakukan dalam tiga fasa sepanjang tempoh 60 hari dan pengagihan bantuan yang lebih meluas. \n\nPihak berkenaan juga menuntut jaminan cadangan itu akan membawa kepada gencatan senjata kekal.Israel sebelum ini menolak tuntutan Hamas dan sebaliknya mahukan kumpulan pejuang itu meletakkan senjata serta Hamas dibubarkan sebagai kuasa tentera dan pentadbiran, selain pembebasan semua baki 58 tebusan.\n\nTrump sebelum ini menyatakan keyakinan bahawa persetujuan gencatan senjata semakin hampir, dengan Rumah Putih turut mengesahkan Israel sudah bersetuju dengan syarat terkini. \n\nNamun, Witkoff pula menyatakan platform sosial X, maklum balas Hamas sama sekali tidak boleh diterima dan hanya membantutkan proses rundingan.\n\nUtusan khas AS itu menggesa Hamas supaya menerima kerangka cadangan gencatan senjata sebagai asas untuk rundingan tidak langsung yang boleh dimulakan segera minggu ini.\n\nDalam perkembangan berkaitan, tentera Israel semalam (Sabtu) mengesahkan telah membunuh Mohammad Sinwar, ketua Hamas di Gaza dalam serangan udara pada 13 Mei — seperti diumumkan Netanyahu sebelum ini. \n\nMohammad adalah adik kepada Yahya Sinwar, pemimpin kanan Hamas yang terbunuh dan dalang serangan ke atas Israel pada Oktober 2023. \n\nSehingga kini, Hamas masih belum mengesahkan atau menafikan kematian itu.\n\nSiri serangan udara dan darat Israel dilancarkan semula sejak Mac selepas tempoh gencatan senjata dua bulan. \n\nTentera Israel berkata mereka terus menyasarkan lokasi strategik termasuk lokasi penembak tepat dan mendakwa telah membunuh ketua pembuatan senjata Hamas.\n\nSerangan berterusan itu telah mengosongkan kawasan besar di sempadan Gaza, memaksa lebih dua juta penduduk berhimpit di kawasan pantai dan sekitar bandar Khan Younis di selatan.\n\nSejak awal Mac, Israel mengenakan sekatan penuh terhadap semua bekalan masuk ke Gaza bagi melemahkan Hamas, tetapi kini berdepan tekanan antarabangsa susulan krisis kemanusiaan semakin meruncing.\n\nSemalam, agensi bantuan melaporkan bahawa puluhan trak Program Makanan Sedunia (WFP) yang membawa tepung ke kedai roti di Gaza dirampas oleh kumpulan bersenjata dan kemudian dirompak oleh penduduk yang terdesak akibat kelaparan berpanjangan.\n\n\"Selepas hampir 80 hari sekatan penuh, penduduk kini kelaparan dan tidak lagi sanggup melihat makanan berlalu di depan mata,\" kata WFP dalam satu kenyataan.\n\nInsiden terbaharu rompakan bantuan di Gaza sekali lagi menyerlahkan situasi keselamatan yang lemah dan menggugat penghantaran bantuan, meskipun Israel telah melonggarkan sekatan sejak awal bulan lalu.\n\nJumaat lalu, Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB) menyatakan keadaan di Gaza kini paling buruk sejak perang bermula 19 bulan lalu dengan keseluruhan populasi berdepan risiko kebuluran, meskipun bantuan berskala kecil mula disambung semula.\n\n\"Bantuan yang dihantar sekarang hanya menjadi 'bahan ejekan' kepada tragedi besar yang sedang berlaku di depan mata,\" kata ketua agensi utama PBB untuk bantuan rakyat Palestin, Philippe Lazzarini di platform X.\n\nIsrael membenarkan sejumlah kecil trak dari WFP dan kumpulan antarabangsa lain membawa tepung ke kedai roti di Gaza, namun penghantaran sering tergendala akibat insiden rompakan berulang.\n\nSatu sistem lain yang dikendalikan kumpulan disokong AS, Yayasan Kemanusiaan Gaza (GHF) juga sedang mengagihkan makanan dan bantuan di tiga lokasi khusus. \n\nNamun, kumpulan bantuan enggan bekerjasama dengan GHF yang dikatakan tidak berkecuali dan menyifatkan jumlah bantuan yang dibenarkan masuk masih jauh daripada mencukupi untuk populasi yang kini berisiko kebuluran.\n\nKetua gabungan kumpulan bantuan Palestin, Amjad Al-Shawa, berkata situasi terdesak itu sedang dieksploitasi kumpulan bersenjata yang menyerang konvoi bantuan.\n\nBeliau menegaskan ratusan lagi trak diperlukan setiap hari dan menuduh Israel mengamalkan 'dasar kebuluran secara sistematik'. \n\nNamun Israel menafikan dakwaan itu dan menegaskan pihaknya membantu penghantaran bantuan termasuk menyokong pusat agihan GHF serta membenarkan trak bantuan lain memasuki Gaza.\n\nSebaliknya, Israel menuduh Hamas mencuri bekalan yang sepatutnya disalurkan kepada orang awam dan menggunakannya untuk mengukuhkan penguasaannya di Gaza yang telah ditadbir kumpulan itu sejak 2007.Hamas menafikan tuduhan rampasan bekalan dan telah melaksanakan hukuman mati terhadap beberapa individu yang disyaki terbabit dalam perbuatan itu.\n\nIsrael melancarkan kempen ketenteraan di Gaza sebagai tindak balas terhadap serangan yang diketuai Hamas ke atas komuniti di selatan Israel pada 7 Oktober 2023 yang mengorbankan 1,200 orang menurut anggaran Israel, dan menyaksikan 251 individu diculik dan dibawa ke Gaza.\n\nSerangan itu memusnahkan sebahagian besar kawasan di Semenanjung Gaza, mengorbankan lebih 54,000 rakyat Palestin serta memusnahkan atau merosakkan majoriti bangunan hingga menyebabkan kebanyakan penduduk kini tinggal di tempat perlindungan sementara.","summary":"KAHERAH/ BAITULMAQDIS: Hamas semalam menyatakan pihaknya mahu beberapa pindaan terhadap cadangan gencatan senjata sementara yang disokong Amerika

at people.' FREDDY GRAY hears Washington whispers that the billionaire's brain is 'decaying' under the pressure, as rumours swirl of his ketamine, ecstasy and mushrooms 'cocktail'","text":"At the height of his power, Alexander the Great wept because there were no more worlds left to conquer. Elon Musk, the richest man of our age, may have been blubbing for a different reason last week, as yet another of his unfathomable ambitions came crashing to earth.\n\nOn its ninth test flight, his SpaceX ‘Starship’ enterprise, which has been designed to make ‘humans an interplanetary species’, went up with barely a hitch. Then, on re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere, the 400ft machine lost contact with the control room, span out of control and blew up. Musk, wearing his favoured ‘OCCUPY MARS’ T-shirt for the big occasion, tried to put a positive spin on Starship’s third mid-flight immolation in a row. He called the crash-test ‘a big improvement’ and posted triumphant videos of the spacecraft thrusting majestically towards the heavens.\n\nBut it was a major setback and everyone knew it. As the ship’s debris splashed down in the Indian ocean, Musk cancelled a celebratory speech he was meant to give to his SpaceX employees. He’d promised Donald Trump that astronauts would plant the American flag on the Red Planet before the President leaves office in 2028. Now that target seems hopelessly optimistic.\n\nMusk must have been hoping that his mission to Mars would have provided a much-needed escape because here, on this planet, things seem to be going from bad to worse for him.\n\nOn Wednesday Musk, 53, finally confirmed what everyone in Washington knew: his ‘scheduled time’ as head of the White House’s Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE) is over. He thanked Trump for giving him ‘the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending’.\n\nPublicly, at least, Trump and Musk have sought to remain on the best of terms. On Friday the President held a special farewell press conference to mark Elon’s departure. ‘This will be his last day but not really because he will, always, be helping all the way,’ he said. ‘Elon is terrific!’\n\nTrump then gave Musk a special golden key to the White House and reiterated that ‘he’s not really leaving’. Musk, who curiously had a black eye (the result, he said, of playfighting with X, his four-year-old son), thanked and praised Trump in return.\n\nBut warm words can’t cover up the fact that relations have soured between Musk and Team Trump, if not the big Donald himself.\n\nYet in a major TV interview to be shown this weekend, Musk has risked a major rupture with the Commander-in-Chief by criticising Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Tax bill’, which is working its way through Congress. ‘I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it,’ Musk said. ‘I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don’t know if it can be both.’\n\nThat has not gone down well in Trumpworld. ‘That bill is Trump’s pride and joy,’ says a source close to the administration. ‘And he really will not have appreciated cold water being poured on it.’\n\nThe official line is still that Musk has only ever been a temporary ‘special government employee’ and his formal role was always going to end after three months. Talk to insiders, however, and the picture becomes clear: DOGE has backfired and Team Trump is increasingly hostile to Musk.\n\n‘As far as I’m concerned he’s just another ungrateful immigrant,’ one source says of the South African-born tycoon. A more sympathetic source adds: ‘It’s the first time he’s come up against the DC blob and I’m not sure he had any idea how to deal with it.’\n\nMusk seems bruised by his experience. Looking morose, he told a conference in Qatar two weeks ago that he would be cutting back his campaign spending. ‘If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,’ he said. ‘I do not currently see a reason.’\n\nLast Monday, a Musk fan on X expressed his disgust at the Republican party for not supporting Musk’s work at DOGE. ‘Did my best,’ replied dejected Musk.\n\nHis political career seems to have imitated the flightpath of the last Starship. After a spectacular start, he soon found himself burning up in the poisonous atmospheres of Washington, DC. Or, as one insider puts it: ‘Elon came to Washington to drain the swamp. But the swamp has drained him.’\n\nWorst of all, Musk’s adventure with Trump appears to have greatly harmed his business empire. His biggest company, the electric car maker Tesla, is facing a host of problems.\n\nLast week, ahead of the multi-national’s big ‘robotaxi’ launch, Musk’s brother Kimbal, along with one of his senior associates, sold almost $200 million in Tesla stocks – a big red flag for investors.\n\nHow things have changed. In January, as he celebrated Trump’s second inauguration in Washington, Musk looked unstoppable. He was the President’s ‘First buddy’, the biggest billionaire in the Trump jungle. He was the man who had bet some $300 million in donations, his reputation and arguably his whole career on defeating the Democratic party in the 2024 election – and he’d won.\n\nHis decision in October 2022 to spend $44 billion buying the social media platform Twitter, which he turned into X, was widely hailed as a decisive moment in American political history. He’d turned a powerfully censorious anti-Trump platform into the most potent pro-free speech website on the planet.\n\nFrom the November 2024 presidential election until the turn of the year, he’d been a near constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s ‘Winter White House’ in Florida. He was heavily involved in Trump’s decision-making and cabinet selections. Insiders called him ‘the de facto President’.\n\n‘The real President doesn’t take too kindly to that kind of talk,’ says one DC insider.\n\nAt the time, however, Trump seemed too smitten with Musk to care about all the chatter over two planet-sized egos clashing.\n\nIn his speeches, Trump never missed a chance to call Musk a ‘genius’. On his first day back in office, the President duly issued the executive order to create DOGE, giving Musk the awesome responsibility of tackling America’s $36 trillion national debt.\n\nA few weeks later, Musk appeared on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, wearing a gothic-style MAGA cap and wielding a chainsaw, a symbol of his mission to slay the federal leviathan.\n\nWith the President’s full blessing, Musk and his merry band of DOGEsters – a group of mostly twentysomething data geeks – happily set about exposing and removing government waste and fraud. They briefly shut down the US Agency for International Development, which oversees the government’s aid efforts.\n\nEven more controversially, they froze Medicaid health insurance payments and laid off thousands of federal employees. As a newfangled executive department, though, DOGE never really had any true constitutional authority. Without majority support in Congress, almost all its actions can be legally reversed.\n\n‘They found the waste,’ says a Washington source. ‘Dealing with it is a whole separate issue. The DOGE guys signalled to the public that they had the power to do stuff they never had the power to do.’\n\n‘They were high on their supply,’ says another insider with links to the intelligence community. ‘We owe Trump a debt because by bringing in Elon and his DOGE people front and centre in the way that he did, he exposed them for the bunch of charlatans they are.\n\n‘If you spend any time among some of the Elon people, it feels more like a cult than a proper business. You have to be a bit mad to work for someone like Elon. What’s happening in the Musk empire is that people are learning that the emperor has no clothes.’\n\nTrump may have been enamoured with Musk’s move-fast-and-break-things approach, but members of his cabinet quickly became fed up with Musk’s haughty attitude to their affairs.\n\nHe insulted Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, by accusing him, in front of Trump, of not cutting back on his staff and clashed with Transport Secretary Sean Duffy for not firing enough air traffic controllers.\n\nBut the real splits with Trump’s inner circle began to show after April 2, ‘Liberation Day’, when Trump sent the global economy reeling as he imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world. Musk, a free-marketeer by instinct, disapproved of Trump’s agenda, not least because it threatened to further harm his Tesla business which was suffering from an at times violent sabotage campaign.\n\nOn X, Musk posted a video of Milton Friedman, the famous economist, explaining how the marvels of international trade come together to produce a pencil.\n\nHe also called Peter Navarro, the architect of Trump’s trade policy, ‘a moron’. A few days later, he accused Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, a moderate in the internal White House debate over tariffs, of being an ‘agent’ for George Soros, the Left-Liberal billionaire and global bogeyman of the Trumpist Right. Musk’s relations with the White House have never been the same since.\n\nSome voices in Washington suggest Musk, under so much strain on so many fronts, may have suffered some kind of breakdown.\n\nA person close to the Trump administration who interacted with Elon over 2024 and this year says ‘his cognition seemed to decay’ and suggests there is ‘little distinction’ between how he ‘presents in real life and his life on X’.\n\nHis ownership of X has turned out to be just one more massive business headache.\n\nHe still has the power to change the global conversation just by tapping on his phone. But latest reports suggest ‘user engagement’ on X is flatlining and subscription revenues are nowhere near as high as shareholders wanted.\n\nMusk would hardly be the first person driven mad by social media. But he’s a highly intelligent and hyperactive man with a terrifying number of responsibilities and a very complicated love life.\n\nHe’s had 14 children with four women. He has struggled with depression and told CNN last year that he uses the powerful drug ketamine to stabilise his mood.\n\nA report in The New York Times on Friday suggests he has been taking a daily cocktail of drugs, including the prescribed stimulant Adderall, plus mind-altering substances such as ecstasy and magic mushrooms. In the Oval Office on Friday, Musk sarcastically criticised The New York Times, saying that it had a history of printing ‘lies’, but he hasn’t yet rebutted its new allegations.\n\n‘He’s becoming a lot more nasty,’ says an insider. ‘He’s yelling more at people. He used to be a much more charming figure.’\n\nMusk is also reportedly furious at Trump’s courting of his friend-turned-nemesis in the tech world, Sam Altman. Musk helped co-found OpenAI, the world’s leading artificial intelligence company, with Altman in 2015 but the two fell out spectacularly. Musk accuses Altman of ‘perfidy and deceit… of Shakespearean proportions’ and is suing him.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal last week, Musk attempted to derail a deal, brokered by the US government, for Altman’s OpenAI to build one of the world’s largest data centres in Abu Dhabi.\n\nMusk lobbied for his company, xAI, to be part of the plan, to no avail. Altman and Musk travelled with Trump to the Middle East last month, but it was Altman who appears to have secured the biggest Arab AI contract.\n\nIt is thought Trump tried to give Musk some solace during a press conference in the Oval Office last month by publicly berating South African President Cyril Ramaphosa about persecution of white farmers in Musk’s homeland.\n\nHere too, however, behind the political theatrics, lies another tangled geopolitical business web.\n\nMusk’s satellite internet service Starlink has been denied a licence to operate in South Africa, partly due to race-based ownership laws and also because the African National Congress, the ruling party, would rather let China control its digital infrastructure.\n\nIt’s far too soon to write off Elon Musk and his many billion-dollar interests. Throughout his career, he’s triumphed over adversity. Time and again, his companies have proved too innovative to be written off. ‘The real story is not one of Musk’s empire collapsing,’ says a less hostile Trumpworld source. ‘It’s one of strategic retreat.’\n\nBut these are dark days for the prince of MAGA.","summary":"Elon Musk must have been hoping that his rocket would have provided a much-needed escape last week, because here, on Earth, things seem to be going from bad to worse for him.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14767927/Elon-Musk-ketamine-ecstasy-mushrooms-cocktail-FREDDY-GRAY-brain.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/31/16/98922571-0-image-a-6_1748704517211.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 00:44:02","author":"Editor,Freddy Gray","authors":["Editor","Freddy Gray"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":326890752,"title":"Labor maintains ‘pathway’ to Australian steel tariff exemption after Donald Trump doubles levee to 50 per cent","text":"Camera IconIndustrial Relations Minister Amanda Rishworth’s comments come after Mr Trump blindsided world leaders be announcing he would be doubling the levees on imported steel to 50 per cent in order to “further secure the steel industry in the United States”.

\n\nAnother mystery is why nobody else in Washington beat him to it. \n\nAfter all, even as Biden slipped deeper into la-la land and aides hid him as much as possible from the public, the stage managers weren’t able to hide the fact that his stumbles and mumbles were growing worse. \n\nHe often couldn’t string two sentences together and displayed a glassy, far-away look, as if he didn’t know where he was. \n\nThe falls and extended hands to invisible people were other big giveaways. \n\n‘Apologies to Don’ \n\nThe disturbing scenes were obvious signs of something amiss, but merely pointing them out might have helped Trump, and so the legacy media stayed silent. \n\nHis condition certainly made the prospect of Biden serving a second term preposterous, yet there was no sign his family or party leaders were willing to tell him so. \n\nDespite the silence of most media, the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, repeatedly told pollsters that Biden was over the hill and should not seek a second term. \n\nThe charade collapsed in the debate with Trump last June, an event where Tapper happened to be a moderator. \n\nUntil that point, he had been a solid Dem team member, even slamming Lara Trump on air over her claim that Biden was suffering from cognitive decline. \n\nTapper, with a sneer, accused her of mocking Biden’s stutter. \n\nBut with the pending publication of “Original Sin,” which he wrote with Alex Thompson of Axios, Tapper called Trump to apologize. \n\nAs she put it, “Jake Tapper called me and said, ‘I have this book coming out, and I know everybody’s saying that I should apologize to you. I plan whenever the book comes out, to go on TV, and I will say you were right and I was wrong,’ ” she said. \n\n“And I guess, to Jake’s credit, he did that,” she told Laura Ingraham. \n\nThanks in part to Tapper’s conversion, there is a renewed energy about addressing long-standing doubts about who was making decisions and running the Biden White House. \n\nAs Tapper put it, a source “told us that the presidency was, at best, a five-person board with Joe Biden as chairman of the board.” \n\nEvidence of that, with examples, will need to be flushed out, as will the question of whether Biden was so disabled that the 25th Amendment should have been invoked to sideline him. \n\nThe fact that Biden, in a single term, issued more than 4,200 pardons and commutations– — far above any other recent president — is already fodder for a House GOP probe. \n\nMedical concerns \n\nA related issue involves the use of an autopen for Biden’s signature on many leniency orders and other decisions. \n\nDid he give approval or did aides act without his knowledge? \n\nThe House panel, led by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, has invited former White House aides to testify voluntarily, including top physician Dr. Kevin O’Connor. \n\nIf they refuse, Comer vows to issue subpoenas. \n\n“We’re going to bring Dr. O’Connor in because he definitely was not telling the truth about Joe Biden’s health,” Comer has said. \n\nIn addition to Biden’s cognitive decline, the fact that he recently announced he is being treated for an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones provokes concerns about why he never disclosed that illness while in office. \n\nSome doctors say he must have had the cancer for years for it to be so serious now. \n\nIn a better world, such revelations would cause serious soul-searching in legacy newsrooms. \n\nWhy did the same outlets that now produce seven or eight stories a day about everything Trump says and does allow the Biden White House to get away with hiding the former president’s decline and sickness? \n\nIn any other business, such a monumental failure by industry leaders would spark major personnel changes and reforms designed to prevent a repeat. \n\nBut with the Washington press corps, there is no soul-searching and there will be no changes. \n\nThe reason is as repugnant as it is obvious. \n\nThe press hates Trump more than it loves the truth.","summary":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper has been a reliable cheerleader for all things Democrat and a snide anti-Trumper, but dramatically broke ranks by daring to co-author a book about Joe Biden’s cognitive decline.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/31/opinion/michael-goodwin-jake-tapper-splits-from-dem-allies-in-latest-book-detailing-bidens-cognitive-decline/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/JTJB1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-01 00:26:20","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":326890762,"title":"Trump yanks Elon Musk ally's NASA nomination","text":"Camera IconThe next leader of NASA must be \"in complete alignment\" with Donald Trump's America First agenda.

However, the new internal orders for the Army instruct personnel to address trans troops by the gender they were assigned at birth and not their preferred pronoun.\n\nThe guidance includes a list of criteria that the military will use for soldiers to begin to identify fellow service members who are suspected of having gender dysphoria. The requirements include previous requests for exemptions to grooming standards connected to medical assignment at birth or starting a medical treatment plan connected to gender dysphoria. \n\nOther markers, according to the guidance, include “overt conduct” on social media or in person, showing a gender identity other than what an individual was assigned at birth, as well as a “private conversation” that a commanding officer may have with a soldier in which they disclosed having gender dysphoria.\n\nIt’s expected that a commander will set into motion a medical record review if they’re aware of any of these criteria. The department’s new policy also means that service members will be asked about their identity during medical check-ups.\n\nWhile Hegseth said in the February memo that trans troops will be \"treated with dignity and respect,” he has severely criticised trans troops in public.\n\n\"No more dudes in dresses, we're done with that s***,” he said at a military conference in Florida this month.\n\nSimilarly, while the Army guidance tells soldiers to use the \"utmost professionalism and treating all individuals with dignity and respect,” its new policies go against social norms for trans people, such as addressing them using their preferred pronouns.\n\nA trans infantry officer and Afghanistan veteran, Army Maj. Kara Corcoran, told CBS News on Friday that \"By implementing this guidance…you're making it worse than the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy, because you're overtly hunting down and trying to identify transgender service members or anybody that…exhibits symptoms of gender dysphoria.”\n\n\"Transgender service members have served openly since 2016 without adverse impacts on readiness or unit cohesion,” she said. “Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having deployed to war zones and executed missions with distinction.\"\n\nAccording to the Department of Defense, gender dysphoria is a \"marked incongruence between an individual's experienced or expressed gender and their assigned gender, lasting at least six months, as manifested by conditions causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.”\n\nThe Army guidance shared on Wednesday suggests that identifying with a gender other than the one assigned at birth goes against standards of truthfulness and discipline.\n\nThe wording is similar to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January stating that the values of trans service members aren’t in line with the \"humility and selflessness required” of military members and are \"inconsistent with\" the \"cohesion\" needed in the armed forces.\n\nA spokesperson for the Army told CBS News that additional guidance has been issued since May 8 amid the continuing voluntary separation of service members.\n\nThe spokesperson added that \"Pronoun usage when referring to Soldiers must reflect their biological sex. In keeping with good order and discipline, salutations (e.g., addressing a senior officer as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\") must also reflect an individual's biological sex.”\n\n\"The Army recognizes the selfless service of all who have volunteered to serve our great nation,” they added. “We are in the process of ensuring the Army is aligned with recent policy changes to Soldier requirements.

Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 2024, told Democrats to look at their own party if they are concerned about the current state of politics.\n\nWalz, speaking to the California Democratic Party’s convention in Anaheim on Saturday, May 31, described the U.S. as being in a political mess because “some of it is our (Democrats’) own doing.”\n\n“I may be the last person to lecture on this topic. But none of us can shy away from having hard conversations,” Walz said.\n\n“The Democratic Party — the party of the working class — lost a big chunk of the working class,” he said about the November 2024 election, when voters elected Republican President Donald Trump to a second term in the White House.\n\nWalz went on to say that Democrats have good ideas, but the average person doesn’t see the party implementing bold ideas. Democrats, he said, should govern with courage and not be afraid to make mistakes.\n\nWalz’s speech in Anaheim was his second stop at a coastal state’s convention on Saturday.\n\nEarlier, Walz sought to energize Democrats in South Carolina at the state party’s convention there. The Palmetto State event is generally considered a platform for national Democrats and potential White House hopefuls.\n\nWalz was one of two speakers on Saturday’s California convention lineup — the other being U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey — whose name has come up as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.\n\nDuring the morning session, Booker fired up delegates at the California convention with a truncated version of the 25-hour marathon speech that he delivered on the floor of the U.S. Senate in April.\n\nSpeaker after speaker at the Democratic event denounced the actions of the Trump administration, calling out Republicans’ attempts to cut Medicaid and food assistance in order to, as the Democrats put it, “line the pockets” of the wealthy.\n\nThe California Democratic Party Convention kicked off in earnest on Friday and will wrap up on Sunday.

A light aircraft buzzed overhead pulling a banner that read: 'No Boys in Girls' Sports!'\n\nCIF representatives at previous track meets have told girls to remove t-shirts with messages protesting the organization and have banned signs to quash protests.\n\nGaines hit headlines in 2022 as a competitive swimmer for University of Kentucky in the 200-yard NCAA freestyle championship against University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who lives as a woman. \n\nThe 25-year-old quickly became an outspoken critic against transgender athletes competing in women's sport and has hailed Trump's 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sport' executive order which he signed February. \n\nGaines, host of the Gains for Girls podcast on OutKick, gave a searing indictment of Hernandez's mother, Nereyda Hernandez, 43.\n\n'His mom is a pretty evil person,' Gaines declared. 'I believe she is using her son to live out some fantasy or dream that maybe she had. \n\n'She has lied to AB in affirming his identity - the total façade - and in the process has harmed real women.\n\n'I have empathy for AB. He's a victim as well. But that doesn't give him the right to trample on women in the process to fulfill his happiness. \n\n'AB Hernandez is of course not the first boy to compete in the state of California - whether it's track and field, whatever sport it may be,' commented Gaines.\n\n'He is following the rules. So I don't have any animosity or hatred or wish any sort of ill will on the boy. Ultimately, it's the rules that are the problem.\n\n'Harm [is] being done because of his acceptance into women's sports and women's spaces.\n\n'That's what has been relayed to me by many of the girls who have competed against AB.'\n\nHernandez's mother recently posted to social media: 'My child is not a threat; SHE IS LIGHT!!! As AB's mother, I will continue to stand by her, proudly fiercely, and unconditionally.' The Daily Mail has reached out to her for further comment. \n\nBut Gaines proclaimed: 'Sports are not about inclusion at the level he's competing. It's not about your feelings. It's about winning, to put it as bluntly as possible. \n\n'Women aren't just a tool used to fulfill men's happiness. That's not what we are. Unfortunately, that's what women are being used for again. But we say enough.\n\n'I'm not trying to rid anyone of opportunities. I believe every single person should play sports. But play in the categories that are safe and fair to everyone.\n\n'We cannot prioritize inclusion over safety and fairness. That undermines the foundation of what sports were created to do.\n\n'That's what we've seen a lot with this movement - women are just expected to roll over. Women are expected to be what they call inclusive and kind and allow these men into our spaces.\n\n'You have men who are described as AGP - autogynephiliacs - who are just men who are sexually aroused dressing as a woman, and we're being forced to participate in that fetish.\n\n'And we are reprimanded if we even dare to question it. Women have had enough. We say no.\n\n'It's not just women like me. I've talked to many women who are lesbians who say 'We're being used here.'\n\n'This seems like something that we see relatively often with this trans community, especially with minors who have transitioned.\n\n'You have one parent, or both parents, who look like they are using their child as a prop.'\n\nShe noted that so-called progressive states, most notably California, are in reality 'regressive because they are destructive and harmful to women and girls'. \n\nGaines noted that girls feel threatened and parents fear they could lose their job if they speak out to much. \n\nShe has spoken with some of the girls who have been competing against Hernandez and were pushed into second place. They 'would be the rightful champion had AB not been competing'.\n\nShe added: 'It breaks my heart. Hearing from them and what they have to say is the reason why I keep pushing forward [and] keep fighting this fight.'\n\nOne of the girls, who placed second behind Hernandez, told Gaines she felt 'betrayed' and 'belittled'.\n\nThe distressed girl, she added, said the messaging from CIF and Newsom for not tackling the issue was 'very loud and clear' that she 'wasn't worthy of calling herself a champion.'\n\n'How could any person with a fifth grade understanding of biology hear that and their heart not break?' asked Gaines. \n\n'It's about the next generation. It's about protecting those girls. The girls are picking up on the discrimination that they are facing simply for being girls and participating in girls sports.'\n\nGaines believes, though, that voters showed their disharmony with trans issues by voting Trump into office for a second time last November.\n\n'People have had enough with the identity politics and with policies that harm women, with the harming of children, with the ridding of parental rights - California has been the nation's leader on all of those things,' declared Gaines. \n\nFormer California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law in 2013 allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity.\n\nA Republican-led effort to block that law failed recently in the Democratic-dominated state legislature. Another proposal that also failed would have required the federation to ban students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team.\n\nA Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for the Central District of California, announced an investigation Wednesday into CIF and the Jurupa Unified School District, which includes Hernandez's high school, to determine whether federal sex discrimination law was violated by allowing trans girls to compete in girls' sports.\n\nFeeling the intense pressure from Trump, last Tuesday the CIF announced a temporary rule change to allow an extra girl to be in the medals in the three track events that include Hernandez. \n\nRiley slammed the CIF for 'indicating that they would [still] allow the boy to still compete with the girls'.\n\n'It is common sense that boys and girls are different, that there are two sexes, that each sex is deserving of equal opportunities of privacy and of safety.\n\n'But now we have sitting Supreme Court justices who can't even answer the question of what's in a woman because they claim to not be a biologist. \n\nShe added: 'Fear is a large part of it.' She pointed to the 'crazy unhinged trans activists that I have found myself up against in many different scenarios. I've been attacked. I've had my life threatened by them.'\n\nA proud Christian, she recalled five students recently being arrested in Portland, Oregon, 'for wanting to end my life.' Critics and trans proponents in Seattle threw human feces at her, she said.'\n\nShe described her anti-trans collaborator Trump as 'the exact man you think he is'.\n\n'That's why people are drawn to him, especially young people. There's a sense of authenticity that you can feel, that you see on TV when you're watching him, or when you're reading his tweets.\n\n'I can attest to the fact that that is real. There is no face that he puts on. There is no wall that he puts up. What you see is very much what you get.\n\n'He has made it very clear his intention of protecting children, of protecting parental rights, of protecting the rights of women.'\n\nShe pointed to the Take It Down Act, proposed by Trump and First Lady Melania in May to protect women and children online exploitation.\n\nAlthough Gov. Newsom recently called transgender athletes competing against girls' 'deeply unfair' - a tougher tone than earlier comments - Gaines insisted he hasn't done anything so resolved the issue. \n\n'Put your money where your mouth is,' she said of the governor. 'If you say it's deeply unfair, do something about it.

Until recently, Dame customers found something unexpected in their cart — an image of a wig resembling President Donald Trump’s hair, labeled \"Trump tariff surcharge,\" with a $5.00 fee. According to Dame Products CEO Alexandra Fine, it was the company’s way of being transparent with customers about the challenges posed by the tariffs. \"[For] Dame, most of our hardware products or vibrators are produced in China. We also make a lot of stuff in the US as well, but all of those products have been greatly impacted by the tariffs,\" Fine told FOX Business. Fine said the instability and shifting tariff rates eventually forced her to take action. US CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REBOUNDS IN MAY AFTER 5-MONTH SLIDE The tariffs have impacted Dame’s cash flow, according to Fine, who said it all comes down to inventory. She explained that her planned inventory purchases have been turned upside down since the tariffs went into place, making it so she needs more than double the amount of money she planned on needing this year. In an effort to maintain transparency, Dame warned customers that prices would increase — a move Fine said triggered some \"panic buying\" as people tried to get their hands on what they wanted before the change. However, once the tariff surcharge was added, the number of customers actually completing checkout dropped by 30%, according to Fine. JAMIE DIMON IDENTIFIES &apos;MOST IMPORTANT&apos; FOCUS FOR TRUMP TEAM AMID GLOBAL &apos;TECTONIC&apos; SHIFTS Although Dame has since removed the surcharge, the move did not go unnoticed. Fine said that the company has seen mixed reactions to its Trump surcharge, some — particularly those on social media — loved it, but others weren’t fans. \"It has been interesting getting some backlash from some Republicans who support the tariffs,\" Fine told FOX Business, saying she felt like she threw herself into a political controversy. \"It just feels like major government intervention,\" Fine said, referring to the tariffs.

States and its allies won't allow China to dominate the Indo-Pacific region, but do not seek war, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Saturday morning in Singapore.\n\nHe addressed regional concerns while speaking during the International Institute for Strategic Studies Shangri-La Dialogue event in Singapore.\n\nHegseth said the Indo-Pacific region is the United States' \"priority theater\" and won't allow China to push the United States and its allies out of the region, the Department of Defense announced Friday in a news release.\n\nInstead, deterrence will be the primary tool by which the United States and its allies will counter any aggressive moves made by China, particularly in the South China Sea and against Taiwan.\n\n\"As our allies share the burden, we can increase our focus on the Indo-Pacific,\" Hegseth said, adding that the region is the nation's \"priority theater.\"\n\nHe said the futures of the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific depend on each other.\n\n\"We share a vision of peace and stability, of prosperity and security,\" Hegseth said, \"and we are here to stay.\"\n\nCommon sense and national interests with guide policy making in the region, while respecting mutual self-interests.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is working to get European nations to do more to increase their respective national security interests instead of largely relying on the United States.\n\nAs European nations do more to protect themselves, Hegseth said the United States will be better able to focus on matters in the Indo-Pacific region and do more to thwart Chinese aggression.\n\n\"This enables all of us to benefit from the peace and stability that comes with a lasting and strong American presence here in the Indo-Pacific,\" Hegseth said.\n\nThat presence won't come at a cost for the nation's allies, though.\n\n\"We are not here to pressure other countries to embrace and adopt our politics or ideology,\" Hegseth told the audience. \"We are all sovereign nations.\"\n\nHe said the United States does not \"seek conflict with communist China.\"\n\nBut the United States \"will not be pushed out of this critical region,\" Hegseth added. \"And we will not let our allies and partners be subordinated and intimidated.\"\n\nHe said China's leaders are \"preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,\" including occupying Taiwan.\n\nAny move by China to take over Taiwan, which China has claimed as part of its sovereign state, would trigger \"devastating consequences\" for the region and the world, Hegseth told the audience.\n\n\"The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent,\" he said, adding that the United States and its allies must be prepared with \"urgency and vigilance.\"\n\nIf deterrence doesn't work and a fighting war is inevitable, \"we are prepared to do what the Department of Defense does best: to fight and win decisively,\" Hegseth said.\n\nThe best way to ensure peace is to prepare for war, \"but we have to do this quickly,\" he said. \"We have no time to waste.\"","summary":"The United States and its allies won't allow China to dominate the Indo-Pacific region,

ceasefire proposal 'unacceptable'","text":"Hamas announced on Saturday that it had replied to a US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal, but Washington's main negotiator criticised the response as \"totally unacceptable\".\n\nThe Palestinian militant group said its response was positive while emphasising the need for a permanent ceasefire -- long a sticking point for Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed US envoy Steve Witkoff's assessment that the response was \"unacceptable\", accusing Hamas of clinging \"to its rejectionism\".\n\nIsrael on Friday warned Hamas to either accept the deal and free the hostages held in Gaza \"or be annihilated\".\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, Hamas said it had \"submitted its response... to the mediating parties\".\n\n\"As part of this agreement, 10 living prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,\" it added.\n\nA source within the group's political bureau said it had offered \"a positive response to Witkoff, but with emphasis on guaranteeing a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal\" from the Gaza Strip.\n\nWitkoff said Hamas's response was \"totally unacceptable and only takes us backward\", urging the group to \"accept the framework proposal we put forward\".\n\n\"That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have... substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire,\" he added in a post on X.\n\n- Hamas alleges negotiation 'bias' -\n\nA member of Hamas's political bureau, Bassem Naim, later told AFP the group \"responded positively and responsibly\" to Witkoff's proposal.\n\nHe alleged there was a \"complete bias\" in the negotiating process in favour of Israel, accusing it of disagreeing with \"provisions we had agreed upon\" earlier with the US envoy.\n\nHamas has long maintained that any deal should lay out a pathway to a permanent end to the war.\n\nIsrael has balked at that prospect, insisting on the need to destroy the group to prevent a repeat of the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.\n\nIt recently stepped up its campaign in Gaza in a bid to defeat Hamas.\n\n\"While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff framework for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to cling to its rejectionism,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the group's reply was \"unacceptable and sets the process back\".\n\n\"Israel will continue its efforts to bring our hostages home and to defeat Hamas.\"\n\nA breakthrough in negotiations has been elusive ever since a previous ceasefire fell apart on March 18 with the resumption of Israeli operations.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had said on Friday that the parties were \"very close to an agreement\".\n\nTwo sources close to the negotiations said Witkoff's proposal involved a 60-day truce, potentially extendable to 70 days.\n\nIt would include the release of five living hostages and nine bodies in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners during the first week, followed by a second exchange the following week, the sources said.\n\n- Gaza 'hungriest place on Earth' -\n\nOf the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\n\"After 603 days of war, we wish to remind everyone that war is a means, not an end in itself,\" the main group representing the hostages' families said in a statement.\n\nIsraeli society was \"united around one consensus\", bringing home all the remaining hostages \"even at the cost of ending the war\", the Hostages and Missing Families Forum added.\n\nIsrael has come under increasing international criticism over the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory, where the United Nations warned in May that the entire population was at risk of famine.\n\nA spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency has called the territory \"the hungriest place on Earth\".\n\nAid is only trickling into Gaza after the partial lifting by Israel of a more than two-month total blockade, and the UN has recently reported looting of its trucks and warehouses.\n\nThe World Food Programme has called on Israel \"to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster\", saying desperation was \"contributing to rising insecurity\".\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Saturday that at least 4,117 people have been killed in the territory since Israel resumed its offensive on March 18, taking the war's overall toll to 54,381, mostly civilians.\n\nHamas's attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\n\nbur-smw/dcp/rlp/sco","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/hamas-says-responds-us-truce-175924076.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/2b828572ac7844eac9e326f21e61f7a2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy NIOMI HARRIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:03 BST, 1 June 2025 |Updated:00:27 BST, 1 June 2025 \n\nEastEnders star Michelle Ryan is reportedly set to return to Albert Square 20 years after quitting the BBC soap.\nThe actress, 41, portrayed Zoe Slater between 2000 and 2005, before leaving for a new life in Ibiza after wrongly believing she killed Den Watts.\nDuring her time on the show, Michelle was involved in one of EastEnders' biggest storylines with it revealed that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) was in fact Zoe's mother and not her sister, with explosive scenes seeing her yell: 'You ain't my mother!', only for Kat to reply: 'Yes I am!'\nAnd now it's said that Michelle will return to the show that catapulted her to fame, with the star believing now is the 'perfect' time to make her long-awaited comeback. \nA source told The Sun: 'Bosses have repeatedly reached out to Michelle over the years, but the timing has never been quite right.\n'People are still talking about her character, so it’s a real coup to bring her back.'\nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the Daily Mail's new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop.\n\nEastEnders star Michelle Ryan is reportedly set to return to Albert Square 20 years after quitting the BBC soap [pictured in 2016]\n\nThe actress, 41, portrayed Zoe Slater between 2000 and 2005, before leaving for a new life in Ibiza after wrongly believing she killed Den Watts \nThey added: 'She feels like now is the perfect moment — and there was an exciting script on the table.'\nMailOnline have contacted EastEnders representatives who declined to comment. \nAfter leaving EastEnders, Michelle headed over to the US after landing the lead role in series Bionic Woman. \nIt comes after MailOnline revealed in February that, despite multiple attempts from bosses over the years, Michelle has refused to return to EastEnders - turning them down every time they've asked. \nBack in 2001, EastEnders' leopard-print-loving Kat Slater, who had been sexually abused by her uncle, finally revealed to her 'sister' Zoe that she was, in fact, her mother. \nIt remains one of the most famous and iconic moments in EastEnders' 40-year history - a scene that has been mimicked by soap fans worldwide.\nThe unforgettable storyline catapulted Michelle, then 16, to superstardom, and in 2005, she walked away from Walford for the final time, five years after arriving in EastEnders with the rest of the Slater clan.\nA source told MailOnline: 'Bosses reached out to Michelle several times over the years, they would love to have her back. For example, as the soap was approaching its big 30th anniversary, it was a gentle approach asking if she would consider a return in the lead up to it all.\n\nDuring her time on the show, Michelle was involved in one of EastEnders' biggest storylines with it revealed that Kat Slater ( Jessie Wallace ) was in fact Zoe's mother and not her sister\n\nNow it's said that Michelle will return to the show that catapulted her to fame, with the star believing now is the 'perfect' time to make her long-awaited comeback [pictured with the Slater family]\n\n EastEnders star Michelle Ryan shares heartbreaking news that her grandmother Doreen has died \n'This was at the very early stages of their plans but Michelle refused and there was a lot of disappointment amongst bosses. \n'It's always been quite baffling why she wouldn't want to reprise a character who is still very much adored by the fans. It's been 20 years since she left Albert Square but still people are talking about her character.'\nIn the lead up to the soap's 40th a number of former characters came back including Grant Mitchell, Bianca Jackson, Chrissie Watts, David Wicks, Nigel Bates, Mickey Miller and even Angie Watts but there was no Zoe. \nMichelle admitted at the time of quitting that she 'got quite bored in the end' playing Zoe, telling the Bristol Evening Post: 'Doing the same thing day in, day out. It's just so boring. I like to jump from different things.'\n'I always saw EastEnders as an apprenticeship. I always wanted to go on and do different things. I have some really good friends from that show but the door is closed.\n'I've always taken chances. I think that's how you progress – by stepping out and doing different things.\n'I really do like my freedom and jumping from job to job. I just want to work with people I admire and respect, wherever that be – big budget, low budget, leading role, supporting role.'\n\nMailOnline revealed in February that, despite multiple attempts from bosses over the years, Michelle has refused to return to EastEnders - turning them down every time they've asked \n\nMichelle admitted at the time of quitting that she 'got quite bored in the end' playing Zoe, telling the Bristol Evening Post: 'Doing the same thing day in, day out. It's just so boring'\n\nAfter leaving the show 20 years ago, the star almost cracked America after landing the leading role in the re-imagining of the popular seventies TV show Bionic Woman, though the show was cancelled after just one season.\nSince then the British star has appeared in several independent films, including 4.3.2.1. and Cockneys vs Zombies.\nShe has also had guest roles in BBC shows Merlin, Doctor Who and Death In Paradise.\nHer most recent acting film appearance was in Frankenstein: Legacy where she starred as Lady Charlotte, in addition to 2025's Finding My Voice in which she layed Lisa Kendall.\nEastendersBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEastEnders icon set to make huge 'return to Albert Square' 20 years after quitting the BBC soap\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

On December 3, when Yoon declared martial law – in a bid to quash the Democratic Party-dominated parliament, which he portrayed as “anti-state” and a “den of criminals” – Lee rushed to the National Assembly and climbed the walls of the building to avoid the hundreds of armed troops deployed there. He livestreamed his exploit, urging supporters to come to the parliament and prevent the arrest of legislators.\n\nDespite the troop blockades, enough legislators managed to make it to the parliament and vote to end martial law. The assembly went on to impeach Yoon on December 14.\n\n“This election would not have happened if not for the declaration of martial law by Yoon Suk-yeol and his impeachment,” said Youngshik Bong, research fellow at Yonsei University in Seoul. “These issues have sucked in all others like a vortex. Everything else is marginal.”\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lee has pledged to bring to justice anyone involved in Yoon’s failed bid and has also promised to introduce tighter controls on the president’s ability to declare martial law.\n\nWhere the candidates stand on the martial law attempt\n\nLee, the opposition leader, has also proposed constitutional changes to introduce a four-year, two-term presidency – at the moment, South Korean presidents are only allowed a single term of five years. Lee has also argued for a run-off system for presidential elections, whereby if no candidate secures 50 percent of the popular vote, the top two candidates take on each other in a second round.\n\n“A four-year, two-term presidency would allow for a midterm evaluation of the administration, reinforcing responsibility,” he wrote on Facebook, calling for a constitutional amendment to enable the change. “Meanwhile, adopting a run-off election system would enhance the legitimacy of democratic governance and help reduce unnecessary social conflict.”\n\nThe PPP’s Kim has accepted Lee’s proposals for a constitutional amendment to allow a two-term presidency, but has suggested shortening each term to three years.\n\nYoon’s martial law bid, however, has left the PPP in crisis and disarray.\n\nInfighting plagued the embattled party as it tried to choose the impeached president’s successor. Although Kim won the party primary, its leaders tried to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. On the eve of the party’s campaign launch, they cancelled Kim’s candidacy, only to reinstate him after party members opposed the move.\n\nBong, at Yonsei University, said the infighting as well as divisions in the conservative camp over Yoon’s decree has cost it support.\n\n“Kim Moon-soo has not set his position clearly on the martial law declaration,” Bong said. “He has not distanced himself from the legacy of Yoon, but at the same time, he has not made it clear whether he believes the declaration of martial law was a violation of the constitution. So the PPP has not really had enough energy to mobilise its support bases.”\n\nStill, Kim appears to have eroded what was a more than 20 percent point gap with Lee at the start of the campaign.\n\nBut he has failed to convince the third placed contender – Lee Jun-seok – to abandon his bid and back the PPP to improve its chances. The New Reform Party’s Lee, who is 40 years old, said on Tuesday there would be “no candidate merger” with “those responsible for the emergency martial law”.\n\nWhat about foreign policy?\n\nAlthough policy debates have taken a backseat, the outcome of the election could reorient South Korea’s approach towards North Korea. The two neighbours are technically in a state of war as the Korean War of 1950-1953 ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, and ties between them are at a new low.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for rewriting his country’s constitution to scrap the longstanding goal of unifying the war-divided nations and described Seoul as an “invariable principal enemy”. Pyongyang has also severed communication lines, and the two countries have clashed over balloons and drones carrying rubbish and propaganda.\n\nLee of the Democratic Party has promised to ease tensions if elected, including by restoring a military hotline, and committed to maintaining the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.\n\nKim, however, has backed Yoon’s hardline approach, promising to secure “pre-emptive deterrence” through tools such as ballistic missiles and the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons. He has said he would also seek a path for the country to pursue nuclear armament by securing the right to reprocess nuclear fuel, a key step towards building atomic weapons.\n\nThe two candidates also differ in their approach to the US, the country’s most important security ally, and to China, its biggest trading partner.\n\nLee, who espouses what he calls a pragmatic foreign policy, has said it is crucial to maintain South Korea’s alliance with the US and pursue security cooperation with Japan. However, he has pledged to prioritise “national interests” and said there’s “no need to unnecessarily antagonise China or Russia”.\n\nKim, meanwhile, has questioned Lee’s commitment to the US-South Korea alliance, and has promised to hold an immediate summit meeting with US President Donald Trump if elected to discuss tariffs.\n\n“I have a very friendly and trusting relationship,” with the US leader, Kim has said.\n\nHe has also indicated a willingness to discuss sharing more of the cost of stationing US troops in the country, something Trump has demanded for years.\n\nLee Sung-yoon, board member of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, described the policy differences between the rival camps as “immutable” and referred to earlier comments by the Democratic Party’s Lee, because of which some view him as being soft on China and Russia.\n\n“In the past, Lee has said South Korea should not get involved in China’s posture towards Taiwan, and just say thank you to both Beijing and Taiwan and stay out of the conflict. He has said of the trilateral defensive drills among US, Japan and South Korea as ‘a defence disaster’ and an ‘extremely pro-Japanese act’. And more than once he has said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy incited Russia to invade because he was a political novice who said unfortunate things.”\n\nThe analyst said Lee has – over the course of the election campaign – tried to walk back some of his statements in a bid to appeal to more moderate voters.\n\nHowever, “I would venture to guess that people sitting in the councils of power in Washington, DC, or Tokyo or in Kyiv, Ukraine, are not overly jubilant at the prospect of a Lee administration,” he said.\n\nWhen will we know the results?\n\nKoreans overseas have already cast their ballots, and early voting took place on Thursday and Friday. Large numbers of people turned out for the early vote, including the two frontrunners.\n\nAccording to the National Election Commission, some 44.4 million people in the country of 52 million are eligible to vote. On election day, which is a public holiday, polling stations will open at 6am (22:00 GMT) and close at 8pm (20:00 GMT).\n\nCounting will begin immediately and the winner will be known that evening or in the early hours of the following day. The candidate who receives the most votes will be deemed the winner, even if they don’t win 50 percent of the votes.","summary":"The vote, held in the backdrop of a martial law bid by ex-President Yoon Suk-yeol, could affect Seoul&#039;s foreign policy.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/31/south-koreas-snap-presidential-election-2025-all-you-need-to-know?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/s1-1748606843.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 23:26:26","author":"Apps Support,Zaheena Rasheed","authors":["Apps Support","Zaheena Rasheed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":326884534,"title":"Inside Dani Dyer and Jarrod Bowen's lavish wedding as bride stuns in £10,000 dress during 'Bridgerton-themed' ceremony","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jun 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Harry sought advice from Princess Diana's brother asking if he should change family name to Spencer\n\nPSG fans teargassed and cars set on FIRE as Champions League celebrations boil over following historic win over Inter Milan\n\nDavid Cameron was like a big MAN-BABY after the Brexit vote, says SARAH VINE in her new bombshell memoir.

The New York Times was lying their ass off.\"He added: \"I tried 'prescription' ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.\"Musk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump's main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants.News of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use. The daily recalled erratic behavior such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute last year.Musk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face.\"And he did.

Even those acronyms that do not directly reflect a specific trading strategy, still capture factors that traders say are important in Trump-era markets, such as volatility and uncertainty, that investors need to consider when making decisions.

With a limited number of aid trucks finally rolling into the ravaged enclave following an 11-week aid blockade, aid agencies have struggled to prevent looting.\n\nOvernight from Friday into Saturday, armed men hijacked dozens of aid trucks entering the Gaza Strip overnight and hundreds of desperate Palestinians joined in to take supplies, local aid groups said.\n\nThe United Nations said on Friday that the situation in Gaza is the worst since the start of the war began 19 months ago, with the entire population facing the risk of famine despite a resumption of limited aid deliveries earlier this month.\n\nOn Saturday, the Israeli military said it was continuing to hit targets in Gaza, including sniper posts and had killed what it said was the head of a Hamas weapons manufacturing site.\n\nIsraeli forces have cleared large areas of the Gaza Strip, squeezing the population of more than 2 million into an ever-narrower section along the coast and around the southern city of Khan Younis.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/hamas-agrees-release-10-living-182920800.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b49bb9f529dc17dce00768a0478af8a5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 23:13:08","author":"Alex Croft","authors":["Alex Croft"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":326884232,"title":"Hamas seeks amendments to Gaza ceasefire proposal but US envoy calls it 'unacceptable'","text":"TEL AVIV, Israel -- amas is seeking amendments to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior official with the group told The Associated Press on Saturday, but U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff called the Hamas response \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nThe latest friction in negotiations comes as the fighting nears 20 months of war, and as desperation grows among hungry Palestinians and relatives of hostages in Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks, said proposed amendments focused on \"the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\" There were no details.\n\nA separate Hamas statement said the proposal aims for a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an ensured flow of aid. It said 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others would be released \" in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners.\" Fifty-eight hostages remain and Israel believes 35 are dead.\n\nWitkoff on social media instead described a 60-day ceasefire deal that would free half the living hostages in Gaza and return half of those who have died. He urged Hamas to accept the framework proposal as the basis for talks that he said could begin next week.\n\nIsraeli officials have approved the U.S. proposal for a temporary ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump has said negotiators were nearing a deal.\n\nA top Hamas official, Bassem Naim, accused Israel of disagreeing with agreed-upon provisions and alleged a \"complete bias toward the other side\" that he said violates the fairness of mediation.\n\n\"We want the bloodshed to stop,\" Motasim, a man from the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, said of the talks. \"I swear to God, we are tired.\"\n\nDesperation rises inside Gaza\n\nPalestinians in Gaza blocked and offloaded 77 food trucks, the U.N. World Food Program said, as hunger mounts following Israel's monthslong blockade of the territory. The WFP said the aid, mostly flour, was taken before the trucks could reach their destination.\n\nA witness in the southern city of Khan Younis, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told the AP the U.N. convoy was stopped at a makeshift roadblock and offloaded by desperate civilians in their thousands.\n\nThe nearly three-month blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of over 2 million to the brink of famine. While Israel allowed some aid to enter in recent days, aid organizations say far from enough is getting in.\n\nIsrael's military body in charge of aid coordination in Gaza, COGAT, said 579 trucks of aid had entered over the past week. The U.N. has said 600 per day were entering under the previous ceasefire that Israel ended with new bombardment.\n\nThe WFP said the fear of starvation in Gaza is high. \"We need to flood communities with food for the next few days to calm anxieties,\" it said in a statement. It added that it has over 140,000 metric tons of food - enough to feed Gazans for two months - ready to be brought in.\n\nThe United Nations said earlier this month that Israeli authorities have forced them to use unsecured routes within areas controlled by Israel's military in the eastern areas of Rafah and Khan Younis, where armed gangs are active and trucks were stopped.\n\nAttacks, gangs and lack of protection hamper UN distribution\n\nAn internal document shared with aid groups about security incidents, seen by the AP, said there were four incidents of facilities being looted in three days at the end of May, not including Saturday's.\n\nThe U.N. says it has been unable to get enough aid in because of fighting.\n\nA new U.S- and Israeli-backed foundation started operations in Gaza this week, distributing food at several sites in a chaotic rollout.\n\nIsrael says the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation eventually will replace the aid operation by the U.N. and others. It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that significant diversion takes place.\n\nThe GHF works with armed contractors, which it says are needed to distribute food safely. Aid groups have accused the foundation of militarizing aid. The GHF said it distributed 30 truckloads of food on Saturday and called it their largest distribution so far.\n\nIsraeli strikes kill at least 60\n\nIsrael continued its military campaign across Gaza, saying it struck dozens of targets over the past day. Gaza's Health Ministry said at least 60 people were killed by Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe ministry said three people were killed by Israeli gunfire early Saturday in Rafah. Three others were killed - parents and a child - when their car was struck in Gaza City. An Israeli strike hit another car in Gaza City, killing four. And an Israeli strike hit a tent sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, killing six, said Weam Fares, a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital.\n\nIsrael's military said several projectiles from Gaza fell in open areas.\n\nThe war began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 250 hostages.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 54,000 Gaza residents, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally.\n\nA group of hostages' relatives again pleaded for a comprehensive ceasefire deal that would free everyone at once, saying the remaining hostages \"will not survive continued military pressure.\"\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.

France and Saudi Arabia have just surprised the world by announcing their plans to try and rekindle the just-about-completely extinguished flame of the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Like a desperate spurned lover stalking his old love even though his former beau has moved on, France and Saudi Arabia are desperately trying to stay relevant in an international dispute where they’re no longer involved and have little to contribute. Recently, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noël Barrot met with his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in Riyadh. Since Saudi Arabia hasn’t normalized relations with Israel, it could be assumed that Israel wouldn’t come up in conversation between these two ministers. Yet, despite all logic to the contrary, the focus of their talks was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its solutions. console.log(\"2390 BODY2.

This international conference, aptly held at the United Nations headquarters, a campus known for producing very little (other than hot air) will be focused on advancing the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To avoid international mockery over hosting a meaningless conference, Macron has announced he’s considering even recognizing a Palestinian state at the conference. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Jerusalem, October 24, 2023. (credit: REUTERS)In a recent statement criticizing Israel’s war efforts against Palestinian terrorists and Hamas in Gaza, the leaders of France, the United Kingdom, and Canada released a statement that ended, “We affirm the important role of the High-level Two-State Solution Conference at the UN in June in building international consensus around this aim. And we are committed to recognizing a Palestinian state as a contribution to achieving a two-state solution and are prepared to work with others to this end.”The conference will unveil a “Paris Declaration for Peace and Dual States,” promoting urgent actions: an immediate halt to hostilities in Gaza, the prompt and unconditional freeing of all captives, ongoing access to coordinated humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the Palestinian population, and the initiation of a swift international strategy for Gaza’s rebuilding, involving local, regional, and global partners. It almost sounds too good to be true. It has recently been reported by Israel Hayom that Ofer Bronchtein, an Israeli aide to Macron, has been spearheading the efforts to convene a conference to accelerate Palestinian statehood. Israel is worried that French and Saudi moves might be made without consulting Israel. There are numerous reasons pushing for a two-state solution is absurd, but the most critical reason is the lack of support for a two-state solution among Israelis and Palestinians. In a poll conducted last year by Khalil Shikaki, director of the well-respected Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research based in Ramallah, only 32% of Palestinians support a two-state solution. There are no reasons to think that support has risen since the poll was conducted. A survey conducted by the Council for a Secure America, a New York-based nonprofit, in February found that 64% of Israelis reject the concept of a two-state solution. President Isaac Herzog aptly explained Israeli sentiment regarding the two-state solution in light of the October 7 Palestinian massacre of Israelis, “What I want to urge is against just saying ‘two-state solution.’ Why? Because there is an emotional chapter here that must be dealt with. My nation is bereaved. My nation is in trauma.” Israeli and Palestinian leaders also oppose the two-state solution. In a statement published following a call with US president Joe Biden last year, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, “Israel categorically rejects international dictates regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. Israel will continue to oppose unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state.”Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, well-known for vacillating between supporting and opposing a two-state solution, usually offering different ideas depending on the language he’s talking in and the crowd he’s speaking to, has publicly admitted that he turned down a chance for a two-state peace deal with Israel that would have given him nearly all the land the Palestinians wanted.While Biden paid lip service to the two-state solution, frequently stating that it was the only way forward to solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he didn’t advance any policies or plans to bring it to fruition. He recognized that neither side had the will to achieve it. US President Donald Trump doesn’t consider the two-state solution the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He has said, “I support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms. I support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two-state, but I support whatever is necessary to get not just peace, [but] a lasting peace. It can’t go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.”As if desperately trying to rekindle the burned-out two-state solution didn’t seem impractical enough for France and Saudi Arabia, they also recently announced a plan to disarm Hamas but have it hold on to its political power and influence over the Gaza Strip. The goal is to turn the internationally recognized terror group – which has never even hinted it has an interest in reforming itself – into a political power in Gaza capable of governing Palestinians. Even Amnesty International, an organization that generally sides with Hamas’s concocted accusations against Israel, outlined Hamas’s human rights abuses against Palestinians it has governed in Gaza.“Hamas forces carried out a brutal campaign of abductions, torture, and unlawful killings against Palestinians accused of ‘collaborating’ with Israel and others.” Amnesty International has highlighted a series of abuses, such as the extrajudicial execution of Palestinians and the arrest and torture of others, including members and supporters of Hamas’s political rivals, Fatah. A plan to allow Hamas to retain its power in the Gaza Strip is ludicrous. France and Saudi Arabia can’t be blamed for wanting to stay relevant in the international diplomatic arena and using archaic ideas to try to claim some of the spotlight. Without Israeli, Palestinian, or American support for a two-state solution, hosting a conference that will advocate a two-state solution, elevating an internationally recognized terror group to a globally recognized governing political party, and unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state, seems not only absurd but desperate.

She spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, arguing her parents were convicted because they are conservatives.\n\nThe episode is the latest chapter in both the Republican Party’s close connections to reality TV and the strange obsession the right has with false reality.\n\nFor decades, conservative Americans have been growing less trustful of media that is not biased to their perspective. From that practice sprung cries of “fake news” and “liberal media.” But conservatives are often all too credulous when it comes to figures created by the reality TV industry, which purports to present the real world but is frequently scripted.\n\nBecause of this, the conservative movement regularly elevates these people from the screens in their living rooms into positions of high power and influence.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump is easily the most successful beneficiary of the reality-TV-to-Republican-politics pipeline. Known largely for tabloid feuds and serial affairs, Trump’s fame grew when NBC’s “The Apprentice” cast him as a powerful businessman. The entire thing was a put-on. Trump made more in licensing his name amid the show’s popularity than from his purported genius in real estate, but conservatives to this day tout him as a businessman who knows how to make deals.\n\nIn the presidency, he has failed to generate those deals and has more often seen key dealmaking opportunities slip through his fingers, from health care to infrastructure.\n\nSean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary, proudly lists his reality TV resume in his official biography on the Department of Transportation website.\n\nThe biography notes that Duffy got his TV start on MTV’s “The Real World,” then transitioned to “Road Rules All Stars,” where he met fellow contestant Rachel Campos-Duffy, now his wife and a Fox News personality. His department biography also clearly notes, “Rachel and Sean are America’s first and longest-married reality TV couple,” in case anyone was wondering.\n\nDuffy also used his TV credits as a springboard to a House seat in Wisconsin, which he held for 10 years, before returning to TV screens on Fox Business—until Trump called him up to serve in the Cabinet.\n\nThe Duggars\n\nThe Duggar family appeared for 10 seasons on TLC’s show “19 Kids and Counting,” featuring their large family. As conservative Christians, parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar were attached at the hip to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, endorsed his 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns, and “begged” him to run in 2012 as well.\n\nIn 2015, after allegations surfaced that their son Josh Duggar had molested underage girls, Huckabee voiced support for the family. In 2021, father Jim Bob Duggar ran on the GOP ticket in an Arkansas state Senate race. He lost—just a few days after Josh Duggar was convicted for possessing child sexual abuse material.\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman was one of the most well-known contestants with Trump’s “The Apprentice,” and by 2004, hot off being “fired” from the show, she said she was considering a run for Congress or the presidency. She never did that but was part of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, saying that his critics “will have to bow down” to him.\n\nBy 2017, she was a part of the Trump administration but was fired after about a year on the job. Newman then returned to TV on “Big Brother,” appearing on American and Australian spin-offs of the program.\n\nShe wrote a tell-all book about Trump, released secretly recorded audio tapes of Trump, and was rewarded a settlement after Trump’s campaign sued her.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\n\nA former Olympian decathlete, Caitlyn Jenner is more recently known for appearing on “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” with her ex-wife Kris Kardashian. Jenner used that television fame to become a Republican activist and even unsuccessfully ran in the 2021 election to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nJenner, a transgender woman, has been open and enthusiastic about her support for Trump, who has tried to roll back equal rights for transgender people. After Trump won in 2024 on a campaign smearing transgender people, she wrote on Instagram, “Thank God the American people have spoken.”\n\nAntonio Sabàto Jr.\n\nFormer Calvin Klein model and “General Hospital” star Antonio Sabàto Jr. is a reality TV veteran. Among his credits are “But Can They Sing?”, “Celebrity Circus,” “My Antonio,” and even “Celebrity Wife Swap” On the latter program, he “swapped” wives with former WWE wrestler Mick Foley, which led to an on-air argument with his then-fiance, Cheryl Nunes.\n\nBy 2016, Sabàto was stumping for Trump, even speaking on his behalf at the Republican National Convention. Sabàto tried to keep the momentum going by running for Congress in 2018 but was crushed by 18 percentage points in his race against Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley in California.\n\n“Duck Dynasty”\n\nThe Robertson family appeared on A&E’s “Duck Dynasty” for five years as the series explored their lives and fortunes made from selling products for duck hunters. Members of the family were a constant presence on Fox News, promoting their right-wing Christian views.\n\nIn 2014, the patriarch of the family, Phil Robertson, was being recruited to run for the Republicans as a Senate candidate in Louisiana. He declined. His son Willie Robertson spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention as part of the process to nominate Trump as the party’s presidential candidate.\n\nThe GOP’s embrace of reality TV personalities is ironic, considering the party has often attacked Democrats for their close affiliation with actors, actresses, and other Hollywood creatives. In the 2008 presidential election, Republican nominee John McCain even produced ads chiding then-Sen. Barack Obama for being a celebrity and compared him with reality TV star Paris Hilton.\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nRepublicans love their D-list stars, compared with well-known A-listers who largely back the Democratic Party. Stars like Tom Hanks and Julia Louis-Dreyfus carry considerably more cultural cachet than the “Duck Dynasty” cast, for instance.\n\nIf anything, the political success of Trump should probably be taken as a warning sign for the right. Trump isn’t good at being president, and the public doesn’t like him. And much of that can be attributed to the fact that he truly lived in reality for a long time, instead reveling in the fake world of “The Apprentice,” where he was falsely depicted as a savvy businessman.\n\nStill, the right still seems to have a hearty appetite for boosting whoever comes next off of the reality TV assembly line, and some of the future leaders of the Republican Party are very likely starring in a show or two right now.","summary":"This past week, President Donald Trump pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, the former stars of USA Network’s reality show “Chrisley Knows Best.”\n\n\n\nThe Chrisleys were convicted in 2022 on multiple counts of financial fraud and tax evasion, but the jury’s decision meant little to Trump, who was lobbied on the issue by the couple’s daughter Savannah Chrisley.

Email p.thirunimalan@dailymail.co.uk \nBy STEWART WHITTINGHAM and PIRIYANGA THIRUNIMALAN \n Published:23:52 BST, 31 May 2025 |Updated:23:52 BST, 31 May 2025 \n\nThere is nothing remotely out of the ordinary about Angela Lloyd and Lee Phillips' semi-detached house on a quiet cul-de-sac in Merseyside.\nAnd to the common eye, Lloyd looks like a normal middle-aged mum who works tirelessly to care for her sick husband.\nSo it was to the sheer shock of neighbours when police descended on their driveway to raid the couple's St Helens home.\nHiding behind the family's net curtains was in fact a decade-long web of lies which saw Lloyd and Phillips pocket £270k in taxpayer money.\nMother-of-two Lloyd, 58, cried 'Oh my god' as she was jailed this week over a string of untruths including using a dead woman's identity, making up 'bogus' medical conditions for her son, and creating pseudonyms to work while claiming carers allowance.\nHusband Phillips, 54, was also jailed after the pair's massive benefits fraud was finally exposed.\nWhile the couple managed to siphon off their ill-gotten gains for years - neighbours have revealed to MailOnline the obvious clues that the couple were running a scam. \n\nMother-of-two Angela Lloyd defrauded the taxpayer of £170k over a period of 11-and-a-half years. Detectives uncovered a web of lies including the creation of pseudonyms to claim benefits\n\nThe fraudster next door: The assuming semi-detached house Lloyd had moved into with Phillips. Phillips had failed to disclose this to the council when she moved in in 2018\n\nPhillips pictured in a Help for Heroes hoodie during a street party held for the late Queen's Diamond Jubilee. He is said to have played a DJ set at the event\nInitially, neighbours on Birch Gardens were worried for the couple after Phillips was seen looking very frail as he would 'hobble' on his walking stick to meet his carers.\nBut they were then left puzzled when he was at other times spotted washing his BMW, driving, and even playing a DJ set for their street party for the late Queen's Diamond Jubilee.\nLocals also told of how there was 'always something dodgy' about Lloyd, and that she would never look people 'in the eye', but would boast about 'secret £60k caravan' they would escape to on the weekends.\nLloyd was sentenced to two years after Liverpool Crown Court found she fraudulently pocketed nearly £170,000 in benefits over a decade, and also helped Phillips falsely claim benefits worth £100,000, as reported by the Liverpool Echo.\nWhen neighbours saw them packing up one of their two cars earlier this week, they thought they were going off to stay at their secret caravan, only to find they were going to jail. \nOne neighbour told MailOnline of the couple: 'I thought they were dodgy as he made a real show of not being able to walk whenever his carers were here.\n'He was shuffling along and holding onto his cars in the driveway before he took a long time to get to his carer's car on his walking stick.\n'But the next thing I saw him washing his BMW in the driveway - he seemed to be walking fine then.\n'And he did a DJ set for the Queen's Jubilee party back in 2022. He had all the speakers out and everything.\n'But after the police raid, they became more reserved and didn't say a lot to people.\n'There was always something dodgy about her - she wouldn't look people in the eye and bragged about going to her £60,000 caravan but would never say where it was.\n'They would take her teenage son and go away on a Thursday night and not come home until Sunday.'\n\nPhillips had fraudulently claimed £100k in PIP, housing benefits, employment support allowance and council tax reductions that he was not eligible for. Neighbours told of how he would look 'frail' and 'hobble on a walking stick' in the presence of carers, but at other times was seen 'walking fine'\nFollowing the police raid on the quiet suburban street, neighbours were left with questions as to why the couple had been arrested - and some allege Lloyd had later told them it was down to dog breeding.\nBut these questions were finally put to rest on Tuesday when the court heard how Lloyd had claimed a total of £169,394.15 which she was not qualified for in housing benefits, carers allowance and personal independence payments over the course of 11-and-a-half years.\nWith the help of Lloyd, Phillips was also found to have illegally claimed £100,980.71 through PIP, housing benefits, employment support allowance and council tax reductions since 2018.\nOlivia Beesley, prosecuting, outlined how the mother-of-two's elaborate scam began when she falsely began claiming housing benefits for a caravan on Riverside Walk in Southport - which was found to be a 'fictitious address'. \nShe even made a fake tenancy agreement for the 'entirely fictitious caravan', ultimately pocketing £71,597.16 from Lancashire Borough Council in relation to the non-existent residence.\nThen in 2018, she began making fraudulent claims that her husband needed 'multiple daily carers to attend to his needs'. She went as far as using Phillips' sister Zoe's birth certificate to pose as his sibling and claim that she was his main carer.\nShe also lied that she was unable to work due to being a full-time carer, but was found to have been working under a false identity Wendy Lloyd at care company Hand in Hand Homecare, and under another pseudonym Angela Valentine at a Tesco.\nIn 2022, she began inventing 'false medical conditions' for her son, claiming she had a carer called Joyce Bibby - a dead woman's identity. Nearly £10k in false disability living allowance overpayments were claimed in relation to this.\nShe again used the deceased woman's name as being her social worker to claim £13,526.70 of PIP, stating that she needed carers due to 'health conditions'.\n\nNeighbours told of how Lloyd would boast about a '£60k caravan' in a secret location that she never revealed, and would say they were going to stay at the caravan from Thursday to Sunday\n\nOne neighbour said they saw the couple packing up on of their cars earlier this week and assumed they were going off to their 'caravan', only to later find out they were off to jail\nWhen MailOnline visited Phillips' address in Birch Gardens which he shared with Lloyd, neighbours revealed how the couple and her son would supposedly go off to a caravan on the weekends.\nIt is not known whether this was the same 'fictitious caravan' which transpired to have never existed, or a indeed a separate, real caravan.\nLeni Newton, 63, said: 'She told people that the police raid was because someone had told on her for breeding border collie puppies without a licence.\n'I'm shocked they've been jailed. I thought they were all above board.\n'I only saw them a few days ago packing up suitcases - I thought they were just going to their caravan.'\nShe added: 'I know they met as she was his carer. He was married but Angela moved in. I thought she had lived in Southport.\n'I did see his ex-wife parked up in the street watching his house when they split.\n'She was obviously spying on them.'\nHer partner David Manchester, 70, said: 'It's a big surprise they seemed to be living a double life.\n'There were a lot of police came here. \n'He was at the street party for the Queen but other times he did seem very frail.'\nHand in Hand homecare agency confirmed to MailOnline that Lloyd had bona fide references, DBS checks and training certificates in the name of Wendy Lloyd.\nA spokesman said: 'We sacked her immediately when we found out the truth.\n'All her DBS and references checked out. The police said we had done nothing wrong.'\nThe court heard how Phillips also swindled money from the public purse by failing to disclose the fact that Lloyd had moved into his home in 2018 - allowing him to continue claiming more than £13k in housing benefits and £2.2k in council tax reductions.\nHe is also said to have 'exaggerated' his medical conditions and need for care, stating that he was unable to do anything for himself.\nHe declared himself 'unfit for work' and failed to mention his wife's wage - illegally pocketing £51k in employment support allowance.\nHowever, Phillips alleged that Lloyd had completed the form and had just 'asked him to sign it'.\nPhillips' counsel Jim Smith argued he has a 'complex recent history' of mental health and disabilities including neurological disorder, anxiety and depression. \nHe was also said to have a pacemaker fitted and appeared in court in a wheelchair.\nWhile Phillips had no previous convictions relating to similar matters, however Lloyd's criminal record shows previous entries for theft and dishonesty offences dating as far back as the 1980s - though her last appearance was in 2012.\nLloyd was jailed for two years after admitting seven counts of fraud by false representation, and Phillips was also seen wiping back tears as he was jailed for 20 months for fraud by false representation and three counts of dishonestly failing to disclose information to make a gain.\nSentencing, Judge Simon Medland KC said: 'Over an 11-year period, or more than that, you, Angela Lloyd, managed to defraud the public of just short of £170,000 and you, Lee Phillips, of about £100,000. In your case, Mr Phillips, over a five-year period, you had about £20,000 per year which you defrauded from the public.\n'For those who seek to defraud the public of scarce and valuable benefits which need to be directed to those who need them, not those who simply wish to have them for reasons of personal greed, that is a serious offence committed by each of you over a long period of time.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe fraudster next door: How woman posed as ordinary housewife living in boring suburban cul-de-sac… but was running secret £270k benefits scam for a DECADE\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Musk denies damning report","text":"Elon Musk on Saturday denied a report that he used ketamine and other drugs extensively last year on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday that the billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump used so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that he developed bladder problems.\n\nThe newspaper said the world's richest person also took ecstasy and mushrooms and traveled with a pill box last year, adding that it was not known whether Musk also took drugs while heading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump took power in January.\n\nIn a post Saturday on X, Musk said: \"To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.\"\n\nHe added: \"I tried 'prescription' ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.\"\n\nMusk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump's main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants.\n\nNews of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use. The daily recalled erratic behavior such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute last year.\n\nMusk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face.\n\n\"And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually is...\" he added, before tailing off.\n\nLater Friday, when a reporter asked Trump if he was aware of Musk's \"regular drug use,\" Trump responded: \"I wasn't.\"\n\n\"I think Elon is a fantastic guy,\" he added.\n\nMusk has previously admitted to taking ketamine, saying he was prescribed it to treat a \"negative frame of mind\" and suggesting his use of drugs benefited his work.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"Elon Musk on Saturday denied a report that he used ketamine and other drugs extensively last year on the 2024 campaign trail.

During a heated altercation with officials during the Wings' loss to the Chicago Sky Thursday, security guards approached as Carrington became increasingly demonstrative. One security guard even got between Carrington and an official. The official backed away from Carrington while pulling the security guard by his shirt in front of Carrington for protection. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Carrington responded to the incident in a post on X Friday, suggesting the summoning of security was a \"microaggression.\" \"Security… when I’m literally having a civil conversation is insane. Mind you, he called the \"sEcUrItY\" over there…\" Carrington wrote over a clip of the incident with a misspelled \"microaggression\" hashtag. Fox News Digital has reached out to the WNBA and the Sky for comment. DIJONAI CARRINGTON, CAITLIN CLARK'S TEAMMATE APPEAR TO JOKE ABOUT INFAMOUS EYE-POKING INCIDENT Former Dallas Wings player Cheryl Swoopes also spoke out against the referee who summoned security in a post on X. \"If this man was scared (of what, I don't know) and needed security, he should NEVER be able to ref again! This can't be real!\" Swoopes wrote. Carrington became a controversial figure in the WNBA last season. As a member of Connecticut Sun in 2024, Carrington gave Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark a black eye after poking her during a game in the first round of the playoffs in September. Carrington laughed with teammate Marina Mabrey after the incident. Carrington has said she didn't intentionally poke Clark in the eye and that she wasn't laughing about the incident. However, she appeared to make light of the controversy over Clark's black eye in an Instagram Live video in October. In the video, Carrington and her girlfriend, NaLyssa Smith, who plays for the Indiana Fever with Clark, were in their kitchen when Smith poked Carrington in the eye. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Ow, you poked me in the eye,\" Carrington said. Smith apologized, and the two laughed. \"Did you do it on purpose?\" Carrington asked. During the \"Unrivaled\" league season in January, Carrington wore a shirt that said, \"The F--- Donald Trump Tour\" while walking into Wayfair Arena in Miami, Florida.

She has drawn backlash from moderate Democrats and Republicans alike since she surged onto the national stage after an upset primary victory against a powerful incumbent Democrat in 2018.The New York progressive has embraced the Democratic socialist label, despite pushback from within her own party. Recently, she has traveled around the country holding massive rallies with progressive Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, with the duo turning out thousands—including in conservative districts and states.What to KnowNew polling released Friday by AtlasIntel—which has been described by election analyst Nate Silver as \"top-rated,\" and was described as the most accurate pollster of the 2024 and 2020 elections—showed Ocasio-Cortez ranked third among politicians included in the survey, in terms of Americans who had a positive view of her. The congresswoman was also one of just three political leaders with an overall net positive image.The New York Democrat was viewed positively by 46 percent of respondents, compared to 44 percent that viewed her negatively—meaning her net positive rating was above water by 2 points. An additional 10 percent of respondents said they didn't know.Only former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama ranked higher than the congresswoman. Barack Obama was viewed positively by 53 percent compared to 43 percent who viewed him negatively. Michelle Obama was 49 percent positive and 45 percent negative.Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez was ahead of Trump and Harris, as well as Vice President JD Vance and former President Joe Biden. Trump was viewed positively by 44 percent, Vance by 42 percent, Harris by 42 percent and Biden by 37 percent. Respectively the politicians were viewed negatively by 55 percent, 56 percent, 52 percent and 55 percent.The poll included 3,469 respondents and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points at a 95 percent confidence level. It was carried out from May 21 through May 27.Speculation has swirled in recent months about Ocasio-Cortez's political future, especially as she has rallied with Sanders across the country. Many have urged her to consider challenging Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, in the 2028 primary, while others see her as a strong Democratic presidential contender.What People Are SayingRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Fox News in April when asked about her future plans: \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important.\"D. Stephen Voss, political science professor at the University of Kentucky, previously told Newsweek via email: \"AOC serves as the face of the Democratic Party for many Trump supporters who dislike national Democrats. They like to pillory her as ignorant and irresponsible.\"Voss continued: \"At the same time, many Democrats embrace AOC as a worthy young successor to Bernie, someone who can play the role of progressive challenger in a Democratic nomination battle.\"Monica Crowley, a former official in the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, told Fox News last November: \"Just a word of warning to the Republicans, to my party: Do not underestimate AOC. She's young, she's vibrant, she's attractive.\"What Happens Next?Ocasio-Cortez's future political moves remain to be seen. For the time being, she has said she aims to focus on fighting back against the Trump administration.","summary":"The New York progressive ranked third among politicians included in the survey, just behind the Obamas.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aoc-viewed-positively-more-americans-trump-harris-poll-2079414","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2654651/alexandria-ocasio-cortez.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:31:49","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.224},{"id":326881070,"title":"Trump says Pakistani officials visiting US to negotiate trade deal ahead of potential 29% tariff","text":"Pakistani officials will be visiting the U.S. next week in an effort to reach a deal to lower tariffs imposed against the Asian country, President Donald Trump said on Friday.\n\nPakistan faces a potential 29% tariff on its exports to America because of a $3 billion trade surplus with the U.S., following the tariffs Trump announced last month against countries around the world.\n\nTrump noted that he would have no interest in making a deal with Pakistan or its neighbor, India, if they were to reignite a war with each other.\n\nThe two countries were involved in a conflict for four days earlier this month, using fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery to conduct their worst fighting in decades.\n\n“As you know, we’re very close to making a deal with India,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews on Friday after departing Air Force One.\n\nIndian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides seeking to sign an interim agreement by early July.\n\nTrump has imposed a 26% tariff on India’s shipments to the U.S.\n\nIndia is likely to allow U.S. firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with the Trump administration.\n\nReuters contributed to this report.","summary":"Pakistani officials will be visiting the U.S. next week in an effort to reach a deal to lower tariffs imposed against the Asian country, President Donald Trump said on Friday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/31/business/trump-says-pakistani-officials-visiting-us-to-negotiate-trade-deal-ahead-of-potential-29-tariff/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105652093.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LjX77EBI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:31:06","author":"Fox Business","authors":["Fox Business"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":326885506,"title":"Joni Ernst Issues Non-Apology for Joke About People Dying Due to GOP Medicaid Cuts","text":"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) doubled down on Saturday on her flippant remarks about people dying due to Medicaid cuts in a new Instagram video that appeared to be recorded in a cemetery. \n\n During a town hall on Friday, Ernst was pressed about President Donald Trump’s tax bill, which would slash Medicaid in order to help fund a new round of tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. The legislation is expected to force 10 million people off Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. \n\n When an audience member shouted, “People are going to die,” Ernst responded: “Well, we all are going to die.” Her unfunny joke drew headlines around the country, and was featured prominently on the front page of The Des Moines Register on Saturday.\n\n In a video posted on her Instagram story on Saturday, Ernst, who is up for reelection next year, decided it was wise to mock her constituents who do not wish to die due to a lack of health insurance. \n\n “Hello, everyone. I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall,” she says in the clip, which features gravestones in the distance behind her. “See, I was in the process of answering a question that had been asked by an audience member, when a woman who was extremely distraught, screamed out from the back corner of the auditorium, ‘People are going to die.’ And I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth.”\n\n “So I apologize,” Ernst concludes, “and I’m really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the Tooth Fairy as well. But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”\n\n Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin said in a statement Saturday, “Thoughts and prayers have a new meaning for the Republican Party with Joni Ernst doubling down on her cruel words. It is immoral and un-Christian to do nothing to prevent people from dying but unfortunately, Trump, Ernst, and the Republican Party are hellbent on putting their own constituents at risk.”\n\n Ernst had tried to defend the Medicaid cuts on Friday as necessary to ensure that undocumented immigrants are not on Medicaid. It’s a favorite Republican talking point, but this is a blatant lie: Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid. Of the 10 million Americans who are expected to lose Medicaid under the Republican tax bill, none of them are undocumented immigrants. \n\n The Trump tax bill would force millions off Medicaid by imposing work requirements on so-called “able-bodied” adults, demanding they work or volunteer at least 80 hours a month. One problem with this idea is that many Medicaid recipients cannot work but have not been approved for disability benefits, which is an onerous process. Those beneficiaries will lose their insurance.\n\n The Medicaid program also contains strict income caps that require beneficiaries to earn exceedingly little money. Taken together, Republicans are effectively demanding that Medicaid recipients work low-income jobs in order to maintain their health insurance, and the added bureaucracy will certainly result in many eligible beneficiaries losing coverage. \n\n Ernst pledged Friday that the Republicans are “going to focus on those that are most vulnerable,” adding that “Medicaid is extremely important here in the state of Iowa.”\n\n Ernst made a post on X thanking people for coming to her town hall. “I always enjoy hearing from constituents and sharing my work to cut government red tape for you,” she wrote. The post has 270 likes and 2,000 comments.","summary":"If her constituents don’t want to die when Republicans cut Medicaid, Iowa Sen.

Noem had announced the arrest of 54-year-old Ramon Morales Reyes, alleging he had sent a letter vowing to shoot Trump and then flee to Mexico. The letter, shared by Noem and later highlighted by the White House and Trump allies on social media, was written in light blue ink and appeared to express fury over immigration policies. However, a person familiar with the investigation told the AP that authorities now believe Morales Reyes did not write the letter. Instead, law enforcement suspected that he was framed, possibly to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial in which he is listed as a victim of assault. The source said that the handwritten threat did not match Morales Reyes' writing style after which officials concluded that the threat was not credible. Despite this, the department of homeland security issued a statement naming Morales Reyes as the author and describing him as a threat, a move that has drawn criticism and confusion. The department has since said the investigation remains “ongoing,” and that Reyes is in the country illegally and has a criminal record. His legal team disputed those claims, saying he is not currently facing any charges and has no knowledge of past convictions. “There is really no way that it could be even remotely true,” said Kime Abduli, Morales Reyes’ immigration lawyer. “We're asking for a clarification and a correction from DHS to clear Ramon’s name of anything having to do with this.” Morales Reyes, a dishwasher in Milwaukee, was arrested on 21 May and is currently being held at a county jail in Juneau, Wisconsin. He lives with his wife and three children and had recently applied for a U visa, which offers protection to undocumented immigrants who have been victims of serious crimes. The immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera has called for his release, and Morales Reyes is expected to appear before a Chicago immigration court next week for a bond hearing. Meanwhile, Milwaukee police have launched a separate investigation into possible identity theft and witness intimidation in connection with the case. The local district attorney’s office confirmed the matter is under active review. Morales Reyes had been due to testify in a July trial involving a man accused of assaulting him, a case that may now be further complicated by his sudden detention.","summary":"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's claim about Ramon Morales Reyes threatening President Trump is now questioned, with evidence suggesting he was framed to force deportation.

One possibility would be to turn the briefings into videos styled after Fox News, four sources told the outlet in its report published Saturday. The President’s Daily Brief, or PDB, is currently a daily digital document containing text, graphics, and images. In order to carry out this new approach, the national intelligence director’s office could even hire one of Fox News’ talking heads and one of the network’s producers. Gabbard herself was a paid contributor to the network. \n\n Trump has received the PDB, which can influence the president’s decisions, just 14 times since he took office, according to his public schedule. During his first administration, the PDB was changed to a one-page outline that included less writing and more pictures, and was presented verbally. He received the briefing 55 times during this same period in 2017. President Joe Biden had received 90 PDBs by this time.\n\n According to the sources, Gabbard thinks Trump’s infrequency could be because of his distrust of intelligence officials, but also because he consumes media differently than how the PDB is formatted. Fox News has been his favorite news source, at least since his first administration. \n\n “The problem with Trump is that he doesn’t read,” a source said. “He’s on broadcast all the time.”\n\n Another idea for the PDB would be to include graphics and maps with animations of exploding bombs “similar to a video game,” per NBC News’ report.\n\n Getting Trump to welcome the PDB “is a very uphill fight” because of his distrust of the intelligence community, one source told the outlet.\n\n Gabbard’s office denied the story. “This so-called ‘reporting’ is laughable, absurd, and flat-out false. In true fake news fashion, NBC is publishing yet another anonymously sourced false story,” Olivia Coleman, the press secretary for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said in a statement to NBC News. \n\n The story is “libelous garbage from unnamed sources,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle told the outlet, adding: “President Trump has assembled a world-class intelligence team who he is constantly communicating with and receiving real time updates on all pressing national security issues. Ensuring the safety and security of the American people is President Trump’s number one priority.”\n\n Gabbard has also considered shifting the PDB to focus on topics that Trump is more interested in, like economics and trade, and less on the war in Ukraine, three sources said. \n\n “You shift with the priorities of the administration,” one source told NBC News.\n\n Earlier this month, Gabbard changed who prepared the PDB, giving her more control over it, PBS News reported. She also fired two top National Intelligence Council officials after the NIC said in a report that the Venezuelan government was not sending Tren de Aragua gang members to the U.S., contradicting Trump’s claims.\n\n “Absent evidence to justify the firings, the workforce can only conclude that their jobs are contingent on producing analysis that is aligned with the President’s political agenda, rather than truthful and apolitical,” Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. \n\n A CIA report published in 2021 outlined the struggles of briefing Trump during his first administration. “Briefing Trump presented the IC with the most difficult challenges it had ever faced,” wrote retired intelligence officer John L. Helgerson. Trump, he said, “doubted the competence of intelligence professionals and felt no need for regular intelligence support.”\n\n At the time, Trump was also not prone to receiving the PDB. “He touched it,” said Ted Gistaro, a CIA analyst who frequently briefed Trump, said in 2021. “He doesn’t really read anything.”","summary":"Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard is reportedly trying to find ways to update the president’s briefs","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-intelligence-briefings-tulsi-gabbard-revamp-report-1235352089/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TrumpGabbard-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:20:41","author":"Althea Legaspi,Naomi Lachance","authors":["Althea Legaspi","Naomi Lachance"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0},{"id":326881980,"title":"Move Over FAANG, Enter the TACO Trade: This Monster ETF Could Be Poised to Take Off","text":"Over the last couple of months, there has been one word largely dictating the direction of the stock market: tariffs.\n\nFor the first time in nearly two years, artificial intelligence seems to have been replaced by tariffs as the buzzword on every investor's lips following President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements on April 2.\n\nSince then, investors have been bombarded with a flurry of headlines and reports of negotiations with major trade partners such as the E.U. and China. Meanwhile, industry experts have tried to analyze the industries and product groups most vulnerable to the new tariffs.\n\nIn the wake of these developments, a new market strategy has been making the rounds on Wall Street as well: the \"TACO\" trade. Let's understand what this acronym means, and more importantly, explore how investors can take advantage of it.\n\nWhat is the TACO trade?\n\nLet's start with the basics. TACO is an acronym that stands for \"Trump always chickens out.\" But what does this actually mean?\n\nPer the nifty chart below, a clear pattern emerges every time Trump announces new tariffs and subsequently pulls back on these policies.\n\nThere's a new trade on Wall Street called the \"TACO trade.\" pic.twitter.com/NArOVyh9q1\n-- Brew Markets (@brewmarkets) May 28, 2025\n\nRatcheting up the tariff rhetoric has consistently sent the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average into a tailspin. However, whenever President Trump has chosen to reverse course, stocks begin to rebound as you can see in the S&P 500 chart above.\n\nSaid another way, every time Trump feels the pressure and \"chickens out,\" per se, on his most severe trade policies, investors quickly buy up stocks again. Thus, the TACO trade is essentially another way of saying \"buy the dip.\"\n\nThis ETF looks primed to thrive in a TACO trade\n\nThe pattern described above reflects how stocks have broadly rebounded over the last several weeks as new trade deals materialize. That said, many of these tariff negotiations are still ongoing, and details could change overnight, so investors should look for diversified opportunities as opposed to honing in on an individual sector.\n\nOne of the best examples of such an opportunity is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO 0.04%). This monster ETF is built to mimic the performance of the S&P 500, and it's the largest of its kind with over $650 billion in assets under management. Owning the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides passive exposure to the stock market's biggest companies across a variety of industries.\n\nMoreover, the ETF is weighted by market cap, meaning giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Eli Lilly contribute more to the fund's performance.\n\nData by YCharts.\n\nThe chart above illustrates the total return for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF since its inception. I've also annotated U.S. recessions, which are marked by the grey shaded columns.\n\nThe big takeaway here is that despite economic slowdowns, the S&P 500 has remained quite resilient. Stock prices generally rise over long time horizons, and investing in the S&P 500 remains a simple, winning strategy.\n\nWhy now is the time to pounce\n\nWhile the TACO trade suggests timing the market by investing when Trump ratchets up his tariff rhetoric, the most prudent strategy is to buy into the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF at regular intervals. This practice is known as dollar-cost averaging, and it can mitigate risk by lowering your average cost per share, reducing the impact of short-term volatility, and encouraging consistent investing.\n\nBased on this year's choppy results, in combination with the long-run performance of the S&P 500, carving out a portion of your portfolio for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF remains a solid move, regardless of what Wall Street has to say about the TACO trade.","summary":"Wall Street is abuzz with the TACO trade right now.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/31/move-over-faang-enter-the-taco-trade-this-monster/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F820018%2Fgettyimages-509051302-1.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:20:00","author":"Adam Spatacco","authors":["Adam Spatacco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.031},{"id":326882082,"title":"Avowed Diddy Hater 50 Cent Says He’ll Reach Out to Trump to Stop Pardon Consideration ‘So He Knows How I Feel’","text":"Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, aka one of Diddy’s most prolific haters, plans to reach out to Donald Trump in light of the president’s comment that he would consider pardoning Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs for his alleged crimes. \n\n“He said some really bad things about Trump, it’s not ok.

Following the backlash, the administration announced an increase in the number of seasonal workers.\n\nBut can those temporary workers handle the attention kicked up by competition between the parks? Ranking America's national parks has become something of a cottage industry. Travel websites, magazines and organizations have taken to publishing lists ranking parks from best to worst, and touting niche aspects.\n\nWinter at El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park.

What’s the most visited park? That continues to be the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It had 12,191,834 visits in 2024.\n\nNext is Zion National Park with 4,946,592 visits and Grand Canyon National Park with 4,919,163 visits. The top ten list also includes Yellowstone (4,744,353), Rocky Mountain National Park (4,154,349), Yosemite (4,121,807), Acadia (3,961,661), Olympic (3,717,267), Grand Teton (3,628,222) and Glacier National Park (3,208,755).\n\nTravel publications create their own rankings by factoring in criteria that appeal to visitors. Those rankings include such considerations as accessibility, natural beauty, scenic diversity, hiking opportunities, the best wildlife viewing (and what kind of wildlife) and an overall range of activities offered.\n\n‘Instagrammable’ National Parks Are Favored\n\nSocial media has largely fueled the ranking trend. Parks that are “Instagrammable” often get inordinate attention because of their striking beauty alone, when other variables can figure into what can make a national park desirable.\n\nBackpacker hiking across a river in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nNumerous travel blogs rank national parks. The blog, “Trip Of A Lifestyle” figured in three factors: “Wow Factor,” “Fun Factor” and “Crowd Factor.” Lauren and Steven Keys visited and photographed all the national parks before ranking them. After “months of nonstop travel and dozens of hours of debate,” according to their blog, they came up with a definitive personal list.\n\nThe Keys concluded that seven national parks tie for first place: Death Valley (the hottest place on Earth, but otherworldly in feel), Yosemite, Hawai’i Volcanoes, Yellowstone, American Samoa (one drawback mentioned: “there are feral dogs everywhere on the island”), Carlsbad Caverns (noted for its massive underground caves and magnificent formations) and Canyonlands, which the couple term, “one of the best-kept secrets of the National Park system.”\n\nSome National Parks Are “Really Boring,” Say Travel Bloggers\n\nTravel blogger Lee Abbamonte has ranked all 63 of the parks based on his tastes and experience. Yosemite tops his list. “Yosemite is big, it has iconic hikes like Half Dome, and it has amazing waterfalls, trees and vistas,” writes Abbamonte on his blog. “Tunnel View at sunset is the single most beautiful view in America when Half Dome turns orange at the top.”\n\nHot Springs National Park in Arkansas, with its thermal springs, hiking trails and nine historical bathhouses, was at the bottom of Abbamonte’s list. He found the park “really boring, uninteresting and I don’t understand why it’s a national park in the first place.”\n\nThe Quapaw Baths on Bathhouse Row in Hot Springs National Park, in Hot Springs, Ark.

Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve recorded only 11,907 visits in 2024, no doubt partly because of its remote north Alaska location.\n\nSuch remote parks, however, are ranked higher by wilderness groups, which value their unspoiled nature, no matter how hard it might be to actually reach them.\n\nForbes has ranked national parks based on crowd size, an increasingly crucial factor given rising popularity.

In March, the non-profit National Parks Association launched its “World’s Best National Parks,” a year-long campaign that allows the public to vote on favorites. Campaign dates are March 18, 2025, through June 11, 2028. Website visitors can vote for one park per country per day. There are three phases to the campaign:\n\nPhase one: votes will determine the best national park among countries, and parks with the most votes will advance to phase two. Phase one runs through March 17, 2026.\n\nDuring phase two, each country’s leading parks will compete within their own continents. The voting runs from March 18, 2026, to March 17, 2027.\n\nPhase three pits the top continental parks against each other in a competition to capture the title of the “World’s Best National Park.” The voting runs from March 18, 2027 to June 11, 2028.\n\nYosemite National Park currently leads the race, followed by Mkomazi National Park in northeastern Tanzania and Kruger National Park in northeastern South Africa.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"America’s national parks are battling for visitors through travel blogger rankings and social media fame—just as Trump’s budget cuts threaten their survival.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rdaniel-foster/2025/05/31/national-parks-battle-for-bragging-rights/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/683b53046a3c9b39fd51c4be/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:15:43","author":"Contributor,R.

The president wants to overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and speed up the development of new nuclear power reactors in the country. The order could power a resurgence in the sector. \n\nNuScale Power (SMR -2.37%), Constellation Energy (CEG 1.01%), and Cameco (CCJ -1.08%) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as nuclear energy stocks that could benefit from the industry's renaissance. Here's a closer look at why they could produce powerful returns for investors if the nuclear energy sector's resurgence gains steam.\n\nNuScale Power has a new power model to offer\n\nReuben Gregg Brewer (NuScale Power): When President Donald Trump signed an executive order that will help to speed up the adoption of nuclear power in the United States, NuScale Power's stock rallied. A lot of nuclear power stocks did the same, but NuScale's rally brought the shares back up to all-time highs.\n\nSMR data by YCharts\n\nThere's both risk and opportunity here. NuScale Power's price advance is being driven by emotions, since the company doesn't technically have a product to sell just yet. But the small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) it is attempting to build are a very exciting advance in nuclear power.\n\nSMRs are built in a factory, which makes them cheaper, easier, and quicker to build than large, site-built nuclear power plants. Their small size also means they can be transported to where they are needed and placed closer to population centers. The inclusion of modern safeguards, meanwhile, reduces the risk of a high-profile meltdown.\n\nIf NuScale Power can start selling its SMRs, it has a huge opportunity ahead of it as nuclear power demand increases. The most exciting thing here, however, is that the big turning point for the business is likely to take shape later in 2025. That's when RoPower, a Romanian power company, will make the final call on whether it will buy six SMRs from NuScale Power. Once the first deal is inked, additional deals are likely to be easier to come by.\n\nA lot has to go right for NuScale Power before it has a sustainably profitable business, making execution a risk to keep close tabs on. But if the dominos keep falling into place, the nuclear renaissance could lead to material long-term gains for early investors in this growth stock.\n\nA nuclear powerhouse\n\nMatt DiLallo (Constellation Energy): Constellation Energy is the country's leader in producing nuclear power by a wide margin. It currently owns 22.1 gigawatts (GWs) of competitive nuclear power generation capacity, nearly four times that of rival Vistra (6.3 GWs). \n\nUnlike utilities that own power generation assets and distribute the electricity to customers, Constellation sells the power it produces to other utilities and large corporate customers under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs). This strategy can enable it to cash in on higher power rates. \n\nThe company is investing heavily on expanding its clean energy operations. It signed a deal with Microsoft late last year to support the restart of its Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant, which it shut down several years ago for economic reasons. However, Microsoft's need for clean power to support its cloud and AI growth led the tech giant to sign a 20-year contract for all the power produced from this nuclear plant when it comes back online in 2028. Constellation is also exploring other nuclear power growth opportunities, including SMRs. \n\nOn top of that, Constellation is investing in other cleaner energy sources, like renewables and natural gas. It's in the process of significantly expanding its leading clean power operations by acquiring Calpine, which is a leader in natural gas and geothermal energy. \n\nThese investments position Constellation to deliver powerful earnings growth in the coming years. It's on track to grow its adjusted operating earnings at a more than 13% compound annual rate through 2030 on a stand-alone basis. It can grow even faster if it closes its Calpine deal. Meanwhile, the nuclear resurgence could power additional growth over the longer term. \n\nA rare dividend-paying nuclear fuel stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Cameco): President Trump wants to speed up the design and build-out of nuclear reactors and quadruple the nation's nuclear energy capacity by 2050 to make it a major source of power. However, while investors expect companies building nuclear reactors and generating nuclear energy to be the biggest beneficiaries from Trump's pro-nuclear stance, the supply side of the equation is going unnoticed.\n\nThe thing is, nuclear power plants run on uranium. That means demand for uranium should rise, too, as more nuclear reactors come online. That makes a stock like Cameco a solid pick to play Trump's nuclear renaissance. Cameco was, in fact, hugely bullish about the uranium industry before Trump signed the executive order.\n\nEarlier in May, Cameco estimated that nearly 70% of the total estimated uranium fuel requirements of nuclear reactors worldwide through 2045 remain uncovered. In other words, upcoming nuclear reactors will have to buy nearly 3.2 billion pounds of uranium to power their plants. For perspective, only around 119 million pounds of uranium were contracted by utilities in 2024 under long-term contracts.\n\nSince Cameco is one of the largest uranium producers in the world, its outlook is closely followed by the uranium and nuclear energy industry. Cameco is already witnessing an uptick in long-term uranium contracting activity. To top that, Cameco also owns a 49% stake in Westinghouse Electric, which supplies nuclear technology, equipment, fuel, and services for nuclear reactors. Westinghouse, therefore, provides an edge to Cameco over other uranium miners.\n\nCameco is also a financially strong company and has even paid a dividend every year since 1991, also increasing it by 33% last year. Combine all of it, and Cameco looks like a smart nuclear stock to buy and hold.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/31/3-stocks-to-buy-to-ride-the-nuclear-power-renaissa/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F819987%2Fa-nuclear-power-plant-with-power-lines-in-the-background.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:14:00","author":"Neha Chamaria","authors":["Neha Chamaria"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":326875550,"title":"Hamas seeks amendments to Gaza ceasefire proposal","text":"Hamas is seeking amendments to the latest US ceasefire proposal for Gaza, a senior official with the group has said, but US envoy Steve Witkoff called the response “totally unacceptable”.\n\nThe Hamas official said proposed amendments focus on “the US guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces”.

The company reached out to global markets as it wished, selling its top artificial intelligence (AI) chips and generating explosive growth. But in more recent times, the U.S. -- beginning with the administration of former President Joe Biden and continuing with current President Donald Trump -- has put in place certain restrictions.\n\nThe Biden administration in 2022 launched export controls, limiting the types of AI chips that could be sold to the major market of China, then earlier this year issued the AI Diffusion Rule to further strengthen that position. The Trump administration recently revoked the diffusion rule, but said it would replace it with other guidelines soon. Meanwhile, Nvidia received notice several weeks ago that it could no longer sell its previously approved H20 chips to the Chinese market due to a U.S. government rule, and this resulted in a billions-dollar charge for the company.\n\nIt's important to remember that in the last fiscal year -- the 12 months ended Jan. 26, 2025 -- China represented 13% of Nvidia's revenue, so if the restrictions continue at this level, they will weigh on growth. That's why investors have paid close attention to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments and plans regarding the situation. And he just delivered a startling message during the recent earnings call. Let's take a look at what it could mean for the stock.\n\nNvidia's exports to China\n\nNvidia had specifically designed the H20 AI chip, based on its Hopper architecture, to respect the U.S. government's guidelines and had earned approval to export it. But, back in April, it received word from the government that it couldn't export the H20 without a license. The U.S. hasn't yet issued such licenses to chip companies.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia was left with H20s it was unable to export, and it announced a $5.5 billion charge linked to that. In the company's earnings report this week, it lowered this to $4.5 billion as it was able to repurpose certain H20 materials. Nvidia's market share in China also has progressively declined from 95% about four years ago to 50% today.\n\nNow, let's consider Huang's startling message about Nvidia's future in China.\n\n\"China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success,\" Huang said. \"Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to U.S. industry. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but Hopper is no longer an option.\"\n\nThe company's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, also said that the potential loss of China's AI accelerator market would have \"a material adverse impact on our business.\"\n\nThe worst-case scenario\n\nNow, let's consider what this could mean for Nvidia. It's true that in the worst-case scenario, the company would completely lose access to China permanently, and this could weigh on its ability to grow. But two elements make me optimistic this scenario won't play out.\n\nFirst, it's important to note that Huang generally is very resourceful and proactive. After all, he quickly led Nvidia's development of the H20 to respect guidelines and maintain a presence in China. So, it's clear he and his team are prioritizing this problem and may find ways to limit the damage.\n\nSecond, Huang hasn't tried to minimize the potential impact of closing the door to the Chinese market. He's sounding the alarm bell in a pretty loud way and clearly explaining how extremely restrictive policies could harm U.S. companies. This could encourage the Trump administration, as it considers new guidelines, to turn things around and allow U.S. companies such as Nvidia some access to the market.\n\nNvidia's biggest market\n\nMeanwhile, it's important to note that through the latest fiscal year, the U.S. is by far the company's biggest market, generating $61 billion in revenue out of the company's total of $130 billion. And revenue from companies with billing addresses in all other geographic regions has climbed significantly. So, though a complete halt to China sales clearly would hurt Nvidia's growth, the company still continues to advance -- and lead -- in other areas throughout the world.\n\nWhat might this mean for the stock? If the worst-case scenario happened, it likely would weigh on stock performance, at least in the short term. On a brighter note, I don't think this is a situation that would destroy Nvidia's long-term value considering the company's leadership in AI throughout the rest of the world. But, as mentioned, I'm optimistic a middle-of-the-road solution may be found, allowing Nvidia at least some opportunity in China, and if this happens, Nvidia shares could soar.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/31/huangs-startling-message-about-nvidia-in-china/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F819943%2Fgettyimages-1422453695-1201x801-d21b45d-1.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:10:00","author":"Adria Cimino","authors":["Adria Cimino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.501},{"id":326881416,"title":"Iran steps up production of highly enriched uranium: IAEA","text":"VIENNA: Iran has stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium in recent months, according to a confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seen by AFP on Saturday.\n\nTensions between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief fell apart.\n\nThe IAEA’s latest report comes as Tehran pursues delicate negotiations with the United States on its nuclear programme.\n\nIt said in its quarterly report that it is of “serious concern” that Iran has an estimated amount of 408.6 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 percent as of May 17, up by 133.8 kilogrammes since the last report in February.

It follows persistent pressure from US president Donald Trump, who has urged Nato allies to raise defence spending to 5 per cent – more than double the alliance’s current 2 per cent target.\n\nThe new defence review is expected to warn of an “immediate and pressing” threat posed by Russia and draw heavily on the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine.\n\nCyber experts are expected to be sent to the front line alongside regular forces, in a move designed to modernise the British military.\n\nMinisters have already announced plans to spend an additional £1.5bn fixing up military houses amid claims years of neglect has led to troops quitting.\n\nThe latest announcement comes in response to a call in the defence review for an “always on” munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said: “A strong economy needs a strong national defence, and investing in weaponry and munitions and backing nearly 2,000 jobs across Britain in doing so is proof the two go hand in hand.\n\n“We are delivering both security for working people in an uncertain world and good jobs, putting more money in people’s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.”\n\nThe 3 per cent funding could prove controversial. Money to meet the 2.5 per cent target was found by slashing overseas aid from 0.5 per cent to 0.3 per cent of GDP – a move which prompted then international development minister Anneliese Dodds to resign.\n\nShadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said: “It’s a bit rich of Labour to talk about ‘always on’ munitions production when procurement has been largely switched off for the past year. Rachel Reeves has deliberately used the SDR to put an effective freeze on new orders for the kit our military needs.\n\n“Of course, we welcome investment in new munitions factories, but we don’t know when they will be ready, only that these orders should have been placed months ago.\n\n“Ultimately, we need to see greater ambition for the pace and scale of rearmament our armed forces require, given the threats we face and the need to replace inventory gifted to Ukraine. That means 3 per cent of GDP by the end of this parliament, and Labour properly prioritising defence spending - instead of seeking to outspend Reform on welfare.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-spend-1-5bn-weapons-213131015.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9b5713285a8f4dd19399b47d9d5bca41","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-31 22:02:29","author":"Kate Devlin","authors":["Kate Devlin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":326876782,"title":"Brain cancer patient DJ Daniel faces 3 new tumors after inspiring President Trump, law enforcement","text":"A 13-year-old boy sworn in by the Secret Service after inspiring President Donald Trump with his fight against incurable brain cancer, was recently diagnosed with three additional tumors.

EV deliveries dropped sharply in Q1. \n\nA sometimes violent consumer backlash of Elon haters ensued with boycotts and vandalism. \n\nShares have recovered more recently as Musk signaled he was moving away from Trump and DOGE, and back to Tesla, but the underlying issues with the company remain.\n\nConsider Tesla’s China conundrum. \n\nTesla builds a lot of its cars in China, approaching nearly half its units sold by some estimates, as it seeks to tap into the massive Chinese consumer base.\n\nAt first the thinking was that Musk could soften Trump’s anti-China trade position. \n\nDitto for the general GOP disposition to end Biden-era tax breaks for EVs. \n\nLet’s just say Trump is as much of a China trade hawk as ever (in response, Mainland consumers are now opting for EVs from China’s BYD), and the GOP is still looking to zero out Biden’s clean-energy tax credits that include breaks for EVs.\n\nGordon Johnson, a longtime Musk and Tesla critic, sees other headwinds for Tesla and its shareholders.\n\n“Tesla has objectively lost its product edge, with many competing cars now offering better” range, interiors and faster charges, Johnson said, basing his criticism on consumer surveys.\n\nHe also noted that Tesla for years hyped the proprietary nature of its battery technology, which may be true only in the most narrow sense, because it sources its battery parts elsewhere. \n\nSure, the nasty political backlash of tree-hugging progressive EV buyers who hate that Elon worked with Trump hurt sales, but losing the product edge has also hurt.\n\nJohnson said China sales — again, a big part of Tesla’s revenues — are now declining sharply because of Trump’s trade war with the Mainland that will likely persist through any framework that is reached.\n\nTesla bulls out there like my good pal Dan Ives say it’s the future we all should be looking at when it comes to Tesla, not the past. \n\nAnd that future is a potentially transformative technology in autonomous vehicles that will meld all the stuff Muskis really good at, like AI and robotics.\n\nMusk himself said in 2022 that the company is “worth basically zero” without a functioning self-driving car.\n\nHe says he’s been testing them for June delivery and they look like they’re functioning well.\n\nIves said it could add $1 trillion to Tesla’s market value.\n\nJohnson isn’t so sure.\n\nOne problem, according to Johnson, is that even though Musk is done with DOGE, he “continues to spend far more time on Twitter than he does on Tesla.”","summary":"Americans should be thankful that Elon Musk devoted his time to DOGE and shining a spotlight on government waste.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/31/business/tesla-shareholders-thankful-to-have-musk-back-after-devoting-his-time-to-doge-in-the-trump-administration/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/ELDMDLE.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-31 21:51:38","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":326884498,"title":"This Week’s Reveal Podcast: The EEOC’s Identity Crisis","text":"Dylan Bringuel remembers the exact moment they got hired by the Holiday Inn Express in Jamestown, New York.

We’ll do our best to make sure you fit and you’re comfortable here.’”\n\nThat wasn’t the case. Bringuel said that the first day on the job, the housekeeping manager called them an “it” and a “transformer” and said people like Bringuel are “what is wrong with society.”\n\nBringuel reported the harassment to hotel management. Within a day, they were fired. In 2024, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission stepped in to help Bringuel sue the hotel for workplace discrimination.\n\nBut earlier this year, something unusual happened. The EEOC dropped Bringuel’s case, not because their allegations lacked merit, but because of President Donald Trump’s executive order on “radical gender ideology.” This week on Reveal, Mother Jones national politics reporter Abby Vesoulis walks through how the anti-DEI movement evolved from a niche legal fight to an all-out culture war—and what that means for the EEOC and the marginalized people it has historically protected.","summary":"Dylan Bringuel remembers the exact moment they got hired by the Holiday Inn Express in Jamestown, New York.
