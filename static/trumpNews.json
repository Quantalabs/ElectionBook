News of easing trade tensions between the United States and China, along with a flurry of Middle East deals for U.S. companies, dominated trade activity.\n\nThe S&P 500 ended May 16 at 5,958, up by 5.27 percent for the week. The Dow rose by 3.41 percent to close at 42,654. The Nasdaq soared by 7.15 percent to 19,211, while the Russell 2000 added 4.46 percent to close at 2,113.\n\nThe week’s winners were companies that stand to benefit from easing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and from the slew of deals struck between Washington and Middle East nations during the recent presidential visit to the region.\n\nAt the top of the list is Nvidia, whose shares rose by 16.07 percent for the week, as both developments could boost demand for its chips.\n\nCisco Systems was another winner, climbing 6.44 percent, driven by news of Middle East partnerships and better-than-expected revenues and earnings for its most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing gained 5.63 percent following a big order for its passenger planes from Qatar Airways.\n\nCoreWeave was also among the week’s big winners, with its shares surging by 56.32 percent on a wave of positive news, including Nvidia’s announcement of a significant stake in the company and a deal with OpenAI—both of which boosted investor interest in the newly publicly traded company.\n\nOne more notable winner was Coinbase Global, whose shares rallied 33.68 percent on news that it will join the S&P 500, meaning funds that track the index will now be required to include its stocks.\n\nHealth care stocks continued to lag, led by UnitedHealth Group, whose shares dropped by 23.31 percent. The stock has fallen for three straight weeks following disappointing earnings results.\n\nTrading during the week was less volatile, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index declining, as most macroeconomic and trade headlines helped ease investor fears of an impending stagflation.\n\nMarket bulls raced out of the gate on May 12 following news of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China, which reduced the U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products to 30 percent from 145 percent, and the Chinese tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10 percent from 125 percent.\n\nWall Street experts welcomed the agreement that emerged from the two sides’ meeting in Switzerland over the weekend.\n\n“The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the U.S. and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth in Minneapolis, told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe massive rally that began on May 12 continued over the next two days, fueled by a wave of corporate deals between Washington and Middle Eastern countries during President Donald Trump’s visit to the region.\n\nHowever, bears took the upper hand on the morning of May 15 after Walmart released its earnings. The retail giant had another strong quarter but said it would raise prices because of tariffs, reversing its previous policy of focusing on market share rather than profitability.\n\nThe decline was short-lived, though, as the “buying the dip” crowd emerged, helping the market recover quickly and head north by the end of the trading session.\n\n“The stock market’s rally has legs, as the trade negotiation with China was seemingly the toughest one on the docket, and the idea that there has been this much progress on the negotiations over such a short period suggests that a resolution may be on the horizon,” Rick Gardner, chief investment officer of Raleigh, North Carolina-based RGA Investments, told The Epoch Times.\n\n“What is remarkable about the market’s rebound since the April lows is the leadership of the technology sector, which was not leading the market in the early months of 2025 before the tariff situation escalated,” Gardner said.\n\nHe said the firm anticipates the tech sector will continue leading stock gains, as it is poised to benefit from easing trade tensions and renewed investor confidence in artificial intelligence prospects.","summary":"A temporary U.S.-China trade truce and a series of U.S.-Middle East deals eased stagnation fears and drew bulls into the market.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/market-review-stocks-roar-back-in-five-day-winning-streak-5859345","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/17/id5859356-GettyImages-2214866236-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 01:00:40","author":"Panos Mourdoukoutas","authors":["Panos Mourdoukoutas"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.201},{"id":322431394,"title":"‘An intentional act of violence’: What we know about bomb blast at fertility clinic in Palm Springs","text":"One person has been killed and at least five people have been injured in an “intentional act of terrorism” against a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. \n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said on Saturday that she had been briefed on the incident. \n\n“We are working to learn more, but let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,” she said on X. \n\nAn explosion outside a California fertility clinic that left one dead and several injured was caused by a bomb, Palm Springs Mayor Ron deHarte has said.\n\nFirefighters in the city responded to the explosion at the American Reproductive Center at approximately 11 a.m. local time.\n\nPalm Springs Police spokesperson Mike Villegas initially called it an “intentional act of violence,” according to The Desert Sun. \n\nIt has since been labeled as an intentional act of terrorism by Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, who told reporters at a press conference on Saturday evening: “Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism. The FBI is investigating it as such. Our Joint Terrorism Task Force is here, working in lockstep with the Palm Springs Police Department, the ATF, and a whole host of agencies.”\n\nThere is no word on the nature of the terrorism, but Davis said the investigation will determine whether its origin is international or domestic.\n\nThe person who was killed is believed to be a suspect, law enforcement sources told ABC News. \n\nMayor DeHarte told The Los Angeles Times in a text that he could “confirm it was a bomb in or near a vehicle parked at the building. One deceased.”\n\n“We are working to confirm the identity of the deceased, and we will provide that to you as soon as we can, but we are keeping that close hold in order to protect the integrity of the investigation,” said Assistant Director Davis.\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Essayli confirmed earlier in the day that the FBI is investigating the incident to determine whether it was intentional. According to spokesperson Nicole Lozano, investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are also working to assess what happened.\n\nSpeaking to the Palm Springs Post, Lt. William Hutchinson with the Palm Springs Police Department confirmed that a car was responsible for the explosion. The department also confirmed that one person had been killed. \n\nA witness told the Post that he saw human remains in the street.\n\n“In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of [Desert Regional Medical Center],” the witness said. “I could see the back of the car still on fire and the rims. That was the only thing that distinguishes it as a car.”\n\nWhen asked at the evening press conference about reports that a witness had found a tripod and camera as if a livestream was planned, officials confirmed they had heard that report and would be investigating.\n\nPalm Springs resident Tamara Cash told The Desert Sun the explosion “was so loud it shook me. All I could hear was alarms going off in different buildings.” \n\nDr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Center’s fertility clinic where the explosion occurred, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for.\n\nThe explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients, but left the IVF lab and all of the stored embryos there unharmed.\n\n“I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”\n\n\"We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected,\" he said in a statement, according to the Desert Sun. \n\n\"Our mission has always been to help build families, and in times like these, we are reminded of just how fragile and precious life is,\" he added. \"In the face of this tragedy, we remain committed to creating hope — because we believe that healing begins with community, compassion, and care.\"\n\nHe said the clinic would be “fully operational” by Monday morning. \n\n\"This moment has shaken us — but it has not stopped us,\" he said. \"We will continue to serve with strength, love, and the hope that brings new life into the world.\"\n\nNima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion.\n\n“The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.”\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the explosion. He posted on X: “I’ve been briefed on the explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs. Jen and I are keeping everyone affected in our hearts.”\n\nHe added: “The state is working closely with local and federal authorities as the investigation unfolds. Please avoid the area.”\n\nRiverside Country and Coachella Valley U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert tweeted: “My office and I are monitoring the news of a large explosion at the American Reproductive Centers IVF treatment facility in Palm Springs this afternoon. As we await more information, please adhere to all instructions from local law enforcement.”\n\nFellow California congressman, Ro Khanna, who represents part of Silicon Valley, linked the explosion to other recent acts of violence, including those against Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and President Donald Trump.\n\n“Today, a fertility clinic was targeted in a bombing in Palm Springs,” he said. “A few weeks ago, Governor Josh Shapiro and his family had their home set on fire by an arsonist. Just a year ago, an assassin's bullet almost took President Trump’s life. Regardless of what we believe, we have to start coming together as Americans to uplift democracy and civility.”\n\nPalm Springs is a city of roughly 45,000 people, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. It became a popular resort at the turn of the last century, and since the 1930s has been a regular haunt of movie stars getting away from the bustle of Hollywood, proving famously popular with the so-called Rat Pack of entertainers – including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. – in the 1950s. The city is also known for its modernist architecture and streets lined with tall palm trees.\n\nSituated in the Coachella Valley within the Colorado Desert, the city’s population triples between November and March as it has become a prominent retirement and snowbird destination. Most of the snowbirds have been Canadians, but some have started boycotting the city amid President Donald Trump’s harsh policies and aggressive rhetoric against the US’s neighbor to the north. \n\nDescribing the location of the blast within the city to CNN, Mayor DeHarte said: “It's in the Uptown Design District of Palm Springs. [The clinic is] right across the street from Desert Regional Medical Center. It's not part of the Medical Center campus, but it's on Indian Canyon, which is just one block east of Palm Canyon Drive that everybody is familiar with when they come to Palm Springs.”\n\nWhile the motive behind the explosion in Palm Springs remains unclear, there have been few reports of attacks on fertility clinics in the U.S. Abortion clinics have been more frequently targeted. Trump said during the campaign that he wanted to be “the fertility president” as a strong supporter of IVF, even as some conservatives are against the practice, but not in a way that has notably prompted violence. \n\nFertility treatments became a national political debate after Alabama’s Supreme Court issued a ruling that classified frozen embryos as unborn children.\n\nThe National Abortion Federation said in its report documenting violence against abortion clinics in 2023 and 2024 that there were 1,199 violent incidents at abortion clinics during those years. \n\n“Although many clinics have closed as a result of abortion bans, we continue to see sustained harassment and violence that wouldn’t be tolerated against any other healthcare providers or profession,” said the organization’s chief program officer, Melissa Fowler, according to Ms. Magazine. \n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report","summary":"Law enforcement agents are still trying to determine who caused the explosion – and why","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/palm-springs-explosion-coachella-valley-b2753074.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/17/21/17/Debris-covers-the-ground-after-an-explosion-on-Saturday-May-17-2025-in-Palm-Springs-California-781v2.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3QiBnaPK-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-18 00:59:31","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.569},{"id":322429094,"title":"Bizarre list of Aussie products Europe wants RENAMED as Anthony Albanese negotiates trade deal","text":"Bizarre list of Aussie products Europe wants RENAMED as Anthony Albanese negotiates trade deal\n\nAlbanese will discuss free trade with Canada and Europe\n\nREAD MORE: Aussies furious over detail at Albanese's swearing-in ceremony\n\nBy ASHLEY NICKEL FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA and AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPublished: 01:52 BST, 18 May 2025 | Updated: 01:52 BST, 18 May 2025\n\nAnthony Albanese is determined not to bend to pressure and change the names of products such as prosecco and feta during trade deal negotiations with Europe. \n\nThe Prime Minister is expected to discuss details of the huge trade deal on the sidelines of his visit to Pope Le XIV's inauguration in Rome.\n\nMr Albanese arrived in the Italian capital city on Friday and will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen. \n\nOn top of the agenda for both of these meetings will be trade and the war in Ukraine.\n\n'It will be an opportunity to have bilateral discussions with a range of world leaders who will be there, people I haven't met before face-to-face,' Mr Albanese told reporters earlier this week.\n\nFree trade negotiations between Australia and the EU broke down in 2023 with Australia wanting more access for beef and lamb exports than EU countries were willing to accept, and the EU calling for name changes to popular Australian products.\n\nThe latter issue became a major point of contention with the EU insisting Australian producers could not name products like 'prosecco' and 'feta' as the names referred to geographic locations. \n\nThe EU claimed prosecco can only be used to describe sparkling wine from the Veneto region of Italy.\n\nAnthony Albanese visited Rome for Pope Leo XIV's inauguration (pictured, Albanese and the Pope)\n\nAlbanese will use his whirlwind two-and-a-half day visit to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen (pictured)\n\nOther products that were incorrectly named due to 'geographic indications' were parma ham, feta and parmesan cheese.\n\nSimilar geographic gripes led to Australian wines being banned from using the names champagne, port and sherry in 2009.\n\nAlbanese earlier refused to adopt any new name changes, noting they originated from Europeans immigrating to Australia.\n\nEU ambassador to Australia, Gabriele Visentin, this week confirmed the EU would be more open to compromising on its naming demands.\n\nBoth Canada and the EU have felt the brunt of US President Donald Trump's so-called 'Liberation Day' tariffs. \n\nAlbanese will be keen to discuss how countries like Australia, Canada or those in Europe can push back on his agenda, protect free trade and preserve elements of the world trading system without unnecessarily aggravating Trump. \n\nThe prime minister also spoke briefly about the importance of the inauguration mass for Australia's five million Catholics at a church in Rome that welcomes visiting Australians. \n\nSince arriving in Rome on Friday, Albanese has met with Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher and Melbourne Archbishop Peter Comensoli, Nine reported.\n\nNegotiations will include calls for Australia to stop using the name 'prosecco' in its wines\n\nSour grapes!

Bekas Jurucakap Pasukan Pendudukan Israel (IOF), Daniel Hagari pernah menyebut: \"Idea melenyapkan Hamas sebenarnya hanyalah ilusi, satu taktik untuk mengalih perhatian dan memperdaya masyarakat umum.\" \n\n Bekas Setiausaha Amerika Syarikat ketika era Joe Biden, Anthony Blinken menegaskan Hamas tidak boleh ditewaskan melalui pendekatan ketenteraan semata-mata dan apa berlaku di utara Gaza menjadi bukti nyata kerana Hamas merekrut anggota baharu sebanyak mana yang gugur atau hilang.\n\n Kenyataan terbaru bekas pegawai IOF, Yisrael Ziv pula menyebut 'Hamas membangunkan taktik pertempurannya' sambil menegaskan penghantaran tentera ke Gaza meningkatkan risiko kecederaan.\n\n Ketika itu, pejuang di Gaza giat melaksanakan operasi ketenteraan terhadap musuh dari utara di al-Syujaiah hingga selatan, al-Jenainah, Rafah. \n\n Helikopter tanpa henti mengambil tentera rejim Zionis tercedera dari Gaza untuk dibawa keluar.\n\n Kalaulah ada gabungan ketenteraan negara Islam, ratusan ribu askar boleh dikumpulkan dan pesawat udara serta kereta kebal boleh digunakan, pasti rejim Zionis boleh dikalahkan.\n\n Jika mahu mengelak konfrontasi ketenteraan, sekurang-kurangnya berilah ugutan kepada musuh dan sekutunya. Namun, apa berlaku di rantau Arab hari ini sebaliknya, Presiden AS, Donald Trump yang negaranya bertanggungjawab menaja berbilion dolar Amerika dari segi persenjataan yang membolehkan rejim Zionis meneruskan genosid ke atas Gaza, disambut dengan pesawat udara pengiring dan rundingan pelaburan bernilai AS$600 bilion (RM2.6 trilion).\n\n AS dibebani hutang berbilion dolar\n\n Rundingan pelaburan itu sepatutnya boleh digunakan sebagai leverage' atau syarat kepada gencatan senjata, keamanan dan nasib anak di Gaza yang kini diancam kebuluran.\n\n AS sebenarnya dibebani hutang berbilion dolar dan dikalahkan China dari aspek ekonomi, justeru mereka memerlukan sekutu kuat ekonomi.\n\n Apatah lagi, AS gagal menghentikan serangan dari Yaman yang jauh lebih miskin, malah terpaksa berdepan banyak siri serangan Yaman ke atas aset ketenteraan mereka di Laut Merah.\n\n Malah, Arab Saudi dan negara Arab jauh lebih maju dan mencapai kekayaan luar biasa, manakala tidak kurang hebatnya dari sudut ketenteraan. Ditambah kelebihan geografi dan minat umat Islam terhadap perjuangan jihad yang sentiasa membara.\n\n Sebaliknya, mereka menggunakan alasan kononnya ada Houthi di belakang, Iran di kiri dan Turkiye di depan, sedangkan semua itu alasan demi kepentingan geopolitik dan kuasa.\n\n Hakikatnya, sumber ancaman paling besar ialah rejim Zionis yang melancarkan serangan terhadap negara Arab dan Islam melepasi sempadan serta undang-undang antarabangsa.\n\n Kita tidak tahu hubungan negara Arab dengan rejim Zionis pada masa depan. Boleh jadi mereka akan bersetuju menyertai Perjanjian Abraham di bawah Trump dalam keadaan Gaza masih dikepung dan dibantai. Semoga hal ini tidak menjadi kenyataan yang menambah luka kepada umat Islam dan dunia.\n\n Tuntutan supaya negara Arab bertindak lebih tegas terhadap Trump bukanlah ekstrem atau melampau, tetapi tuntutan syarak demi anak di Gaza dan kesucian Masjid al-Aqsa.\n\n Penulis adalah Pegawai Penyelidik Aqsa Syarif","summary":"SEBAHAGIAN umat Islam mula berasakan saudara seagama di Gaza kini berada dalam keadaan paling lemah, sama seperti negara Arab dan Islam berjiran.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/rencana/lain-lain/2025/05/1397263/negara-arab-patut-gunakan-kuasa-ekonomi-tekan-trump","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/patutgunakan_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1747526935.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 00:09:02","author":"Megat Aiman Hakim Megat Shariffudin","authors":["Megat Aiman Hakim Megat Shariffudin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.072},{"id":322427578,"title":"‘Everybody has skin in the game’: Protesters in North County push back against Trump’s anti-trans, immigrant policies","text":"Protesters gathered at rallies across northern San Diego County on Saturday in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies that target the LGBTQ+ community and roll back key protections for the group.\n\n“Every human should have dignity, and they should all be respected,” said Karen Pohl, a Navy veteran who lives in San Diego and attended a rally held outside the Oceanside Civic Center.\n\nThe event was one of six demonstrations at locations across North County. The rallies were held on the International Day Against Transphobia, Homophobia and Biphobia — a global day of action against LGBTQ+ discrimination — though attendees also expressed fear for the Trump administration’s policies targeting immigrants.\n\nTransgender people and immigrants “are number one and two targets of this administration,” Pohl said.\n\nRally attendees held handmade signs with phrases like “protect trans kids” and “trans rights are human rights,” as they chanted that “love, not hate, makes America great.”\n\nSaturday’s rallies were part of demonstrations organized by local activists held every other weekend. The events are sometimes focused on a specific cause, such as immigrants’ rights or LGBTQ+ protections, or are aimed at mobilizing against the Trump administration’s actions more generally.\n\n“This is not just about ‘I don’t like this president because he doesn’t express my opinion,’” said Max Disposti, the executive director of the North County LGBTQ Resource Center, on Friday before the rally. “This is about presidents violating the basis of democracy… the deportation without due process, the unprecedented attack against the LGBT community.”\n\nStarting on his first day in office in January, President Donald Trump has signed numerous executive orders that have aimed to limit or eliminate protections for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nLast week, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump could begin enforcing his administration’s policy that bans trans people from the military and forces out those who are already serving.\n\n“Adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” reads the order.\n\nAnd in March, Trump issued an executive order that barred trans veterans from receiving gender-affirming care through the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nOceanside resident Irma Robinson has a nonbinary child, and said that her child has felt threatened since Trump was elected last November, pointing to his rhetoric and campaign promises that targeted the trans and nonbinary community.\n\n“That was just a blow to all of us, but more so to the LGBTQ community,” Robinson said. “Our kids are definitely on edge.”\n\nAnd while many thought that California would be a safe haven, some are now questioning that.\n\nOn Friday, the North County LGBTQ Resource Center was notified that it would lose a roughly $500,000 state grant from the California Department of Health.\n\nThe governor’s proposed $322 billion budget would also reduce funding for Planned Parenthood — funding for which is also currently on the chopping block in the federal spending bill currently being negotiated in Congress.\n\n“We’re hanging on to hope that the state of California will protect what Trump is taking away,” Disposti said. “I understand we are in a deficit, but also it’s always the same story — the first thing that gets cut are services to people that can’t afford health care and any other resources.”\n\nMany rally attendees said their concerns about the Trump administration go beyond just one action.\n\nThey’re worried about immigrants, reproductive health and the LGBTQ+ community — along with federal funding cuts and the spending bill, Trump’s foreign policy and efforts from the administration to persuade women to have children.\n\nTo Ethan Gering at the Civic Center rally, it’s growing increasingly clear that the federal government’s actions aren’t just impacting one group.\n\n“I think it’s reached a point where everybody has skin in the game,” Gering said.","summary":"Six rallies were held on the International Day against Transphobia, Homophobia and Biphobia — a global day of action against LGBTQ+ discrimination","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/17/everybody-has-skin-in-the-game-protesters-in-north-county-push-back-against-trumps-anti-trans-immigrant-policies/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SUT-L-LGBTQ-RALLY004.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-18 00:06:05","author":"Maura Fox","authors":["Maura Fox"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.213},{"id":322431390,"title":"Trump orders Walmart to ‘eat the tariffs’ and stop blaming his trade war for rising prices: ‘I’ll be watching’","text":"Fresh back from his Middle Eastern tour, President Donald Trump turned his attention to domestic economic issues on Saturday, lashing out at Walmart for its announcement that prices will start going up this month as tariffs on imports start to bite.\n\nAmerica’s largest retailer warned customers this week that price increases for many products are imminent because, as the company’s chief financial officer, John David Rainey, said, the tariffs are “still too high” — even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30 percent for 90 days.\n\nThe president has long insisted that tariffs are a tax on foreign countries. However, they are a tax on imports collected at the border and paid for by the importer, raising the end price of goods for American shoppers.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump appeared to acknowledge this, saying that Walmart should “eat the tariffs” and not pass the higher cost of sourcing goods on to its customers.\n\nHe wrote on Truth Social: “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”\n\nRainey told CNBC this week: “We’re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb.”\n\n“It’s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I’m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices,” he said. “You’ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.”\n\nWalmart’s first-quarter profit slipped as the company said it was not immune to the impact of the tariffs. The company expects sales to increase 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the second quarter, but did not issue a profit outlook because Trump’s tariff policies are constantly changing.\n\nWalmart is among the first U.S. retailers to report its financial results for the first quarter, giving a snapshot of the mood of American shoppers. \n\nTrump’s tariffs have increased the cost of toys, strollers, and appliances, among other products, after he slapped a base rate of 10 percent duties on goods entering the U.S. from most countries.\n\nWalmart’s CEO Doug McMillon said that the company will “do our best” to keep prices low, but echoed Rainey’s comments.\n\n“Given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” McMillon said.\n\nMany Americans have been pulling back on spending as they grow uneasy about the economy, and inflation remains elevated.\n\nU.S. consumers spent slightly more at retail stores in March to get ahead of the then-widely expected tariffs, which Trump announced on April 2, dubbed by him as “Liberation Day.”\n\nSales at retail stores and restaurants rose just 0.1 percent in April from March, a sharp slowdown from a 1.7 percent gain in the previous month.\n\nConsumer prices have risen 2.3 percent in April compared with a year earlier, according to the Department of Labor report published Tuesday.\n\nTrump says his intention is to encourage U.S. consumers to buy American products, stimulate domestic manufacturing, and create jobs. \n\nFor decades, American consumers have been used to low-cost foreign-made goods filling shelves at big box stores such as Walmart. Retailers have been sounding the alarm for months that Trump’s trade policy could bring that to an end.\n\nA photo posted on Reddit appears to show how much the price of something as simple as a phone charging cable is going up.\n\nThe $9.99 USB-C cord from the store's in-house Heyday brand now costs $17.99, according to the poster, identified as a Target employee by The Daily Mail.\n\nTrump even admitted at his most recent Cabinet meeting that Americans — particularly children, apparently — should prepare to expect less and to pay more for that.\n\nThe president said: “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls.”\n\nHe also suggested those two dolls could “cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”\n\nWhen Mattel, the creator of Barbie, Hot Wheels, Uno, American Girl, and more, said it would diversify its production to other countries, but not the U.S., Trump threatened to retaliate.\n\nYnon Kreiz, chairman and CEO of Mattel, told CNBC in early May that, regardless of tariffs, costs are too high in the U.S. to produce affordable toys for even the American consumer.\n\nKreiz said that a “significant portion” of toy creation does occur in the U.S., such as design, development, product engineering and brand management, but that producing toys overseas allows them to create a “quality” and “affordable” product.\n\nWhen asked about the statement, Trump said: “That’s ok. Let him go, and we’ll put a 100 percent tariff on his toy, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.”","summary":"President lashes out at world’s largest retailer despite claiming his tariffs are tax on foreign countries not U.S. consumers","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-walmart-eat-tariffs-prices-b2753079.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/17/22/44/2025-05-16T100605Z_226646552_RC2XIEAE1ILD_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-GULF.JPG?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4c0LrDZl-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:42:19","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":322425624,"title":"Trump says he will speak to Putin to end Ukraine 'bloodbath'","text":"ISTANBUL - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would speak to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine on Monday following talks between the two sides at which a Ukrainian official said Moscow's negotiators voiced new demands before a ceasefire could be agreed.In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies preparations were underway for a conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump.The talks in Turkey on Friday were the first time the sides had held face-to-face talks since March 2022, weeks after Russia's full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor.","summary":"Kyiv said Russian negotiators have demanded Ukraine pull its troops out of all Ukrainian regions claimed by Moscow before any ceasefire deal.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/05/18/world/politics/us-russia-trump-putin-call/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/05/18/469590.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:39:00","author":"The Japan Times,Web Master","authors":["The Japan Times","Web Master"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.011},{"id":322424386,"title":"Lauren Sánchez's 'budget' bachelorette look hides pricey surprise that costs SIX times more than outfit","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, May 18th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritain crashes out of Eurovision: UK's Remember Monday avoids nul point humiliation but fail to win over Europe in public vote - as AUSTRIA romps to victory in Switzerland in one of the most politically charged song contests ever\n\nBritish tourist, 36, is left fighting for his life after being 'stabbed and thrown from a car' in horror attack at tourism hotspot - as police launch probe\n\nExplosion in Palm Springs sends shockwaves through the city as images show reproductive center destroyed\n\nDoctors told me my terrible obsessive thoughts were just anxiety, says EVE SIMMONS.

On May 9, after the state GOP endorsed Ramaswamy, Yost suggested the group had engaged in “a premature coronation of an untested candidate.”\n\nThe Ohio Republican primary in 2026 is on May 5. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican who is term-limited, cautioned last week that one year is “a lifetime” in politics.\n\nYost wrote that “a steep climb to the nomination for governor has become a vertical cliff.”\n\n“I do not wish to divide my political party or my state with a quixotic battle over the small differences between my vision and that of my opponent. I am simply not that important,” Yost added.\n\nAmy Acton, who served as Ohio’s public health director during the COVID-19 pandemic, is running as a Democrat.\n\nSpeculation is mounting that former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) will enter the Democratic primary. Brown lost his reelection bid last November when he was defeated by Trump-endorsed Bernie Moreno.\n\n“The comeback attempt by Sherrod Brown represents a real and present danger to Ohio’s prosperity. Our state has challenges ahead, but we are not Washington, D.C. Columbus needs re-engineering, not demolition,” Yost wrote.\n\n“Sherrod Brown and the risky progressive ideas of his party will unwind all of the good that the last 15 years of Republican leadership has brought. This is a time to protect Ohio, not a time for a family squabble,” he added.\n\nRamaswamy praised Yost in a May 16 statement after the announcement.\n\n“Congratulations to Dave on running a thoughtful campaign. He has served Ohio with great dedication, and I am confident he will continue to play an important role in shaping the future of our state and our nation,” Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy announced his gubernatorial bid on Feb. 24, a move that had been anticipated for several weeks since he left his role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on the first day of Trump’s new term.\n\nBorn to Indian parents, Ramaswamy earned degrees at Harvard University and Yale Law School before he gained success as an investment partner for hedge fund QVT Financial, founded Roivant Sciences, and co-founded his own investment firm, Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe first rose to national prominence with his 2021 book “Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Ramaswamy outlined 10 core beliefs, led by “God is real,” followed by “there are two genders,” in his 2024 book ”Truths: The Future of America First.”\n\nRamaswamy had shown interest in the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Vice President JD Vance. Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted was considered a frontrunner to become Ohio’s next governor until DeWine appointed him as Vance’s successor.\n\nHusted faces a special election in 2026 to retain his seat for the remainder of Vance’s unexpired term. On May 9, the state GOP also voted to endorse Husted.\n\nOhio is a state that Trump decisively won in 2016, 2020, and 2024. Republicans have a supermajority in the state legislature.\n\nEntrepreneur Heather Hill is now Ramaswamy’s lone competition in the Republican primary.\n\n“My heart goes out to the Republican candidates who feel forced to drop out of the race due to the RNC/GOP’s unfair bias towards one candidate,” Hill said in a statement after the May 9 vote.\n\n“I want to reassure Ohioans that I will not give up. I will fight tirelessly every day to ensure my name is heard and that I prioritize the best interests of all Ohioans,” she added.\n\nSome Republican strategists think that former Ohio State University football coach Jim Tressel will eventually announce his candidacy to replace DeWine.\n\nEarlier this year, DeWine appointed Tressel as lieutenant governor to replace Jon Husted, who was tapped by DeWine to fill JD Vance’s vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nAt the news conference announcing his new role, Tressel was asked by reporters if he would run for governor.\n\n“I haven’t given any thought against it but I haven’t given any thought to it either,” Tressel, who also served as president of Youngstown State University in northeast Ohio, said. “I have been focused on what the governor would like me to learn and what the governor would like me to do.”\n\nTressel, who was the head coach of the Ohio State national championship team in 2002, said last week that he hasn’t ruled out running. The filing deadline is Feb. 4.","summary":"Entrepreneur Heather Hill is the only remaining competitor for Ramaswamy in Ohio's Republican Primary Next May.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/ohio-attorney-general-dave-yost-ends-gubernatorial-bid-after-state-gop-endorses-vivek-ramaswamy-5859344","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/03/id5717269-dave-yost-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:30:13","author":"Jeff Louderback","authors":["Jeff Louderback"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.19},{"id":322433006,"title":"It's 'scary' that James Comey was the FBI director, says Lisa Boothe","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nBig Weekend Show May 17, 2025 01:53 \n\n It's 'scary' that James Comey was the FBI director, says Lisa Boothe \n 'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss President Donald Trump's response to former FBI Director James Comey's '86 47' post on social media.\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE BIG WEEKEND SHOW | VIDEOV-VIDEOPOLITICSUS","summary":"&apos;The Big Weekend Show&apos; co-hosts discuss President Donald Trump&apos;s response to former FBI Director James Comey&apos;s &apos;86 47&apos; post on social media.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372996027112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/2924134b-ebea-4d6b-a56e-cdd9d993560e/9a57fbcd-4c36-425f-9a38-b767a2bcf78b/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:28:22","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.26},{"id":322422124,"title":"Romanians vote in presidential run-off that could widen EU rifts","text":"By Luiza Ilie\n\nBUCHAREST Reuters) -Romanians vote on Sunday in a presidential election run-off that pits a hard-right eurosceptic against a centrist independent, and where the outcome could have implications for both the country's struggling economy and EU unity.\n\nHard-right nationalist George Simion, 38, who opposes military aid to neighbouring Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership, decisively swept the first presidential election round, triggering the collapse of a pro-Western coalition government. That led to significant capital outflows.\n\nCentrist Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, 55, who has pledged to clamp down on corruption, is staunchly pro-EU and NATO, and has said Romania's support for Ukraine is vital for its own security against a growing Russian threat.\n\nThe president of the EU and NATO state has considerable powers, not least being in charge of the defence council that decides on military aid. He will also have oversight of foreign policy, with the power to veto EU votes that require unanimity.\n\nWhoever is elected will also need to nominate a prime minister to negotiate a new majority in parliament to reduce Romania's budget deficit - the largest in the EU - as well as reassure investors and try to avoid a credit rating downgrade.\n\nAn opinion poll on Friday showed Dan slightly ahead of Simion for the first time since the first round in a tight race that will depend on turnout and the sizable Romanian diaspora.\n\n\"Unlike Western states, which can more easily afford mistakes, trust in Romania can be lost much more easily and it could ... take generations to gain it back,\" said Radu Burnete, director of the country's largest employers' group.\n\n\"We cannot afford to drift.\"\n\nVoting starts at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and ends at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT), with exit polls to follow immediately.\n\nMISINFORMATION\n\nPolitical analysts have said victory for Simion, a supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, would risk isolating the country abroad, eroding private investment and destabilising NATO's eastern flank.\n\nThe vote comes on the same day as the first round of Poland's presidential election, expected to be led by pro-EU Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and conservative historian Karol Nawrocki.\n\nVictory for Simion and/or Trzaskowski would expand a cohort of eurosceptic leaders that already includes prime ministers in Hungary and Slovakia amid a political shift in Central Europe that could widen rifts in the EU.\n\n\"What the (nationalists) want is a European Union that is as little integrated as possible,\" said political analyst and historian Ion M. Ionita.\n\n\"One that is very little united from a legislative standpoint in which decisions are only taken nationally, but still benefitting from European money.\"\n\nRomania's vote comes nearly six months after the initial ballot was canceled because of alleged Russian interference - denied by Moscow - in favour of far-right frontrunner Calin Georgescu, who was then banned from standing again.\n\nThe cancellation was criticised by the Trump administration, and Simion owes much of his success to popular anger against the decision, as well as frustration with mainstream parties blamed for high living costs and corruption.\n\nSimion has said his prime minister pick would be Georgescu, who favours nationalisations and an openness towards Russia.\n\nSome analysts warn online disinformation has been rife again ahead of Sunday's vote.\n\n\"We're seeing disinformation spreading like wildfire across social media platforms – through bots and strategic reshares mimicking authentic posting,\" said Roxana Radu, expert at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government.\n\n(Reporting by Luiza IlieEditing by Mark Potter)","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/romanians-vote-presidential-run-off-232113293.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/960871712b5ac3e3d74b063ed1d3b90e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:21:13","author":"Luiza Ilie","authors":["Luiza Ilie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":322422122,"title":"Bomb at fertility clinic in California kills one","text":"A bomb blast outside a California fertility clinic killed one person Saturday, in what the US attorney general called an \"unforgivable\" attack.\n\nThe blast ripped through downtown Palm Springs, badly damaging the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of other nearby buildings.\n\n\"The blast appears to be an intentional act of violence and the blast extends for blocks with several buildings damaged, some severely,\" Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said.\n\n\"There has been one fatality, the person's identity is not known.\"\n\nThe city's mayor, Ron deHarte told AFP investigators had \"confirmed a bomb exploded in or near a vehicle.\"\n\nEyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centers clinic, with aerial footage of the scene showing the building roof had collapsed.\n\nThe charred remnants of a vehicle lay in a parking lot, some distance from the apparent epicenter of the explosion.\n\nDebris was blown straight through the building and scattered across the road, while the roofs of a number of nearby buildings had been damaged, indicating the intense force of the blast.\n\nThe local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, reported five people were injured in the explosion and the person who died was a suspect in the blast.\n\nA statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt, and that its lab -- \"including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials -- remains fully secure and undamaged.\"\n\nIt said that \"a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building.\"\n\nReproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remains controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons.\n\nViolence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to determine exactly what had happened.\n\n\"But let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America.

Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,” she said on X. \n\nA deliberate attack\n\nAn explosion outside a California fertility clinic that left one dead and several injured was caused by a bomb, Palm Springs Mayor Ron deHarte has said.\n\nPalm Springs Police spokesperson Mike Villegas called it an “intentional act of violence,” according to The Desert Sun. \n\nFirefighters in the city responded to the explosion at the American Reproductive Center.\n\nDeceased person believed to be suspect\n\nThe person who was killed is believed to be a suspect, law enforcement sources told ABC News. \n\nMayor DeHarte told The Los Angeles Times in a text that he could “confirm it was a bomb in or near a vehicle parked at the building. One deceased.”\n\nSpeaking to the Palm Springs Post, Lt. William Hutchinson with the Palm Springs Police Department confirmed that a car was responsible for the explosion. The department also confirmed that one person had been killed.\n\nPolice investigating possible ‘act of terrorism’\n\n“Everything is in question, whether this is an act of terrorism,” Hutchinson told The Desert Sun. \n\nA witness told the Post that he saw human remains in the street.\n\n“In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of [Desert Regional Medical Center],” the witness said. “I could see the back of the car still on fire and the rims. That was the only thing that distinguishes it as a car.”\n\nU.S. Attorney Bill Essayli has confirmed that the FBI is investigating the incident to determine whether it was intentional. According to spokesperson Nicole Lozano, investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are also working to assess what happened.\n\n‘This moment has shaken us’\n\nPalm Springs resident Tamara Cash told The Desert Sun the explosion “was so loud it shook me. All I could hear was alarms going off in different buildings.”\n\nDr. Maher Abdallah, who runs the American Reproductive Center’s fertility clinic where the explosion occurred, told The Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for.\n\nThe explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients, but left the IVF lab and all of the stored embryos there unharmed.\n\n“I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.”\n\n\"We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected,\" he said in a statement, according to the Desert Sun. \n\n\"Our mission has always been to help build families, and in times like these, we are reminded of just how fragile and precious life is,\" he added. \"In the face of this tragedy, we remain committed to creating hope — because we believe that healing begins with community, compassion, and care.\"\n\nHe said the clinic would be “fully operational” by Monday morning.\n\n\"This moment has shaken us — but it has not stopped us,\" he said. \"We will continue to serve with strength, love, and the hope that brings new life into the world.\"\n\nNima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion.\n\n“The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.”\n\nPalm Springs\n\nPalm Springs is a city of roughly 45,000 people, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. It became a popular resort at the turn of the last century, and since the 1930s has been a regular haunt of movie stars getting away from the bustle of Hollywood, proving famously popular with the so-called Rat Pack of entertainers – including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. – in the 1950s. The city is also known for its modernist architecture.\n\nSituated in the Coachella Valley within the Colorado Desert, the city’s population triples between November and March as it has become a prominent retirement and snowbird destination. Most of the snowbirds have been Canadians, but some have started boycotting the city amid President Donald Trump’s harsh policies and aggressive rhetoric against the US’s neighbor to the north.\n\nDescribing the location of the blast within the city to CNN, Mayor DeHarte said: “It's in the Uptown Design District of Palm Springs. [The clinic is] right across the street from Desert Regional Medical Center. It's not part of the Medical Center campus, but it's on Indian Canyon, which is just one block east of Palm Canyon Drive that everybody is familiar with when they come to Palm Springs.”\n\nAttacks on clinics\n\nWhile the motive behind the explosion in Palm Springs remains unclear, there have been few reports of attacks on fertility clinics in the U.S. Abortion clinics have been more frequently targeted. Trump said during the campaign that he wanted to be “the fertility president” as a strong supporter of IVF, even as some conservatives are against the practice, but not in a way that has notably prompted violence.\n\nFertility treatments became a national political debate after Alabama’s supreme court issued a ruling that classified frozen embryos as unborn children.\n\nThe National Abortion Federation said in its report documenting violence against abortion clinics in 2023 and 2024 that there were 1,199 violent incidents at abortion clinics during those years.\n\n“Although many clinics have closed as a result of abortion bans, we continue to see sustained harassment and violence that wouldn’t be tolerated against any other healthcare providers or profession,” said the organization’s chief program officer, Melissa Fowler, according to Ms. Magazine. \n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/intentional-act-violence-know-bomb-231503177.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/60b07221c1bcef5e46edf237cd7f0da6","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:15:03","author":"Gustaf Kilander And Oliver O'connell","authors":["Gustaf Kilander And Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.591},{"id":322420606,"title":"A GOP congressman says raising taxes on top earners would help push Trump's 'big beautiful bill' forward","text":"A GOP congressman said on Saturday that raising the top tax rate for high earners could help President Donald Trump's massive tax and immigration package get the votes it needs.\"The One Big Beautiful Bill has stalled — and it needs wind in its sails,\" Rep.

Since 2018, however, there's been a $10,000 limit on those deductions. LaLota is among several New York Republicans who are seeking a higher limit so taxpayers can deduct more.The GOP-led bill proposes raising the cap to $30,000 for taxpayers who earn $400,000 or less. LaLota wants to see the SALT cap set at $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.Hardline conservatives on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, believe the tax bill should include more spending reductions, arguing that it doesn't go far enough in cutting into the nation's budget deficit.On Friday, five Republicans on the House Budget Committee joined Democrats to tank a procedural vote that would have advanced the \"one big beautiful bill.\"House GOP leaders are working through the weekend to put together a deal that could pass in a Sunday night committee vote. They're still aiming to pass the bill on the House floor by Memorial Day, but the failed vote was a big setback for both Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson.On Friday, Trump urged GOP unity on the bill in a post on TruthSocial.\"Republicans MUST UNITE behind, 'THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!'\" he said. \"We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party.

The Independent has sought further information from Israel.\n\nIt comes a month after Israel announced plans for a new military strip in southern Gaza named the Morag Corridor. Observers at Goldsmiths, University of London’s Forensic Architecture studio said on Friday that Israel had destroyed dozens of homes in the remains of Rafah city and built several new military outposts.\n\nAnd last week, Mr Netanyahu said Israel’s security cabinet had approved a plan to “conquer” Gaza and establish a “sustained presence” there, in which the “population will be moved, for its own protection”.\n\nIsraeli officials had suggested the so-called Gideon’s Chariot offensive would begin in earnest once Donald Trump’s four-day tour of the Middle East had concluded.\n\nThe US president left the region on Friday, without having visited Israel. On Saturday, defence minister Israel Katz said Gideon’s Chariots was under way and was being led with “great force” by Israel’s military.\n\nWhile Mr Trump issued a warning that “a lot of people are starving” in Gaza, without mentioning Israel’s blockade, the US president’s apparently sympathetic tone was tempered further as reports emerged suggesting his administration was considering a plan to permanently relocate as many as a million Gazans to Libya.\n\nWhite House sources told NBC News that the idea had been discussed with Libya’s leadership and was being seriously considered. In exchange, Washington would release billions of dollars of funds to Libya that the US froze more than a decade ago.\n\nMr Trump first suggested relocating Gaza’s 2.3 million inhabitants back in February, drawing fierce criticism from the international community. He also spoke of turning Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.\n\nAt least 300 people have been killed in Gaza since Thursday morning, as one of the deadliest phases of Israel’s bombardment continued for a third consecutive day.\n\nPalestinian health authorities said at least 150 people had been killed in the past 24 hours, with many hundreds more being treated in hospital, and countless others still buried under rubble. More than 3,000 have been killed since Israel broke a January ceasefire on 18 March.\n\nIsrael insists its offensive is aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the release of the remaining 58 hostages seized in the group’s cross-border incursion on 7 October 2023, which sparked the war and left 1,200 people in Israel dead.\n\nIsrael believes as many as 23 of the hostages in Gaza are still alive, although Israeli authorities have expressed concern for the status of three of them.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, an Israeli strike killed at least four children in the Jabalia refugee camp in the north, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the bodies. Seven others were wounded in the strike, which hit a house. A later strike in Jabalia killed four, the hospital said.\n\n“This is unacceptable. Until when? Until we all die?” said Naji Awaisa, as he and others fled the camp with their belongings.\n\nAirstrikes around Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed 14 people, with the bodies arriving at al-Aqsa hospital. One strike on a house killed eight people, including parents and four children.\n\nA strike also landed outside a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza City, killing four, health officials said.\n\nGaza is in the third month of an Israeli blockade with no food, water, fuel or other goods entering the territory of more than 2 million people. Food security experts say Gaza will be in famine if the blockade is not lifted.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of people marched through London to mark the anniversary of Nakba.\n\nThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the march was intended to “mark the 77th anniversary of the 1948 Nakba and demand our government take action to end the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land”.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/israel-planning-move-gazans-three-212922477.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/ea7076b735880e41662da4da372e3982","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-17 23:06:57","author":"Andy Gregory","authors":["Andy Gregory"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":322422476,"title":"Why Republicans are fixated on fake ‘white genocide’","text":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\nThis past week, President Donald Trump took a break from bashing immigrants and refugees to grant a special exception to a group of white immigrants from South Africa, many of whom are descended from farmers who benefitted from racist apartheid policies. \n\nThe decision upset the Episcopal Church, which said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee resettlement.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter on Monday why he decided to make this exception, Trump doubled down on the right-wing “white genocide” myth. \n\n“It's a genocide that's taking place. Farmers are being killed. They happen to be white, but whether they’re white or Black, it makes no difference to me,” he said.\n\nOf course, Trump is a racist who uses racist language and pushes racist policies—so it absolutely makes a difference to him.\n\nAround the same time that the exception for white South Africans occurred, Elon Musk—who is originally from South Africa—had a “white genocide” problem as well. Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot created by Musk’s AI company, began pumping out information about “white genocide” in responde to unrelated questions.\n\nBut the right’s obsession with the “white genocide” myth is nothing new.\n\nDuring his time at Fox News, conservative pundit Tucker Carlson spent episode after episode of his program arguing that a “white genocide” was in progress, and that corporate media was part of a conspiracy covering it up. He even linked arms with white supremacists in 2018 to argue that a mean tweet about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was evidence of “white genocide.”\n\nSimilarly, during Trump’s first term in 2018, he pushed for a federal investigation of “the large-scale killing of farmers” in South Africa, which pleased white supremacists who have argued that the nation is engaged in “white genocide.”\n\nBut, like most of what Trump says, this was built on falsehoods. The 2018 data actually showed that attacks on farmers in South Africa were on the decline, disproving the right-wing claim that white farmers were being disproportionately targeted.\n\nIn February, a South African court determined that claims of “white genocide” were “clearly imagined and not real.” Furthermore, South Africans are still living with the aftermath of bigoted apartheid policies.\n\nUnder apartheid, Black people were not allowed to own land, and land was stolen from Black families. A 2017 audit found that, while white people make up just over 7% of the population, they own 72% of farms and other agricultural properties.\n\nThe “white genocide” myth is being invoked in U.S. politics because conservatives long ago embraced the politics of victimhood. Even when the right is in majority control of U.S. political institutions, like right now, it still claims that it’s a persecuted minority.\n\nFew conservative figures love to play the victim as much as Trump, who has made frequent claims that mysterious forces are out to get him.\n\nThis mentality perfectly combines with the conservative embrace of white supremacy. Claiming that a “white genocide” is underway, even when the data disproves it, becomes a way of being racist while simultaneously laying hands on the mantle of victimhood.\n\nAs they turn a blind eye to still-existing systemic racism in South Africa, conservatives continue to assert that there is no systemic racism in the United States—despite reams of data proving otherwise.\n\nThis is part of the conservative legacy. When he held office in the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan continued to conduct official business with and had diplomatic relations with the apartheid government of South Africa. Reagan looked on as the state pushed those racist policies, and now Trump has welcomed the beneficiaries of that racism with open arms.\n\nDespite Trump’s claims that his new refugee exception supports white South African immigrants who are victims of “white genocide,” it still exists only in myth.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nThis past week, President Donald Trump took a break from bashing immigrants and refugees to grant a special exception to a group of white immigrants from South Africa, many of whom are descended from farmers who benefitted from racist apartheid policies. \n\n\n\nThe decision upset the Episcopal Church, which said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee resettlement.\n\n\n\nWhen asked by a reporter on Monday why he decided to make this exception, Trump doubled down on the right-wing “white genocide” myth. \n\n\n\n“It's a genocide that's taking place.

They're done with all that. What they want is a relationship with Europe that benefits them. All they care about now is something that will put some extra money in their pockets'.\n\nThe agreement in principle, which is expected to be signed by European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa at Lancaster House in London, will also include a defence and security pact that would allow British companies to win contracts from a €150 billion (£125 billion) EU weapons fund. \n\nFirms such as BAE Systems could bid for contracts from the Security Action For Europe (Safe) fund, established in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and fears that Donald Trump could ditch America's Nato commitments.\n\nHowever, a senior diplomatic source last night said that the French government were leading demands for the UK to pay Brussels for the privilege of being allowed access to the fund.\n\nThe source said: 'The figures being discussed are in the hundreds of millions up to possible billions. It would inevitably trigger memories of the days when Britain forked out a fortune to the EU each year'.\n\nThe deal would also require Britain and the EU to 'standardise' mutual defence systems and ensure 'greater interoperability'.\n\n Last night Shadow Defence Secretary James Cartlidge said: 'Labour's Brexit betrayal is in full swing. Whenever they negotiate, Britain loses.\n\n'We have been warning of their backsliding across the board, and now ahead of their Surrender Summit on Monday, fears are growing that Labour might force the British public to cough up as the price of their defence agreements.\n\n'We are Europe's biggest defence power and have led the West in supporting Ukraine – they should be welcoming us, not making absurd demands.\n\n'There must be no more taxpayer money sent to Brussels. We will fight Labour tooth and nail to prevent this.'\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said: 'We should not be putting our army under an EU flag, let alone then paying for the privilege'.\n\nMr Farage has called the youth mobility plan, 'effectively be a back door to free movement of people that will be strongly opposed by Brexit voters', while the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch has claimed it could amount to an 'uncapped migration scheme'.\n\nBut Sir Keir has insisted that it would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, pointing to reciprocal schemes that the UK already has with the likes of Australia.\n\nUnder such agreements, people between the ages of 18 and 35 are allowed to work in each other's countries for two years. \n\nThey are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia. \n\nThe PM told The Times: 'We have a red line in our manifesto about freedom of movement, but youth mobility is not freedom of movement.\n\n'I think the British public are pretty pragmatic, that's what we're known for, which is why I think they will look forward not backwards'.\n\nIt has been calculated that 80 million Europeans would qualify for a British visa if a mobility scheme for under-35s is not capped.\n\nLast night, Downing Street said that the deal would help UK firms 'who face red tape and checks just to export to our nearest and biggest trading partner'; British supermarkets 'who have to pass these costs on to consumers and reduce the availability of products on shelves'; and British families 'who face higher bills, queues on holiday and whose safety and security is harmed by a lack of cooperation between neighbouring countries facing the same global challenges'.\n\nSir Keir said: 'In this time of great uncertainty and volatility, the UK will not respond by turning inwards, but by proudly taking our place on the world stage – strengthening our alliances and closing deals in the interests of British people'.","summary":"The scheme is expected to include a youth mobility scheme - dubbed free movement 'by the back door' - and an agreement to allow EU trawlers to fish in British waters.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14723281/starmer-deal-brussels-eu-urrender-summit-UK-taxpayers.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/17/23/98490881-0-image-a-19_1747522642907.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:57:26","author":"Dan Hodges,Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Dan Hodges","Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.026},{"id":322419882,"title":"We'll continue conducting ICE enforcement operations 'politicians be damned,' says DHS official","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nBig Weekend Show May 17, 2025 09:11 \n\n We'll continue conducting ICE enforcement operations 'politicians be damned,' says DHS official \n DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses ICE operations and former FBI Director James Comey's alleged threat against President Donald Trump on 'The Big Weekend Show.'\n Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE BIG WEEKEND SHOW | VIDEOV-VIDEOPOLITICSUS","summary":"DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin discusses ICE operations and former FBI Director James Comey&apos;s alleged threat against President Donald Trump on &apos;The Big Weekend Show.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6372997099112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/61bc1d33-645d-431d-8ae9-89bc800a079d/e9cc4ffd-9c53-4584-b706-5bff6cb7be54/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:56:32","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.147},{"id":322418130,"title":"Trump tells Walmart to eat the cost of his tariffs instead of raising prices","text":"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Saturday ripped into Walmart, saying on social media that the retail giant should eat the additional costs created by his tariffs.\n\nAs Trump has jacked up import taxes, he has tried to assure a skeptical public that foreign producers would pay for those taxes and that retailers and automakers would absorb the additional expenses. Most economic analyses are deeply skeptical of those claims and have warned that the trade penalties would worsen inflation. Walmart warned on Thursday that everything from bananas to children’s car seats could increase in price.\n\nTrump, in his Truth Social post, lashed out at the retailer, which employs 1.6 million people in the United States. He said the company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, should sacrifice its profits for the sake of his economic agenda that he says will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.\n\n“Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” Trump posted. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected. Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, “EAT THE TARIFFS,” and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!”\n\nThe posting by the Republican president reflected the increasingly awkward series of choices that many major American companies face as a result of his tariffs, from deteriorating sales to the possibility of incurring Trump’s wrath. Trump has similarly warned domestic automakers to not raise their prices, even though outside analyses say his tariffs would raise production costs.\n\nSo far, those tariffs have darkened the mood of an otherwise resilient U.S. economy. The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment on Friday slipped to its second lowest measure on record, with roughly 75% of respondents “spontaneously” mentioning tariffs as they largely expected inflation to accelerate.\n\nIn April, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon was among the retail executives who met with Trump at the White House to discuss tariffs. But the Trump administration went forward despite warnings and has attacked other companies such as Amazon and Apple that are struggling with the disruptions to their supply chains.\n\nWalmart chief financial officer John David Rainey said he thinks $350 car seats made in China will soon cost an additional $100, a 29% price increase.\n\n“We’re wired to keep prices low, but there’s a limit to what we can bear, or any retailer for that matter,” he told The Associated Press on Thursday after the company reported strong first-quarter sales.\n\nThe administration recently ratcheted down its 145% tariffs on China to 30% for a 90-day period. Trump has placed tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada due to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, harming the relationship with America’s two largest trading partners.\n\nThere is a universal baseline tariff of 10% on most countries as Trump promises to reach trade deals in the coming weeks after having shocked the financial markets in early April by charging higher import taxes based on trade deficits with other countries. Trump insists he intends to preserve the tariffs as a revenue source and that a framework agreement with the United Kingdom would largely keep the 10% tariff rate in place.\n\nTrump has also placed import taxes on autos, steel and aluminum and plans to do so on pharmaceutical drugs, among other products.\n\nThe tariffs and Trump’s own reversals on how much he should charge have generated uncertainty across the U.S. economy, such that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has held the central bank’s benchmark rates steady until there is more clarity.

The viral trend coincides with President Donald Trump's unprecedented funding cuts targeting federal parks, forests, monuments, seashores and trails. \n\nThe message of #ParkTok and #MountainTok is G-rated: to conserve and protect public lands. The raunchy content is merely a wrapper to lure followers and get that message in front of as many people as possible. \n\nAt first glance, the TikTok fan accounts for Yellowstone and Joshua Tree -- among dozens of other national parks, forests and recreation sites -- appear to be competing in an unhinged brawl. Some commenters speculate that federal park rangers or marketing strategists have gone rogue to garner outside financial support.\n\nBut the unofficial accounts, which are growing in number daily, are run by independent content creators with no affiliation to the government. According to the National Park Service's Office of Public Affairs, the NPS has no official presence on TikTok, as there are no terms of service between federal agencies and the platform. \n\n\"Viral trends focused on national parks can certainly boost park visibility and drive increased interest and awareness,\" the National Park Service told CNET in an email. \"We appreciate the enthusiasm for our nation's parks and the creative ways individuals share their experiences online.\"\n\nAnd millions of social media followers say they're here for it. Promoting the country's vast landscape and its preservation for future generations could serve as a kind of spiritual uplift in dark times. \n\nNature is sexy; budget cuts aren't \n\nFar beyond the racy adult content, there's a unifying purpose to posting videos of cascading waterfalls, colossal trees, seductive deserts and enchanting wildlife. Researchers have noted that national parks are key to conserving biodiversity and supporting people's well-being. And it seems everyone, not just nature nerds, can get behind these public lands -- US national parks saw a record number of recreation visits last year, nearly 332 million.\n\n\"If you actually love all this stuff, you get attached to that beauty,\" said Kim Tanner, the creator of the Joshua Tree fan account. \"And then you realize you don't want that beauty damaged.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's 2026 budget plan includes slashing more than $1 billion from the National Park Service. It also threatens to axe a whopping $33 billion from national recreation management programs and conservation and preservation grants. The grants are critical to maintaining 433 individual areas of public lands covering more than 85 million acres, which are managed by the NPS.\n\nThe National Parks Conservation Association says the White House's budget reductions are the largest proposed cuts to the National Park Service in its 109-year history and could \"decimate at least 350 National Park sites.\" Many have said Trump is laying the groundwork to sell off public lands and turn recreational areas over to state-level management. \n\nAccording to Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, the NPS has already lost nearly 2,500 employees, or nearly 13% of its staff, in what she calls a \"brain trust exodus\" of environmental experts. \n\n\"What's happening right now, in trying to dismantle the National Park Service from the inside out, is more horrific than anything we've seen before,\" Brengel told me. \n\nGetting wild for the wild \n\nTikTok is controversial, and so is sex. That's precisely why trends like these have political capital, capable of attracting admirers and haters, and bringing everyone else into the conversation. \n\n\"The polarization on social media is reflective of our real-life political polarization,\" said CNET social media reporter Katelyn Chedraoui. \n\nThe #ParkTok and #MountainTok creators, some of whom are former park employees, are all nature lovers who span the political spectrum. Many of the accounts openly denounce the administration's threats against the parks and direct viewers to demonstrations or fundraisers, but the trend isn't overtly partisan or activist-driven. \n\n\"Most of their posts work on a subconscious level, prompting viewers to think about the national parks and their own experiences with them,\" said Chedraoui. \"It's simple but effective.\" \n\nIn fact, the TikTok engagement around public lands originated before the budget cuts to the parks. The first three fan accounts -- Mount Hood, Mount Rainier and Yellowstone -- appeared right after the elections last November. Managed by three friends who are avid outdoor enthusiasts, the accounts put up posts early on that were a mix of comic relief and wilderness awe. \n\nThere wasn't much thirst trap content then. \"It was just waterfalls and vistas and sunsets,\" said Jaime Wash, the creator behind the Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens fan accounts. Then, two of the creators started trolling each other, and folks loved it. \n\nIt was fake beef, but the diss-track template became a winning strategy. By January, the trend started picking up speed, with more fan accounts joining the fray. Over the last several months, the popularity of the posts has seen ebbs and flows -- until fairly recently, when all of #MountainTok and #ParkTok blew up for their risqué content. \n\nPrivate parts in public lands became a magic formula, a kind of viral virility, that the creators knew how to play up. \"Social media users are very used to brands acting unhinged on TikTok,\" said Chedraoui. \n\nA bridge over troubled water\n\nSome critics have slammed the parody accounts, accusing creators of trying to monetize a legitimate cause, or claiming that the sexually charged content damages the parks' reputations. \n\nBut according to the creators, who collaborate regularly in a group chat, making money wasn't, and never will be, their intention. Wash told me that if at any point they do collect a payout for the content, they plan to donate the funds to the parks. \n\nAfter gaining such a huge following, Wash said, she felt it was her responsibility to get people involved. In April, the Mount Hood fan account brought out followers to Portland's Hands Off protest. \n\n\"We're building a community to show that things aren't helpless, that change can happen and we're there for each other,\" Wash said. And besides raising the alarm, the posts add comic relief and entertainment to a daily cycle of doomscrolling and anxiety. \n\nTanner told me that #ParkTok and #MountainTok can help open people's eyes, showing how fragile nature really is. By highlighting endangered animals and the damage from things like logging, drilling and mining, they can help millions of followers understand what's really at stake. \n\nThe surprising power of social media\n\nSocial media acts as a cultural barometer, revealing public sentiment in real time and highlighting the issues that resonate. Platforms like TikTok also give grassroots movements a megaphone, allowing everyday people to bypass traditional media filters and speak directly to broad audiences. \n\n\"We've seen digital action lead to tangible action,\" said Sheila Nguyen, associate director of communications and engagement for the National Parks Conservation Association. \"The more people who see that social media content, the bigger the pool of people who may speak up and the more collective impact we can have,\" Nguyen told CNET in an email. \n\nIn fact, social media publicity has been shown to boost national park visitation. A 2024 research study found that positive social media posts that include photos or videos drive the biggest increases in visitation. \n\n\"The more people we can get into these parks, the better. That way, they can experience it firsthand, see it, fall in love with it, and then want to protect it,\" said Tanner. \n\nThe National Parks Conservation Association urges people to sign up for alerts on its advocacy page so they can raise concerns with congressional representatives. \"We feel that Congress is the best option right now to get the administration to back off of these bad proposals,\" said the NPCA's Brengel. \"Congress needs to be pushed to stop some of these terrible actions.\" \n\nMany TikTok creators I spoke with also said they're advocating ways to hold elected officials accountable. \n\n\"It's heartbreaking to think the places that I absolutely love may never be the same again,\" said Wash, \"and I want to do anything to stop that.\"","summary":"Viral thirst traps on social media are raising eyebrows... and alarm bells about budget cuts.","url":"https://www.cnet.com/news/social-media/tiktoks-raunchy-love-letter-to-the-national-parks-might-actually-save-them/","image":"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9f2b3348f47634e28a38f242c66942c0eb984702/hub/2025/05/17/be1c8060-9e23-4799-9228-05b3eb37c1f9/gettyimages-1042755830.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:30:00","author":"Laura Michelle Davis","authors":["Laura Michelle Davis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.143},{"id":322424388,"title":"Pedro Pascal's fans react to his muscle tank on Cannes red carpet after star fuels plastic surgery rumors","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, May 18th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritain crashes out of Eurovision: UK's Remember Monday avoids nul point humiliation but fail to win over Europe in public vote - as AUSTRIA romps to victory in Switzerland in one of the most politically charged song contests ever\n\nBritish tourist, 36, is left fighting for his life after being 'stabbed and thrown from a car' in horror attack at tourism hotspot - as police launch probe\n\nExplosion in Palm Springs sends shockwaves through the city as images show reproductive center destroyed\n\nDoctors told me my terrible obsessive thoughts were just anxiety, says EVE SIMMONS.

'F**k the people that try to make you scared, you know? And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. And don’t let them win.'\nEddington is set at the height of the COVID pandemic in May 2020 and follows 'a standoff between a small-town sheriff (Phoenix) and mayor (Pascal)' that 'sparks a powder keg as neighbor is pitted against neighbor in Eddington, New Mexico.'\nEarlier in the press conference, the Wild Robot actor was asked about Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n'Obviously, it’s very scary for an actor participating in a movie to sort of speak to issues like this. It’s far too intimidating the question for me to really address, I’m not informed enough,' he said.\n'I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right of history. I’m an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the U.S. after asylum in Denmark.'\n\nHis fans couldn't get enough of his playful behavior or his arms at the the Palais des Festivals for the photo call for his upcoming film Eddington\n\nOne fan shared a photo of Pedro with his arm around Emma Stone and wrote, 'My new religion is pedro pascal's arms' \n\n'Pedro Pascal has been massively serving at #CannesFilmFestival so far,' another X (formerly Twitter ) user wrote, adding that 'the other men don't stand a CHANCE!' \n\nA third fan wrote, 'Every time someone invalidates me for finding a 50 year old man hot, Pedro Pascal validates me by showing up even sexier and hotter than the day before'\nPascal continued: 'If it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. I stand by those protections. I’m too afraid of your question, I hardly remember what it was.'\nWhen Pedro arrived in Cannes earlier this week, his jawline looked remarkably chiseled – prompting plastic surgery rumors. \nSome speculated about the actor getting a 'neck lift' with one writing, 'Fresh neck lift is sitting' and another adding, 'Oh that neck lift did him well!'\nOthers wondered if his prominent jaw was due to weight loss. 'Is he dropping weight for a role?' one asked.\n'He must be hitting the gym because he looks way slimmer.'\n'It's amazing how skinny he looks here vs when he's on a show or something... wonder if he's lost weight recently.'\nMeanwhile, Pedro came to the aid of his co-star Emma Stone when a bee got a little too close to her for her comfort. \nWhile posing for photos alongside Pedro and Austin at the screening of Eddington, the 36-year-old actress' face suddenly twisted in surprise and fear.\n\nA fan really made their point by writing, 'I feel like a Victorian man catching a glimpse of an ankle'\n\nElsewhere on the red carpet, the Materialists star commented on the current climate in U.S. politics and very vociferously said, 'F**k the people who try to make you scared'\n\nHer co-stars started laughing at her reaction as a bee started flying a little too close for comfort and tried to help her swat it away.\nAs she was breaking down over the sudden surprise, her two co-stars tried to save her as Butler attempted to blow the bee away but accidentally made it fly even closer to Stone.\nThen, Pascal waved the bee away with his hand before wrapping his arms around Stone to catch her when her knees' buckled and she pretended to melt away in relief.\nAustin ButlerPedro PascalJoaquin Phoenix\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPedro Pascal's fans react to his muscle tank on Cannes red carpet after star fuels plastic surgery rumors\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It said more than 3,000 have been killed since Israel broke a January ceasefire on March 18.\n\n'Extensive' Israeli airstrikes in Gaza also killed 10 people on Saturday after the IDF announced an intensified operation aimed at defeating Hamas, rescuers said.\n\nThe announcement came after hundreds have died following days of strikes across the besieged territory, according to Gaza's health ministry. \n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said on its Hebrew X account that it had mobilised troops for 'Operation Gideon's Chariots' to seize 'strategic areas' of the strip.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed earlier in the week to escalate pressure on Hamas to destroy the militant group that has ruled the Palestinian enclave for nearly two decades. \n\nThe latest strikes began on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump concluded his four-day trip to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe stepped-up campaign came as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continued to worsen after Israel imposed an aid blockade on the strip in March - leaving one of the territory's last functioning hospitals unable to get supplies.\n\nThe army announced in a post that it had begun the 'initial stages' of the new offensive, part of 'the expansion of the battle in the Gaza Strip, with the goal of achieving all the war's objectives, including the release of the abducted and the defeat of Hamas'.\n\nIt said it had 'launched extensive strikes and transferred forces to seize control of areas within the Gaza Strip'.\n\nGaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said 10 bodies had been brought to hospitals after strikes on Saturday morning.\n\nThree people were killed and four wounded in drone strikes east of the southern city of Khan Yunis, he said, while three others were killed and several wounded in the bombing of a house in Jabalia, in the north.\n\nAn attack on an apartment northwest of Khan Yunis killed three people, he added, while one person was killed and five wounded, 'including a girl, a young woman and a pregnant woman', in a strike on a tent west of the same city.\n\nThe civil defence agency said Israeli strikes had killed at least 100 people the day before.\n\nIsrael resumed its offensive in Gaza on March 18, ending a two-month truce in its war against Hamas triggered by the group's October 2023 attack.\n\nThe return to fighting has drawn international condemnation, with the UN human rights chief on Friday denouncing the renewed attacks and what he described as an apparent push to permanently displace Gaza's Palestinian inhabitants.\n\n'This latest barrage of bombs... and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,' Volker Turk said in a statement.\n\nThe main Israeli campaign group representing the families of hostages said that by extending the fighting, Netanyahu was missing a 'historic opportunity' to return their loved ones through diplomacy.\n\nHamas on Friday demanded the United States press Israel to lift the aid blockade in return for a US-Israeli hostage recently released by the group.\n\nEdan Alexander, the last living hostage with US nationality, was freed after direct engagement with the Trump administration that left Israel sidelined.\n\nSenior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said that as part of the group's understanding with Washington regarding Alexander's release, Hamas was 'awaiting and expecting the US administration to exert further pressure' on Israel to restore aid.\n\nIsrael says its decision to cut off aid to Gaza was intended to force concessions from Hamas, which still holds dozens of Israeli hostages seized during the attack that sparked the war.\n\nBut Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure to lift the blockade, as UN agencies warn of critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines.\n\nMarwan Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, said the situation there on Saturday was 'catastrophic after its surroundings were targeted again this morning, causing the collapse of ceilings and cracks in the walls'.\n\n'The operating rooms and intensive care units are completely full and we are unable to receive any more critical cases,' he said, adding there was 'a severe shortage of blood units, medicines, medical and therapeutic supplies, and surgical procedures'.\n\nUS President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday that 'a lot of people are starving'.\n\n'We're looking at Gaza. And we're going to get that taken care of,' Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi, on a regional tour that excluded key ally Israel.\n\nThe Arab League is to meet in Baghdad on Saturday to discuss regional crises, with Gaza expected to be high on the agenda.\n\nThe Hamas attack of October 7, 2023 resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.\n\nOf the 251 hostages taken during the attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.\n\nThe health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 2,985 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war's overall toll to 53,119.\n\nEarlier this week, a new humanitarian organisation that has US backing to take over aid delivery said it expects to begin operations before the end of the month - after what it describes as key agreements from Israeli officials.\n\nA statement from the group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, identified several US military veterans, former humanitarian coordinators and security contractors that it said would lead the delivery effort.\n\nMany in the humanitarian community, including the UN, said they will not participate because the system does not align with humanitarian principles and won't be able to meet the needs of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nA statement on Friday by Tom Fletcher, the United Nations' humanitarian chief, said the plan is \"rooted in the non-negotiable principles\" and that the UN has people ready to deliver assistance. He demanded the rapid, safe and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry Dr Majed Al-Ansari, a spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry, previously told the Mail's 'Apocalypse Now?' podcast that Israel 's continued bombardment of Gaza risks fanning the flames of extremism in the region.\n\nSpeaking to the Mail's special correspondent David Patrikarakos, he also confirmed that talks are ongoing with the Trump administration to replace Air Force One with a $400 million luxury Qatari plane.","summary":"The controversial proposal allegedly shows military zones cordoned off exclusively for troops in the north, centre and south of the territory, while civilian areas exist in between.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14723241/Israel-split-Palestine-leaked-map-Hamas.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/17/23/98489601-0-image-a-2_1747519551232.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:27:57","author":"Editor,Ruth Stainer","authors":["Editor","Ruth Stainer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.198},{"id":322415654,"title":"Krisis Gaza jadi tumpuan Sidang Kemuncak Liga Arab di Baghdad","text":"ANKARA: Presiden Palestin, Mahmoud Abbas, menggesa negara-negara Arab untuk mengguna pakai pelan bersama bagi menamatkan perang Israel yang berterusan ke atas Gaza.\n\nAnadolu Ajansi (AA) melaporkan beliau menyuarakan perkara itu ketika pemimpin-pemimpin berhimpun di Baghdad untuk menghadiri Sidang Kemuncak Liga Arab Ke-34, semalam.\n\nAbbas turut mencadangkan satu persidangan antarabangsa diadakan di Kaherah bagi membiayai dan melaksanakan pembinaan semula Gaza yang menurutnya sudah tidak lagi boleh didiami kini.\n\nSelain itu, beliau menyatakan kesediaan untuk mengadakan Pilihan Raya Presiden serta badan perundangan pada 2025, sebaik saja syarat-syarat yang sesuai diwujudkan di Tebing Barat, Gaza dan Baitulmaqdis.\n\nPersidangan dihoskan oleh Iraq untuk kali pertama sejak 2012 itu diadakan di tengah-tengah kempen ketenteraan Israel di Gaza.\n\nMenurut sumber Palestin, serangan berterusan Israel telah meragut lebih 53,000 nyawa rakyat Palestin sejak Oktober 2023.\n\nPresiden Iraq, Abdul Latif Rashid, mengecam apa yang disifatkannya sebagai 'pencerobohan Israel yang berterusan'.\n\nMalah, beliau menolak sebarang percubaan untuk memindahkan rakyat Palestin dari Gaza atas apa jua alasan.\n\n\"Keselamatan bersama Arab tidak boleh dipecahkan,\" katanya sambil menggesa negara-negara Arab agar bekerjasama mengekalkan kestabilan serantau.\n\nMenteri Luar Bahrain, Abdullatif Al-Zayani selaku Pengerusi persidangan ke-33 yang lalu, menegaskan sokongan Bahrain terhadap pembinaan semula Gaza dan usaha mengekalkan gencatan senjata.\n\nPresiden Mesir, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, meminta Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS), Donald Trump, meningkatkan tekanan bagi gencatan senjata segera di Gaza.\n\nBeliau memberi amaran bahawa tanpa penubuhan sebuah negara Palestin, kestabilan sebenar serantau akan sukar dicapai walaupun Israel memperoleh lebih banyak perjanjian normalisasi.\n\nPerdana Menteri Sepanyol, Pedro Sanchez yang turut menghadiri persidangan itu, berkata: \"Palestin sedang berdarah di depan mata kita.\"\n\nBeliau turut mengumumkan inisiatif bersama Palestin di Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (PBB) untuk mendesak penamatan sekatan ke atas Gaza.\n\nSanchez mencadangkan empat keutamaan segera -

Police said that Ferreira De Oliveira in February used a phone cord in an assault on her 16-year-old daughter, according to Boston-based station WBUR.An ICE spokesman told WBUR Ferreira De Oliveira, a native of Brazil, was taken into custody because she is in the country illegally, and that the state criminal charges are a separate matter.While initial proceedings took place on her case, Ferreira De Oliveira remained in ICE detention at the Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island.The arrest, however, caused deep distress within the community, as several people tried to intervene, with many begging the local police not to assist ICE in arresting Ferreira De Oliveira.In response, Batista and Saucier released three videos that total around one hour of footage of body camera footage from Worcester police who arrived amid the chaos as people tried to help push back against ICE agents.\"The footage of a family being torn apart is disturbing to watch but the municipality cannot interfere in or prevent a federal detainment,\" Batista said in a statement. \"As a community, we must come together in support of one another and not allow external forces to divide us.\"Police did intervene as Ferreira De Oliveira's daughter tried to chase down the vehicle that took her mother away, crying and screaming hysterically as police tried to subdue her. She was then arrested, but Saucier has requested the court to dismiss the case. He stressed, however, that interference during the execution of official duties \"is never acceptable.\"According to WBUR, 911 calls described over two dozen people surrounding ICE agents. In another snippet, someone demanded that Saucier arrive at the scene to intervene.Batista on Friday also issued an executive order that will prohibit local police from participating in enforcing immigration laws, except in the case of officer safety.What People Are SayingWorcester Police Chief Paul Saucier in a Saturday email to Newsweek said: \"To ensure transparency and provide a clearer perspective of the incident, we are releasing the dispatch calls and body-worn camera footage. By doing so, we aim to illustrate the chaotic nature of the situation as experienced by the officers who had to make rapid, critical decisions in the moment to ensure the safety of everyone on the scene.\"He added: \"Given the totality of circumstances, the Worcester Police Department is requesting that the Court dismiss the case against the juvenile that was arrested during the incident, but it is important to emphasize that assaulting or interfering with law enforcement officers as they carry out their duties is never acceptable. The Worcester Police Department remains committed to fulfilling our responsibilities of protecting all residents of the City of Worcester.\"City Manager Eric Batista in a statement to News 10 Boston said: \"I recognize the significant impact this incident has had on our community. It has created division and caused trauma to the individuals directly involved and to the greater community at large. It is my hope that releasing all of the body-worn camera footage and establishing a clear policy on how municipal employees are to engage with ICE agents is the first step in repairing any unintentional harm and can help determine how, as a community and a municipality, we respond in these situations.\"He continued: \"I want to be undeniably clear that our Police Department will never target individuals based on their immigration status. The body-worn camera footage from the first responding officer will show that the target of ICE's operation was already detained by federal agents prior to WPD's arrival and that WPD did not assist ICE with the civil arrest. The footage of a family being torn apart is disturbing to watch but the municipality cannot interfere in or prevent a federal detainment. As a community, we must come together in support of one another and not allow external forces to divide us. Worcester has always and will always be a welcoming and inclusive city.\"What Happens Next?The courts will convene on Monday to continue mediating the case of Ferreira De Oliveira, and it may vacate the daughter's arrest.","summary":"The arrest of Brazilian national Rosane Ferreira De Oliveira has caused deep upset in Worcester, Massachusetts.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-dozens-neighbors-confront-ice-agents-arrest-attempt-2073681","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2646710/worcester-mother-arrest-brazilian-national.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:17:05","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.543},{"id":322424416,"title":"UK To Strike New Deal With EU In Coming Days: PM's Office","text":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to sign a new deal with the EU seeking to reset ties after Brexit, his office said Saturday ahead of landmark talks.Starmer will meet on Monday with EU chiefs for the first post-Brexit EU-UK summit aimed at agreeing steps towards a closer relationship between Britain and the 27-country bloc which it left five years ago after an acrimonious and knife-edge referendum.\"This week, the prime minister will strike yet another deal that will deliver in the national interest of this country,\" Downing Street said in a statement, also pointing to recent trade deals with the United States and India.Starmer will welcome EU bosses Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa as well as top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas for Monday's talks at the storied Lancaster House venue in London.\"The prime minister will set out how a strengthened, forward-looking partnership with the European Union will deliver for working people and lead to more money in pockets,\" the statement said.Talks looked set however to go down to the wire due to last-minute squabbling over long-standing issues, such as fishing rights and food checks.But negotiators were hopeful of at least signing a defence and security partnership.Starmer, elected Labour prime minister last July, wants a deeper relationship with the European Union than the one negotiated by the previous Conservative government.That deal \"isn't working for anyone\", Starmer's office said. The move is aimed at opening the door to closer cooperation as both the EU and Britain race to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears the United States under President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.That should mean more regular security talks, Britain considering joining EU military missions and the potential for London to fully tap into a 150-billion-euro ($167-billion) defence fund being set up by the bloc.But Starmer has several red lines he has said he will not cross, while sticking points remain over some EU demands that threaten to stall the rapprochement.In an interview with The Times on Saturday, Starmer said a deal would be a \"really significant moment\".Starmer has ruled out rejoining the customs union and single market but has suggested that the UK is ready for regulatory alignment with the EU on food and agricultural products.EU diplomats in Brussels have been working on getting Britain to keep its waters open for European fishermen in return for easing the checks on some food imports from the UK.And Starmer appeared to have made a key concession by agreeing to an EU demand and clearing the way to let young Europeans live and work in Britain under a youth mobility scheme.While freedom of movement was a \"red line,\" he told The Times, \"youth mobility is not freedom of movement\".Starmer is approaching the scheme cautiously under pressure from rising support for Nigel Farage's anti-immigration and Euro-sceptic party Reform UK, which made huge gains in local elections earlier this month.Starmer said late Saturday in a statement that on Monday \"we take another step forwards, with yet more benefits for the United Kingdom as the result of a strengthened partnership with the European Union\".\"In this time of great uncertainty and volatility, the UK will not respond by turning inwards, but by proudly taking our place on the world stage.\"","summary":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to sign a new deal with the EU seeking to reset ties after Brexit, his office said Saturday ahead of landmark talks.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/uk-strike-new-deal-eu-coming-days-pms-office-3773859","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4601451/britains-prime-minister-keir-starmer-will-soon-meet-eu-chiefs-their-first-post-brexit-eu-uk.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:15:25","author":"Jo Biddle","authors":["Jo Biddle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.097},{"id":322424418,"title":"Bomb At Fertility Clinic In California Kills One","text":"An explosion outside a California fertility clinic Saturday killed one person in what the local mayor described as a bomb attack.The blast ripped through downtown Palm Springs, badly damaging the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of other nearby buildings, in what the city's police chief said appeared to have been a deliberate act.\"The blast appears to be an intentional act of violence and the blast extends for blocks with several buildings damaged, some severely,\" Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said.\"There has been one fatality, the person's identity is not known.\"Eyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centers clinic, which appeared to have been badly damaged in the blast.A statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt when the blast went off.\"This morning, an unexpected and tragic incident occurred outside our Palm Springs facility when a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building,\" it said.\"We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected. \"We are immensely grateful to share that no members of the ARC team were harmed, and our lab -- including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials -- remains fully secure and undamaged.\"Reproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remain controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons.Violence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of.US Attorney Bill Essayli said his office was aware of the blast.\"FBI is on scene and will be investigating whether this was an intentional act,\" he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.The local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, reported five people were injured in the explosion and the person who died was a suspect in the blast.

Here Are Top American Companies Worth Investing In.","text":"The United States, like all countries, has gone through its share of ups and downs -- from soaring economies to recessions, from times of peace to wars. Most recently, President Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports has rocked the financial markets, as investors worry about the impact of tariffs on prices -- and eventually on the economy.\n\nBut through thick and thin, famous investor Warren Buffett has firmly remained a supporter of his country and U.S. companies. Back in 2008, with the financial crisis raging, the billionaire wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, clearly saying the financial world was \"a mess\" and the general economy wasn't looking much better.\n\nDuring those troubled times, Buffett was doing one thing -- and it's something that might surprise you. He was buying U.S. stocks.\n\n\"Bad news is an investor's best friend,\" Buffett wrote. \"It lets you buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price.\"\n\nFast-forward to 2025, and Buffett's message and strategy haven't changed. (And why should they? Buffett's method has led Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating returns over 59 years.) At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting recently, the billionaire said he felt lucky to have been born in the U.S. and encouraged investors not to worry that the country hasn't solved every problem it's encountered -- his words suggest that, because the U.S. constantly has changed, evolved, and been resilient, there's reason to be optimistic about the future.\n\nWith this Buffett wisdom in mind, here are some top American companies worth investing in right now.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nWhat better way to start this list than with a Warren Buffett favorite? Buffett bought shares of Coca-Cola (KO 0.56%), the world's largest nonalcoholic drinks maker, over a seven-year period starting in the late 1980s. And he's held on ever since. Buffett likes this company for its solid moat -- its strong brand and established global presence -- as well as its commitment to dividend growth.\n\nThough Coca-Cola is a household name around the world, the company's flagship market is North America, which brought in almost $19 billion in revenue last year. That's nearly 40% of total revenue.\n\nIn an environment of tariff uncertainty, Coca-Cola is a great stock to own because the business relies on local suppliers and bottlers in each of its markets. This reduces the need to import, and therefore cuts the tariff exposure. The company said during an analyst call last month that it expects \"minor impacts\" and is confident about its ability to manage the tariff situation.\n\nSo if you buy Coca-Cola stock, you can benefit from this quality business and passive income over time -- and in the near term, tariff worries won't keep you up at night.\n\n2. Palantir Technologies\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR 1.00%) prides itself on its work with the U.S. government. In fact, this Denver-based software company in its earlier days generated most of its revenue and growth thanks to contracts with the government.\n\nRecently, though, its commercial business has exploded higher, and Palantir has worked with international companies and governments too. But the U.S. remains its biggest business, representing 71% of total revenue in the recent quarter.\n\nSo, Palantir depends greatly on the health of American businesses and the spending of the U.S. government. This has worked out well so far, with revenue growth soaring, and the company is so optimistic about the future that it recently raised several forecasts for the full year, including its revenue outlook.\n\nPalantir, using artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platforms, helps customers aggregate and make better use of their data. As companies and governments rush to apply AI to their projects and gain efficiency, Palantir could see bright days ahead. That makes it a great stock for growth investors to buy and hold right now.\n\n3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX 0.95%) is the global leader in cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment, with blockbuster drug Trikafta helping the company generate $11 billion in product revenue last year. The biotech just launched a new CF drug, Alyftrek, as well as a non-opioid painkiller called Journavx that's expected to create another billion-dollar franchise for the company.\n\nThough Vertex sells its products internationally, it makes most of its revenue -- 60% of total revenue last year -- in the U.S. And the following is very important in a context of import tariff uncertainty: Vertex produces its CF drugs primarily in the U.S., limiting exposure to these extra costs.\n\nBut Vertex isn't only a tariff safe haven. It's also a company that has proven its ability to innovate, produce game-changing drugs, and generate growth. Its newest product launches should keep that momentum going and lead to more share price growth over the long run. So when you buy shares of Vertex, you're adding a fantastic growth stock to your portfolio -- and betting on America at the same time.\n\nYour dog, cat, or goldfish may know Chewy (CHWY 0.71%) very well. That's because this e-commerce company sells everything your pet may need, from food and toys to health insurance. And Chewy even recently launched vet clinics, a great move to add a new revenue stream and potentially introduce new customers to its e-commerce offerings.\n\nThough Chewy expanded into Canada in recent years, it makes most of its revenue in the U.S. So the company depends on the buying power of the U.S. consumer for growth. This has worked out nicely in recent years, as Chewy has steadily increased revenue and profit.\n\nCHWY Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nAnd Chewy has developed a loyal customer base, as we can see through Autoship -- a service that automatically reorders and ships your favorite products to you. Autoship sales now make up 80% of total sales.\n\nWhat about the issue of tariffs plaguing the market these days? Chewy says it has \"very small exposure\" to China -- the country most impacted by the U.S. tariff plan -- thanks to its reliance on local sources for many products, making it a great buy for investors seeking safety along with growth for their portfolios right now.\n\n5. American Express\n\nFinally, I'll finish off this list with another stock Buffett holds in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. Like Coca-Cola, it's a long-term position and one that offers Buffett security, dividend growth, and exposure to the U.S. economy.\n\nI'm talking about American Express (AXP -0.02%), which issues credit cards around the world -- but the U.S. remains its biggest market. For example, U.S. consumer and business customers made up 67% of American Express's total worldwide network volume in the 2024 full year.\n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to invest in a credit card company now as economic uncertainty remains -- but American Express actually makes a fantastic buy during these times. Since the company has a large base of affluent customers, who are less sensitive to tough economies, it actually holds up well during these environments. In the first quarter of this year, American Express reported an 8% increase in revenue and cited \"the power of our premium customer base.\"\n\nOn top of this, millennials and those in Gen-Z make up American Express's fastest-growing U.S. customer group, and this popularity with a young crowd shows potential for more growth down the road.\n\nAll this means Buffett favorite American Express may be a surefire way to bet on the strength of the U.S. consumer, today and over time.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-remains-optimistic-about-america/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F818422%2Fwarren-buffett-1-tmf-2015.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:10:00","author":"Adria Cimino","authors":["Adria Cimino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":322416266,"title":"‘Fight back’: Pedro Pascal urges Cannes to resist US political pressure","text":"Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal has called on members of the film industry to “fight back” and keep expressing themselves amid what he appeared to describe as a political climate of fear in the United States.\n\n“F*** the people that try to make you scared.

I don’t want to see that decline for one more day. That means a genuine, serious engagement with a new leadership team and new agenda, and one that I will personally drive.” \n\nThere is no question Ms Ley’s election is a milestone for the Liberals. \n\nWhether it is enough to finally solve the problem that has been haunting the party for over decade – the so-called one it has with women – remains to be seen. \n\n‘It didn’t start at the last election’\n\nThe Australian National University (ANU) found female Coalition voters had dropped from 45 per cent in 2013 to just 33 per cent at this year’s election, while an Australian Financial Review/Freshwater poll published in March showed just 28 per cent of women preferred Mr Dutton for prime minister. \n\nAccording to a 2013 study by the University of Wollongong, a party leader’s gender is but one of a multitude of factors that women consider when determining their vote. \n\nA decade later, you only have to look at the US to see that is still the case. \n\nIn November, Kamala Harris became the second female presidential candidate to fail at breaking the highest glass ceiling in American politics, and the second to be trounced by Donald Trump, following his landslide victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. \n\nNot only was the Republican the more desirable candidate for white women over the age of 45, but fewer females voted for Ms Harris than they did for former President Joe Biden. \n\n‘Parties are more likely to be the holdup’\n\nAustralian voters have shown – on a local, state and federal level – that they are “not opposed” to voting for women. \n\nWhat is “more likely to be the hold-up”, La Trobe University political researcher Phoebe Hayman told news.com.au, are the parties themselves. \n\nEarlier this month, West Australian teal independent Kate Chaney told reporters that the Liberals’ 2018 rejection of Julie Bishop in favour of Scott Morrison as leader was its “sliding doors moment”, where “a lot of women looked … and thought, this does not look like a party that represents me”. \n\nThe Hume-Loughnane review of the 2022 election loss similarly found that defectors in teal seats were highly likely to agree with the statement that “the treatment or attitude toward women within the Liberal Party had a strong influence on my vote”. \n\nThe perception of female politicians as more compassionate, collegial and caring – all attributes that are seen as important during internal crises – “may be what is needed within the Liberal Party as it goes through a period of reflection”, Ms Hayman said. \n\n“However, women leaders are often punished for not adequately embodying masculine leadership traits when things improve, particularly by those within their party,” she continued.\n\n“Research shows women party leaders are more likely than men to have short tenures that end by either being pushed out or pressured to resign.” \n\nOn Friday, Today host Karl Stefanovic asked Ms Ley point-blank if sexism was the reason it had taken the Liberals “so long to elect a female leader”. \n\nThough Ms Ley responded she was “incredibly humbled to have the endorsement of my party room”, Australia Institute Chief Political Analyst Amy Remeikis told news.com.au the fact she only beat Angus Taylor by four votes - her 29 to his 25 - was worth noting.\n\n“Sussan Ley’s biggest issue is that there is no sign the party is united behind her,” Ms Remeikis said. \n\n“About half the party room does not want her as leader. And being a woman doesn’t mean that the party’s men-driven issues are solved, because the same people who supported Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton are still there. \n\n“Ley was also a defender of many of the policies Morrison and Dutton had in place and has shown she is just as willing to engage in reactionary politics and culture wars.” \n\n‘There is no opportunity for a circuit-breaker’\n\nWhat the Liberals can – or will – do now to reconnect with their female voter base is unclear.\n\nGiven Mr Dutton failed to produce any policy that spoke to women, the party might consider offerings in such areas as the environment, education and healthcare, Ms Hayman said, which female voters tend to prioritise.\n\nThe Labor Party now boasts a majority female government for the first time, with women outnumbering men in the lower house. However this was achieved almost three decades after the party made the decision to set gender quotas in the 1990s.\n\nThe Liberal Party did not follow suit, opting for “targets” instead despite Mr Morrison’s suggestion that quotas be considered in 2021. \n\nIt also “does not have” the 30-ish years Labor did to turn things around – an impossible feat unless it has “a complete rethink of who the modern Liberal Party is”, Ms Remeikis said. \n\n“Labor was also able to do that because of the federated nature of the party, where the Liberal Party has always prided itself on being led by its base,” she added.\n\n“But that means if the base and branches don’t want to see change and are doubling down on the direction of the party, then there is no opportunity for a circuit-breaker.” \n\n‘Liberals are in an electoral blackhole’\n\n“Symbolic representation” may be a good start, Ms Hayman said, “but symbolism alone won’t fix the party’s problems”. \n\n“For women to substantively represented in politics and to have women’s issues prioritised in policy platforms, they need to hold a critical mass within their party, giving them the confidence to come forward with opinions, perspectives and to support each other in party ballots,” she said.","summary":"Sussan Ley’s appointment as the Liberals’ first female leader is significant – but it may not be enough to fix the

combination of advanced 3D scanning, artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies.\nThe digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo in Zhangye, a fifth-tier city in Gansu province, is part of a nationwide push to bring China’s ancient history to life and engage new generations through the use of technology.\nIn elaborate Tangut attire that glimmers with digital silk, the princess interacts with visitors via a touch screen at Dafo Temple, home to China’s largest indoor reclining Buddha statue, dating back to the Western Xia dynasty of 1038-1227.\nAccording to Beijing’s official narrative, the short-lived empire which neighboured the Song dynasty was a melting pot of Tibetan, Uygur and Han cultures, and an early example of the integration of China’s various ethnic groups, now a central theme of its ethnic policy.\nThe digital princess in China’s backwaters is exemplary of the country’s strong push for digitalisation of thousands of museums and cultural heritage over the past decade.\nDespite economic challenges from the pandemic and geopolitical tensions, Beijing continues investing in cultural initiatives to preserve history, strengthen national pride, promote technological progress and enhance soft power in hope of building a “cultural superpower”.\nThis was in contrast to many Western countries like the United States, who are cutting funding for cultural heritage and museums, observers said.\n“Where the West often sees museum technology as a potential budgetary casualty, China sees it as a geopolitical asset and a powerful tool for cultural soft power,” said Simon Li Ka-ho, a Hong-Kong based digital humanities specialist.\nNeil Schmid – the first and only Western scholar hired by the Dunhuang Academy in Gansu – noted that the Chinese government “continues to treat – and invest in – heritage as a strategic asset: a source of national pride, a tool of soft power, and increasingly, a driver of regional economic development through tourism and digital cultural industries.”\n\nChina’s backing for museum digitalisation is deeply rooted in its strategic goals.\nSince coming to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasised the need to “let the cultural relics in the museums, the heritage on the vast land, and the words written in the ancient books come alive”, to tap into China’s cultural and historical roots and boost national pride.\nEntry to China’s museums has been free since 2008, while the digitisation of historical documents has been going on since 2020.\nThe country’s 14th five-year plan, which covers 2021–2025, includes the goal of making China a “museum superpower” by 2035 through a combination of better protection of cultural relics and sci-tech innovation.\nJianfei Yang, head of the cultural industries management department at Communication University of China in Beijing, said the policy framework was “systematic and comprehensive”, providing top-down support for various aspects of digitisation, from protection and research to exhibition and talent development.\nYin Kou, an associate professor at the National Institute for Cultural Development at Wuhan University, has researched China’s museum digitalisation policies over the past three decades.\n“A culturally strong nation has become the central goal of China’s national strategy and museums serve as important platforms for fostering cultural confidence, preserving Chinese civilisation, and meeting the people’s aspirations for a better life,” he said.\n\nDespite economic challenges, spending on cultural heritage and museums has continued to rise.\nSpending on museums and memorial halls grew faster than other public cultural expenditure between 1996 and 2015, which itself outpaced GDP, according to government data and research papers.\nBetween 2016 and 2021, museum expenditure grew at an average of 11.79 per cent annually. By the end of 2023, the number of museums in China had grown to 6,833, compared to 4,165 in 2013.\nThis support is available to museums of all sizes. The Ministry of Finance said in March that 5.82 billion yuan (US$804 million) in transfer payments last year supported 50,000 grass-roots cultural facilities such as museums and libraries, and the total was expected to grow in 2025.\n“China’s sustained fiscal commitment to cultural heritage – especially in the realm of digitalisation – demonstrates a deep recognition of the long-term value of cultural infrastructure,” Schmid said.\n“This policy continuity reflects a broader vision in which culture is not peripheral but central to China’s national development agenda – and a major contrast with what’s currently happening in the US.”\nUnique funding model\nPublic funding for cultural heritage institutions has declined globally since 2022, according to a February report by the International Council for Museums that surveyed hundreds of facilities across six continents.\nChina was a “notable exception” to the trend, with the government’s “generous funding” enabling museums to “undertake expansive projects with greater confidence”, it said.\nThe report described the Chinese model as “unique”, noting that its state-owned museums were benefiting from “relatively stable public funding, with strategic increases during economic downturns to ensure operational stability”.\n\nIn the US, President Donald Trump has disrupted the art world with a number of executive orders since returning to the White House in January.\nLast month, representatives from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the National Gallery of Art to discuss its legal status, amid spending cuts that have included an 85 per cent reduction in National Endowment for the Humanities grants.\nEmeritus professor Kirk Denton from Ohio State University’s department of East Asian languages and literatures, said most Chinese museums were state-funded. He noted there was a growing number of private museums, mostly focused on fine arts, that did not receive government support but were still subject to state regulations.\nObservers said that the difference were in how China viewed its cultural resources and its socialist system of resource allocation.\nAccording to Yang, protecting cultural heritage is a “public good and government responsibility”, as these assets belong to the nation and its people. Once decided, the country will concentrate resources to build a “cultural superpower”.\nThis differed from some other countries where market forces played a larger role in the management and utilisation of heritage sites due to limited government funds, he said.\nYang also noted that digitalisation supported Beijing’s goal to boost domestic cultural and tourism consumption – using new technologies to create innovative business models based on traditional heritage and museums.\n\nEugene Chng, dean of the school of culture and creativity at Beijing Normal-Baptist University in Zhuhai, called the US approach to museums and libraries “tragic”.\nDescribing these institutions as guardians of a nation’s knowledge, history and identity, Chng said China’s “deep and enduring” history set it apart from those centuries-old countries, adding that its use of digital technology offered much potential.\nHe also highlighted the importance of China’s “top-down approach”, which he said underpinned its stability and success. “[The method] is particularly important in a world that is fragmented, in societies that lack a national direction and are in need of cohesion.”\nVisitor numbers surge\nChina’s support for the digitalisation of museums also served its purpose of nurturing patriotic education and shaping historical memory and national unity narratives, academics said.\nThe National Cultural Heritage Administration is marking International Museum Day on Sunday with a call for more collaboration between museums and schools, as well as activities that “enhance knowledge dissemination, moral cultivation and social consensus-building”.\nThe emphasis on the educational role of museums is a result of the Chinese leader’s trip a decade ago to Xian, one of China’s oldest capitals. During his visit, Xi said that “a museum is a university”.\nBetween 2013 and 2023, the number of museum visitors in China doubled, from 74 million to 140 million, with children under 18 the fastest-growing group, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.\n\nHong Kong-based Li, who is also a senior non-residential fellow in genocide education at the University of Southern California (USC), attributed the rise in part to digital tools that “transform passive viewing into immersive learning”.\n“Museums are now ‘epistemological engines’, teaching history, identity, and ethics through extended reality, interactive games, and AI-facilitated storytelling. And when you combine tech with moral memory, one builds not just knowledge – but values,” he said.\nIn Nanjing, the Memorial Hall for the Victims of the Nanking Massacre features an interactive exhibit developed by the USC Shoah Foundation which enables visitors to interact with a recorded survivor who responds to questions in real time using natural-language technology.\nSimilarly, a small museum in Nanning offers visitors the opportunity to be immersed in a digital recreation of the Communist Party’s first Congress and unlock seven pivotal scenes from its founding.\nWhat are the downsides?\nWhile technology can bring history to life for young museum visitors, there are risks to China’s centralised, state-led public expenditure model, according to Li, who warned that “narrative control might marginalise diverse interpretations of history, an issue digital platforms tend to amplify via algorithmic reinforcement”.\nDenton from Ohio State University said that while Chinese museums received more government support than those in the US, there was a “political motivation” behind the funding.\n“The Chinese government finds it expedient to use museums to propagate social and moral values, historical narratives … Museums are also about ‘soft power’, projecting an image of China’s long cultural tradition and its present achievements to a global audience,” he said.\nChina has sought to attract more overseas tourists to boost post-pandemic economic growth and improve its global image. Last year, it welcomed 20 million visa-free visitors, a 112.3 per cent increase from 2023, according to the National Immigration Administration.\n\nMore museums are offering AI-powered audio guides in multiple languages to serve those visitors, though pre-booking systems can be challenging.\nSeveral research reports have found that history-related collections have been the fastest growing museum category in China over the past three decades.\nIn recent years, China’s museums have taken on the role of promoting ethnic unity and correcting “wrong historical views”, aligning with Xi’s call to “tell China’s story well” by focusing on archaeology and cultural research that strengthen Beijing’s portrayal of a seamless legacy, emphasising China’s long-standing status as a global power with ancient roots.\nIn April, Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, said museums should challenge narratives that divide Han and minority cultures – a long-time headache for the party – and represent the country as “diverse but unified”.\nThe virtual princess in Zhangye is an example of this approach. In a December report on the digitalisation of China’s cultural relics, Tencent said that she helped visitors understand how the Tangut people and other ethnic groups interacted and merged along the Silk Road.\nDenton, who specialises in museum culture and historical memory in Greater China, noted that museums taught lessons from history that were consistent with the ideology of the state.\n“In China, they exalt revolutionary heroes and martyrs, glorify past leaders, promote the [Communist Party’s] central role in ending the ‘century of humiliation’ and in the modernisation of China,” he said.\nIn this sense, digitalisation is especially crucial because many of China’s cultural relics were looted during the “century of humiliation” which began with the first opium war of 1839-1842.\nMore than 10 million artefacts, including sculptures from the Mogao Caves and treasures from Yuanmingyuan in Beijing, also known as the Old Summer Palace, were taken abroad and scattered worldwide.\n\nSince physical restoration is often impossible, digital technology allows for virtual reconstructions of these lost sites and artefacts.\nFor example, the Digital Yuanmingyuan Project, led by Tsinghua University, uses immersive VR experiences and 720-degree projections that allow people to explore the Old Summer Palace virtually.\nMore than 80 researchers have created detailed digital replicas of 108 scenic areas of the palace, using historical documents, drawings and photographs made before its destruction in the second opium war.\nVirtual reconstructions\nBreakthroughs in key technologies have established a foundation for China’s cultural heritage protection and innovation system. Reinforcing technological leadership was also part of China’s museum digitalisation strategy, analysts said.\nAccording to Wuhan University’s Kou, the integration of digital technology with museums reflected China’s “combined commitment” to cultural confidence and self-reliance, aiming to build a “strong socialist cultural and technological nation”.\nChng, who has trained in digital museology and heritage technology and curated exhibitions with multiple museums, said that China was not only seeking to be at the forefront of digital innovation in automotive industries, manufacturing and services, but also in the cultural sector.\nThe use of technology to enhance exhibits, as well as “new ways of studying and communicating heritage using large language models affirm China’s position as a global innovator, and strengthens its national image”, he said.\n\nRiding the waves of policy support, tech giants are actively taking part in different stages of the digitalisation of China’s cultural heritage.\nSince 2017, Tencent has partnered with the Dunhuang Academy to preserve the Unesco World Heritage site’s Mogao Caves by making the murals, sculptures and other examples of Buddhist art more accessible through technology.\nThe collaboration has resulted in a Digital Dunhuang exhibition that showcases efforts to preserve the art by using 3D technology to digitally scan the caves, so that replicas can be created in various museums.\nByteDance, another tech giant, is also supporting the country’s cultural heritage, with its Shidianguji platform using AI and optical character recognition to digitise more than 2,000 ancient Chinese texts since 2022.\nUSC’s Li – who described this evolving landscape as a “tech-culture industrial complex” – warned of potential ethical issues, such as ensuring authenticity when using AI to generate historical content, and avoiding algorithmic bias.\nSilk Road partnerships\nDespite the geopolitical tensions between China and the West, international collaborations to preserve and document the world’s cultural heritage sites remain possible, especially among Belt and Road Initiative countries, according to analysts.\nThe state-owned Silk Road Fund, established in 2014, has been supporting museums and heritage initiatives across the region – including the largest archaeological excavation between China and Uzbekistan.\nAnd at Quanzhou – the port city in Fujian province known as the terminus of the old Silk Road – Chng is working on a project to digitalise the ancient Buddhist Kaiyuan Temple.\nChng said the current tensions may prompt more countries to partner with China, recognising its strengths in digitalisation. “Along the Silk Road, we can still work with all these countries, all the way to Europe, maybe, and all the way down to Southeast Asia.”\nIn Dunhuang, Schmid views cultural heritage as a “shared human legacy” that is well-suited for research diplomacy. This creates opportunities for joint initiatives, with sites like the Mogao Caves seen as powerful soft power tools.\nPast collaborations – including with the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles – have provided access to “global best practices and advanced techniques”, according to Schmid.\n“We’re now using that foundation to develop heritage models and applications rooted in China’s unique cultural and technological contexts,” he said.","summary":"While investment in cultural heritage is declining in the US and other countries, the ‘unique’ Chinese model is flourishing, observers said.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3310750/international-museum-day-how-china-aiming-cultural-superpower-status","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/17/e375ca57-cf16-4a6a-a7d5-5dbf59c2a809_fab14091.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:00:17","author":"Xinlu Liang","authors":["Xinlu Liang"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.884},{"id":322412006,"title":"Distrust and Accountability","text":"CNN’s Kasie Hunt interviewed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer the other day. She confronted him about allegations of a meeting with former President Joe Biden that should have raised alarms about Biden’s fitness for office. “We’re moving forward,” Schumer replied. He would not answer the question.\n\nChuck Todd, speaking afterwards on CNN, said, “He is among the people responsible for this. The leaders of the Democratic Party, the staff of the White House—and I have to say I find everybody now talking to these authors—get out of here. Now you tell us?” He then referred to the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration as “catastrophic governance.”\n\nThe American people began raising concerns about Biden’s fitness for office while Biden campaigned for the presidency in 2020. Polling in 2021 noted that a majority of the American public had concerns about Biden’s mental and physical frailty. Former President Barack Obama’s speechwriter Jon Favreau now claims Biden declined after the 2022 midterms. New reporting from CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson notes Biden regularly had bad days before 2022, but as he aged, he got even worse.\n\nDemocrats would have us believe it was stress related to Hunter Biden. But these same Democrats refused to release the audio of Biden’s interview with Special Prosecutor Robert Hur. The same reporters who now claim they were stunned and their sources would not be candid with them were the very same reporters who never fought for the release of the Hur audio and, in fact, treated the Hur report’s conclusion that Biden was not mentally fit to stand trial as a partisan statement.\n\nAxios’ Alex Thompson is one of the few reporters the Biden administration blackballed for regularly covering Biden’s decline. CNN’s Tapper, for his part, told his colleague John Berman, “I’m not going to speak for anybody else, but knowing then what I know now, I look back at my coverage during the Biden years—and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough.”\n\nComcast gave Biden White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki her own show. She used her show to deflect from concerns about Biden’s decline. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe told his audience on March 6, 2024, “F you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever.” This contradicts both the new Democrat spin that Biden began a rapid decline after 2022 and also the Tapper and Thompson revelations that the decline had started being noticed in 2019.\n\n“Look, what we learned through our reporting is that starting in around 2019, 2020, there were two Bidens. There was a Biden that was perfectly workable, serviceable, seemed fine. And then there was a non-functioning one that couldn’t come up with names of top aides, that would lose his train of thought to an alarming degree. And that non-functioning Biden reared his head increasingly over and over,” Tapper told Berman.\n\nThis gets back to Chuck Todd’s comments about Sen. Schumer. “Now you tell us,” he says. But what did they need to tell us? The American people were raising concerns in 2020 and 2021. It was the American press corps that insisted Americans not believe their lying eyes. It was voices on CNN and MSNBC that had Democrats on to insist the video of Biden being led off stage by Barack Obama had been mischaracterized by Republicans.\n\n“Catastrophic governance” is how Todd characterized this opening of Trump’s new term. That, I suspect, gives us the answer to the big question—how could the press cover for Biden when the American people themselves knew something was wrong? Because, at that time, Biden was the only thing standing between the presidency and Trump. Now that he has lost, the truth can be told, except for the part of the press’ complicity in the cover-up. Americans did not need White House sources to tell them something was wrong. Only America’s top reporters did, and without those sources, they insisted until the bitter end that the public got duped by the GOP.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Though he's only been in office for a few months, the president is already trying to make good on this promise via a new Republican-backed tax bill currently in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe 389-page bill covers a variety of tax reforms, and it specifically calls out no taxes on tips. While it's not clear that this bill will pass or that all its provisions will remain as they appear now, it gives us insight into what this change would look like.\n\nHow no taxes on tips would work\n\nThe bill lays out the basic guidelines for how this rule change would work in practice. First, it would only be available for \"qualified tips.\" These are cash tips (or equivalents, like a credit card tip or mobile payment service payments) given in occupations that customarily receive tips. These payments must be voluntary, with the amount determined by the person giving you the tip. Plus, you must not be a highly compensated employee to take advantage of this deduction.\n\nIf you're self-employed, you may still take advantage of this new rule. However, your business must show a profit to do this. You cannot create a loss by deducting tips under this change.\n\nYou'd be eligible for this deduction whether you claim the standard deduction or itemize. You must include your Social Security number on your tax return, and if you're married, you must include your spouse's Social Security number as well. You must also report your tips to the IRS. They'll likely appear on your W-2 or 1099, so you shouldn't have to worry about this.\n\nSome details still need to be worked out\n\nWhile the Republican-backed bill outlines the basics, some details still need to be hammered out. For one, the current bill only calls for this rule to remain in place through 2028. Deciding whether it would be permanent would likely come later after the government's had a year or two to see how it works in practice.\n\nA big potential issue is employers trying to give their employees extra salary as tips in an attempt to avoid taxes on that money. The bill says the Secretary of the Treasury \"shall prescribe such regulations or other guidance as may be necessary to prevent reclassification of income as qualified tips.\" We don't know what those regulations might look like yet.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is also supposed to create a list of occupations that have customarily received tips prior to Dec. 31, 2024. You must be in one of these industries to be eligible to deduct your tips. We know from the current bill that this will include businesses that engage in \"the providing, delivering, or serving of food or beverages,\" as well as beauty service businesses, like barbering, hair styling, nail care, and spa treatments. But it's possible others could get added to this list as well.\n\nIt's important to remember that there are still some hurdles to ending taxes on tips. Assuming the bill passes the House, it will still have to make its way to the Senate, where it could be subject to substantial revisions. So while tax-free tips are a possibility, it's not a done deal yet.","url":"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2025/05/17/trump-tells-the-irs-not-to-tax-tips-officially/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F818212%2Fsmiling-waitress-collecting-credit-card-payment-from-customer.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 22:00:00","author":"CFP,Kailey Hagen","authors":["CFP","Kailey Hagen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":322409320,"title":"Strange sightings over Arizona skies spark fresh UFO fears","text":"A United States F-16 Viper combat jet has been damaged after being struck by an “unidentified aerial phenomenon”.\n\nIt comes amid a fresh uptick in the number of strange flying objects being sighted over the southern US border state of Arizona. \n\nThe News Nation media service reports seeing Federal Aviation Authority documents confirming “numerous encounters” with strange craft. One reportedly struck the perspex canopy of a $A100 million F-16 fighter, causing the aircraft to be grounded for repairs. \n\nThese aren’t UFOS (Unidentified Flying Objects).\n\nInstead, they are UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena).\n\nSo what’s in a name?\n\nArizona shares extensive military testing grounds with neighbouring Nevada – home to the secretive Area 51 testing facility that has been associated with otherworldly flying saucers for decades.\n\nBut it also borders Mexico. That is the focus of fresh invasion fears.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has invoked the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 in response to a “predatory incursion” of the United States.\n\nNot the murderous alien Predators of Arnold Schwarzenegger fame, but the fundamentally human need to seek safety and security – or a quick buck.\n\nNow, defence analysts are linking an uptick in the region’s long history of alien invasion scares to a surge in the use of cross-border drug-smuggling drones.\n\nSomething in the air\n\n“There has been a lot of activity, particularly on the Arizona border. A lot of people are reporting a lot of things,” former director of the Pentagon’s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), Luis Elizondo, told News Nation.\n\nOne incident flared across local headlines in November.\n\nStrange lights were seen in the night sky above Bullhead City. Footage quickly went viral on TikTok.\n\nDespite being linked to the headlights of off-road vehicles driving through nearby hills, the incident has further fuelled the state’s reputation as an alien sightseeing destination.\n\nIn 1997, photos of a V-shaped formation dubbed the “Phoenix Lights” attracted global attention. \n\nFew accepted the US Air Force’s explanation that it was a group of A-10 “Tankbuster” aircraft practising formation-flying with their night-lights on.\n\nAnother incident, this time in 2011, convinced locals that the aliens had returned. \n\nAgain, the explanation that the Arizona Skyhawks skydiving team was carrying high-intensity flares to kick off a nearby football match didn’t appeal.\n\nBut now, the FAA documents suggest US Air Force pilots are adding to Arizona’s collection of inexplicable sightings.\n\nAt least until they’re explained.\n\nBorder patrols have been intensified in recent years and one of President Trump’s first acts was to order 6000 extra troops into the region, supported by armoured personnel carriers, surveillance aircraft, combat helicopters and two navy destroyers.\n\nCombined with intensified border police checks and patrols, this is making it more challenging for Mexico’s cartels to feed America’s illegal narcotics addiction.\n\nEvidence suggests they’re turning to a new generation of large drones to haul their deadly cargo directly to market.\n\nDones being used as delivery mules isn’t exactly new. US authorities have been documenting seizures of small craft carrying 5 to 10kg for more than a decade. \n\nBut technologies developed for the likes of Amazon to deliver large parcels across an urban landscape are being adapted for the drug trade.\n\nThat means they’re flying higher and further than ever before.\n\nThe truth is out there\n\nNew research from the Manchester Metropolitan University and Liverpool John Moores University has examined the tendency for people to attribute unexplained events to paranormal or extraterrestrial events.\n\n“When faced with events we cannot control, our minds look for patterns and explanations,” the study’s authors write.\n\nPresident Trump’s new administration came to power, insisting it would tackle the UFO issue once and for all. \n\nAnd White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did so in one of her first public appearances.\n\nShe addressed last year’s spate of strange lights in the sky in the American Northeast.\n\nThey were not aliens. They weren’t even Iranian drones. They were, she said, normal aircraft flying normal routes at normal times.\n\nIt’s just that people had suddenly started paying attention to them.\n\n“In time, it got worse, due to curiosity. This was not the enemy,” she explained.\n\nNow, the Trump Administration has moved to shut down a secret FBI office dedicated to investigating “unidentified anomalous phenomena””. \n\nIt had been public knowledge for decades that the Pentagon had been running the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to examine strange sightings. \n\nBut the FBI had never admitted – before announcing it was about to be shut down – that this team existed. \n\nQuestions, however, remain unanswered.\n\nTennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett wants to know more. He’s told the US Congress that extraterrestrial craft are operating from secret undersea bases.\n\n“I haven’t been briefed on this, just from what I’m putting together, but we have some secret sonar … (They) tell me something’s moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater … and this one was as large as a football field underwater, and this was a documented case, and I have an admiral telling me this stuff,” he told One America News.\n\nThe research psychologists say it’s a natural tendency for people to turn to paranormal and conspiracy-theory beliefs in order to deal with anxiety.\n\n“Realising that life is unpredictable and has an end can be unsettling,” they write. “Supernatural beliefs provide comfort by suggesting that a higher power controls human destiny.”\n\nThe illegal immigration crisis, the militarisation of the border – and increased military training and experimentation in the face of increasing global aggression – all converge on Arizona.\n\nThat may help explain why every light in the sky is suddenly a UFO or UAP.\n\n“Instead of dismissing such beliefs, it is important to recognise their emotional and personal significance,” the psychologists conclude.\n\n“Particularly, how beliefs shape people’s perspectives and coping mechanisms.\n\n“While they may not align with logic or evidence, the comfort they afford is deeply meaningful to those who hold them.”\n\nJamie Seidel is a freelance writer | @jamieseidel.bsky.social","summary":"A US fighter jet has been struck by an unidentified object over the Arizona skies, sparking fresh alien speculation.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/space/strange-sightings-over-arizona-skies-spark-new-ufo-fears/news-story/e14bcf4e31bf3f0e24f2c375f62898ad?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/50062c82aa67aff20f0ec4e44faa2074","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 21:58:36","author":"Jamie Seidel","authors":["Jamie Seidel"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.17}]}
