He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist’? \n\nYes, that was Donald J. Trump at one of his rallies during the 2024 US election. \n\nAnd after Trump won, he invited the communist autocrat to his inauguration. Xi turned it down. Too busy exercising his iron fist at home.\n\nActually, there is a serious point here. Trump perpetually labours under the misapprehension that if only foreign autocrats could have some fun time with him at Mar-a-Lago, they would succumb to his charm and see things his way.\n\nIt is astonishingly egocentric, as well as delusional. We are now seeing this with President Putin. Trump genuinely believed he could, by schmoozing the poisoner in the Kremlin, persuade Moscow to abandon its war on Ukraine. \n\nIndeed, Trump regularly claimed that his unique skills as a personal negotiator would ‘end the war in 24 hours’.\n\nEye-watering\n\nIs it now dawning on the President that Putin can’t be handled like some fellow property developer over martinis at the golf and country club? I doubt it: Trump is too old a dog to learn new tricks.\n\nThere is another stark difference between the US and the nations ruled by Xi and Putin. Those are dictatorships, whose peoples enjoy no electoral choice, and where dissent can lead to death. \n\nWhat this means, in terms of Trump’s declaration of trade war on China, is that Xi can allow the sort of deep pain it might cause his people, in a way which a leader of the US can’t.\n\nOr as the exiled Chinese novelist Hao Qun pointed out: ‘Tariffs and even economic sanctions are not Xi Jinping’s pressure points. He is not particularly concerned about the hardships tariffs may cause for ordinary people.’\n\nTrump may not care either, but he is an obsessive observer of opinion polls – or so I was told by someone who had had political dealings with him.\n\nWhen the inevitable consequence of slapping 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods filters through into eye-watering price rises in US consumer markets, and the closure of many American retailers, those opinion polls will direct Trump’s response . . . to seek a rapid exit from the trade war he started, long before any of the supposed benefits accrue. And don’t think that Beijing is unaware of this.\n\nThen there are, in little more than a year and a half, the mid-term elections. If consumer price inflation is plaguing Main Street – which was the chief reason for Joe Biden’s unpopularity, post the Covid pandemic – then Republicans will panic. Those are the sort of democratic checks that Xi has no need to consider.\n\nThe Chinese president for life did have one moment when public dissent might have capsized his leadership. \n\nBeijing’s brutally enforced ‘Zero-Covid’ policy, enforcing lockdowns long after the rest of the world had abandoned them, eventually sparked the sort of protests that had not been seen in China for decades. Overnight, Xi abandoned the policy, without explanation or apology.\n\nBut in the case of the trade war, the communist leader can rely on the nationalism of the Chinese people, which should never be underestimated. They think, historically, in terms of ‘the century of humiliation’ of China by Western powers.\n\n In this context, an abhorrence of quailing before Washington is something Xi can and will exploit, both for his own popularity internally and in terms of the image China presents to the rest of the world.\n\nThe fact that Trump is deeply unpopular outside America will only be of assistance in this. I have been struck by how even those in this country disgusted by the ruthless and intensely repressive nature of Xi’s regime still look forward to Trump getting a bloody nose.\n\nThere will be many more of them in the EU, which Trump, justifying his tariffs, said ‘was created to screw the United States, that’s the purpose of it’.\n\nIn reality, the US was instrumental in creating what became the EU, seeing such an entity as a bulwark against the Soviet empire.\n\nThe CIA was the biggest single financial backer of the European movement in the 1950s, and what we now call the EU was the brainchild of Jean Monnet, who had the closest imaginable relationship with the US state department.\n\nThe point is that if Trump were strategic in his desire to isolate China, he would not simultaneously pick a fight with the EU. \n\nWhen Ursula von der Leyen came in as President of the European Commission, she stated her intention to reduce the risks of dependence on China.\n\nBut the effect of Trump’s imposition of 25 per cent tariffs on cars and steel from the EU (and from the UK too, by the way) is to weaken the hand of European leaders who favour such a realignment.\n\nBut, obviously, Trump is not strategic. His supporters eulogise what they call the President’s ‘4-D chess’, in terms of his whipsawing decision-making, but – and I speak as someone who has written books on chess – Trump is as far from a Grandmaster as it is possible to imagine. \n\nChess demands the ability to think deeply before moving, and a complete absence of emotion in decision-making. Trump is, to an extraordinary extent, a creature of impulse charged with ferocious energy.\n\nPerhaps the best insight into this came from a former employee in his casino business, John O’Donnell, who published a book – called Trumped! – about the experience.\n\n O’Donnell wrote: ‘Donald’s conception of time was so circumscribed that it was astounding. He did business entirely in the moment.’\n\nThis is the polar opposite of men such as Xi and Putin, who can at least be recognised as patient and enduring in their pursuit of political objectives, however inimical those are to our own security.\n\nWe saw that Trumpian inconstancy on a world-shaking scale last week, as he suddenly deferred the very high level of tariffs he had imposed only days earlier against hundreds of nations (including an island inhabited purely by penguins, blameless birds who, up until then, had no reason to be anti-American).\n\nThe reason for this dizzying 180-degree turn at speed was not just the plunge in share prices that underpin the retirement funds of millions of Americans but also the bond market fleeing from the dollar. This is a threat to America much greater than anything that Xi can muster.\n\nThat the dollar has been, since the aftermath of the Second World War, the world’s reserve currency is, as the former French president Valery Giscard d’Estaing put it, America’s ‘exorbitant privilege’. \n\nIt has enabled the effortless funding of the US’s colossal debts and, by keeping those borrowing rates low, means that poor households in the developing world subsidise much richer ones in the US.\n\nIt has, in effect, funded the American dream. But last week, even the Greek government was able to raise money on the international markets at a lower rate than the US, so great was investors’ panic over Trump’s wild wilfulness.\n\nAnd Trump’s next move on the world trade chessboard? We have no idea. And neither does he.","summary":"Who said of China's president Xi Jinping, 'He's a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist'?

It is a market holiday today, but we are, as you can see, out with an addition.The Take: Why Celebrating A Tariff Advantage Is DangerousU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday exempted smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from his reciprocal tariffs. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Guidance issued late Friday evening comes on the heels of that 145% tariff on products from China, a move that would have crippled companies like Apple, which makes iPhones and many of its products in China. So the guidance includes exclusions for other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel, TV displays, flash drives, and memory cards.The White House said on Saturday the exemptions were made because Trump wants to ensure that companies have time to move production to the United States. Excellent news. Actually, maybe not.None of this obviously changes the uncertainty that has now gripped global businesses and investors and is keeping everyone from small entrepreneurs to Fortune 100 business leaders worldwide uneasy and tossing and turning in their beds. And that includes India and everyone in it, by the way, which is why some of our early celebrations around tariff twists should concern us. When the first round of reciprocal tariffs was announced two weeks ago, the government and apparel industry, for one, pointed out that India was being hit with a 26% tariff, while close competitors like China and Vietnam were being hit with higher rates.But when it comes to the United States, reciprocal tariffs on Bangladesh stood at 37% compared to India's 26%. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, another major garment-exporting nation, faced tariffs of 44%. Needless to say, we appear to have an advantage in a duty structure that even the sharpest economists have struggled to explain or justify.And when I say duty structure, I mean the U.S. tariff duty structure. The electronics industry put out a similar statement yesterday. The India Cellular and Electronics Association rightly pointed out that imports of smartphones and laptops to the United States from China will still be hit with a 20% tariff even after those new exemptions.On the other hand, India and Vietnam will continue to enjoy zero tariffs on smartphones, laptops, and tablets exported to the U.S. The world being what it is, tariffs exist at various borders, some apparent, some not, at least to us. If the U.S. kept tariffs low for many years, it did so to make its industry globally competitive, and arguably it has. It's not clear how the current strategy will change all of that, but I'll come to that, or at least part of that in a bit.Now take this example which I've heard cited before. Bangladesh enjoys a 9-12% preferential tariff advantage on its exports to the European Union, which makes a big difference because some 60% or more of its apparel exports head to the EU, according to some estimates. Now this advantage is offered to Bangladesh as the least developed country.However, as things stand, it is set to graduate to developing nation status next year. But Bangladesh has won a great spirit and will now graduate only in 2029, meaning it will continue to enjoy tariff benefits on exports to the EU, according to many reports. Now, what have Indian apparel companies done about this whole competitive advantage that Bangladesh has?Well, they've set up factories in Bangladesh, though tariffs are not the only reason for doing so because Bangladesh does have a strong ecosystem when it comes to low-cost, high-scale apparel production. Speaking of ecosystems, The Wall Street Journal recently carried an interesting insight from a professor at Arizona State University who worked on organisational development for Apple in China. It took China 40 years to build a complex manufacturing supply chain.We used to have that. It's a disaster that we let it go, he said. According to him, over time, Apple had built an ecosystem of more than 1,000 suppliers in China.It taught them how to operate more efficiently, so they competed with each other ...","url":"https://www.thecore.in/podcasts/markets-flip-flop-as-they-settle-down-for-extended-trade-wars-833447","image":"https://www.thecore.in/h-upload/2025/04/13/1055694-e555-1200x630.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 00:45:12","author":"Govindraj Ethiraj","authors":["Govindraj Ethiraj"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.294},{"id":310814350,"title":"World News | Israel Intensifies Strikes Across Gaza on Palm Sunday and Hits Hospital in North","text":"Deir Al-Balah (Gaza Strip), Apr 14 (AP) A wave of Israeli strikes across Gaza on Sunday hit a hospital and other sites, killing at least 21 people, including children, as Israel vowed to expand its security presence in the small coastal strip. The predawn strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was the latest of several attacks on northern Gaza's last major hospital providing critical health care.

Hospital director Dr. Fadel Naim said the emergency room, pharmacy and surrounding buildings were severely damaged, affecting over 100 patients and dozens of staff. One patient, a girl, died during the evacuation following an Israeli warning because staff were unable to provide urgent care, Gaza's Health Ministry said. Israel said it struck a Hamas command and control center at the hospital, without providing evidence. Hamas denied the allegations.

Al-Ahli Hospital is run by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which condemned the attack, saying in a statement it happened on “Palm Sunday, the start of the Holy Week, the most sacred week of the Christian year.” Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, and worshipers in Gaza City marked it in a church whose gilded trim and intact walls were a contrast to the widespread debris elsewhere. Associated Press video showed the hospital's caved-in roof surrounded by rubble. The health ministry's director general, Dr. Munir al-Boursh, said patients had been carried outside in beds and slept in the streets. “Nothing was left safe inside the hospital, or all over Gaza,” said Mohammad Abu Nasser, an injured man who sat on his bed outdoors and looked at the destruction. The health ministry said the hospital was temporarily out of service and patients were transferred to other hospitals in Gaza City. The aid group Medical Aid for Palestinians called it the fifth attack on Al-Ahli since the war began. Hospitals have special protection under international law. Israel has besieged and raided them, some several times, and struck multiple ones while accusing Hamas of using them as cover for its fighters. Last month Israel struck Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, the largest in southern Gaza, killing two people and causing a large fire, the health ministry said. The facility had been overwhelmed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire last month with a surprise wave of airstrikes. Charity workers killed Hours later Sunday, a strike on a car in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed at least seven people including six brothers, according to staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. The youngest brother was 10. Their father, Ibrahim Abu Mahadi, said his sons worked for a charity that distributes food to Palestinians. \"For what sin were they killed?” he said. AP reporters saw the mangled, bloodied car as relatives wept over the bodies. Israel's military asserted that it killed the deputy head of a Hamas sniper cell. An airstrike Sunday afternoon hit a house in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, killing at least seven people including two women, according to the Indonesian hospital. A pregnant woman was rescued from the rubble. Alaa Manoun later wept after learning her youngest daughter had died, along with her husband and her mother. Two other daughters, ages 4 and 7, were injured. Manoun had a broken ankle but otherwise seemed OK, according to a doctor. No scan was available, since the only machine in northern Gaza was at Al-Ahli Hospital, now damaged. “We don't know whose body is this and whose body is that,” said a neighbor, Abdallah Dardouna. “There is no resistance, there is no Qassam, no Hamas, there is no one here. It's only civilians here.” Another strike in Deir al-Balah hit a municipal building and killed at least three people, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. In Khan Younis, a strike killed at least three people, according to staff at Nasser Hospital. Israel's military said in a statement it had struck over 90 militant targets over the past 48 hours including command and control centers, tunnels and weapons. The military also said it had intercepted a projectile fired from Gaza. The war started when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, during an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel and took 250 people captive. Many were eventually freed in ceasefire deals. Israeli authorities have vowed to pressure Hamas to release the remaining 59 hostages, 24 believed to be alive, and accept new ceasefire terms. It cut off all supplies to Gaza over a month ago. More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count but says more than half of the dead have been women and children. Missile reported from Yemen Israel's military said a missile was launched from Yemen on Sunday afternoon and the details were under review. Sirens sounded in several parts of Israel and the occupied West Bank. There were no reports of casualties or damage. The Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to target Israel in what they have called solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.

A notice shared on Friday evening suggested that electronic gadgets from China would be able to bypass his 125% import tax and even his global 10% tariff - however, as we have now learned, this is not the case after all. Posting on Truth Social, the President wrote: “NOBODY is getting “off the hook” for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” “There was no Tariff “exception” announced on Friday,” Trump continued in his post. “These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff “bucket.” He then added: “We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” In a direct dig at rival nation China, Trump also declared that the US would not be “held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.” He then went on to argue that Beijing was behind an escalating trade war with the US and would do “everything within its power to disrespect the American People.” Tensions between both nations have been steadily worsening over the past week, after China hiked it’s levies on imported goods to 125% in response to Trump’s tariffs which had effectively slapped a 145% tariff on them. After a rocky few days, there did appear to be a glimmer of hope on Friday, when a Trump appeared to spare electronics like iPhones and laptops from his tariffs, but that prospect was short-lived, with Commerce Secretary Howar Lutnick also confirming on Sunday that those products will still be included in tariffs after all. In an interview with ABC News, Lutnick explained that those items would still be included in a set of tariffs due to be rolled out in one to two months time. He said: “Well remember those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral tariffs which are coming.”He said like the separate pharmaceutical and auto tariffs, electronics will face levies as part of the semiconductor tariffs. “They're going to have a special focused type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored” Lutnick explained. He argued that such products, which are commonly made in China, need to be made in America, so at the moment electronics are exempt from the current reciprocal tariffs but wouldn’t be exempt from appearing in a different set of looming tariffs aimed at bringing more manufacturing to the US. Yet even if Trump is able to bring manufacturing to the US, the process will hardly be instant, with experts fearing it would take years to reach the kind of capacity needed to produce the amount of electronics required each year. Apple for example, would be one of the companies hit by any tariffs, as more than 80 per cent of all their products are made in China, with the company already losing a whopping $640 billion in the days since the tariff announcement earlier this month. There are also no immediate plans to try and deescalate the situation either, as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping \"don't have any plans\" to speak, even as the tariff war between the two countries escalates in real time.","summary":"Just days after economic experts saw a glimmer of hope among Donald Trump's raft of tariffs with a potential exemption on electronic goods, the US President has now clarified this is not the case","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-insists-no-tariff-35049465","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35047947.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 00:32:44","author":"Phoebe Tonks","authors":["Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":310812840,"title":"Hong Kong exporters warned against evading US tariffs on small parcels","text":"Hong Kong industry leaders have cautioned local exporters against evading US tariffs on small parcels via illegal third-country transshipments or parallel imports of goods into America, saying companies risked being prosecuted and faced criminal liabilities while tarnishing the city’s reputation.\nTheir warnings came after US President Donald Trump’s latest move to further raise tariffs on small parcels sent to America from mainland China and Hong Kong to 120 per cent, up from 90 per cent on Thursday.\nTrump also increased the tariff on Chinese imports to 145 per cent on April 9, up from an earlier-stated 125 per cent.\nAnalysts anticipated that alternative business models would emerge to get around the US tariffs on small items, such as via illegal transshipment of goods through Mexico or Canada, or by being sold as parallel imports.\nBut Willy Lin Sun-mo, chairman of the Hong Kong Shippers’ Council, warned the city’s exporters against such moves, saying they could lead to serious legal consequences and damage their companies’ reputations.\n“For example, for a Hong Kong firm to make a shipment of goods, it needs to state its final destination. If the goods are exported to Mexico first, then picked up by another company there for re-export to the US, the firms need to declare the origin of the goods,” he said.\n“Any false declarations by the Mexican firm would risk it being prosecuted by US customs for carrying out illegal transshipment. The same applies to the Hong Kong firm as the US may request the city’s customs to investigate if it knowingly participated in unlawful dealings.”\nLin called on Hong Kong exporters to be law-abiding to prevent “damaging the city’s reputation or causing trouble to Beijing”.\n“In these tumultuous times, Hong Kong firms should be more cautious and refrain from taking part in illegal transshipment just to circumvent the duties,” he said.\nLin added that American officials were keeping a close eye on Hong Kong and any illegal dealings were likely to be detected by US customs.\n“Even if US citizens carry goods over the borders, they will be subject to close scrutiny by customs officials who can easily detect [any import of] Chinese goods,” he said.\n\nIn the US, importers who knowingly falsify the country of origin of their imports are subject to significant fines and penalties, while companies or individuals found to be complicit in selling or purchasing unlawfully transshipped products face additional civil penalties and even criminal liabilities.\nIn recent years, investigations by the US Department of Homeland Security have identified multiple cases of mainland goods being diverted through third countries to circumvent anti-dumping and countervailing duties. In one case, the US government sought more than US$11 million in unpaid import duties and up to US$62 million in civil penalties from a mainland company that allegedly unlawfully transshipped Chinese aluminium through third countries.\nDennis Ng Kwok-on, vice-president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong, said it was likely some mainland exporters would try to use the parallel import route to escape the tariffs on small parcels.\n“Some firms know very well that they will transport the small items via parallel traders to get around the tariffs,” he said. “But there is a great risk that they will be easily spotted by US customs.”\nFor firms that moved goods to Mexico and Canada before re-exporting them in small volumes to the US, Ng argued they should not be held responsible for the actions of buyers.\n“If the firm clearly states the goods are exported to Mexico, they should not be held responsible for how the buyer will distribute them. It will have nothing to do with the exporter,” he said.\nEric Sun Yung-tson, chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters’ Association, said there was no way for businesses to evade the impact of tariffs on small parcels, even if they distributed goods to US clients via Mexico or Canada, as the latter countries faced levies too.\n“No one can avoid the extra costs of the new tariffs, as the US targets every country in the world,” Sun said. “Despite a lower tariff imposed on Mexico and Canada, the cost of shifting the shipping destination would still be higher [than at present].”\n\nAccording to an amendment on so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Thursday, Hong Kong time, the new rate on shipments priced up to US$800 would be 120 per cent of their value, up from the earlier announced figure of 90 per cent.\nThe per postal item fee will be raised to US$100 from the earlier US$75 after May 2 and US$200 from the planned US$150 after June 1.\nWashington earlier accused Chinese online marketplaces such as Temu and Shein of taking advantage of a loophole in the “de minimis” trade exemption to send goods to the US duty-free. The de minimis rule dates back to 1930 and waives import duties for packages from the mainland and Hong Kong valued at US$800 or less.\nLast week, Trump announced that the de minimis trade exemption would cease on May 2.\nAdditional reporting by Oscar Liu","summary":"Local industry leaders say firms that ship goods via illegal transshipment or parallel imports will likely face prosecution and tarnish city’s image.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3306339/hong-kong-exporters-warned-against-evading-us-tariffs-small-parcels","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/13/57b0afdb-9973-40a9-9307-95d0f9e9d1cc_148356ae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 00:30:12","author":"Cannix Yau","authors":["Cannix Yau"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":310813388,"title":"True north: Foxconn plans first solo UP unit","text":"Foxconn, the biggest vendor globally for Apple, is eyeing 300 acres along the Yamuna Expressway at Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh to set up its first facility in north India, people aware of the developments told ET.“This facility has the potential to be slightly bigger than its upcoming facility in Bengaluru, which is set to become the company's second largest globally, said one of the persons cited above.

The strategic Yamuna Expressway connects the new airport at Jewar, as well as the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.Greater potentialFoxconn's proposed investment in Uttar Pradesh comes at a time when uncertainty is looming large over President Donald Trump's tariff imposition. “The uncertainty over tariffs and geopolitical climate gives Foxconn a ‘capacity’ safety net for the potential future EMS (electronics manufacturing services) opportunities that will eventually fall into India’s lap, considering it is the best possible alternative destination,” said Neil Shah, vice-president, research, at Counterpoint Research. It’s good to diversify geographically and, at the same time, being closer to some prospective customers will help tap them — from smart devices to auto.”Foxconn has operations across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana. People aware of developments said the manufacturer has wound down operations in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh.Prabhu Ram, vice-president, industry research group, at CyberMedia Research, concurred with Counterpoint's Shah. Ram pointed to India’s robust market and rising role as an export hub, gaining from international supply chain realignments that are aimed at fostering resilience and promoting diversification. “Foxconn’s expanded investment in India aligns with these trends, underscoring its strategic intent to strengthen and deepen its manufacturing presence in the country,” he said.Shah said the Noida cluster, like Chennai, has emerged as a burgeoning manufacturing ecosystem with aligned infrastructure, a growing pool of local talent, and a plethora of suppliers catering to both major and minor EMS providers. The diversification geographically within India helps someone like Foxconn to attract prospective clients while expanding capacity and capabilities for existing clients, he said.Foxconn has lately been doubling down on its India. ET reported last month that Foxconn was aiming to make 25-30 million iPhones out of its India facilities, more than double of the production of last year.The Apple supplier has been keen to go beyond smartphones. On his visit to India last year, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said the target was production for sectors such as information and communication technology, electric vehicles, energy and digital health in its next phase of growth in India. “Foxconn is very well known for its vertical integration capabilities, Liu had said in August. Definitely, we want to move up the value chain as much as we can in India.”","summary":"Foxconn is in talks to acquire 300 acres along the Yamuna Expressway in Greater Noida for its first northern India facility.

The man, captured later in the day, will face charges of attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault, authorities said.

Shapiro said he, his wife, their four children, two dogs and another family had celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover at the residence on Saturday and were awakened by state troopers pounding on their doors at about 2 a.m. Sunday. They fled and the fire was extinguished, officials said. No one was injured. At a Sunday evening news conference in front of the badly damaged south wing of the governor's residence, Pennsylvania State Police Col. Christopher Paris identified the man in custody as Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg. Also Read | Israel-Hamas War: IDF Intensifies Strikes Across Gaza on Palm Sunday, Hits Al-Ahli Hospital in North; at Least 21 Killed. Shapiro says he's unbowed Paris emphasised that the investigation is continuing. Authorities did not disclose the man's motive, but an emotional Shapiro — who is viewed as a potential White House contender for the Democratic Party in 2028 — said he is unbowed. Shapiro said that if Balmer was trying to stop him from doing his job, then he'll work harder, and he added that Balmer will not stop him from observing his faith. “When we were in the state dining room last night, we told the story of Passover” and the exodus of the Jews from slavery in Egypt to freedom, Shapiro said. “I refuse to be trapped by the bondage that someone attempts to put on me by attacking us as they did here last night. I refuse to let anyone who had evil intentions like that stop me from doing the work that I love.\" Suspect hopped over a security fence and forcibly entered the residence, officials say Authorities said the suspect hopped over a nearly 7-foot-high (2.1-meter-high) iron security fence surrounding the property, eluded officers who became aware of the breach and forcibly entered the residence before setting it on fire. Lt. Col. George Bivens said Balmer had a homemade incendiary device — he wouldn't describe what kind — and appeared to have carefully planned the attack. He was inside the residence for about a minute before he escaped, Bivens said. Bivens said Balmer was later arrested in the area. Shapiro said the fire was set in the very room where the families celebrated Passover with a seder with members of Harrisburg's Jewish community on Saturday night. We have to be better than this, Shapiro says “We don't know the person's specific motive yet,\" Shapiro told the news conference. “But we do know a few truths. First: This type of violence is not OK. This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society. And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another or one particular person or another. It is not OK, and it has to stop. We have to be better than this.” The fire badly damaged the inside of the large room that is often used for entertaining crowds and art displays. Large west- and south-facing windows were completely missing their glass panes, shattered glass littered the pathways and doors stood ajar amid signs of charring. Window panes and brick around doors and windows were blackened and charred. Inside, a charred piano, tables, walls, metal buffet serving dishes and more could be seen through broken windows and fire-blackened doors. The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was called to the residence and put out the fire at the Susquehanna Riverfront mansion. Shapiro and his family had been sleeping in a different part of the residence, police said.

The result would likely be a 20-25pc decline in exports to the US, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion, with the textile sector bearing the brunt of the blow.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2024, Pakistan exported $5.3bn worth of goods to the United States, making it the country’s largest single-country export market. A significant portion of these exports were textiles and apparel, which already face tariffs as high as 17pc.\n\nIf the proposed tariffs are implemented, Pakistan’s price competitiveness would be severely eroded, possibly allowing regional competitors like India and Bangladesh to capture the market share.\n\nThe economic consequences would extend beyond textiles, the Pide analysis warned. Major exporters such as Nishat Mills and Interloop may be forced to reduce production, threatening more than 500,000 jobs. Non-textile exports — including leather, rice, surgical instruments and sports goods — also face increased vulnerability.\n\nDespite the risks, Pide viewed the crisis as an opportunity for strategic transformation. The policy note encourages Pakistan to take swift and thoughtful action in response. In the short term, Pide recommended that Pakistan engage in high-level diplomatic efforts to highlight the mutual costs of the tariffs and preserve long-standing trade relations.\n\nFor example, the United States exported $181 million worth of cotton to Pakistan in 2024, a trade stream that is now at risk. Pakistan might also consider reducing tariffs on select US imports — such as machinery, scrap metal and petroleum — to create room for negotiation. Additionally, Paki-s-tani firms could be encouraged to use more US-origin inputs like cotton and yarn to help maintain value chains and seek tariff exemptions.\n\nFor the long term, Pide emphasised the need to diversify both export products and markets. Emerging destinations such as the European Union, China, Asean nations, Africa and the Middle East offer growth potential in sectors like IT, halal food, processed foods and sports goods.\n\nThe report also called for measures to reduce energy and logistics costs, streamline regulations and promote innovation and technology adoption. Furthermore, a comprehensive US trade strategy is necessary — one that focuses on building synergies in technology, agriculture, energy and value-added manufacturing.\n\nOn the international front, Pide noted that the proposed US tariffs exceed the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) bound tariff ceiling of 3.4pc, potentially violating multilateral trade rules. While legal recourse through the WTO remains an option, Pakistan’s limited fiscal resources may hinder such efforts, it said. More importantly, the tariffs ignore the interconnected nature of global trade. \n\nThe US-Pakistan textile loop is a prime example — American cotton supplies Pakistani mills, which in turn export finished garments to the US. Disrupting this value chain benefits neither country.\n\n“The road ahead is challenging, but it also presents a chance for Pakistan to recalibrate and strengthen its export framework,” the report noted. \n\nWith timely diplomacy, strategic policy reforms and bold diversification efforts, Pakistan can not only withstand this external shock but also emerge as a more competitive and resilient player in the global economy, it concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025","summary":"• Study by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics says US policy should serve as ‘wake-up call’ for export diversification\n\n• Warns tariffs may cost textile sector half a million jobs; leather, rice, surgical instruments, sporting goods also vulnerable\n\n\n\nISLAMABAD: The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products announced by US President Donald Trump — later suspended temporarily — could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serves as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.\n\n\n\n“A storm may be brewing on Pakistan’s trade horizon,” said the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (Pide), adding that the “proposed reciprocal tariffs by the United States could have a devastating impact on the country’s export sector”.\n\n\n\nIn a stark policy note, the institute cautioned that these tariffs could lead to macroeconomic instability, significant job losses and a critical reduction in foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\n\nThe study, titled ‘Impact of Unilat","url":"https://www.dawn.com/news/1904017/trump-tariffs-could-pose-14bn-risk-to-pakistan-exports","image":"https://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 00:19:05","author":"Khaleeq Kiani","authors":["Khaleeq Kiani"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.109},{"id":310811278,"title":"Singapore downgrades 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0-2%, citing impact of Trump tariffs on global trade","text":"SINGAPORE: Singapore has downgraded its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2025 to 0 per cent to 2 per cent, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Monday (Apr 14), citing the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on global trade.\n\nIn February, Singapore’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 was at 1 to 3 per cent, taking into account an expected easing in the overall growth of Singapore’s key trading partners, including the US and China, the ministry added.\n\n\"Since then, the US has imposed a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on all countries and higher reciprocal tariffs targeted at countries that run large trade surpluses with the US,\" said MTI. \n\nThe ministry noted that the tariffs imposed by Trump and the ongoing trade war between the US and China are expected to \"weigh significantly on global trade and global economic growth\".\n\nIt added that regionally, the growth outlook of economies will be \"negatively affected\" by a fall in external demand due in part to the tariffs’ wider impact on global trade and growth.\n\n\"Business and consumer sentiments will also be dampened, thereby crimping domestic consumption and investments in many economies,\" said MTI.\n\nSingapore's economy grew 3.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, according to advance estimates from the ministry.\n\nThe tariffs, announced by Trump on Apr 2, impose a universal 10 per cent tariff on all imports into the country, with higher rates for countries deemed to have treated the US \"unfairly\".\n\nTrump on Apr 9 hit the pause button on imposing higher levies on its trading partners - except China - for 90 days, but Singapore, which currently imposes zero tariffs on US imports, is still subject to the baseline 10 per cent rate.\n\nWhile Singapore “may or may not” slip into recession this year, the economy will be significantly impacted, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said.\n\n“Slower growth will mean fewer job opportunities and smaller wage increases for workers. And if more companies face difficulties or relocate their operations back to the US, there will be higher retrenchments and job losses,” he said on Apr 8.\n\nBeyond immediate concerns, Mr Wong added the tariffs confirm the stark reality that “the era of rules-based globalisation and free trade is over”.\n\nSingapore will form a national task force to support businesses and workers in response to the tariffs which could slow economic growth, and impact jobs and wages, he said.\n\nThe task force, chaired by Mr Gan, will include representatives from Singapore's economic agencies, the Singapore Business Federation, the Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-economy-gdp-2025-q1-trump-tariffs-mti-5053721","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--mfCTWjsU--/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/06/20/office%20workers%20CBD%20singapore%204.jpg?itok=asniLbkF","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14

that Rory McIlroy had the talent to make history.\n\nThe extent to which he would do so was the only question, a question now answered emphatically by victory in the Masters to complete the career grand slam.\n\nMcIlroy is the first European player to have won all four major titles, joining an elite club populated by greats of the sport Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\n\nAnd the 35-year-old is two more wins away from becoming the most successful European player of the modern era, Sir Nick Faldo having won both the Masters and Open Championship three

opening 68 – the only bogey-free round of the day – in the 2007 Open at Carnoustie just two months after his 18th birthday.\n\nBack in his home country, of course, they had been well aware of McIlroy’s talent for years.\n\nAged 16 he shot a course record of 61 at Royal Portrush, the venue for the 2019 Open, and the following year became European amateur champion and reached number one on the world amateur rankings.\n\nMcIlroy turned professional after playing in the Walker Cup against an American side that included Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson and in just his second event was third in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland.\n\nA first European Tour victory arrived in the Dubai Desert Classic in 2009, while his maiden PGA Tour title came in spectacular fashion with a closing 62 in the Quail Hollow Championship.\n\nThe following year brought a first major title as he decimated the field in the US Open, a record-breaking win made more remarkable by what had happened at Augusta National just two months before.\n\nTaking a four-shot lead into the final round, McIlroy collapsed to a closing 80 and finished 10 shots behind the winner Charl Schwartzel, a nightmare he later described as a “huge turning point” in his career.\n\nIt is a career that has had its fair share of ups and downs both on and off the course, from calling off his wedding to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki after invitations had been sent out to a contract dispute with his former management company.\n\nThere was the ankle injury suffered playing football which prevented him defending his Open title in 2015, an ill-judged round of golf with United States president Donald Trump and the controversial decision not to compete in the Olympics when golf made its return to the Games in Rio in 2016.\n\nAnd who knows what the fall-out would have been had he missed his tee time on the final day of the Ryder Cup in 2012 and potentially prevented Europe from producing the ‘Miracle of Medinah’?\n\nMcIlroy, of course, made it with minutes to spare – before beating Keegan Bradley – and partly thanks to a PGA of America employee, Erica Stoll, who would go on to become his wife.\n\nBut if that was down to sheer good luck, everything he has achieved on the course has been down to that natural talent and a resilience to recover from the close calls in the 2022 Open, 2023 US Open and last year’s US Open at Pinehurst.\n\nThe man who took advantage of McIlroy’s late stumble that day, Bryson DeChambeau, was alongside him in the last group on Sunday as McIlroy gained revenge, fittingly joining golf’s most exclusive club by winning at its most exclusive club.","summary":"McIlroy finally won the Masters to fulfil a lifelong dream and end an 11-year major

Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere.\n\nIt was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed.\n\n“It’s not really an exception. That’s not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.”\n\nGreer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.”\n\nOn Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.”\n\nSome had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever.\n\nThe administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China.\n\nIt would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., burdening Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone and torpedo sales of its marquee product.\n\nThe turmoil has battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.\n\nAt one point, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline.\n\nAn electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration.\n\nThat united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nApple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs.\n\nAn electronics exemption would remove “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick’s comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.”\n\nNeither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nO’Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

Pelosi denied that her husband traded on information she gave to him.Former President Joe Biden also endorsed a ban on congressional stock trading during the final months of his administration.What To KnowTrump in the first days of April announced a sweeping slate of tariffs, including reciprocal tariffs against dozens of nations, that sent the U.S. economy into a near-freefall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 4000 points in just a few days.Despite reports that Trump intended to stick to his guns on tariffs, he reversed course just days later, prompting a massive rally in the stock market for one of the best days of trading ever.However, analysts noted a spike in trading activity shortly before Trump announced his 90-day pause for reciprocal tariffs while a 10 percent universal tariff remains in place and China faces a 145 percent tariff.On April 8, Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a \"GREAT TIME TO BUY,\" leading Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, to suggest Trump had foresight. Schiff and Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, then sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer asking for an investigation into potential conflict of interest.Democrats renewed those calls during interview appearances on Sunday morning talk shows. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct a \"sweeping review of all securities traded\" by federal officials to determine if any of them violated insider trading laws.\"There are people who have looked at what happened to purchase and to calls just before he [Trump] made that announcement that caused the stock market to skyrocket,\" Warren told CNN host Jake Tapper on State of the Union. \"But let me be clear with the back-and-forth here. That's what investigations are for, and it's entirely appropriate to have an investigation to make sure that Donald Trump, Donald Trump's family, Donald Trump's inner circle didn't get advanced information and trade on that information.\"\"This is how the stock market works in order to make sure on a consistent basis that no one is trading on insider information,\" Warren said, adding that \"the same thing should apply to Congress.\"Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, during his appearance on NBC News' Meet the Press renewed his call for an investigation into potential insider trading, telling host Kristen Welker: \"The real group that should be holding investigations and accountability, and even just oversight, is Congress.\"\"There is enough of an offense here, enough smoke here, that should demand congressional hearings,\" he said, insisting Congress is \"meant to hold oversight over the president.\"He added: \"These are real, legitimate, justifiable questions, and not to have hearings, not to do any kind of oversight, undermines the faith in our government, undermines the trust we need in our nation right now.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump posted to Truth Social last week: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\" He ended the post with the letters DJT, both his initials and the stock market ticker of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp, the firm in which he holds a majority stake.When asked why he paused tariffs, Trump told reporters on Wednesday: \"Well, I thought that people were jumping a little out of line, they were getting yippy...they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.\"Senator Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said in his video on Wednesday: \"Look, this is a president who is trading in his own meme coin, even as he's president, his kids are trading in their own cryptocurrency. You've got people like Elon Musk who are doing their own conflicted self-dealing in the administration. In any administration this corrupt it is more than necessary to ask, were people personally profiting from insider information while people's savings, their retirement accounts were being torched?\"Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a video posted on X: \"Who close to Trump knew that he was going to suspend the tariffs? Which of his Mar-a-Lago friends or his billionaire advisers were able to capitalize on that inside information? Why did Trump send out that post to his supporters earlier in the day? The bottom line is the chaotic nature of this tariff policy with Trump's position changing every single hour gives ample opportunity for any individual who has early access to information about the White House's change in position to make boatloads of money, either by investing at the right time or pulling their money out of the market at the right time. This entire White House is one giant grift.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, wrote on X: \"Any member of Congress who purchased stocks in the last 48 hours should probably disclose that now. I've been hearing some interesting chatter on the floor. Disclosure deadline is May 15th. We're about to learn a few things.

We bundled up and then trundled up to tour a bitingly cold place, in what is suddenly a hot neighborhood.Who knows for how much longer, but for now Greenland truly might be the last frontier, all snow-dusted mountains and icebergs — blazing blue and sometimes the size of cruise ships — that come lazing down the fjords. Greenland has been part of the Danish kingdom for 300 years, though the capital Nuuk sits closer to New York than it does to Copenhagen. And the towns and villages cling only to the coastline; with no roads connecting them. You're better off cross-country skiing the terrain, as does Maliina Abelsen, a former finance minister and a native Greenlinder. The spotlight cast on her homeland is, she says, overwhelming.Maliina Abelsen: This is new for us, and we probably have to get used to-- to the attention. It's so much more intense at the moment.Jon Wertheim: And it's intense because why specifically?Maliina Abelsen: It's intense because the whole world order is changing.She's currently chairperson of the largest company in the territory, Royal Greenland, a leader in fishing, an industry that accounts for more than 90% of the territory's exports. Doing business here, on top of the world, gives a whole new meaning to the phrase weather dependent.Maliina Abelsen: So when people come to Greenland they can get very frustrated when they say, \"Oh, my flight was delayed with five hours.\" And I say, \"Five hours? That's not a delay; five weeks is a delay.\" So you kind of have to adapt. Because otherwise you are not able to survive here in Greenland.The territory is lodged between North America and Europe, so massive it encompasses three time zones; yet so sparse that in one of those time zones the listed population is eight. But determined to explore, we headed south from Nuuk by plane. We were prepared for delays, less so the annihilating cold on a boat ride across a fjord. The temperature that balmy morning? Minus-12 Fahrenheit. Our destination: the Plymouth Rock of Greenland.Greenland was settled by Erik the Red, so named as much for his fiery temper as his fiery beard. Banished from his native Norway, he headed west and ended up right around here, in 982. He was a fearless and fearsome frontiersman. Erik the Red was also a slick marketer and salesman. This vast patch of ice? He named it Greenland in hopes of luring investors, farmers and other settlers. A thousand years later…Donald Trump (3/4/25): \"We will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before..\"A different kind of sales pitch, this to a joint session of Congress last month.Donald Trump (3/4/25): \"And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland… We strongly support your right to determine your own future.\" Aqqaluk Lynge: We saw your faces at Congress grinning about Greenland.Aqqaluk Lynge, an elder Inuit statesman once represented the Arctic population at the United Nations. For him, Trump's Greenland fixation is more than troubling; it's offensive. Aqqaluk Lynge: When he mentioned-- Greenland, like it was a toy or-- or something.Jon Wertheim: You noticed that?Aqqaluk Lynge: We all noticed that in Greenland, all of us. And it was ugly.When President Trump first made eyes at Greenland in 2019, on the island, it had the effect of fueling a spirit of independence, a reassessment of the relationship with Denmark, which pumps in around $800 million a year, but also, historically, imposed its values on Inuit culture. The coupling of Denmark and Greenland, well, it's complicated.Maliina Abelsen: It's like a forced marriage, if you can say so. At least it was from the Greenlandic side. 'Cause they-- we have never been asked if we wanna be part of the Danish kingdom. Then we have a lover coming into the relationship. And that lover is pointing at one and saying, \"Oh, I really, really like your wife there. And that's when you saw that there was whole dynamic change between Denmark and Greenland. Jon Wertheim: Should we keep going with that analogy? Are you attracted to the lover?Maliina Abelsen: I think that some people got a little attracted and they thought, \"Ooh, that could be much better. That-- lover looks so rich and powerful.\" But we have also seen how our Inuit-- cousins live in-- in-- in Alaska, and how they were treated. We definitely do not wanna go down that road.In the city, such as it is, of Nuuk, (population 20,000) locals turned out last month for a demonstration: a remarkable show of unity for a country so spread out, and, historically, so measured.The rally included newly elected Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen. Jens-Frederik Nielsen: And it's all clear that we stand together, no matter what-- political color you have, we stand together on this issue. Greenland is for Greenlanders, not for anybody else.The demonstration ended outside an old wooden cottage that serves as the American consulate. Per one recent poll, just 6% of the local population favor U.S. control. The loudest pro-American voice we encountered was an American; the founder of the \"Bikers for Trump.\"Chris Cox: My name is Chris Cox. I'm from the United States and I have come here to try to make some friends.On his own dime and own time, Cox came to Greenland from his home in Charleston, South Carolina, a Trump evangelist on an unofficial mission.Chris Cox: We are not looking at you like a tiger looks at a gazelle wanting to pounce on you. Jon Wertheim: What have you learned about this place?Chris Cox: I've learned that it-- it's-- it's a very unique people. They're a docile people. They're a peaceful people.The U.S. has long been enthralled by Greenland. In the 1860s—the gilded age of empire, when land masses were bought and sold like horses-and-buggies—talk first surfaced of America acquiring the territory. During the second World War, Americans were given control of Greenland. They built 17 military bases. The most significant, Bluie West One in Narsarsuaq, in the south of the territory, was a crucial stopoff before D-Day.When the Americans shut the base down in the 50s, they didn't much clean up after themselves; these drums remain today, but so does a military museum celebrating America's presence here. On display: images of proud American airmen, some of whom left a literal legacy.Maliina Abelsen: There's a strong-- long relationship with the Americans. And as-- I am one of them-- or what can you say, my grandmother had a child with the American soldier from Narsarsuaq -- I-- I am a product of that relationship.Jon Wertheim: You're one quarter American, essentially.Maliina Abelsen: That's correct.After the War, President Truman tried to buy Greenland for $100 million in gold. Denmark declined, but the two countries did sign a 1951 treaty—it still stands today—giving broad license for the U.S. military to operate in Greenland.Today, Tule, now called Pituffik Space Base, figures critically in U.S. anti-missile defense, and was the site of Vice President Vance's recent visit — a visit that triggered the firing of the base commander for - in the eyes of the Trump administration - not showing sufficient support for the U.S. agenda there.The administration maintains that acquiring Greenland is essential for world security. As ice caps melt and the Arctic trade routes and new sea lanes become more important, U.S. control would thwart Russia and China's access. Trump has derided Denmark for not being up to the job.But why would the current administration seek to acquire a place where America has always been so welcomed? In Copenhagen, political scientist Ole Wæver, questions the entire premise of Trump's aggressive stance.Ole Wæver: Bottom line is the Americans are militarily on Greenland as much as they want.Jon Wertheim: So if President Trump said, \"We wanna do X in Greenland,\" outside of this realm of-- of buying, or annexing, or seizing. Just-- \"We need to put up a base in Greenland--\"Ole Wæver: They wouldn't get a no.Jon Wertheim: They wouldn't get a no?Ole Wæver: No.Jon Wertheim: So, what's going on here?Ole Wæver: That's a good question. And everyone is-- is scratching their heads in-- in-- in Copenhagen and-- and Nuuk as well. For all the head scratching, the consequences could be severe. Ole Wæver: To invade and-- and annex a part of another member country then it would be necessary in the next NATO meeting to say by everyone else that this is a violation of everything we know.Jon Wertheim: This would blow NATO to pieces?Ole Wæver: It would. It is just a violation that is just one bridge further than anything we have seen so far.Wæver also joins the chorus of those worrying that if the U.S. annexes Greenland, it would rewrite the rules for international relations…Ukraine invaded by Russia. Or China potentially taking over Taiwan?….Incursions like these play differently if we're now in a might-makes-right world.Apart from geo-strategy, the U.S. does offer another reason for acquiring Greenland. It's that time-honored justification for empire building: riches, lots of riches.There are minerals in Greenland. But getting to them, like getting anything and anywhere here, is a mission in itself. We joined Eldur Ólafsson, CEO of Amaroq Minerals, which operates one of the two active mines in Greenland.Jon Wertheim: I think there are mines in this world that are easier to get to.Eldur Ólafsson: Certainly, yes.The Trump inner circle portrays Greenland as a bonanza, a cookie jar of commodities and natural resources: gold, zinc, copper and rare earth minerals, seen as essential for the future world economy. Mines across Greenland have come and gone over the centuries, largely because of the logistical challenges. But with gold prices at all-time highs, Ólafsson estimates that, with prudent planning and patience, there is $150 million a year to be made from this mine.Jon Wertheim: So we're going into the mountain now?Eldur Ólafsson: Yeah. So we're going into and up, which is quite rare in today's mining world.….Not for the claustrophobic, it's a bumpy 30-minute ride through sinuous tunnels…Jon Wertheim: You just haphazardly picked up this shard, but I c-- I can see with the naked eye, you can see all the gold there.Eldur Ólafsson: Yes.Jon Wertheim: How much gold is in this gold belt?Eldur Ólafsson: We can't say for certain, because we would have to drill it all out. This is completely untested. So-- dozens of millions of ounces potential, for sure.Jon Wertheim: Millions of ounces of gold--Eldur Ólafsson: Mmm.Jon Wertheim: --here in Greenland, potentially?Eldur Ólafsson: Yeah.There may be gold in them, thar hills… but geologists we consulted were deeply skeptical of the promise of any natural resource jackpot in Greenland. Plenty of other countries — America included — have just as many, if not a lot more untapped minerals.Regardless of who, ultimately, controls Greenland, foreign investment into sectors like mining is — and always has been — welcome…consistent with a catchphrase we heard repeatedly: we are not for sale; but we are open for business. Still, this vast land has been thrown, vastly, off-balance.Jon Wertheim: Is there any sense that this is just about the ambition to expand and plant a flag and this isn't about bases and resources?Maliina Abelsen: Yeah but-- that's what-- that's what concerns me. We're talking about people who lives here. It's disrespectful.Aqqaluk Lynge has a more defiant message still: Aqqaluk Lynge: If you should try something in the Arctic-- you should be very careful. I think-- we should say-- ice is slippery.Produced by Michael H. Gavshon. Edited by Daniel J. Glucksman. Field producer: Jakob Illeborg. Associate producer, Elizabeth Germino.

Likewise, the parallel market slipped by 3.4 per cent w/w against the dollar to exchange at N1,600.00/$1.\n\nIn the forwards market, the naira rates decreased across the 1-month (-3.0 per cent to N1,670.42/$1), 3-month (-3.6 per cent to N1,752.18/$1), 6-month (-5.2 per cent to N1,870.78/$1), and 1-year (-7.5 per cent to N2,087.66/$1) contracts.\n\nThe development, according to industry stakeholders, was due to the pullback which was largely driven by escalating US-China trade tensions, as fresh tariff hikes reignited fears of a global economic slowdown, dampening expectations for oil demand—particularly from key industrial consumers.\n\nOn the supply side, OPEC’s decision to bring forward its production ramp-up added further downside pressure, stoking concerns of a potential market oversupply. With weakening demand fundamentals coinciding with increased output, investor sentiment was volatile, leading to broad-based selling across the market.\n\nAlready, U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan has warned that global risks driven by falling oil prices and renewed trade tensions could deepen Nigeria’s macroeconomic vulnerabilities.\n\nThe bank, in a research note titled Frontier Local Markets Strategy: Reducing Risk Further, urged investors to close their positions in the country’s treasury bills as Brent crude oil approaches sub-$60 levels.\n\nThe bank had backed Nigeria’s carry trade for its high yield and relative stability. However, J.P. Morgan has now shifted its stance, citing a changing global environment worsened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s push for sweeping global tariffs.\n\n“While Nigeria may well avoid a recession itself, the substantial decline in oil prices below its break-even of $60/bbl would push Nigeria’s current account balance into deficit,” the report stated. \n\nBrent crude oil price on Friday fell 1.3 per cent w/w to $64.71/bbl (previously $65.58/bbl), pressured by renewed demand-side concerns and rising supply risks. Despite being an oil-exporting nation, Nigeria is grappling with a paradox: higher oil prices have not translated into stronger FX inflows or currency stability. \n\nBut instead, rising costs are fueling inflationary pressures and increasing the cost of imports, further burdening the local currency.\n\nAs a result, the naira has continued to depreciate against major currencies, even as the CBN ramps up its interventions to stabilize the FX market. The apex bank has reiterated that it will keep monitoring global developments and will continue to take necessary steps to ensure the naira remains relatively stable. \n\nHowever, financial experts noted that while the CBN’s interventions may help cushion the naira in the short term, the long-term outlook remains uncertain unless broader reforms are implemented to boost non-oil exports and attract foreign direct investment.\n\nHead, Research and Strategy at Cordros Capital, an investment firm based in Lagos, Jolomi Odonghanro, said that the naira is likely to remain under pressure as the FX market remains highly vulnerable to global shocks, driven by the U.S. tariff-induced trade tensions that continue to trigger capital outflows.\n\n“Compounding this are foreign investors’ concerns over declining oil earnings, stemming from the slump in oil prices — a development that could lead to a trade deficit and a shortfall in the current account.\n\nNevertheless, CBN’s sustained interventions are expected to cushion the naira from sharp depreciation in the near term. Without structural changes to diversify Nigeria’s export base, reliance on CBN interventions will not be sustainable,” Odonghanro said.\n\nAlso speaking, an economic expert at the Lagos Business School, Dr. Ifeanyi Okechukwu, noted that without structural reforms, Nigeria will remain vulnerable to external shocks, even in times of high oil prices.\n\n“Trump wants cheap crude oil and so the level of optimism for the economy should be a cautious one. Although the macroeconomic fundamentals look credible and positive, we are actually in the deep blue sea with what is happening around crude oil prices because foreign investors are not really concerned with our net reserves, balance of trade, as those do not tell you the wealth of an economy.\n\nA lot of things have been going wrong and so we need to be very careful about our trajectory of optimism of the naira. We really need to diversify our earnings, as we cannot continue to rely on FX standings,” Okechukwu stated.","summary":"By Chinwendu Obienyi Nigeria&#8217;s foreign exchange (FX) market is once again facing renewed volatility as global economic uncertainties, driven by slumping oil prices and protectionist trade measures from the United States, continue to exert pressure on the naira and the nation’s external reserves.

Eichorn won in 2022 with nearly 64% of the vote. So there’s a good chance the candidate who wins the Republican primary will go on to claim the Senate seat.\n\nTrump handily carried the district in his 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut Crow Wing County GOP Chair Lowell Smith isn’t taking anything for granted. Historically — and this year in particular — Republicans across the country haven’t done as well as Democrats in turning out core voters in special elections.\n\n“We’re going to do everything we can to turn out the vote,” Smith said.\n\nBut Democrats think they’ve got an outside shot. They’ve endorsed Denise Slipy, an environmental health and safety professional from Breezy Point. Other Democrats have bowed out.\n\nSlipy will face the Republican primary winner in the April 29 special election. The outcome won’t flip the balance of power in the Senate, where Democrats currently have a two-vote majority.\n\n“It’s a tough district, but we’re going to do everything we can. Folks are going to sign up to phonebank and door knock up there,” Minnesota DFL Party Chair Richard Carlbom told MPR News this month. “And on April 29, we’re going to see just how much ground we can gain and hopefully gain enough to win that seat.”\n\nThe Republican contenders are largely in harmony on conservative positions, such as lowering taxes, cutting spending and barring transgender athletes from girls’ sports.\n\nSeveral said they back Trump’s recent actions, including massive layoffs and cuts to federal agencies.\n\nJennifer Carnahan owns two shops in downtown Nisswa. Since January, she’s also served as mayor of the tourist destination north of Brainerd with about 2,000 residents, whose population swells in the summer.\n\nCarnahan said she worked hard to win the mayoral seat and wasn’t eager to leave her new role. But when Eichorn abruptly resigned, she decided to throw her hat in the ring.\n\n“I just didn’t view there was any loss to jump in,” she said. “I’d go out there and work hard, share my conservative values, how I could still be an asset and help Nisswa, but a broader community if I am elected. And if not, I still have my mayoral term for two years, and we can still do great things.”\n\nCarnahan is a familiar name to political observers. She’s the widow of U.S. Rep. Jim Hagedorn, who died of cancer in 2022. She’s also the former state Republican Party chair, whose tenure was marked by controversies before she resigned in 2021.\n\nAlso running is Josh Gazelka, whose father is former GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka.\n\nJosh Gazelka is 31 years old and lives in Pequot Lakes. He works for a Texas-based marketing firm and said he had no plans to get into politics.\n\n“If you told me three weeks ago I’d be running, I think I would have laughed you out of the room,” he said in an interview earlier this month. “Because I’ve seen firsthand growing up what it looks like. It really is service paired with a lot of flak, no matter what you do.”\n\nBut Gazelka said when the seat came open, he felt a calling to serve, citing the impact of state taxes on the local economy as a key issue.\n\n“I love the different businesses in the area. I love the idea of having my family here,” he said. “But I just know how difficult it is to just survive, and it’s driving people out of the state.”\n\nKeri Heintzeman said she had been thinking for a while about running for office. She has campaigned for Trump and for her husband, Josh Heintzeman, who represents the area in the state House.\n\n“I’ve knocked thousands and thousands of doors, and been able to hear what are the concerns of people and how that relates to government,” she said.\n\nHeintzeman said Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson first called to see if her husband was thinking about running for the Senate. But his departure would leave an open seat in the House, where membership is evenly split between parties.\n\n“I said, ‘Do you have another candidate in mind from our area?’ And he said, ‘How about Keri Heintzeman?’ ” she recalled. “My heart leaped. I knew that that was something I’d been thinking about for many years.”\n\nHeintzeman said her history with political campaigns helped her hit the ground running despite the shortened timeline, quickly launching lawn signs and campaign mailers. But she said she’s “not running as anybody’s wife.”\n\n“I’m standing on my own two feet and my own experience,” she said.\n\nPolling places will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, April 15.

T The US district court judge handling the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia now is weighing whether to grant a request from the man's legal team to compel the government to explain why it should not be held in contempt. Any move toward a contempt finding would represent an extraordinary turn in the Trump administration's assertion of presidential authority, both generally and specifically over immigration policy. Also Read | Donald Trump Physical Exam: US President ‘Fully Fit’ to Serve as Commander in Chief, Says His Doctor. The government's latest daily status update, filed Sunday as required by Judge Paula Xinis, states essentially that the Trump administration has nothing to add beyond its Saturday statement that, for the first time, confirmed that Abrego Garcia, 29, was alive and remained in an El Salvador prison under the control of that country's government. That means for the second consecutive day, the administration has not addressed Xinis' demands that the administration detail what steps it was taking to return Abrego Garcia to the United States. The US Supreme Court ruled last Thursday that the Trump administration must bring him back. Xinis followed that with an order Friday requiring the administration to disclose Abrego Garcia's “current physical location and custodial status” and “what steps, if any, Defendants have taken (and) will take, and when, to facilitate” his return.

The Trump administration has asserted that Abrego Garcia, who lived in the US for about 14 years before being deported, is a member of the MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia has disputed that claim, and he has never been charged with any crime related to such activity. The Trump administration has called his deportation a mistake but also has argued, essentially, that its conclusion about Abrego Garcia's affiliation makes him ineligible for protection from the courts. Abrego Garcia's location was first confirmed to the court by Michael G. Kozak, who identified himself in the Saturday filing as a “Senior Bureau Official” in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. Sunday's status update was signed by Evan C. Katz, who was identified in the filing as assistant director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security. Separately, Abrego Garcia's lawyers have asked Xinis to issue an order compelling the government to explain to the court why it should not be held in contempt for failing to comply fully with previous orders. As of early Sunday evening, Xinis had not filed such an order. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also have asked Xinis to order the government, among other things, to produce documents and contracts that detail the US agreement with El Salvador to house people deported from the US or, in absence of such records, to require that government officials testify in court about the arrangement. Xinis expressed frustration Friday during a hearing in her Maryland courtroom when a US government attorney struggled to provide any information about Abrego Garcia's whereabouts. “Where is he and under whose authority?” the judge asked during the hearing. “I'm not asking for state secrets. All I know is that he's not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I'm asking a very simple question: Where is he?” The judge repeatedly asked a government attorney about what has been done to return Abrego Garcia, asking pointedly: “Have they done anything?” Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general, told Xinis that he had no personal knowledge about any actions or plans to return Abrego Garcia. But he told the judge the government was “actively considering what could be done” and said that Abrego Garcia's case involved three Cabinet agencies and significant coordination. Kozak's statement a day later stated: “It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador. He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.” The Justice Department has not responded to an Associated Press request for comment. During his time in the US, Abrego Garcia worked construction, got married and was raising three children with disabilities, according to court records. A U.S. immigration judge initially shielded Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faced persecution there by local gangs that terrorized his family. The Trump administration deported him there last month anyway, before describing the mistake as “an administrative error” but standing by its claims that he was in MS-13.

Susan Wild called Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's decision to hide her face in a photo at the White House \"cringey\" during an appearance Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I apologize ahead of time to the Democrats at the table because I don’t mean it aimed at you, but one thing that seemed to symbolize kind of the weird place that Democrats are in, and it is this photograph of governor Gretchen Whitmer standing in the White House,\" CNN host Jake Tapper began, speaking to his panel. \"It’s a picture of Gretchen Whitmer hiding her face.\" Whitmer was seen temporarily shielding her face from cameras in the Oval Office by holding up a folder, according to a photo by the New York Times. She later lowered the folder as the president spoke to the press and encouraged Whitmer to comment as well. Tapper asked Wild what was going on with her party during the discussion about the photo. \"That begs the question of what she was doing there anyway,\" Wild said, explaining that Whitmer was there to talk to the president about issues pertinent to her state. \"So, you know what I would have done if that was me, I would have said, ‘I‘m not going in there,’ or when the press came in or the cameras came in, I would have been out of there. It's cringey.\" TRUMP PRAISES DEM GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER AFTER SLAMMING HER LAST YEAR: 'VERY GOOD PERSON' \"The American automakers are happy about these tariffs. So, I understand why she went. But that was the ultimate cringey move right there. That was right out of 'Veep,'\" Wild added. President Donald Trump praised Whitmer after their meeting at the White House and said she had done a good job. According to a statement from a spokesperson for Whitmer, the governor and president discussed \"the northern Michigan ice storm, investing in Michigan’s defense assets, like Selfridge Air National Guard Base, tariffs and the importance of creating good-paying American jobs and bringing back critical supply chains and keeping our Great Lakes clean and safe.\" \"We're honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, great state of Michigan. And, she's been — she's really done an excellent job. And a very good person,\" Trump said during the press conference on Wednesday. Whitmer is widely seen as a future presidential candidate given she's the two-term governor of a swing state. Whitmer told reporters afterward that she thought she was coming into the Oval Office for a one-on-one meeting with the president and was surprised by the press conference.

In point of fact, the state representative said, due to growing uncertainty, “for this budget cycle,” tax hikes are off the table altogether.\n\n“We feel that, you know, in these uncertain times, that not knowing what is going to be happening with Washington, what industries they are going to be targeting, what circumstances — who’s going to be at the most risk — we felt it was not appropriate at this point in time to be adding any type of additional revenue, additional tax burden, to our residents and to our businesses,” Michlewitz told WCVB’s On the Record.\n\nAccording to the House budget chief, Bay State residents are already feeling some pain from the Trump Administration’s fiscal policies, and adding to that pain just didn’t seem right.\n\n“They are getting attacked from the federal side, we wanted to prevent that from happening on the state side as well,” he said.\n\nProposals by Gov. Maura Healey to tax candy sales or to change prescription drug fees, or any other new revenue generating ideas, will not feature in the House budget, according to the 3rd Suffolk lawmaker. Lower chamber lawmakers will instead focus on “balancing the budget with the revenues we have,” Michlewitz said. Budget writers are well aware of the possible impacts of an unreliable federal partnership, he said, and they’re just as concerned as any business.\n\n“The unpredictability here is what’s most concerning. You know, as a (state) budget writer — and any budget writer — predictability is very important. The unpredictability that you’re facing here with the federal government is making things extremely difficult in terms of how to project,” he said.\n\nBudget authors are used to dealing with the normal ups and downs of the markets and changes in the global economy, but “when you have a federal partnership, that we’ve had forever” and that’s all of the sudden proving unreliable, lawmakers are left wondering what might come next.\n\n“You tell me where to cut, I know I can cut. You tell me where I can grow the budget, I’ll grow the budget,” the Ways and Means Chair said. Problems occur, he said, because of “this day-to-day, you know, not knowing what’s coming next, what’s around the corner.”\n\n“I’d be worried about anything that’s tied to federal funding,” he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Ron Mariano, speaking to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce last week, said that “state money will not be able to fill every gap created by sweeping cuts at the federal level” and that lawmakers can’t know where the axe will fall.\n\n“There is still a huge amount of uncertainty regarding what will eventually be cut from the federal budget, especially when you consider that Trump and Elon are poised to make these cuts unilaterally, without consulting Congress,” Mariano said.\n\nBecause House budget writers are aware of potential gaps in federal funding, the House Speaker said, they “are committed to doing what we can in the House to ensure that residents and businesses here in Massachusetts are protected.”\n\n“As the House works to develop our budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, I want to say here and now that our fiscal 2026 budget will not raise taxes or fees on any residents or businesses here in the commonwealth,” Mariano said.\n\nThe governor’s $62 billion fiscal year 2026 budget proposed hiking spending by 7.4%, but to be fair to Healey, it was drafted well before President Donald Trump’s global Trade War.","summary":"The budget due to be released by the state House of Representatives next week will not include any tax hikes, according to leading lawmakers. ","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/13/state-budget-will-contain-no-tax-hikes-according-to-ways-and-means-chair/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rianonl04.jpg?w=1024&h=752","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 23:29:37","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":310807714,"title":"Nigeria and the US new tariffs","text":"President Donald Trump recently announced sweeping tariffs on all export goods to the United States (US) and a baseline 10 per cent tariff on all American imports. Tariffs are taxes on goods and services bought from other countries. They are also percentage of a product’s value. The tariffs that affect over 50 countries, including US major trade partners like China, European Union(EU) countries, Japan, Indian, and Africa, have already triggered a trade war with China. The tariff hike is already causing chaos in global financial markets. Among African countries, South Africa was slammed with the highest tariff of 30 per cent. \n\nTrump intends to use the tariff to boost US economy and encourage US consumers to patronise more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised that will lead to huge levels of investors in America. Experts predict that this could upend global economy, and imminent global recession, as well as reduce world’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 7 per cent, according to data from the World Trade Organisation(WTO). China, last Friday, swiftly responded to Trump’s tariff from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. The US leader raised tariff on China to 145 per cent from 125 per cent announced a week earlier. Nigeria is one of African nation’s that will be adversely affected by the new wave of Trump administration’s tariffs. \n\nHenceforth, exports from Nigeria to the US will attract 14 per cent tariff. Going forward, the 14 per cent tariff on Nigerian goods means that a $10 product will attract $1.40 tax on top, raising the total of such product to $11.40. In effect, the companies that bring such goods to the US will pay the tax to the US government, and such firms can choose to pass on some or all the cost to the final consumers. The 14 per cent tariff on Nigerian exports marks a significant change in the trade dynamics between both countries. \n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s trade with the US totaled N31.1trillion between 2015 and 2024. Total imports within the period stood at N16.4trillion, or 8.7 per cent, meaning that Nigeria is at the receiving end of Trump’s new tariffs. \n\nThis puts the Nigerian economy on a tailspin. The Federal Government, through the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, last week, admitted that several of Nigeria’s oil and non-oil exports will face adverse effects due to the 14 per cent tariff. \n\nUndoubtedly, this will disrupt trade relations and potentially weaken the competitiveness of Nigerian products in the US market. Worrisome too is the fact that the tariff will raise prices of goods and further weaken the value of the naira. It will also worsen already biting economic hardship in the country and slow down manufacturing activities as well as hinder international trade. It will also weaken the demand for Nigeria’s oil, the nation’s major export. Already, the price of oil in the international market has dropped. This will affect the target of the 2025 budget. \n\nNigeria’s export to the US has averaged $5.5billion annually in the last two years. A significant portion comprises crude oil and gas. The second-largest export category, accounting for 3 per cent includes fertilisers, urea, followed by lead, all valued at $82 million. \n\nNigeria also exports to the US smaller quantities of agricultural products, such as live plants, flour and nuts. They account for less than 2 per cent of Nigeria’s total exports to the US. \n\nAll of these products were previously exempt under African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a US trade initiative that allows eligible sub-Saharan African countries to export certain products to America duty-free. The overall aim of AGOA is to promote economic growth and development in Africa. With Trump’s sweeping tariffs, there is no hope for AGOA. Admittedly, tariffs can hamper international trade and cause disruptions to the balance of trade between two economies and a fierce trade war between superpowers. This is exemplified by the trade war between US and China. \n\nHowever, the US tariff should awaken emerging and vulnerable economies like Nigeria and the other developing countries. It is time for the federal government and its policymakers to aggressively boost the non-oil sector by enhancing the quality and control of Nigerian exports to meet global standards and improve international acceptability. \n\nThis is the time to reignite the goals of African Continental Free Trade Zones (AfcFTA) agreement, which includes enabling free flow of goods and services across the continent and boosting the trading position of Africa in the global market and eliminate trade barriers in Africa. Therefore, African leaders should take the Trump’s tariffs as a challenge to boost their economies through exports and become less dependent on American imports.","summary":"President Donald Trump recently announced sweeping tariffs on all export goods to the United States (US) and a baseline 10 per cent tariff on all American imports.

Rather, Trump said, “those products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’”\n\nWhite House advisers and Cabinet members tried to project confidence and calm amid Trump’s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs on imported goods from around the world. But their explanations about the overall agenda, coupled with Trump’s latest statements, also reflected shifting narratives from a president who, as a candidate in 2024, promised an immediate economic boost and lower prices but now asks American businesses and consumers for patience.\n\nA week ago, Trump’s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips.\n\nHere are the highlights of what Trump lieutenants said last week vs. Sunday:\n\nThere are varying answers on the purpose of the tariffs\n\nLong before launching his first presidential campaign in 2015, Trump bemoaned the offshoring of U.S. manufacturing. His promise is to reindustrialize the United States and eliminate trade deficits with other countries.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, interviewed on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” played up national security. “You’ve got to realize this is a national security issue,” he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war.\n\n“We don’t make medicine in this country anymore. We don’t make ships. We don’t have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right?” he said.\n\nLutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle.\n\n“The world cheats us. They’ve been cheating us for decades,” Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets.\n\nNavarro insisted the tariffs would yield broader bilateral trade deals to address all those issues. But he also relied on a separate justification when discussing China: the illicit drug trade.\n\n“China has killed over a million people with their fentanyl,” he said.\n\nSpeaking before Trump’s Truth Social post disputing the notion of exemptions, Lutnick alluded to that coming policy. “They’re going to have a special focus-type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” he told ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nThe status of negotiations with other nations, including China, remains fuzzy\n\nWith the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued that other countries would rush to the negotiating table.\n\n“I’ve heard that there are negotiations ongoing and that there are a number of offers,” Kevin Hassett, director of the White House Economic Council, told ABC. He claimed that “more than 50 countries (were) reaching out,” though he did not name any.\n\nNavarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials.\n\nGreer said on CBS that his goal was “to get meaningful deals before 90 days” –- the duration of Trump’s pause -– “and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.”\n\nTalks with China have not begun, he said. “We expect to have a conversation with them,” he said, emphasizing it would be between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump took an aggressive tone himself Sunday in his social media post, saying “we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People.”\n\nNavarro was not as specific about Beijing. “We have opened up our invitation to them,” he said. Lutnick characterized the outreach as “soft entrees … through intermediaries.”\n\nPressed on whether there is any meaningful back and forth, Navarro said, “The president has a very good relationship with President Xi.”\n\nThen he proceeded to criticize several China’s polices and trade practices.\n\nThe pitches are different, but confidence is constant\n\nNavarro was bullish even after U.S. and global trading markets suffered trillions of dollars in losses.\n\n“The first rule, particularly for the smaller investors out there, you can’t lose money unless you sell. And, right now, the smart strategy is not to panic,” he said on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”\n\nNavarro’s optimism did not waver despite another net-loss week for securities markets and rocky bond markets. “So, this is unfolding exactly like we thought it would in a dominant scenario,” he said.\n\nOthers confronted some of the more complex realities of trying to achieve Trump’s goal of restoring a bygone era of U.S. manufacturing.\n\nLutnick suggested the focus is on returning high-tech jobs, while sidestepping questions about lower-skilled manufacturing of goods such as shoes that could mean higher prices because of higher wages for U.S. workers. But some of that high-tech production is what Trump has, for now, exempted from the tariffs that he and his advisers frame as leverage for forcing companies to open U.S. facilities.\n\nHassett did acknowledge widespread angst.\n\n“The survey data has been showing that people are anxious about the changes a little bit,” he said, before steering his answer to employment rates. “The hard data,” he said, “has been really, really strong.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nATLANTA – Trump administration officials were out in force across the television&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Team Aims to Convey Assurance and Stability After Tariff Decisions Shake Markets first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-team-aims-to-convey-assurance-and-stability-after-tariff-decisions-shake-markets/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/FA2TYRUMCFFDRGCNWCO2CQL2SU.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 23:14:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":310810080,"title":"Trump vows nobody getting 'off the hook' for 'unfair' trade balances, says there was no tariff 'exception'","text":"President Donald Trump vowed on Sunday that nobody was getting \"off the hook\" for unfair trade balances and tariff barriers, which other countries have used against the U.S. The Trump administration announced Friday that it was exempting imported smartphones, laptops and other electronics from reciprocal tariffs, but the president wanted to clear a few things up. \"There was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,\" Trump said in a post on X on Sunday. \"These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. \"What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People,\" he continued. \"We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!\" TRUMP'S TARIFF BLITZ NOW EXEMPTING ELECTRICAL GOODS LIKE PHONES, LAPTOPS Trump closed out his post by saying the Golden Age of America will mean \"more and better paying jobs\" as well as making products in the U.S. and treating other countries as they have treated America. \"The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before,\" he said. \"We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Customs and Border Protection issued new guidance on reciprocal tariff negotiations late Friday, noting the exemption of those goods from Trump’s April 2 executive order that declared a national emergency due to non-reciprocal trade practices and structural imbalances in the global trading system. Subsequent executive orders ramped up tariffs on China to 125%. 'DEAL-MAKER-IN-CHIEF': BEHIND THE SCENES OF TRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE, WHERE HE HAS FINAL SAY OVER NEGOTIATIONS The updated guidance, which cites a presidential memorandum issued Friday, excluded the products from Trump’s 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global tariff on some countries. They apply to goods that left a warehouse as of April 5. The new move will likely ease the blow for consumers while giving a boost to electronics giants such as Apple, Samsung and Dell. A White House official confirmed to Fox News that the exemptions were put in place. CHINA REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON TARIFFS AFTER TRUMP THREATENED TOUGHER MEASURES Products included in the exemption are things like hard drives, computer processors, solar cells, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, flat-panel TV displays and memory chips. But in light of the easing of tariffs on electronics, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the exemption would be temporary. \"They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\" Lutnick told ABC’s \"This Week\" on Sunday. Lutnick’s comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the horizon. Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday night that he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \"We’ve been making a lot of money,\" he said. \"It’s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China, was making a lot of money.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS In a statement issued Saturday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not specifically address the exemptions but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies, including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia, that are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" Fox News Digital’s Michael Dorgan, Brie Stimson and Sarah Tobianski, as well as the Associated Press, contributed to this report.","summary":"President Trump said Sunday that no country was off the hook from tariff barriers and unfair trade balances, days after announcing exemptions on some electronics imports.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-vows-nobody-getting-off-hook-unfair-trade-balances-says-no-tariff-exception","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/04/931/523/trump-pointing-and-answring-question.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-13 23:12:54","author":"Greg Wehner","authors":["Greg Wehner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":310802612,"title":"BBC: Jak Trump likviduje americké univerzity","text":"BBC: Jak Trump likviduje americké univerzity\n\nModerátor, The World This Weekend, BBC Radio 4, neděle 13. dubna 2025, 13 hodin: Vítejte\n v pořadu The World This Weekend. U mikrofonu je Johnny Diamond. \nNejúspěšnější světové univerzity se střetávají s hnutím, které hluboce \nnedůvěřuje jejich politice.\n„Vysoké školy dostaly stovky miliard dolarů od tvrdě pracujících \ndaňových poplatníků, a my vyženeme to jejich protiamerické \nšílenstvíílenství z našich institucí jednou provždy.\"\n Donald Trump zadržel miliardy dolarů finančních prostředků a zbavil \nstovky zahraničních studentů víz, a probíhají deportace.

A výzkumných studií na \nléčbu rakoviny, cukrovky, srdečních a plicních onemocnění.“Pravice si však nic z toho nic nedělá Politika diverzity musí být rozdrcena.\n\n\n „V Americe neexistuje žádná instituce, žádná, která by měla menší rozmanitost než univerzity. Univerzity jsou baštami levicového myšlení.\"\n\n\nTrump: Vydáváme na vysoké školství více peněz než kterákoli jiná země, a přesto se z našich studentů stávají komunisté a teroristé a sympatizanti mnoha a mnoha různých rozměrů. To nemůžeme dopustit. Je načase nabídnout něco dramaticky jiného.“\n\n\nModerátor: Americké univerzity jsou uznávanými světovými špičkami, které vychovávají nositele Nobelových cen a dominují světovým žebříčkům a jsou zodpovědné za posouvání hranic lidského poznání. Co se tedy děje?\n\n\nZpravodajství: „Stovky milionů dolarů z federálních fondů jsou pozastaveny na několika univerzitách, včetně Northwesternu, granty a smlouvy v hodnotě 400 milionů dolarů pro Kolumbijskou univerzitu.“\n\n\nModerátor: Vedle pozastavení federálních fondů nebo hrozeb jejich pozastavením se objevily požadavky, aby univerzity zrušily politiku diverzity, potlačily údajný antisemitismus, přetvořily akademické katedry a administrativa se pustila do stíhání zahraničních studentů, kteří podle ní dělají problémy.\n\n!OK. Dobře, pojďme, pojďme ne, dobře. OK. Nebrání se. Dává mi svůj telefon. OK.\"\n\n\nModerátor: Více než deset lidí bylo zatčeno. Stovkám z nich byla zrušena víza, mnozí z nich se v posledních letech tak či onak zapojili do protiizraelskýchm, propalestinských protestů. Kdysi se myslelo, že i jejich svoboda projevu je chráněna. Není tomu tak, prohlásil bez skrupulí ministr zahraničí Marco Rubio:\n\n„Pokud přijdete do této země jako student, očekáváme, že budete chodit na přednášky, studovat a získáte titul. Pokud sem přijdete, abyste třeba demolovali knihovnu, převzali vládu nad kampusem a dělali různé šílené věci, zbavíme se těchto lidí. Takže když identifikujeme takové šílence, sebereme jim studentská víza, tisk si myslí, že studentská víza jsou nějakým druhem práva od narození, ne. Studentské vízum, to je, jako kdybych vás pozval k sobě domů. Když přijdete ke mně domů a položíte mi na gauč všechny možné věci. Vyhodím tě ze svého domu.“\n\n\nModerátor: Právě odnětí federálního financování výzkumu a doprovodné, často dosti vágní požadavky na reformu vyvolávají jedny z největších obav. Nejprve 400 milionů dolarů z Kolumbie v New Yorku, pak 200 milionů z Princetonu. Následovalo 9 miliard z Harvardu jen v tomto týdnu, miliarda pro Cornell a 790 milionů dolarů pro Northwestern bylo také zmrazeno. Ve čtvrtek se Donald Trump zeptal své ministryně školství Lindy McMahonové, jak se věci mají.\n\n\nTrump: „Takže máte něco k těm dolarům, které zadržujete poměrně velkému počtu univerzit, které se nechovají slušně?“ \n\n‚Ano,‘ odpověděla McMahonová.\n\n„Je tu Princeton. Cornell, další, které přicházejí a vlastně teď dostávám telefonáty od rektorů univerzit, kteří opravdu chtějí přijít a sednout si. Diskutovat.“\n\nNěkteří představitelé americké pravice si myslí, že univerzity si za peníze daňových poplatníků podestýlají peří, ale mnozí vidí ve snižování financování politickou zbraň, která má univerzity, jež se výrazně přiklánějí k levici na rozdíl průměrného Američana, násilím přimět k změně politické linie. Elitní vysokoškolské ústavy, říká Lynn Pasquerellová, prezidentka Americké asociace vysokých škol a univerzit, jsou náhle velmi silně ohrožené.\n\n\nLynn Pasquerellová: „V posledních měsících se pro vysoké školství vytvořila nová krajina, kterou utváří odebrání miliard dolarů z fondů a smluv na výzkum. Vysoké školství se stalo ohniskem politického diskurzu, kde jsou naše studijní programy podrobovány zkoumání, naše hodnoty zpochybňovány, naše autonomie omezována a mnoho vedoucích představitelů univerzit se ocitlo na nemožné křižovatce, aby si zachovali přístup k základnímu financování výzkumu, který zachraňuje životy a je hnacím motorem inovací. Slouží veřejnému blahu. Jsme nuceni ustoupit z těch principů institucionální autonomie, akademické svobody a sdílené správy, které definují vysoké školství a svobodnou společnost.“\n\n\nModerátor: Některým z nejbohatších a nejznámějších institucí ve Spojených státech byly odebrány stovky milionů, v některých případech miliardy federálních grantů. Souvisely tyto granty a jejich odebrání přímo s nějakou konkrétní politikou těchto institucí? Jste schopni rozeznat nějaký vzorec?\n\n\nLynn Pasquerellová: „No, toto odebírání federálních fondů na výzkum bylo údajně reakcí na selhání kampusů při řešení antisemitismu nebo na politiku, která umožňuje transsexuálním ženám soutěžit v ženských sportech, na tvrzení, že se na našich kampusech dopouštíme liberální indoktrinace. Obvinění, která byla vznesena, však nebyla nijak konkrétní, aby se jimi instituce zabývaly, a tak Princeton dostal oznámení, že mu budou odebrány miliony dolarů z financování výzkumu. Ale není jim jasné, proč tomu tak je, a tak na ideologické požadavky, které zasahují do akademické svobody, do institucionální autonomie, pojištěného řízení, je obtížné reagovat, pokud člověk nezná přesná obvinění vůči instituci.\n\n\nModerátor: Jaký dopad má odebrání tohoto druhu částek na instituce, které o tyto peníze přišly?\n\n\nLynn Pasquerellová: „No, viděli jsme, že Johns Hopkins musel propustit více než 2200 zaměstnanců, z nichž mnozí pracovali v rámci grantů USAID. V některých případech jsou důsledky skutečně otázkou života a smrti kvůli zastavení poskytování služeb a výzkumných studií na léčbu rakoviny, cukrovky, srdečních a plicních onemocnění a dalších život ohrožujících stavů, ale je zde také potenciál hlubokého a trvalého dopadu v podobě poklesu vědeckého pokroku, snížení konkurenceschopnosti na světovém trhu, narušení kariéry a neschopnosti postgraduálních studentů dokončit své programy a eroze veřejných účelů vysokoškolského vzdělávání.“\n\n\nLynn Pasquerellová: „Není pochyb o tom, že kolem hodnoty vysokoškolského titulu panuje skepse, že se veřejnost obává, že vysokoškolské vzdělání je příliš drahé. Že je příliš obtížně dostupné, nebo že jsme baštou liberálního progresivismu, která hodlá vymývat mozky další generaci sněhových vloček. Musíme se tedy zabývat způsoby, jakými jsme existovali ve věži ze slonoviny, jako je záměrně odtržení od praktických záležitostí každodenního života a těch, kterým se snažíme sloužit.“\n\n\n\n\nModerátor: Někteří považují zrušení a pozastavení federálního financování za přímé ohrožení svobody akademického bádání. Poukazují také na prudkou změnu ve způsobu, jakým se zachází s některými zahraničními studenty. Na mnoha amerických kampusech se v posledních dvou letech konaly dlouhé, hlasité a rušivé demonstrace proti izraelské válce v Gaze, někteří židovští studenti si stěžovali na obtěžování a antisemitismus. Mezi reakcemi federální vlády je nyní mimo jiné snaha vypořádat se s tím, co považuje za zahraniční potížisty. Stovkám studentů byla zrušena víza. Někteří studenti byli zatčeni, Rumeysa Ozturk, Turkyně studující na Tuftsově univerzitě v Massachusetts, byla zadržena, přemístěna mimo stát a nyní čeká na deportační řízení. Úřady uvedly, že byla zadržena poté, co se zapojila do aktivit na podporu Hamásu, ale její právnička Adriana Lafaye, která pracuje pro Americkou unii občanských svobod, konstatuje, že obvinění je neopodstatněné.\n\n\nAdriana Lafaye: „Právě před dvěma dny u imigračního soudu vláda předložila dokument týkající se důvodů pro zrušení studentského víza, což je základ všeho, co se jí děje. A jediná věc, která tam je, je tento redakční komentář, se spoluautorstvím, který, budu citovat, našel společnou věc s organizací Studenti za spravedlnost v Palestině, která byla později dočasně vykázána z univerzity. V tomto dokumentu se říká, že tato prostá zmínka o této jiné skupině v tomto komentáři by mohla, cituji, podkopat zahraniční politiku USA tím, že by vytvořila nepřátelské prostředí pro židovské studenty a naznačila podporu jmenované teroristické organizaci. Samozřejmě, že ne.“\n\n\nModerátor: Jak to vidíte vy a jak to vidí Americká unie občanských svobod. Je to součást vzorce. Soudního obtěžování zahraničních studentů, zejména na amerických univerzitách?\n\n\nAdriana Lafaye: „Určitě je to součást určitého vzorce. Došlo k řadě zatčení studentů, kteří se podíleli na propalestinských akcích, ale tento případ je tak nápadný, protože jde jen o jeden článek. Rumeysa se nepodílela na vyvolání žádných nepokojů. Univerzita uvedla, že nezpůsobila žádné výtržnosti, že jednala zcela v souladu se všemi univerzitními pravidly. Vedlo to k velkému zhoršení celkové atmosféry. Studenti mají obrovský strach. Studenti, kteří byli zapojeni do aktivismu, ale i studenti, kteří nebyli, se nesmírně bojí mluvit, a vůbec žít a dál existovat na těchto univerzitách.\n\n\nModerátor: Administrativa tvrdí, podívejte se, spousta těchto lidí pronáší antisemitské výroky. Stýkají se s antisemity, jsou to antisemitští aktivisté. A vůbec, tito lidé, zahraniční studenti s vízy, nemají stejná ústavní práva jako američtí občané, a tak by se upřímně řečeno neměli divit, když jejich chování vyvolá velmi odlišnou reakci úřadů?\n\n\nAdriana Lafaye: „Oni ale mají práva. Každý ve Spojených státech má právo na svobodu projevu. Zde je smyslem našeho prvního dodatku svoboda projevu. Práva nejsou jen chránit řečníka, ale chránit otevřenou výměnu myšlenek, a to je něco, z čeho těží jak neobčané, tak občané USA, a je to podstatná součást toho, co znamená mít univerzitu, kde si lze svobodně vyměňovat myšlenky.“\n\nZdroj v angličtině (audio, registrace) ZDE\n\nDonald Trump | USA | Školství\n\nBritské listy plně závisejí na finančních příspěvcích čtenářů.

Andrew Cuomo vowed he will stand up to “bully” President Trump if he’s elected New York City mayor — but critics sniped back that the Democrat knows all about bullying.\n\nCuomo, during a speech at First Corinthian Baptist church in Harlem, said he sparred with Trump during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n“We almost created issues to fight about,” Cuomo said at the end of Palm Sunday service. “It became so commonplace. But we fought about vaccines. We fought about federal resources. We fought about ships, we fought about everything,”\n\n“And you know what I learned about Mr. Trump? He is a bully,” he said. “And you know what you do with a bully? You stand up to a bully. When they put their finger in your chest, you step forward. You don’t step back … We’re going to stand up to the bully.”\n\nDuring his first-term as president, Trump called Cuomo a “bully thug.”\n\nCuomo was in Harlem to discuss his 500,000 units over 10 years housing plan, two-thirds of which will be affordable to people with low- and moderate-incomes. He said that would incentivize faith based-groups to use their surplus property for housing.\n\nCritics were more caught up on the “bully” jab.\n\n“Hello pot, meet kettle,” said upstate state Sen. George Borrello, who represents the Buffalo-Rochester region and dealt with Cuomo both as Chautauqua county executive and as a state legislator.\n\n“Cuomo was the biggest bully in Albany for years,” Borrello said.\n\nState Republican Party chairman Ed Cox scoffed at Cuomo’s claims.\n\n“Talk about a bully. Cuomo is the original thug in NY politics,” he said.\n\nQueens state Assemblyman Ron Kim in 2021 claimed a spitting-mad Cuomo threatened to “destroy” him if he didn’t help contain the damage over the Cuomo administration’s alleged cover-up of nursing home resident COVID-19 deaths.\n\nKim — whose uncle died of the coronavirus in a nursing home — said Cuomo told him in a heated phone interview, “You have not seen my wrath.”\n\nThe assemblyman declined to revisit the alleged threat on Sunday.\n\nA rep for city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander said Cuomo and Trump are two peas in a pod.\n\n“New Yorkers know that Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump are longtime friends who share a history of corruption, daddy issues, and sexual harassment allegations,” said Lander spokesperson Dora Pekec.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor under the threat of impeachment in 2021 over sexual harassment claims, which he denies.\n\nHe is now the Democratic-front runner for mayor, according to numerous polls.\n\nBut one long-time confidante of Donald Trump who also knows Cuomo well said the accusations of bullying show that both men are tough — a positive trait.\n\n“One thing you can say for certain: Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo are both very tough guys and in American politics only the tough survive,” said political consultant Roger Stone.","summary":"Ex-Gov.
