The 12th annual NVSBW was scheduled to run from Monday through Friday and would have honored America’s 1.6 million veteran-owned small businesses. \"By refusing to support a clean funding bill to reopen the government, Senate Democrats have frozen the majority of SBA’s services, including our small business lending programs and public events like National Veterans Small Business Week,\" said SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler blamed Senate Democrats, who have repeatedly blocked bills to fund the government since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. SENATE RETURNS TO WORK AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN NEARS LONGEST IN US HISTORY OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT She said Democrats \"continue to block pay for more than 1 million active-duty military members,\" adding that the Trump administration is \"pursuing every option\" to support the military during the shutdown. The theme for this year’s NVSBW — \"Veteran-Owned, American Made\" — was intended to highlight how veteran-owned small businesses drive U.S. manufacturing, strengthen national security and contribute more than $1 trillion in annual sales to the economy. TRUMP'S 'NUCLEAR' DEMAND NOT LANDING FOR SENATE REPUBLICANS AMID SHUTDOWN In a statement, the SBA said that all related events — including in-person and virtual training sessions, capital access workshops, and government contracting resources — have been suspended. \"The cancellation underscores how widely the shutdown has disrupted services and opportunities for those who have already sacrificed so much,\" the agency said. Democratic leaders have urged Republicans to begin negotiating an extension of expiring health insurance subsidies as part of efforts to reopen the government. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have blocked the GOP’s plan to reopen the government at least 13 times since the shutdown began, according to the White House.

Remaining election personnel with CISA, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, have since been prohibited from working with or contacting state election officials, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe cuts have sent state and local officials responsible for running elections searching for ways to shore up potential gaps in cybersecurity, threat monitoring and physical protection of polling places. Changes at Homeland Security are sinking in as the nation confronts a bitterly divided political climate marked by violent outbursts including the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nAmericans will head to the polls on Tuesday to decide the winners of gubernatorial, mayoral and legislative races, as well as judicial seats and ballot initiatives. Election Day marks the first real test of the political landscape since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, offering an early glimpse of how his administration will oversee elections whose integrity he and his allies have repeatedly challenged. The New York City mayoral race, in particular, has drawn national attention as a proxy battle over urban governance, progressive politics and the future of the Democratic party.\n\nHomeland Security officials continue to communicate and provide guidance to state and local personnel on other matters, according to an agency spokesperson.\n\n“Under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, CISA has refocused on its core mission and leads the nation’s effort to secure critical infrastructure, and that includes election infrastructure from cyber and physical threats,” said DHS spokesperson Scott McConnell. “Every day, DHS and CISA are providing our partners the most capable and timely threat intelligence, expertise and resources they need to defend against risks.”\n\nDHS officials forcibly reassigned or put on leave members of CISA’s election security and resilience team in the months after Trump returned to power in January, according to people familiar with the matter. The CISA team was charged with coordinating election security efforts among the more than 10,000 election jurisdictions throughout the U.S.\n\nThe federal government has historically taken a lead in uniting, informing, and enabling state and local election officials to secure elections. In February, CISA froze all election security activities and the department initiated a review of CISA’s role in helping state and local officials, Politico reported. Nine months later, the result has not been made public.\n\nThe loss of federal support is a “nasty shock” to election officials who have relied on federal support to fend off hackers and potentially violent plots, said Lux, who is also the supervisor of elections for Okaloosa County, Florida.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are reporting an increase in politically motivated violence, according to an October Pew Research Center poll. In one case, a Texas man was charged in September with making violent terroristic threats against New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.\n\nThe reduction in election security services come amid deeper cuts resulting in reduced capacity for CISA’s Cybersecurity Division to provide services to critical infrastructure entities. Remaining capabilities, such as vulnerability scans and ransomware notifications, also are degraded in quality, according to former CISA officials.\n\n“There are things important to the elections community that will be missing on this Election Day,” Lux said. “First and foremost, we have lost the ability to communicate on a national scale.”\n\nDuring the 2024 election cycle, suspicious packages containing white powder were sent to election offices in more than a dozen states. CISA’s election security team at the time served as a national intelligence clearinghouse, sharing detailed reports with election officials including photos of the handwriting and envelopes. The crime was not solved.\n\nDozens of malicious and suspicious cyber incidents targeting American election infrastructure occurred in the weeks leading up to Election Day, including phishing attempts, denial of service attacks and more, according to Lux. The 2024 election also saw at least 227 bomb threats, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. CISA’s situation room had been where intelligence on the threats was collected and sent to election officials around the country.\n\nThe Trump administration also appointed people who have spread conspiracies about the 2020 election results to prominent positions. Heather Honey, who spread false information about the vote in Pennsylvania that year, has served as the deputy assistant secretary for election integrity in DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans, according to an organizational chart on the department’s website.\n\nLux’s Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or EI-ISAC, tried to set up its own national version of the situation room for this year’s election. The effort failed because the organization, which lost federal funding this year, couldn’t afford the software licensing fees required to collect and share data with so many partners nationally. Lux said he intends to ask DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to confirm whether the CISA situation room will return in time for the midterm elections next year. CISA didn’t respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nEI-ISAC used to be a free program but, due to federal funding cuts, has been rolled into a larger paid membership with another information-sharing collective, Lux said. Major election jurisdictions can afford to have teams of cybersecurity professionals on staff. However, the demise of CISA’s free services and EI-ISAC’s new pricing model are expected to have an especially big impact on smaller and poorer jurisdictions.\n\nThat makes election offices with less funding particularly vulnerable to state-backed hackers from China, Russia and Iran, officials said. Attackers from each of those countries have previously sought to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\n“It’s those small, underserved jurisdictions which are the bigger concern because they are the least prepared to deal with it,” Lux said.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

They also needed to dip into the freezer to hand out food meant for next week’s distribution.\n\n“So many people are food challenged in our community,” said Michael Miller, treasurer for Hunger at Home, which sets up their operations in the parking lot every Monday morning. “Now, without the food stamps, people are desperate. We’re just trying to give a little hope here.”\n\nDemand for free food is soaring at Bay Area food pantries as recipients of the embattled federal food stamps program are seeing their accounts frozen and worry they won’t be able to feed their families.\n\nCharity programs that distribute food, meanwhile, are scrambling for more donations to restock their shelves.\n\nEver since Congress shut down the federal government over a spending bill stalemate, payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) used mostly at grocery stores have been in jeopardy. Tens of millions of recipients received notice last Thursday that their accounts weren’t being replenished in November.\n\nOn Monday, after a federal judge ruled that the Trump Administration must fund the food program, President Trump said he would use SNAP’s nearly $5 billion emergency fund for the month of November, but because there’s still a $4 billion shortfall to fully fund the program, benefits might be cut in half. How long it will take to release those funds remains uncertain.\n\n“I’m gonna starve,” said Nick Gamez, lining up at West Valley Community Services food pantry in Cupertino Monday. “I got this food bank, thank God, but I can barely get around. I ended up losing my job and being homeless. I lost where I lived for 30 years because I couldn’t pay the rent. So now I live in my son’s car.”\n\nThe Alameda County Community Food Bank, which distributes food to more than 350 food pantries in schools, senior centers, child care facilities and other agencies across the county, is seeing an “extraordinary increase” in demand for food, said spokesman Michael Altfest.\n\n“The lines are growing,” Altfest said. “We’ve been hearing from a lot of agencies that are running out of food very quickly.”\n\nCalls to the Alameda County food bank’s emergency helpline for people urgently seeking food have been doubling every week for several weeks, the surge driven mainly by people dependent on the SNAP program and anticipating the disruption, Altfest said.\n\nThe escalating demand for food resembles the early days of COVID, Altfest said, when shutdowns threw large numbers of people out of work.\n\nBut now, there’s a major difference.\n\n“During COVID, hunger and poverty went down, and that was because of interventions by the federal government,” Altfest said. “This time it’s the federal government that’s causing what’s happening.”\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of Bay Area residents are expected to be pushed out of the SNAP program in the coming weeks as county and state officials determine who no longer qualifies under President Donald Trump’s spending bill, which restricted eligibility.\n\nThe Alameda County food bank has also been providing weekly food deliveries for 200 to 300 employees of the Transportation Security Administration who work at Oakland San Francisco Bay Airport, and more than 1,500 workers from another federal agency, who haven’t been paid because of the federal government shutdown, Altfest added.\n\nFood pantries under the umbrella of the Food Bank of Contra Costa & Solano “are seeing more people standing in line,” said the non-profit’s advocacy and policy manager, Hailey Solares, while the phone has been “ringing off the hook” with people seeking food, spokesman Jeremy Crittenden added.\n\nThe current government shutdown is about to tie a record for duration. And because the last government shutdown didn’t disrupt SNAP benefits in California, Crittenden said, “we’re in uncharted territory.”\n\nAt the West Valley Community Services food pantry in Cupertino, Belkis Mir stood in line Monday with her 4-month-old, Subha, the youngest of her three children.\n\n“With the kids, I’m worried, because how can we survive with no food?” she asked. Already, SNAP wasn’t paying enough to cover the family’s food bill, so the West Valley pantry was a big help. She has been receiving benefits since her husband lost his job as a retail store manager four months ago — around the same time their infant was born.\n\n“People are losing jobs,” she said. “I know a lot of other friends that have been laid off. It’s really hard.”\n\nWest Valley Community Service has seen demand roughly double since the government shut down in early October and word spread that SNAP benefits could be cut. Last Thursday, when SNAP notices went out warning that funding would stop in November, the number of people in line jumped from the normal 25 to 63, said Executive Director Sujatha Venkatraman .\n\n“Our fear is that new people who have not used our services because they had SNAP and they were figuring it out with their income, would need us now,” Venkatraman said. “So we are preparing for that, and we definitely need to make sure more food comes in. So we’re asking for more food donation, more financial donations to run our market operation.”\n\nAt the San Jose Flea Market parking lot, Patricia Ribeiro volunteers every Monday morning with her daughter, who is raising four children without their father’s help and are grateful to also receive a box of food each week. Her daughter, Gina, is using the federal Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program for food, but worries even that could be cut.\n\n“I don’t want to cry, but the kids were left with no money, no nothing,” Patricia said. “Throughout all the years, we’ve never had to come to a place to ask anybody for help. If it wasn’t for Hunger at Home, I don’t know what I would do.”","summary":"The escalating demand for food resembles the early days of COVID when public health restrictions on gatherings threw large numbers of people out of work.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/03/im-gonna-starve-lines-at-bay-area-food-pantries-double-as-snap-payments-freeze-remain-uncertain/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-SNAPLINES-1104-6.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:46:01","author":"Ethan Baron,Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Ethan Baron","Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":375460706,"title":"Protest rallies in line with US values on free speech, says envoy","text":"The US ambassador to Malaysia, Edgard Kagan, said he welcomed protests near the embassy as a sign of commitment to freedom of expression.\nKUALA LUMPUR: The numerous protests held outside the US embassy here shows a commitment to freedom of expression that are in line with US values on free speech, says the US ambassador to Malaysia.\nEdgard Kagan said the protests \"show a commitment to freedom of expression that we think is right, and the US has long stood for”.\nProtests have been held near the embassy in support of Palestinians and against US support of Israel, against the visit of US president Donald Trump for the Asean summit and against the proposed appointment of pro-Israel political commentator Nick Adam as the next US envoy.\n\nKagan said in an interview with FMT that even when protest demonstrations were unpopular with past Malaysian governments, \"we stood for this\".\nHe also pointed out the irony of political leaders formerly against protest demonstrations who later changed their tune.\n“I find it quite interesting that some of the people who, when they were in power didn't think demonstrations and free expression were quite so good, now are very much in favour of it,” Kagan said.\nKagan said “we will take this” as a sign of shared appreciation of the value of freedom of speech.\n“And as the ambassador of the United States, I just want to say we accept your apology,” he quipped.\nKagan did not name anyone in his remark.\nHowever, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who in the past stated he would never allow street protests, had in 2016 urged the people to take to the streets to demand the resignation of then prime minister Najib Razak and in July this year, he took part in a rally calling for Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to step down.\nHe had also criticised then US vice president Al Gore in 1998, at the height of the Reformasi movement, when Gore gave public support to protest demonstrations held following Anwar Ibrahim’s sacking as the deputy prime minister.","summary":"In an interview, Edgard Kagan also points out the irony of leaders  formerly against protest demonstrations later changing their tune.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/11/04/protest-rallies-in-line-with-us-values-on-free-speech-says-envoy","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/c66e68f8-ambassador-edgard-d.-kagan-u.s.-embassy-in-malaysia-3.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:45:41","author":"Alina Khai","authors":["Alina Khai"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.089},{"id":375456320,"title":"How Albo secretly asked a famously acid-tongued Australian for help with comebacks to Trump -

Among Democrats, Mamdani has 54 percent support and Cuomo, who previously governed the state of New York as a Democrat, has 26 percent.\n\nThe poll found New Yorkers expect a wide array of the city's problems to get worse under a 'Mayor Mamdani,' including crime, antisemitism and the economy.\n\nIt found 47 percent believe levels of crime and violence will get worse, with only 32 percent saying the city would be safer under Mamdani. \n\nOn the issue of crime there was a stark split among New Yorkers based on age.\n\nFor voters under 30, 49 percent said they believed safety would improve under Mamdani, with 32 percent saying it would not.\n\nBut among over-65s only 26 percent thought the city would be safer under Mamdani and 50 percent said it would not.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll found 43 percent of New Yorkers expect the number of businesses in the city to decrease under Mamdani, with stores going under and potential entrepreneurs forced to head elsewhere.\n\nOnly 23 percent thought the number of businesses would rise under the democratic socialist.\n\nThe poll showed 39 percent expected the risk of terrorism to increase under Mamdani, with only 18 percent thinking it will lessen. \n\nAnd 45 percent thought the problem of antisemitic views in the city would get worse, with only 21 percent thinking it would improve.\n\nEven Democrats thought Mamdani would have a negative impact on antisemitism, with 29 percent saying he would make it better and 32 percent worse. \n\nEarlier this month, Mamdani faced a backlash after posting a picture of himself on social media with Imam Siraj Wahhaj, a Brooklyn-based Muslim cleric.\n\nWahhaj was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted potential co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a precursor to the 9/11 attacks. He was never charged with any crimes and denied involvement in the attack.\n\nThe poll revealed only one issue where New Yorkers thought Mamdani would improve the current situation.\n\nIt showed that 39 percent think housing would become more affordable under Mamdani, with 32 percent believing it would be less so.\n\nDemocrats backed him to reduce housing costs by 52 percent to 19 percent.\n\nThe poll also revealed a stark split among Democrat voters in New York, with many opposed to Mamdani. \n\nIt showed 33 percent of Democrats believe crime will rise, 29 percent think there will be less businesses, and 25 percent said the risk of terrorism will increase.\n\nThe poll was conducted between October 23 and 26 among 500 registered voters and had a margin of error of 4.4 percent.\n\nSliwa has resisted pressure to drop out to help Cuomo, suggesting if anyone was to stand down it should be Cuomo instead.\n\nCuomo is deeply unpopular with Republicans so Sliwa withdrawing may not greatly assist him.\n\nEarlier this month, Sliwa vowed he would only leave the race if 'a Mack truck hits me and I get turned into a speed bump, and they can’t recover me in the I.C.U. That’s the only way.' \n\nMamdani, who is running to be New York's first Muslim mayor, was born in Uganda and moved to New York aged seven. \n\nHis father is an academic and his mother a filmmaker. As a child he went to a private school in Manhattan where fees are now $66,000 a year.\n\nDespite his ultra-privileged upbringing Mamdani is successfully appealing to working-class voters and young adults who find New York increasingly unaffordable to live in, with promises that he will bring their costs down.\n\nHis platform of policies includes a freeze on rent hikes, free bus services, fully-funded day care for under-5s, city-owned grocery stores, and turbocharging the minimum wage ultimately to $30 an hour.\n\nHe wants to fund those policies, which will cost billions of dollars, by raising taxes on the rich and companies.\n\nThere would be a 2 percent increase on New Yorkers earning over $1 million a year, and the top corporate tax rate would rise from 7.25 percent to 11.5 percent.\n\nCritics say that will lead to a surge of firms and high-earning individuals leaving New York, which will in turn decimate the city's tax revenue and Mamdani unable to pay for his policies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has branded Mamdani a 'communist' and threatened to cut off federal funding to the city if he is elected.\n\nBut the president is reportedly resigned to Mamdani winning, with it seemingly tooo late for Cuomo or Sliwa to catch up.","summary":"Greg Abbott pitched a creative strategy for dealing with those trying to escape from New York if the socialist is elected mayor.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15254463/Texas-governor-New-York-tariff-Zohran-Mamdani.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/03/23/103559523-0-image-m-27_1762213642941.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/03/7633647493166380831/1024x576_MP4_7633647493166380831.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:34:46","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Amazon, for example, is asking 30,000 people to go home globally and around 1,100 in India.\n\nThis has sparked an old debate: is technology, AI in this case, displacing labour on a large scale? Many say yes. Many say no, it’s not technology alone but also excessive hirings when, either, the times were good or when circumstances warranted it, as during the Covid pandemic.\n\nBut this is a futile debate. Regardless of the reason, there is now a shift towards reducing the number of people firms employ. In the US, even the government has been trying to do this after Donald Trump became President.\n\nOverall, therefore, we can expect a reduction in the number of people employed. For the most part, and as always since the Industrial Revolution started in the middle of the 18th century, this will happen in the private sector.\n\nKarl Marx had predicted this in the middle of the 19th century. He had blamed the blind pursuit of profit by investors for it. It’s not going to be any different this time. The consequences are social, economic and political.\n\nThe social consequences are obvious: misery for those who lose their jobs. The economic consequences are a reduction in aggregate demand, leading to excess capacity and lower profits for investors. The political consequences are widespread unrest even as the political class seeks to tackle the problem with old tools.\n\nThe real problem\n\nTo get a proper perspective, it’s important to bear in mind that in 1900 the world’s population was around a billion. Today it is in excess of 8 billion. Half of these people are in India and China. Yes, half.\n\nAssuming the workforce then was 40 per cent, it means 400 million people were either employed or looking for jobs. With the same workforce percentage, 3.2 billion people are now either employed or looking for jobs.\n\nThat’s the scale problem and it’s not solvable. If 400 million could not be employed, how can 3.2 billion be? But no one will tell you this.\n\nBe that as it may, there has been both social and political pressure to employ as many people as possible, regardless of their productivity. By and large there has also been a public and private sector convergence of views on this.\n\nBut that convergent consensus seems to be breaking down now because competition amongst investors has pared down profits. This has happened in the past also and the response has always been the same: reduce the wage bill. And that’s exactly what’s happening now, with knobs on.\n\nWhat’s different now is the speed at which employees are being reduced. It’s comparable to what happened in England after 1760 — a 65 per cent reduction in employment over 25 years.\n\nAnd this has become possible because of AI. It is doing what, say, the railway did to road transport: massive displacement of labour and huge cuts in employment and wage bills.\n\nThe way forward\n\nThe first thing to do is stop talking about employment, which is a relatively new concept, barely 150 years old. Instead we should start focusing on work, meaning whether or not there are enough income earning opportunities.\n\nIn terms of our income tax department, shift away from Form 16 to Form 16A. That is, from being employed by someone else to being self-employed.\n\nSecond, and more difficult, the politicians must stop promising jobs and must talk about work. The problem of raising aggregate demand isn’t solved only by smoothening income accrual. It’s a function of annual income.\n\nThird, short-term contracts must become the norm rather than lifetime ones promising employment regardless of productivity. This way shocks to the labour market can be minimised.\n\nFourth, it’s important to bear in mind that just as labour tries to maximise its welfare, so do investors. In India we see the extraordinary sight of some Left oriented people championing the cause of both sides. This muddies the waters completely.\n\nLastly, the big gorilla in the room, the governments. They employ the maximum numbers which is understandable. But they make no effort to look at productivity.\n\nNot just that. These employees get inflation indexed pay. Both are regularly increased without reference to productivity.\n\nGovernments need to link the two by moving towards contractual arrangements that keep incomes intact but not over a lifetime.

The golf icon marked the milestone alongside the 36-hole Gary & Vivienne Player Invitational, played across the Gary Player Country Club and the Lost City Golf Club in North West, South Africa.The event was hosted by the Gary & Vivienne Player Foundation to support the Blair Atholl Pre-Primary School, a cause that holds special meaning for Player and his late wife, Vivienne.After the celebrations, Player shared a heartfelt message on Instagram on Monday, October 3, thanking everyone who has been part of his journey. He wrote:“It’s hard to find words for what last night meant. To celebrate 90 years of life at Sun City’s iconic Super Bowl - among friends, family, and so many who have shared this incredible journey - is deeply humbling. I’m grateful beyond measure for every person who has been part of this story. GP” View this post on Instagram Instagram PostPlayer’s achievements and lifelong commitment to giving back drew praise from many sports figures. Springbok rugby legend Bryan Habana called him an inspiration who continues to make a difference beyond golf.“Looking at Gary Player and what he’s achieved in all spheres of life, whether it be professional sport, philanthropy, or the love he has for South Africa, what stands out most is his undying desire to give back,” Habana said.Former rugby star Jaco Kriel shared similar thoughts, calling Player’s influence extraordinary.“He’s not just a great golfer, but to leave a legacy like he’s doing at the moment is amazing. I think that’s any sportsman’s dream, to leave a legacy like that and still live his legacy and make such a difference.”The two-day Gary & Vivienne Player Invitational concluded on Sunday, November 2, with the four-ball team of Sunshine Tour golfer Luke Brown, Brian McFadden, Darren Roos and Surinder Arora emerging as winners.Gary Player shares his dream round with golf and world legendsGary Player recently opened up about his ultimate fantasy lineup, revealing a rather unconventional “dream sixsome” that blends world leaders, humanitarians, and a U.S. president. His picks, which he called his “around the world” team, include Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, Donald Trump, former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, and evangelist Billy Graham, as per The Palm Beach Post.Player also shared his ideal golf groups from both past and present. For his all-time living foursome, he chose Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, Lee Trevino, and current World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. His dream lineup of late golf legends includes Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Sam Snead, and Byron Nelson.Player has already played a round with one of his world leader picks, U.S. President Donald Trump. Speaking about the experience, Trump said,“I played with Gary Player. You know Gary’s 90 and he shot 70 with me the last time we played! That’s pretty amazing from 6800 yards.” (via Golf Digest)Since turning professional in 1953, the South African legend has built one of the most successful careers in golf history. He has won more than 160 tournaments around the world, the most by any golfer. His record includes 46 titles across the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Champions, along with nine major championships. Player remains the only golfer to have completed the career Grand Slam on both tours.","summary":"Gary Player celebrated his 90th birthday in grand fashion at Sun City, surrounded by family, friends, sports legends, and business leaders from around the world.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/golf/news-gary-player-pens-heartfelt-message-celebrating-90-years-life-sun-city","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/11/27336454-1762215564.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-04 00:26:20","author":"Sonali Verma","authors":["Sonali Verma"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.6},{"id":375456964,"title":"Pelosi indicates she will address retirement rumors after Election Day","text":"Pelosi, who has served as House Speaker twice while representing California’s 19th Congressional District since 1987, addressed the rumblings of her retirement on Monday, the eve of Election Day.\n\n“I have said I won’t do anything until Preposition 50, so tomorrow night will be very fraught with meaning for all of us.

The reason I'm saying testing is because Russia announced that they were going to be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea is testing constantly. Other countries are testing.

They have some. They have quite a bit.\"\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump announced the immediate resumption of nuclear weapons testing, citing Russia's recent trials of advanced nuclear-capable systems, in what marks a major escalation between the two nuclear powers.\nBefore boarding Air Force One, Trump said while denuclearisation would be a \"tremendous thing\", restarting American nuclear testing after more than three decades was \"appropriate\".\"They seem to all be nuclear testing,\" Trump told reporters, referring to Russia and China.\n\"We have more nuclear weapons than anybody.

I worked on his campaign in 2008, and he just let us down. He let this country down, but he especially let down a lot of African-Americans. So we really don't want to hear him tell us how we were supposed to go.\" Crump was among a group of Republican voters who traveled to Medford, New Jersey, Monday afternoon for a Turning Point Action rally to mobilize further support for Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli in the final hours before Election Day. The rally was billed as a \"Super Chase\" event, where community members then head out to remind voters to submit their ballots. Ciattarelli did not attend this specific rally. Attendees heard from local conservative leaders before hitting the road to knock on doors and remind people to get out and vote in the final hours of the election. OBAMA'S PRESENCE AND TRUMP'S POLICIES CONSUME 11TH HOUR RALLY TO KEEP NJ BLUE Obama traveled to Newark, New Jersey, Saturday evening, where he held a rally with Democrat candidate Sherrill. New Jersey is a historically deep blue state that previously voted to elect a Republican governor in 2013, when former Gov. Chris Christie was elected, and previously voted to elect a Republican president in 1988, when George H.W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis. \"Let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,\" Obama told the audience Saturday, taking a shot at President Donald Trump and his administration. \"It's hard to know where to start, because every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and carelessness and mean-spiritedness. And just plain old craziness.\" SHERRILL INSISTS NJ A DEM STRONGHOLD AHEAD OF OBAMA VISIT, REJECTING GOP MOMENTUM: 'NOT A PURPLE STATE' Republicans are on a mission to flip the state red and are motivated by Trump's inroads with Jersey voters in 2024. Trump cut his 2020 loss from 16 points in the state down to six points in 2024, and flipped five counties to the GOP. Joe Sereday, chairman of the Burlington County Young Republicans, reported to Fox Digital that enthusiasm is high among voters casting ballots for Ciattarelli and added that Obama's campaigning in the state signaled desperation for the party in a state that is historically blue. \"I think it's kind of old news now,\" Sereday said, adding that Obama deserves respect as a former president, but that he sees issues with the campaigning efforts. \"Usually when the Democrats roll in these big names — Obama, who else was here, Andy Kim, Cory Booker — usually that means they're in trouble.\" WITH LEGACY ON THE LINE, OBAMA HITTING CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO BOOST DEMOCRATS IN KEY GOVERNOR ELECTIONS He added: \"Usually when they bring in Obama and the wash-ups, hate to say some of the wash-ups, usually that means they're desperate.\" Cliff Maloney, CEO of Citizens Alliance and the founder of campaign efforts PA Chase and NJ Chase, told Fox Digital that Obama's presence in New Jersey was a \"Hail Mary\" pass from Democrats. \"I just think it's all AstroTurf. I think it is fake excitement,\" Maloney, who attended the rally as a speaker to mobilize New Jersey voters. \"They're kind of just hyping things and trying to sensationalize it. Nobody's excited about (Sherrill). And that's something that you can't fix that.\" \"You can bring an Obama. You can bring in whoever. At the end of the day, New Jersey has an 800,000 registration advantage to Democrats and we're here in the state telling you it's competitive,\" Maloney added. \"So win or lose, the fact that this is a place that Democrats have to spend resources, time, energy, and money, this is not even supposed to be a competitive race. We're in a dead heat right now. We are in the game. This is a competitive grace. And if Jack pulls this off, it will be an earth-shattering moment in the political world.\" New Jersey's notoriously high taxes and spiraling energy costs are top concerns for voters, with locals telling Fox Digital that protecting Christianity and \"truth\" is also on the ballot in 2025. SHERRILL PULLS OUT ALL STOPS WITH OBAMA ENDORSEMENT, STAR-STUDDED NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN PUSH AS RACE TIGHTENS \"My concerns are actually Christianity, people not being told the truth, obviously abortion and our children in schools, they need to learn things that are really truthful,\" local South Jersey voter Valerie told Fox News Digital. \"I do feel like we are going to flip the state,\" she added. \"I'm hoping that a lot of Republican voters come out and they don't stay home, because if they do come out, I think we'll win.\" Local voter and pastor Jeff Kliewer told Fox Digital that pro-life and homeschooling issues are also factoring into voting decisions. \"The pro-life issue is still huge,\" Kliewer said. \"It's one of the biggest. And for us, in New Jersey, a number of the pregnancy centers have been under attack by the Democratic machine under Phil Murphy, and it's only gonna get worse if they hold power. So I know a lot of the leaders of those pregnancy centers are trying to help girls, but they're constantly under pressure. So there's that issue.\" \"Secondly, the homeschool families, there's a lot red tape that's being introduced against homeschooling. Although New Jersey has been one of the freest states for homeschooling, that might change if we don't keep good people in office here,\" he continued, adding taxes are at the top of most voters' minds as they head to the polls. Turning Point Action field representative Noah Formica, who is from Pennsylvania and made the trek down to New Jersey to bolster mobilization efforts, explained that the \"Super Chase\" event is designed to spur locals to motivate their neighbors to vote. \"It's a group of people getting together. They listen to a few speakers talking about action, and then we get directly involved in our communities,\" he said. \"Every single door that we knock, right here in New Jersey, makes all the difference. Just voter contacts. And we have almost 60 people here, so if each person here knocks 15 doors, imagine the impact that'll make on a local race,\" he said.

Israeli officials identified the three as soldiers who were killed in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that triggered the war in Gaza.\n\nThe exchange marked another step forward for the tenuous, U.S.-brokered ceasefire intended to end the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSince the truce took effect on Oct. 10, Palestinian militants have released the remains of 20 hostages, with eight now remaining in Gaza.\n\nFor each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. With Monday’s return, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed back since the start of the ceasefire.\n\nSlow identification process in Gaza\n\nThe Red Cross said it had facilitated the transfer of 45 Palestinian bodies to Gaza on Monday morning. Zaher al-Wahidi, a spokesperson at the Gaza Health Ministry, told The Associated Press that Nasser Hospital received the bodies around noon.\n\nOnly 78 of the bodies returned so far have been identified, the ministry said. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza, it added. The ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‘s office identified the three hostages, whose bodies were returned to Israel on Sunday night, as Capt. Omer Neutra, an American-Israeli, Staff Sgt. Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami. A Hamas statement earlier said their remains were found on Sunday in a tunnel in southern Gaza.\n\nNeutra was 21 when Hamas militants abducted his tank crew during the 2023 attack. In December 2024, the military announced Neutra had been killed in the attack.\n\nDaniel, 19, was part of the tank crew and was taken into Gaza. Nimrod Cohen, who was also in the tank, was released alive earlier, as was the body of one of the other crew members.\n\n“Our hearts are shattered, yet at last we can begin the process of bringing Omer to his final resting place in the land he loved and defended,” Neutra’s mother, Orna, told reporters Monday in Tel Aviv.\n\nShe and husband Ronen thanked Israeli troops, U.S. President Donald Trump and U.S. negotiators, who played a leading role in brokering the ceasefire. But they did not thank Netanyahu, who many families of hostages blame for prolonging the conflict and endangering captives.\n\n“The IDF soldiers and the U.S. administration fought for his life,” Ronen Neutra said.\n\nHamami, commander of Israel’s southern brigade in the Gaza division, was killed during the 2023 attack while fighting to defend Kibbutz Nirim and his body was taken into the Palestinian territory.\n\nMilitants have released one to three bodies every few days. Israel has pushed to speed up the returns and in certain cases has said the remains were not those of hostages. Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.\n\nArrests of 2 ex-military figures rock Israel\n\nA political scandal continued to rock Israel involving the military’s former legal chief, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, who admitted to leaking a video of Israeli soldiers sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee and resigned from office.\n\nFar-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s national security minister, said Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested Sunday night. At a court hearing Monday, the judge extended her detention until Wednesday, according to a copy of the decision. It said she is being held on suspicion of offenses including fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of justice. The investigation continues while she is held in a women’s prison in central Israel.\n\nPolice conducted a frantic search for Tomer-Yerushalmi on Sunday after her family raised concerns about her safety and police found her abandoned car near the beach in Tel Aviv, Israel’s Channel 12 reported. Police said she was found soon after the search began.\n\nIsraeli media reported that former chief military prosecutor Col. Matan Solomesh was also arrested overnight and his detention was also extended.\n\nThe Palestinian detainee who was the subject of sexual abuse in the video leaked by Tomer-Yerushalmi last year was released and returned to Gaza on Oct. 13, according to documentation from the military prosecutor’s office obtained by the AP.\n\n2 Palestinians killed in the West Bank\n\nTwo Palestinians, one of them a teenager, were killed by Israeli gunfire Sunday night in separate incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah.\n\nJamil Hanani, 17, was killed in the town of Beit Furik, the ministry said Monday. Israel’s military said soldiers opened fire at Palestinians hurling rocks, hitting one person. Hanani’s death extends a surge in military killings of Palestinian youth in the West Bank during an upswing in violence since the start of the war.\n\nAlso Sunday, Ahmed Al-Atrash, 32, was fatally shot by an Israeli settler at an entrance to the city of Hebron, the ministry said. Israel’s military referred the AP to the police, who did not immediately comment. Hundreds of hard-line settlers live in fortified enclaves under military protection in the city of more than 200,000 Palestinians.\n\nEfforts to ramp up Gaza aid and a vaccination campaign\n\nU.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper will be in Jordan on Monday, with plans to visit a warehouse where British aid remains stuck waiting to enter Gaza.\n\nAhead of the visit, Cooper said that “humanitarian support is desperately needed and the people of Gaza cannot afford to wait.”\n\n“Following the U.S.-led peace process and the plans for a substantial increase in aid for Gaza, we need an increase in crossings, an acceleration in lifting of restrictions and more agencies able to go in with aid,” Cooper said.\n\nCooper also announced that Britain will provide an extra 6 million pounds ($7.9 million) of humanitarian support for Gaza, provided by the U.N. Population Fund.\n\nAlso Monday, Gaza’s Health Ministry announced that a campaign to vaccinate some 40,000 Palestinian children under 3 years old against preventable diseases like measles, polio and meningitis will kick off next week. It will focus on children who missed routine vaccinations or received only partial doses due to the war, Dr. Nedal Ghoneim, the Health Ministry’s public health manager, told the AP.\n\nThe Hamas-led attack on southern Israel two years ago killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 68,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.\n\nIsrael, which has denied accusations by a U.N. commission of inquiry and others of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the ministry’s figures without providing a contradicting toll.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday.\"\n\nDonald Trump Jr. responded to the post on X first, saying: \"Going to make sure that my dad sees this.\"\n\nJust after 11 am on Sunday morning, Kennedy responded, saying, \"Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.\"\n\nLater that day, President Trump posted a screen shot of Adams' original post and responded \"On it!\" on his favored social media platform, Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Monday, Adams posted that he had an appointment to receive the infusion he needed of the cancer drug, Pluvicto, on Tuesday.\n\n\"For context, I waited months for the drug, like everyone else,\" Adams wrote. \"But I think my files got misplaced or something and that glitch just got corrected.

Few, though, have the social media reach to enlist such powerful helping hands.\n\n\"Our health system shouldn't be one where we need the intervention of the president or the HHS secretary to weigh in on behalf of a high-profile political backer,\" said Anthony Wright, the executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy organization.\n\nWright added that he is gratified Adams got the help he needed and said it should be available to all. \"Glad the President is offering to do casework,\" Wright said, noting that federal workers who do similar problem solving have been fired and navigators who help people sign up for Affordable Care Act health insurance have been cut by 90%. Wright also called out the\" \"current shutdown over the issue of tax credits that help millions access and afford health care.\"\n\nNPR reached out to Kaiser for comment and they e-mailed this statement: \"Mr. Adams' oncology team is working closely with him on the next steps in his cancer care, which are already underway.\n\nSince it was approved by the FDA three years ago, Kaiser Permanente's nuclear medicine and medical oncology experts have treated more than 150 patients with Lu-177 PSMA (Pluvicto) in Northern California alone. We know this drug and this disease.\"\n\nAdams' experience drummed up a chorus of well-wishes online, as well as those who called out the preferential treatment he apparently got.\n\n\"There are Americans all over America who are currently going through similar circumstances,\" wrote one X poster, responding to Kennedy's offer to help Adams.\n\nAnother responded: \"How about promoting UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, like the rest of the Industrialized 1st World Nations, so EVERYONE can be treated, not just Celebrity & the Wealthy?\"\n\nIn the shutdown health care fight that started Oct. 1, about 24 million Americans who buy their insurance on the ACA marketplaces will see their premiums skyrocket — the average plan will double in price — if Congress doesn't act. Democrats say they will not reopen the government unless the tax subsidies that bring down the cost are renewed. Republicans say they will not discuss renewing the subsidies until the government is reopened.","summary":"Like many Americans, Scott Adams had insurance problems.

He once “corrected” me by saying Asian isn’t spelled or pronounced Asean.\nMy eyes rolled. But who was I to correct a man, an American at that, who knows about things like these? I let it pass.\nPeople aren’t making that mistake now, though I did catch a news anchor on one of the western news channels mistaking APEC for Asean.\nBut hey, perhaps he was just seconded there from our own RTM.\nThe recent orgy of ceremonies, meetings and traffic jams in Kuala Lumpur because of the Asean summit were indeed a sight to behold, even if they’re not something you want to be caught in.\nUnfortunately, I did get caught.\nTwo Sundays ago I drove to KLIA to pick up my wife. What was usually a two-hour round trip ended up taking five hours.\nHuge stretches of the airport highway were blocked. I detoured, diverted and visited parts of Putrajaya, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan that I hardly knew existed.\nThat was one epic jam. I, and the hundreds if not thousands who missed their flights that day, will remember it for a while, in my case with a smile, though probably not for the many who missed their flights.\nAnwar and the Beast\nThat was the morning US President Donald Trump arrived in Kuala Lumpur, with the aid of the navigation equipment on Air Force One no doubt, as he probably couldn’t even point out Malaysia on a map.\nAnyway, a belated welcome to Malaysia, Mr. President!\nHe seemed to enjoy the welcome ceremony, doing a few jigs on the tarmac to the accompaniment of the kompang music. That video clip appeared on numerous international broadcasts and podcasts, giving Malaysia millions of dollars’ worth of free and positive publicity.\nOur own prime minister also got the unusual honour of riding in the \"Beast\" – the president’s monster of an armoured car. Wags claimed that the PM was on board purely so he could use his Malaysian IC to buy subsidised petrol on that thirsty vehicle.\nOverall, I think Malaysia came out very well in the news. We got to show off our beautiful country and capital city and people and culture.\nThe Americans must have been impressed by the lack of houses on trees; sorry bud, over here only the very rich have tree houses.\nOn with the show\nWe certainly know how to put on a show to impress our guests. It's part of our DNA – our famed hospitality especially when it comes to being friendly to foreigners who are not foreign workers.\nI’m sure we’ve also created a lot of interest from people who never thought of Malaysia as a holiday destination. Welcome to Visit Malaysia Year 2026 to you too!\nBut did anything good come out of the meetings with the foreign leaders? Well, we signed some agreements with the US, which gave us tariff exemptions on a large number of our exports to the US.\nCould we have got more? I doubt it. Tariffs will likely be around for the duration of Trump’s presidency, and perhaps even after it.\nTariffs, once instituted, don't go away easily.\nBut tariffs aren’t necessarily a killer for our trade with the US. Some of our exports, especially semiconductors, electronics and medical devices, can't be easily replaced by the US, or even any of our regional economic competitors.\nAs long as we maintain our competitiveness, we should be able to trade with the US in pretty much the same old ways. We may have to eat some of the tariffs through price discounts – but then we may not even have to do so.\nWhat’ll happen is Americans will have to pay more for our goods. They have made their tariff bed; now they have to sleep in it.\nOn the tariff game\nI’ve written before that tariffs are an inevitability under Trump. They aren’t, as earlier claimed, tools to address trade imbalances – just ask Australia, Brazil, Singapore and others who have trade deficits with the US and still had tariffs imposed upon them.\nRather, they’re a tool for revenue generation to replace the income taxes that have been slashed, especially for the rich. The budget deficits caused by the loss of these incomes – which has spiked the US national debt by a couple of trillion under Trump already – need to be filled up somehow.\nThe old, discredited trickle down economics won't fill out budgetary and debt holes. Lately, nobody in the Trump administration even bothered to pretend that they would.\nOn top of tariffs for everybody, whether friends or foes, there’s now also an “entry fee” for trading with the US. Figures in the hundreds of billions have been imposed on the EU, Japan, South Korea, the UK and even little old us.\nThis is nothing but a shake-down, the kind of things gangsters do. The US under Trump is doing it because they can. The EU and especially the UK just meekly accepted them. And so did South Korea and Japan – until lately.\nSuddenly our East Asian cousins are growing a spine on this matter. We’ll wait and see how they react to this extortion – the price of them getting things wrong can mean their own governments falling, as had happened with Japan recently.\nStaying out of the fray\nLittle old Malaysia is trying its best to stay out of the fray. We can't afford to raise Trump’s ire – but neither can we afford to destroy bridges we’ve built over decades with other trading partners.\nBut perhaps the worst of the trade wars is beginning to abate. It turned out not everybody will fold when confronted by Trump – Canada and China being the clearest examples.\nCanada, which also faces having its sovereignty challenged by Trump, is giving priority to increasing trade with the rest of the world and reducing reliance on the US, their traditional partner.\nChina is playing hardball, in effect telling the US “we have the cards too”. They indeed do have many trade weapons and tools at their disposal, while having more leeway in their domestic politics to dealing with the US.\nTheir recent actions in stopping rare earths exports show this. Their strength here comes from having played the long game on rare earths for decades as part of their national energy strategy.\nThat had led them to be the biggest producer of rare earth minerals in the world, as well as the processor of almost all of these minerals too.\nThe US will never catch up here. A typical Chinese university produces more mining engineers in a year than all the US universities combined. The same applies to all the other expertise and disciplines needed to mine and process rare earths.\nApart from this serious lack of skills and expertise, there are billions of investments needed, years of lead-time, as well as the tangles of laws and environmental issues.\nThe rare earths card\nWe in Malaysia know how complex the matter of processing rare earths is, if anybody still remembers the decades-long and still on-going controversies regarding our own processing of these minerals.\nSo, it turns out Malaysia has some of the cards too. An increasingly important card is our national will and resolve, which is critical as demonstrated by Canada and China, and by the lack of them as shown by the UK and the EU.\nCertainly, we’re not quite in their league. But we do export a lot of things to the US that they can't do without. We’re a big, stable and rational trade player in the region and in the world, even while much of the world is becoming more irrational.\nIt looks like our chairmanship of Asean, which has just ended, came at the right time.\nWe managed to steer clear of being crushed in the melee of nations hysterically rushing around trying to deal with the chaos being created by the US.\nIf anything, our position is enhanced.\nFeeling good\nWe can afford some feel-good moments. It would’ve been unreasonable to expect us to win major concessions from the US. Their mind is made up, and unless you’re China, you shouldn’t fancy your chances.\nWe did end up with some advantages over our economic competitors, even those from Asean (and even Asian) countries. Our strategies going forward should be maximising the benefits from these advantages while we still have them.\nWe should bide our time. The US will recover from this madness at some point, though much weaker and diminished. We haven’t burned any bridges with them, and will continue to trade and deal, but with more confidence and resolve .\nAt the same time, we’re also keeping good relationships with the other players, including those on the opposite camps to the US. This is a surprising talent that Malaysians have – our pragmatism of not going over the brink.\nAll in all, it was a pretty good week for Malaysia. We shone in one area where we have always shone – dealing with complex foreign policy and relationships issues.\nHowever, the next time we have a big party like this, please don’t go overboard and shut down the entire city. Find some other more rational ways to manage traffic and society.\nLet people remember the events for the right reasons.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not reflect those of FMT.","summary":"We managed to steer clear of the melee of nations trying to deal with the chaos created by the US.

Trump hosted a grand “A Little Party Never Killed Nobody” bash at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The party took place over the weekend while the government struggles to pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) affecting millions of Americans.\n\nThe party’s theme took a leaf from Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, which was later adapted into a movie. The book and the novel explored themes of drastic inequality, which was also reminiscent in the party (more on that later). Clips of Trump from the Gatsby-themed party are doing the rounds on social media.\n\nLip-reader Nicola Hickling tried to decode one of the clips and told the Daily Mail that Trump was actually whispering about wanting to spend more time with First Lady Melania Trump. He reportedly said: “No small talk. One night, I don’t want to be disturbed and want to spend some time with Melania before I leave.”\n\nDonald Trump is partying with his wealthy billionaire donor friends in Florida just hours before crucial programs like SNAP, Head Start, and more expire for millions of Americans. You do not hate him enough. pic.twitter.com/3aYzNrbb2X\n— Harry Sisson (@harryjsisson) November 1, 2025\n\nSpeaking of Trump and Melania’s marriage, despite long-standing rumors, the First Lady and the US President continue to present a united front. They have been married for over 20 years now, but they often find their relationship under scrutiny. Every month, rumors of the couple’s alleged divorce also surface in the news.\n\nTrump and Melania Trump’s divorce rumors resurfaced after the First Lady was skipping a lot of public events, especially after Trump’s second term as President began. The couple shut down the divorce rumors, courtesy their repeated public appearances together. The latest one was at the Halloween celebrations.\n\nMelania began her career in New York in the 1990s as a model. She met the then real estate and business tycoon Donald Trump at a fashion Week party in New York in 1998, and they started dating shortly after. The two got married on January 22, 2005. She became a US citizen in 2006. The couple welcomed their son Barron William Trump in 2006.\n\nAfter the White House posted photos of Trump and Melania celebrating Halloween and distributing candies to kids, Internet users decided to address the rising cost of living and the layoffs through the comments section of the Halloween celebration post.\n\nThe subjects of commentary on Melania and Donald Trump’s Halloween festivities also veered from the East Wing demolition to no SNAP fund references. More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP, which provides about $715 a month for a family of four — that’s just under $6 a day per person.\n\nPresident Trump and the First Lady Participate in Halloween at The White House https://t.co/AnezkesE8L\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 30, 2025\n\nCalifornia Governor and Trump’s big-time critic, Gavin Newsom, also reacted to the viral photo of Trump’s Gatsby-style party and he wrote on X, “Donald Trump hosted a Great Gatsby party while SNAP benefits were about to disappear for 42 million Americans. He does not give a d—- about you.”\n\nAmid the government shutdown, layoffs, and crippling healthcare system, Trump has been busy with White House renovation projects. When not pictured at Gatsby-themed parties, golfing tours with granddaughter Kai, Trump is busy with the many White House renovations, which he claims have been backed solely by “private donors.”\n\nThe tales of Trump and his many renovations at the White House are well known. In addition to the Ballroom, which reportedly costs around $300 million, Trump also introduced the Presidential Walk of Fame walkway outside the West Wing of the White House. He also posted photos from a redecorated Lincoln bathroom at the White House, which received a lot of flak.","summary":"Trump hosted a Gatsby-themed party at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/lip-reader-reveals-what-trump-said-about-melania-at-his-controversial-gatsby-themed-party","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trump_Melania_1200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:51:54","author":"Pranita Chaubey","authors":["Pranita Chaubey"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":375453536,"title":"Meet Diddy's new prison pal: Disgraced rapper spotted with well-known sports star-turned-convict","text":"Meet Diddy's new prison pal: Disgraced rapper spotted with well-known sports star-turned-convict\n\nREAD MORE: Controversial NBA star suspended by team for swipe at coaches\n\nBy OLIVER SALT, US ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR\n\nPublished: 23:45 GMT, 3 November 2025 | Updated: 23:51 GMT, 3 November 2025\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs has already run into a familiar face in prison after he was spotted hanging out with former NBA star Sebastian Telfair this week.\n\nThe disgraced rapper, who is almost four months into his four-year jail sentence after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for prostitution back in July, linked up with Telfair in the prison yard at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey, where they are the most famous inmates doing time.\n\nIn two photos obtained by TMZ, Diddy is seen laughing and chatting with a group of fellow convicts, and Telfair's publicist claims he is one of the men talking to him.\n\nThe ex-basketball player, who is also from Brooklyn like Combs, will not be with the Bad Boy Records founder for much longer as he nears the halfway point of his six-month sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release in a healthcare fraud case.\n\nTelfair was a 2004 first-round NBA Draft pick for the Portland Trail Blazers out of Abraham Lincoln High School, where he became one of the most sought-after prospects in America.\n\nHe went on to play for the Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Oklahoma City Thunder before bringing the curtain down on his career in China.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs has already run into a familiar face in jail in ex-NBA star Sebastian Telfair\n\nTelfair (right) was seen hanging out with Diddy and a group of fellow convicts in a prison yard\n\nTelfair is halfway through a six-month sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release in a healthcare fraud case\n\nAfter previously pleading for a pardon from President Donald Trump, the 40-year-old reported to Fort Dix - a 'low security' institution - back in August.\n\nIn 2023, Telfair pled guilty to charges of fraud after he was found to be one of 18 former NBA players who defrauded the league's health and welfare benefit plan of about $4million.\n\nHe was sentenced to time served plus three years probation - which included court ordered community service.\n\nDiddy, meanwhile, is due for early release from prison on May 8, 2028.\n\nThe date, which was shared by the Bureau of Prisons last week, assumes he will maintain good behavior, which would see him released after completing 85 percent of his 50 month sentence.\n\nDiddy will have the chance to shave a fraction of his sentence off for each of the three-and-a-half years he is behind bars as part of the First Step Act aimed at rehabilitating federal prisoners.

'We're talking about people who are wealthier than anyone has ever been in the history of humankind.'\n\nThe Beeb despises billionaire Californian corporations, except when it's trying to do a deal to get Disney to fund another series of Doctor Who. And it vacillates between amused disgust and sheer loathing of The Donald.\n\nThis double helping of hatred blinded Panorama producers to how pathetic the likes of Musk and his American 'tech bros' appear to the British.\n\nThey're not super-villains. They're just self-obsessed geeks who happen to have ridden a tidal wave of new technology and now have much more money than imagination.

I wouldn't be even slightly surprised if the last we see of Musk is his frozen head being loaded onto a starship bound for Mars.\n\nTrump makes no effort to hide his affinity for the filthy rich. This documentary made much of his association with Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder who envisaged his money-mover app as a Swiss bank account in every pocket.\n\nOne long segment, including a reconstruction, related how Thiel once talked his way out of a speeding ticket.

Senior officials at the BBC have reportedly not responded to the concerns raised in the dossier, while unidentified “managers” refused to admit that “a breach of standards” occurred, The Telegraph reported. (RELATED: CBS ‘Race And Culture’ Unit Dies Swift Death As Outlet Sheds Jobs Under Bari Weiss)\n\n“The spliced together version of Trump’s comments aired by Panorama made it seem that he said: ‘We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not gonna have a country anymore,’” the dossier stated about “Panorama’s” depiction of Trump’s address on the Ellipse of the White House.\n\n“While we don’t comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully,” a BBC spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Michael Prescott is a former adviser to a board committee where differing views and opinions of our coverage are routinely discussed and debated.”\n\nTrump’s actual remarks were far different than what aired on the BBC program, according to a transcript of the speech on NPR’s website..\n\n“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump said, according to the transcript.\n\nTelegraph associate editor Gordon Rayner broke down how the video was edited to present the appearance that Trump endorsed the riot in a video posted by the newspaper on YouTube in which he held up a copy of the dossier, noting that the first part of the statement the BBC aired took place at 12:16 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n“Trump didn’t, in fact, say this at all,” Rayner said in the video after replaying the BBC’s clip. “The BBC spliced together two clips that took place 54 minutes apart.”\n\n“It wasn’t until nearly an hour later that he then said the second part of the BBC’s version,” Rayner added later after playing the clip and demonstrating the cut. Rayner then fast-forwarded, showing that the second part of the clip the BBC aired was from remarks made at 1:10 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n“Trust in the media is at an all-time low because of deceptive editing, misleading reporting, and outright lies,” White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson told the DCNF. “This is yet another example, of many, highlighting why countless Americans turn to alternative media sources to get their news.”\n\nTrump has won settlements from media outlets over their coverage of him. He secured a $15 million settlement with ABC in December 2024 after he sued the outlet on March 19, 2024, for defamation over “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely saying Trump was found “liable for rape” during a contentious March 10, 2024, appearance by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\n 🔴 An internal BBC whistleblower memo seen by The Telegraph says a Panorama programme “completely misled” viewers by editing @realDonaldTrump‘s speech to make it seem like he encouraged the Capitol riot Full details and video from Gordon Rayner here ⬇️https://t.co/NUVYDQkjJH pic.twitter.com/n6P92DAIjh — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) November 3, 2025 \n\nParamount announced it had settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, on “60 Minutes” on July 2.\n\nThe BBC also came under fire for its Arabic-language reporting on the Israeli operations in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas that killed over 1,200 people in Israel, and for “censorship” on coverage of transgender issues.

The petition argues that Bad Bunny’s performances and style are the opposite of what American families expect on football’s biggest stage.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Strait’s publicist via email on Monday for comment.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe petition with 7,000 supporters represents a broader cultural debate about representation, American identity, and the role of major platforms in reflecting diverse audiences. The organizer, Kar Shell, emphasizes that the Super Bowl halftime show should keep the event family-friendly, keep politics out of entertainment, and celebrate American music traditions, particularly country music which has been underrepresented on the halftime stage.\n\nThe controversy extends beyond entertainment preferences to touch on immigration policy, language accessibility, and political engagement in sports.\n\nIn an October interview with conservative network Newsmax, President Donald Trump dismissed Bad Bunny’s halftime announcement, saying he had “never heard of” the performer. “I don’t know who he is,” Trump said. “I don’t know why they’re doing it. It’s, like, crazy. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”\n\nTurning Point USA, the organization co-founded by assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, announced in October that it will host its own halftime show as counterprograming to the Super Bowl LX’s show.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nShell argues that the Super Bowl is one of the few live events that families of all ages watch together, and that the halftime show should be entertaining for everyone without explicit or controversial content. Additionally, the petition emphasizes that roughly 78 percent of Americans speak only English and that music should bridge differences rather than highlight them, expressing frustration over Bad Bunny’s comments about audiences needing to learn a different language to enjoy the show.\n\n“The Super Bowl halftime show should unite our country, honor American culture, and remain family-friendly, not be turned into a political stunt. Bad Bunny represents none of these values; his drag performances and style are the opposite of what families expect on football’s biggest stage,” the petition reads. \n\nThe petition also suggests alternative country artists, including Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Dierks Bentley, Kenny Chesney, Carrie Underwood, Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, Tim McGraw, Cody Johnson, and Brooks & Dunn, who could deliver a show honoring American musical roots while remaining energetic and family friendly.\n\nWhat Is the NFL’s Position?\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell firmly stated in October that the league is not considering dropping Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, emphasizing that the decision was carefully thought through and noting that the NFL rarely selects an artist without encountering some blowback or criticism.\n\nThe commissioner said the halftime choice reflects the league’s commitment to connecting with a global audience. “He’s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,” he said. “That’s what we try to achieve. It’s an important stage for us and an important element to the entertainment value.”\n\nHow Popular Is Bad Bunny?\n\nBad Bunny has become one of the most popular musical stars in the world, ranking as the third-most streamed artist globally on Spotify last year and the only Latino to crack Spotify’s top five spot, with his 2022 album Un Verano Sin Ti being the most-streamed album on Spotify of all time.\n\nHis concerts have boosted Puerto Rico’s GDP by $400 million, and his final performance for his residency, livestreamed on Amazon Prime, was the most-watched single artist performance on the platform.\n\nGeorge Strait performs onstage on July 27 in Boerne, Texas.

With over 60 No. 1 hits and more than 40 years in the music industry, George Strait is not only a legend in the country music genre but a staple in American musical history.

Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller also cameos as a sinister ghoul that bears a strong resemblance to Nosferatu.\n\nTrump confides to his staff that he is being plagued by a ghostly entity wearing a large-brimmed hat, who stands in the corner radiating malevolent energy.\n\nAmusingly, the entity is revealed to be Melania Trump, based on real, rather unsettling fashion choices made by the First Lady.\n\nQueen Camilla and First Lady Melania Trump view items on display during a visit to the Royal Collection exhibition, in the Green Drawing Room during the State visit by the President of the United States of America at Windsor Castle on September 17, 2025 in Windsor, England. (Photo by Aaron Chown - WPA Pool/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nMelania’s sinister presence might also be inspired by the “Hat Man,” an urban legend of a spectral man in a hat commonly seen in nightmares and fever dreams.\n\nAs the boys embrace the ruthless scam of their crypto coin, Kyle becomes increasingly uncomfortable, and irritated by the appearance of his miserly cousin Kyle, an old favorite of the show who returns to help the boys pull off the scam.\n\nCousin Kyle instructs the boys on how to build hype for their coin to prepare for the rug pull, and rolls up to the White House for a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., where he is sucked into a group séance.\n\nA bitter rivalry between Pam Bondi and Vice President J.D. Vance explodes during the séance, and to top off the scene, the recurring joke of Kristi Noem’s melting face returns, frightening cousin Kyle into a confession.\n\nCousin Kyle admits that crypto is one massive money laundering scheme designed to further enrich the wealthy, and the White House responds by placing him under arrest.\n\nThe episode concludes with Stan admitting to Kyle that he was right about everything, and grudgingly accepting that the world has changed, and so has South Park.\n\nParker and Stone seem to have embraced their role as political satirists of the second Trump era—the role seems a good fit for the crudest, rudest show on television.\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\nForbes‘South Park’ Tackles The 6-7 Meme, And The AntichristBy Dani Di PlacidoForbes‘It: Welcome To Derry’—Who (Or What) Is Pennywise?By Dani Di PlacidoForbesThe Internet Is Dreaming Of ‘Mall World’—But What Is It?By Dani Di PlacidoForbesTikTok’s ‘Group 7’ Meme, ExplainedBy Dani Di Placido\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"‘South Park’ pokes fun at itself in episode 2 of season 28, ‘The Woman in the Hat,’ suggesting that the White House is haunted by the presence of Melania Trump.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/11/03/south-park-says-that-everything-sucks-now-including-south-park/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6909358163f5814e8f5f89b7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:25:21","author":"Dani Di Placido,Senior Contributor","authors":["Dani Di Placido","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":375451212,"title":"Trump says he will restrict federal funds for New York City if Mamdani wins","text":"United States Republican President Donald Trump says he will restrict federal funds for New York City if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the city’s mayoral elections, to be held on Tuesday.\n\nTrump said on his Truth Social platform on Monday that “it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required”, if Mamdani wins the race.\n\nPolls show Mamdani leading against former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary, and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, who is the Republican nominee.\n\nAccording to the latest RealClearPolitics polls on Monday, Mamdani led with 45.8 percent, maintaining a 14.7-point advantage over Cuomo’s 31.1 percent and a 28.5-point lead over Sliwa’s 17.3 percent.\n\nOn the final day of campaigning on Monday, the mayoral candidates raced across New York City’s five boroughs after months of back-and-forth barbs, social media hits and saucy debates.\n\nAs the closely-watched election day edged closer, Mamdani led a sunrise walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, flanked by hundreds of supporters, before kicking off the day with a speech at City Hall.\n\nCuomo, on his part, denounced socialism in the Bronx, visited seniors in Chinatown, and popped off an X post calling Mamdani a “poser”.\n\nAnd Republican candidate Sliwa greeted supporters in the Coney Island neighbourhood of Brooklyn in his signature red hat, as he spoke at a subway station where a woman was killed on a train last year.\n\nMamdani and Cuomo’s duelling campaigns have reflected their positions in the New York race: the son of another former New York governor, steeped in the liberal Democratic political establishment, versus a young and little-known assemblyman who would be the city’s first Muslim, first person born in Africa and the first person of South Asian descent to lead New York City.\n\nThe mayoral race, which has captured outsized global attention, has seen a record 735,317 early votes cast over the past nine days, more than four times the total for the 2021 election, according to the New York City Board of Elections.\n\n‘Our time is now’\n\nMamdani, a 34-year-old New York state assemblyman, has galvanised New Yorkers with an optimistic, multilingual campaign that promised free buses, rent freezes and universal childcare, partially paid for by taxing the city’s wealthiest residents.\n\nHe reiterated that Trump had signalled his support for Cuomo in a 60 Minutes interview. In recent weeks, Cuomo has appealed to conservatives as a way to up his polling numbers.\n\n“If [Cuomo is] elected as mayor, our city will descend deeper into the darkness that has forced too many of our neighbours to flee, and made it impossible for working people to live lives of dignity,” Mamdani said.\n\nIn his City Hall speech on Monday, Mamdani seemed to embrace the seismic shift that his campaign has represented for New York’s politics.\n\n“There were few in this city who dared to imagine that we could win, and what it would mean for a city that has – for too long – served only the wealthy and powerful, at the expense of those who work through sunrises and sunsets,” Mamdani said.\n\nMoments later, the crowd broke out in cheers of, “Our time is now!”\n\nCuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 after an independent state probe found he had engaged in a pattern of sexually harassing women, took aim at Mamdani’s democratic socialist promises in his final hours of campaigning, likening them to left-wing governments in Latin America.\n\n“Socialism didn’t work in Venezuela.

Jeff Landry's intervention in LSU football","text":"Gov. Jeff Landry is being applauded by some for taking a stand against bloated contracts in college sports and derided by others for political grandstanding that could make it harder for Louisiana State University to land a new football coach.\n\nThis much is clear: The governor has been a vocal force in a sports shakeup that has consumed LSU recently. \n\nThe university lost its football coach and athletic director last week amid criticism from Landry, a smooth-talking Cajun populist and staunch ally of President Donald Trump. \n\nThe episode is just the latest example of Landry being hands on with LSU since taking office last year. He once revived the team’s tradition of bringing a live tiger onto the football field, publicly called for the school to discipline professors who criticized Trump in class and complained about LSU women’s basketball players not being on court to stand for the national anthem, though the team did not change its pre-game routine. \n\nHere’s what to know:\n\n What did Landry say? \n\nLSU football coach Brian Kelly was fired in the fourth season of a 10-year, $100 million deal, the day after a 49-25 loss to Texas A&M on Oct. 25.\n\nThe day of Kelly’s firing, Landry said he hosted a meeting in the governor’s mansion on the evening of Oct. 26 “to discuss the legalities of the contract.” Landry has said he is concerned his state will be on the hook to pay for Kelly’s buyout, which is about $54 million.\n\nJohn Carmouche, chair of the LSU’s Board of Supervisors’ Athletic Committee, told the AP that the meeting at the governor’s mansion occurred after Kelly had already been fired by athletic director Scott Woodward.\n\nWhile the governor's concerns are valid, negotiations with Kelly are ongoing and private donors and nonprofits have typically picked up the bill for sports-related buyouts at the university, Carmouche added. \n\nDays after Kelly’s firing, Landry told reporters at a Wednesday press conference that LSU’s athletic director would not be selecting the next football coach.\n\n“Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it,” said Landry. He also criticized Woodward’s prior tenure at Texas A&M, where he served as the school’s athletic director.\n\nThe next day, LSU cut ties with Woodward.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Woodward said that “others can recap or opine on my tenure and on my decisions over the last six years as Director of Athletics, but I will not.”\n\nBoard chairman Scott Ballard framed Woodward’s departure as the result of “a mutual agreement after conversations” between Woodward and the LSU board. Nine of 18 Board of Supervisors members have been appointed by Landry since taking office in January 2024 and the governor will be able to appoint four more in 2026.\n\nCarmouche, who like Ballard was appointed to the LSU board by Landry, denied that the governor’s remarks had any influence on Woodward’s departure.\n\n“We’re all independent people,” Carmouche said.\n\n What’s next for LSU football \n\nIn a Friday press conference, LSU interim athletic director Verge Ausberry, flanked by Ballard and Carmouche, sought to reassure the public that the school’s athletic department “is not broken.” \n\nA search committee comprised of Ausberry, Carmouche, Ballard and several others is on the hunt for a new coach. The university board is scheduled to vote on a new president Tuesday, having been without one since June.\n\nLandry has denied that he will be picking the next coach, but said he wants the new contract to be structured differently than Kelly’s.\n\n“We’re going to put metrics on it, because I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country and then leaving the taxpayers to foot the bill,” Landry told reporters.\n\n What others are saying \n\n“The Louisiana governor and the LSU board has damaged the reputation of our university,” political pundit James Carville, a Democrat, told the AP. Carville has said he plans to burn his LSU diploma and football gear and is mulling a defamation lawsuit against Landry on Woodward’s behalf.\n\nCarville hosted a welcome party for Woodward, a former political consultant and lobbyist, when he was hired by LSU in 2019. Under Woodward, LSU won six national championships in various sports, including football.\n\nFormer Louisiana Board of Regents Chair Richard Lipsey, who founded the influential Tiger Athletic Foundation and recommended Woodward’s hiring, said that Landry’s comments about Woodward revealed that he “wanted more control over LSU” and “wants to run the athletics department.” \n\nLandry’s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEd Orgeron, the former LSU football coach who led the team to a national title in 2019, said that it’s not unusual for a Louisiana governor to take an active interest in the university’s football program. Landry’s predecessor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, hosted dinners for the university’s freshmen recruiting class and showed up at practice to throw passes with LSU receivers.\n\nCurrent Louisiana Board of Regents Chair Misti Cordell, a Landry appointee, said that the governor’s comments sparked constructive public discussion about the need for greater guardrails to protect public universities amid ballooning costs in college sports: “He said what a lot of people were thinking.”\n\nRep. Dixon Wallace McMakin, an LSU graduate who serves as the football team’s announcer, said that Louisiana governors have regularly sought to influence the Tigers dating back a century to the days of firebrand populist Huey Long and are sensitive to poor performance on the gridiron.\n\n“It affects everybody and a governor feels it from all of his voters around the state,” said McMakin, a Republican. “Our standard is excellence, and anything less than excellence we will not stand for in the state of Louisiana.”\n\nWilbert Pryor, who has served on the Louisiana Board of Regents for nearly a decade, said Landry’s perceived influence over the LSU athletics program would complicate the hiring process for a new coach reluctant to have the governor looking over his shoulder.\n\n“I don’t remember any governor in my lifetime making decisions on college football,” Pryor said. “You’d think he would have other things to garner his attention.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

If he were to win New York City’s mayoral race, he’d be one of the most influential socialists in the country.\n\nThere’s a debate about whether there’s a difference between democratic socialism and socialism. Mamdani often makes the distinction that he’s a Democratic socialist, appearing to be distinct from countries like socialist and communist countries in Cuba and North Korea.\n\nSome are fearful of socialism, democratic or not, taking the reins of the United States’s largest city.\n\nBrooklyn Republican New York City Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, who immigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has called Mamdani a “communist” and warned he’ll bring a resurgence of socialism and antisemitism.\n\n“They escaped communism and socialism. A lot of people here are Jewish immigrants. They escaped antisemitism,” she said. “We came to America for the American dream, for capitalism, for the free market economy, for opportunities for our children.\n\n“And what we’re seeing now is everything that we escaped, communism, socialism, antisemitism is coming back into New York City,” she added.\n\nMamdani has refused the “communist” label, which President Donald Trump has also used for him, and said Trump calls him that because he knows voters are connecting with his brand of Democratic socialism. \n\n“I think it reflects the fact that … whereas that identity would have been enough for Donald Trump in the past, now he doesn’t even want to use that because he knows that the message of my politics is one that is connecting with New Yorkers across the five boroughs. It’s a message of dignity in each and every person’s life,” Mamdani said in September.\n\nIt’s unclear how else Mamdani’s socialist roots will manifest if he makes it to City Hall. The DSA’s platform list states that Medicare, housing, and college should be free for all people and that several police reforms should be enacted, including the elimination of cash bail. The organization often touts Mamdani and believes it can take on the ruling class.\n\n“The Democratic Socialists of America believes that we as working people can beat the ruling class and forge a better world,” the group’s platform says.\n\nNew York City has long been one of the most expensive places to rent housing in the nation. The city accounted for 39 of the 100 ZIP codes with the most expensive median rent across the United States.\n\nThe average rent price in New York City is about $3,600, according to Zillow. That’s $1,100 higher than the average in Washington, D.C., of $2,500.\n\nOne of Mamdani’s hallmark campaign pledges has been to freeze the rent of rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. Those apartments saw a 3% rent increase this year, following a recommendation by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board, which oversees the rent of rent-stabilized units.\n\nWhile a mayor cannot control the rent themselves, they can appoint members to the Rent Guidelines Board that will implement their agenda. \n\nCuomo has said Mamdani’s “freeze the rent” pledge is misleading because it only accounts for rent-stabilized units. “‘Freeze the rent’ is a fraud on the public,” he said earlier this month.\n\nMamdani and Cuomo have both pledged to build affordable housing in New York City in the hope that they can bring rent prices across the board down. Sliwa believes affordable housing isn’t an adequate solution, and wants to convert commercial space into rental housing while supporting small landlords and property owners.\n\nThe rent issue in the city is part of the greater cost-of-living crisis there. Food, healthcare, and utilities are more expensive than in most cities.\n\nAll three candidates have acknowledged that the cost of living is a top issue and have campaigned heavily on it. Mamdani, the polling leader, has done the most extensive campaign work on the affordability of the three.\n\nEven in his campaign launch video last year, Mamdani repeatedly cited affordability as a top problem.\n\n“The cost of living is the real crisis,” he said then.\n\nNew York City’s crime rate has been variable over the years, with a downward trend as of late. New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch recently announced the city hit record lows in shooting incidents and victims in 2025.\n\nHowever, voters remain concerned about the city’s safety, particularly as the police force grapples with a staffing crisis, having lost several thousand officers from its peak of 40,000 in 2000.\n\nMamdani hasn’t addressed the problem as much as Cuomo and Sliwa, and it could be a weak point for him. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani gained extensive popularity and renown in the city due to his efforts to combat crime in the mid-to-late 1990s.\n\nThe two opposition candidates to Mamdani have tried to capitalize on voter concerns about crime by promising to hire more officers. Cuomo has pledged 5,000 new officers, while Sliwa wants 7,000.\n\nMamdani wants to maintain the current NYPD force levels and create a “Department of Community Safety.”\n\nThe campaign states that the new department will alleviate pressure on the NYPD by redirecting its focus away from “failures of our social safety net.” The department would send mental health workers to the scenes of certain emergencies and “gun violence interrupters” to areas where violence is escalating.\n\nThere’s been ample skepticism about whether his new department will be able to solve the city’s crime problem.\n\nThere are concerns that the outreach workers may not be equipped to handle a dangerous situation. “If someone is inside a house and there are knives or weapons around, even though he may be nonviolent, the police may need to respond,” Rodney Harrison, a former NYPD chief, told the New York Times.\n\nSubway safety is also a top concern. A woman was set on fire on a city subway in December 2024, sparking uproar over the perceived danger of the city’s subways.\n\nMamdani’s DCS would deploy dedicated outreach workers to 100 subway stations, whereas Cuomo and Sliwa aim to increase the presence of law enforcement officers in the transit system.\n\nAll three candidates also want to expand outreach to the city’s large homeless population, many of whom reside in the subway system.\n\nTrump has taken a particular interest in New York City’s mayoral race during his second term in office, likely because he was born in the city. He has largely refused to back anyone in the race until very recently, noting he’d rather vote for the “bad Democrat” in Cuomo than the “communist” Mamdani.\n\nThe president isn’t a fan of Sliwa, even though he is a Republican, once calling the crime prevention leader “not exactly prime time.”\n\nThere has been discussion during the general election about who will be best to deal with the president, who has signaled that he will deploy the National Guard to fight crime in New York City at some point.\n\nCuomo insists that he’s the best candidate to battle Trump because he fought with him as New York’s governor. “I would say to the president — the first conversation, look, we have had many, many battles … and the battles were bloody, and I’d like to avoid them. … I will fight you every step of the way if you try to hurt New York,” Cuomo said during the first mayoral debate.\n\nThe former governor has said Trump would knock Mamdanu on his “tuchus.” Mamdani has taken pleasure in associating the former governor with Trump, even congratulating him on Trump’s recent endorsement.\n\n“Congratulations, @AndrewCuomo. I know how hard you worked for this,” he wrote on X.\n\nMAMDANI LEADS THE NYC MAYORAL PACK AHEAD OF OTHER KEY PLAYERS CUOMO AND SLIWA\n\nSliwa has said he’s willing to be tough on Trump, but not if it costs the city valuable federal funds.\n\nMamdani said he would resist any deployment of the National Guard, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or any other federal intervention. He has noted he would speak to Trump only about lowering the cost of living in the city.","summary":"The New York City mayoral race has brought several issues to light in the last several months amid the noise about socialist Zohran Mamdani’s rise.

However, after the emergency summit, Eby no longer feels like BC is going it alone and has a “strong partner” in the federal government.\n\nOn Oct. 14, the Trump administration announced a 10 per cent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber, which, on top of pre-existing duties, now amounts to a 45 per cent tariff. At the same time, Trump slapped a 25 per cent tariff — set to increase in 2026 — on some other wood products, including furniture such as kitchen cabinets and vanities. In 2024, more than 20 per cent of BC’s total commodity exports were wood products, such as lumber, pulp and wood pellets. \n\nBC seeking new markets\n\nThe US is the province’s largest trading partner, but BC is making moves to find new markets for its softwood lumber and other wood products. \n\nThis week BC Minister of Forests Ravi Parmar Parmar is embarking on the “largest forest minister's trade mission to Asia in the history of our province, bringing alongside myself a number of companies, First Nations and value-added partners,” he told Canada’s National Observer in a phone interview last week. Parmar will be travelling to Asia from Nov. 7 to 14. More details are expected in the coming days about which countries will be included, but Japan and South Korea are already confirmed.\n\n“Japan is a very important market to us in British Columbia — I would argue, probably the most important market in terms of value of products,” Parmar said. Japan is BC's third largest trading partner for forest products, after the US and China. In June 2025, trade was down with all BC’s trading partners compared to the previous year.\n\nJapan’s aging population and declining birthrate are reducing demand for softwood lumber imports because there’s less demand for residential housing, but Parmar sees an opportunity for growth thanks to Japan’s booming tourism sector. \n\n“They've shared with us that they need to build 50,000 hotel rooms every single year from now until 2030, and so I want to find a way to be able to build BC wood into their ambitious targets,” Parmar said.\n\nSimilarly, he said the UK has “ambitious” housing targets over the next five years, and BC can support those goals with its lumber and wood products.\n\nTo help further this goal, BC’s Crown corporation, Forestry Innovation Investment, will open an office in London, UK, the province announced recently. \n\nParmar envisions the UK trade office as a gateway to rebuild BC’s trade with other markets in the EU, Middle East and northern Africa, where BC once had significant trade relationships.\n\n“The message that I have to Europeans, to those in North Africa as well as select markets in the Middle East … [is] this is a longstanding relationship that we want to rebuild, because our relationship with the United States has changed forever,” Parmar said.\n\nForestry companies moving south\n\nBut diversification and sales will not save the industry, said Fen Hampson, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University, in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer. There are other longstanding issues facing the forestry sector.\n\nA recent investigation published by The Tyee shows that big forestry companies — Canfor, Interfor and West Fraser — were investing billions south of the border well before Trump initiated the trade war.\n\n“We've long since harvested the stuff that's easy to get to,” Hampson said. With fewer high value trees available for harvest and the need to venture into more remote areas, costs increase for the industry, he added.\n\n“The industry is not nearly as efficient as competitors now in the United States and in Latin America,” he said. \n\n“It's a double hit that the industry is experiencing: long-standing productivity challenges, efficiency challenges, coupled with, now the tariff bludgeon and so … the reality is that this is not going to be a driver of the BC economy,” Hampson said, adding that a responsible government would focus on creating a regulatory environment that entices investment in other sectors.\n\n— With files from the Canadian Press\n\nNatasha Bulowski / Local Journalism Initiative / Canada’s National Observer","summary":"The US is the province’s largest trading partner, but BC is making moves to find new markets in Asia and Europe for its softwood lumber and other wood products.","url":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/11/03/news/bc-anti-tariff-ads-eby-trade-asia-europe","image":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/11/03/davideby-sept-18-2025-1.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:14:27","author":"Byjohn Woodside,Natasha Bulowski","authors":["Byjohn Woodside","Natasha Bulowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.078},{"id":375449696,"title":"Johnson administration scores victory in legal battle with President Trump over frozen federal funds","text":"Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration has scored another legal victory against President Donald Trump’s efforts to punish Chicago for its status as a sanctuary city — this one with $50 million at stake. \n\nIn a ruling handed down Friday, a federal judge granted the city’s motion for a preliminary injunction challenging the decision by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to terminate a program created to reimburse cities for costs tied to the care and feeding of migrants.\n\nThe original lawsuit was filed in May by Chicago, Denver and Arizona’s Pima County.\n\nIt argued that the February 2025 funding freeze and the Trump administration’s subsequent decision to eliminate the program on grounds that it facilitated illegal immigration and was inconsistent with the administration’s priorities violated both the U.S. Constitution and federal law.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration reimbursed some of the five grants totaling $66 million that Chicago was due to receive. But $50 million was still being withheld from the city.\n\nThe preliminary injunction granted Friday prohibits the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA from freezing the funding or terminating the program on the basis of a policy disagreement with Congress. The court ruled that the administration’s actions violated the separation of powers that gives Congress power to control government spending. \n\nCorporation Counsel Mary Richardson-Lowry promised to use “every legal tool available” to pursue the $50 million in funding. \n\n“The city of Chicago will use every legal tool available to uphold the rule of law and defend the separation of powers that is the bedrock principle of our Constitutional system,” Richardson-Lowry was quoted as saying in a press release on the ruling. \n\n“Congress created the Shelter and Services Program to reimburse cities for providing humanitarian assistance to migrants released by DHS. When DHS and FEMA unlawfully terminated that program despite Congress’ direction, we acted swiftly and the court ruled that the federal government’s actions violated the law.”\n\nBy June 2024, the city of Chicago had already spent more than $400 million to provide food and shelter for more than 42,000 migrants, most of whom were sent to Chicago by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nThe migrant crisis that Johnson inherited from former Mayor Lori Lightfoot forced the city to set up nearly 40 shelters for the thousands of migrant arrivals from Texas, as well as for the incoming migrants’ medical care, food service, school enrollment and work permits.\n\nDuring the height of the city’s migrant crisis, Chicago faced difficult choices that angered some City Council members and their constituents.\n\nScores of asylum seekers were forced to sleep on floors at O’Hare Airport and police stations. The Johnson administration also angered alderpersons by closing Park District fieldhouses used for recreation and cultural events.\n\nThe mayor chose an abandoned industrial site at 38th and California in the Brighton Park neighborhood as the venue for a “winterized base camp” for thousands of migrants. That site turned out to be contaminated. Gov. JB Pritzker stepped in and blocked its use, exacerbating tensions between the city and state.\n\nLast year, Chicago created a single, unified shelter system to house migrants and the city’s own homeless residents.\n\nDuring an appearance on WVON radio earlier this year, Johnson tried to ease lingering tensions with African American voters about the migrant crisis. A caller asked how Johnson could justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars “putting these people up when you can’t throw a brick without hitting a homeless Black person.” Johnson said he had little choice but to deal with the crisis.\n\n“We took an attack from the governor of Texas, responded to that attack even though it wasn’t our responsibility. It should have been the federal government. We … got those individuals off the floors of police stations and still built a system to respond to the unhoused crisis in Chicago,” Johnson said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/11/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-frozen-federal-funds-fema","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/63c38c4/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6135x4090+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2F00%2F6d2a1d744c349692cb315fa669fe%2Fwatch","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:14:23","author":"Fran Spielman","authors":["Fran Spielman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.538},{"id":375451150,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Shreds Note From 'The View' Bosses Live On-Air Begging Her to Correct Bombshell Claims About Trump — After Hosts Were Warned Over Political Commentary","text":"Whoopi Goldberg has let her outright hatred of Donald Trump get the better of her on The View, suffering a meltdown when she was handed a legal note she was forced to read live on-air, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nThe show's moderator, 69, threw a fit when she was handed a piece of paper by panelist Sunny Hostin that asked her to clarify a remark she made about the president using an autopen in a pardon. The comment rattled producers enough to prompt the comedian to make a correction to viewers.Incoming Legal Note!The kerfuffle came amid the Hot Topics segment on Monday, November 3, where the ladies were discussing Trump's appearance on 60 Minutes the night prior.\n\nIn it, the president claimed, \"I don't know who he is,\" when asked by Norah O'Donnell why he pardoned billionaire crypto exchange founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\n“He said that Joe Biden didn’t know who he was pardoning because he used an autopen. How come you don’t know who this guy is?” Hostin, 57, huffed. \n\nGoldberg fired back about Trump, \"'Cause he used an autopen!\"'It Was a Joke!'The women moved on to other elements of the interview, including ICE raids, when, several minutes later, Hostin passed the legal note to Goldberg. She looked down and muttered, \"What the hell? What?\" as she began to read aloud the contents. \n\n\"It was a joke!\" the Sister Act star shouted, as Hostin explained to viewers, \"We don’t know if Trump used an autopen,\" while snarking, \"But we do know that he didn’t know who that crypto guy was.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on!\" Goldberg continued to complain about the missive, which was from the show's producers. \n\n\"Well, I’m sorry.

I'm very specific when I’m pointing stuff out. When I'm making jokes, you know when I'm making jokes. This is ridiculous,\" the EGOT winner fumed as she tore the note into pieces amid audience applause.So far, the White House has not responded to Goldberg's legal note tirade. Still, the Trump communications team responded with fury when Joy Behar went on a rant about the president in July.\n\nThe statement even suggested that the show's hard-left-leaning bent could make it the next liberal talk show casualty, after Stephen Colbert's The Late Show received its cancellation notice amid sky-high costs and sagging ratings. \n\n\"Joy Behar is an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. It’s no surprise that The View’s ratings hit an all-time low last year,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers stated.\n\nRogers added, \"She should self-reflect on her own jealousy of President Trump’s historic popularity before her show is the next to be pulled off-air.\"Booking More Republican GuestsABC launched an investigation into a liberal bias after it was revealed that nearly all of The View's guests in the first half of 2025 were hard-left-leaning. \n\nIn an attempt to appear more balanced, the show's panelists found common ground with one formerly proud MAGA supporter, Marjorie Taylor Greene. \n\nThe Georgia congresswoman is appearing on the ABC daytime show on Tuesday, November 4, in a rare guest booking with a Republican, after going rogue against her party on the government shutdown.\n\nGreene, 51, called for it to end and for her party to work with the Democrats. \n\nWhen showing the clip of the politician speaking about it during a prior Hot Topics discussion, Goldberg praised her as \"the surprising voice of reason.\"\n\nBehar joked, \"You know what?

Bush said on November 1, according to Mediate.\n\nIn Virginia, he said Republicans will likely suffer minimal losses, while in New York, he said Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani would emerge victorious.\n\nThe elections — which have drawn high-profile endorsements, including from former President Barack Obama — are being closely watched by political operatives. \n\nThe results will be seen as a pulse check on the political mood nearly one year into President Donald Trump’s second term.\n\nCiting recent trends, Rove indicated that in New Jersey, Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli, a former state representative, could triumph over Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate. \n\n“Trump lost it [New Jersey] in 2020 by 16 points,” he told Fox News. “He lost it by six last time around. So the number one thing that the Republican candidate needs to do is he needs to build on the Trump bump.”\n\nHe added that the GOP will likely pick up seats in the state legislature. \n\nIn an October Quinnipiac University poll, Sherill led Ciattarelli 51 percent to 43 percent.\n\nIn Virginia, Rove estimated that Republican incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares will beat Democratic challenger Jay Jones and that the GOP losses will be minimal in the House of Delegates. \n\nHe said that, in the gubernatorial race, former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is “running significantly ahead of” Republican Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears.\n\nIn a November Emerson College survey, Spanberger held a comfortable 11-point lead over Earle-Sears, while Jones only outpaced Miyares by 2 points.\n\n“And in New York, we’re gonna get the gift that keeps on giving,” Rove said, predicting Mamdani would defeat former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n\n“We’re gonna have a Democratic socialist mayor who wins in the low 50s or mid 50s in a city where 62% of the eligible voters are registered Democrats, 22% are registered independents, and only 16% are Republicans, conservatives, or members of little, fringe, left-wing parties,” he said.\n\nMamdani received support from 43 percent of respondents in an October Quinnipiac poll, while Cuomo and Sliwa trailed him with 33 percent and 14 percent, respectively.\n\nElections will also be held on Tuesday in dozens of other states, including in California, where voters will decide whether or not to redraw the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.","summary":"Rove zeroed in on the New York City mayoral race and gubernatorial and down-ballot races in New Jersey and Virginia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/karl-rove-predictions-election-day-new-york-virginia-b2857870.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/03/23/33/GettyImages-2161587283.jpeg?crop=6087,4058,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EGblCL2y-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:10:44","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":375442628,"title":"US changes Nigeria designation after Trump threat over alleged attacks on Christians","text":"The State Department on Monday officially updated its designation for Nigeria as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" for its alleged severe violations of religious freedom and persecution of Christians. \n\nThe CPC label is given by the U.S. government to nations \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\" under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. The designation is largely symbolic, but U.S. law states that governments must \"take targeted responses to violations of religious freedom.\"\n\nThe move comes after President Donald Trump accused the Nigerian government of not doing enough to protect Christians from violence.

Other countries designated as CPCs include Burma, the People’s Republic of China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\n\nTrump previously designated Nigeria as a CPC in December 2020 during his first term in office, but that designation was reversed the following year under the Biden administration. \n\nObama Secretary of State Antony Blinken removed Nigeria from the CPC designation list in November 2021 after assessing it did not meet the criteria a formal designation of concern regarding \"systematic, ongoing, and egregious\" violations of religious freedom.\n\nThe U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom blasted the move at the time and said the decision to remove Nigeria from the special designation was \"unexplainable\" and appalling. \n\nAccording to the State Department, the International Religious Freedom Act requires an annual review of the status of religious freedom worldwide and the designation of countries that have “engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom” during the reporting period.\n\nThe IRFA defines particularly severe violations of religious freedom as \"systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom, including violations such as torture, degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without charges, abduction or clandestine detention, or other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of persons,\" according to the State Department. \n\nAfter a country has been designated a CPC by the secretary of state, Congress is then notified, and where non-economic policy options designed to bring about cessation of the particularly severe violations of religious freedom have reasonably been exhausted, an economic measure generally must be imposed, the State Department states.\n\nCongress will investigate\n\nTrump called on Rep. Riley Moore, a Republican from West Virginia, to lead an investigation into the alleged slaughtering of Christians in Nigeria. Moore has been a vocal advocate for Christians in Africa. Last month, he called on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to designate Nigeria as a country of particular concern.\n\nMoore applauded Trump's move over the weekend and said he and House Appropriations Committee chairman Tom Cole, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee would investigate the alleged religious persecution.\n\nIn August, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a bill calling for sanctions against Nigeria for purported violations of religious freedom and to designate Nigeria as a CPC.\n\nIn March 2025, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa held a hearing to discuss \"Conflict and Persecution in Nigeria\" and the case for designating Nigeria a CPC. \n\nAccording to Moore's office, more than 7,000 Christians have been killed in Nigeria in 2025 alone -- an average of 35 per day -- with hundreds more kidnapped, tortured, or displaced by extremist groups such as Boko Haram, ISIS West Africa, and the Fulani militants. According to Moore's office, reports indicate that between 50,000 and 100,000 Christians have been killed and more than 19,000 Christian churches have been attacked or destroyed since 2009. Data from Open Doors indicate that more Christians are killed every year in Nigeria than the rest of the world combined. \n\nBut those numbers have been widely disputed. \n\nExtremist violence in the country \"affects large numbers of Christians and Muslims in several states across Nigeria,\" the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom found in 2024. \n\nExperts say both Christians and Muslims -- the two main religious groups in the country of more than 230 million people -- have been victims of attacks by radical Islamists.\n\nNigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has also pushed back against Trump's and other lawmakers' claims, writing \"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians.\" \n\nTrump threatens to halt U.S. aid \n\nThe U.S. committed approximately $1.02 billion in aid to Nigeria for fiscal year 2023, according to U.S. government figures. \n\nSlightly less aid was reported for FY2024 at $902.9 million.\n\nAnd even less in foreign aid to Nigeria is projected for FY2025 -- roughly $550 million has been obligated for the year, though the data is incomplete. It's unclear how much aid Trump is considering cutting.\n\nDespite the shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development and cuts to all U.S. foreign aid, the U.S. government announced a contribution of $32.5 million to Nigeria in September 2025 that would \"provide food assistance and nutrition support to internally displaced persons across conflict-affected areas,\" according to the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria.\n\nTrump gets celebrity endorsement \n\nRapper Nicki Minaj thanked Trump for his tweet addressing persecution of Christians in Nigeria over the weekend. Minaj is not Nigerian; she is Trinidadian. \n\n\"Reading this made me feel a deep sense of gratitude. We live in a country where we can freely worship God. No group should ever be persecuted for practicing their religion,\" Minaj said on X. \"We don’t have to share the same beliefs in order for us to respect each other. Numerous countries all around the world are being affected by this horror & it’s dangerous to pretend we don’t notice. Thank you to The President & his team for taking this seriously. God bless every persecuted Christian. Let’s remember to lift them up in prayer.\" \n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz thanked Minaj for \"using your platform to speak out in defense of the Christians being persecuted in Nigeria.\" \n\nHe also invited her to talk more in depth about what the administration is doing to protect Christians around the world. \"We cannot allow this to continue,\" Waltz added. \"Every brother and sister of Christ must band together and say, 'Enough!'\"","summary":"He said the U.S. might attack Nigeria, cut aid if Christians weren't protected.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-designates-nigeria-country-concern-after-trump-threat/story?id=127148133","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bd90f786-be8d-4edc-a2c3-5ca3e42d2797/marco-rubio-1-ap-gmh-252027_1761576717454_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-03 23:06:54","author":"Mariam Khan","authors":["Mariam Khan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.508}]}
