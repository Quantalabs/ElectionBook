It’s time to sit together as peaceful neighbours and negotiate. If we truly want lasting peace, the Kashmir issue must be resolved.”\n\nThe ceremony paid glowing tributes to the martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland during the recent confrontation.\n\nIn his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saluted the martyrs and lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces for their unmatched bravery. “Today is a day of gratitude — such days come once in centuries,” he remarked, highlighting the significance of the recent military triumph.\n\nThe premier revealed that during a high-level meeting with top military commanders on the night of May 9 and 10, it was decided that the enemy had crossed all limits. “Our innocent citizens, including a six-year-old child, were martyred. The enemy sent a message that they could strike within Pakistan’s territory,” he said.\n\nShehbaz Sharif detailed the military response, saying, “Six enemy aircraft were downed — including Rafale jets and drones — giving a strong message to those who thought they could act with impunity.” He added that Pakistan’s response left the aggressor nation scrambling for cover.\n\n“The whole world is now asking how Pakistan achieved such a decisive success,” the prime minister said. “It was the prayers of 240 million Pakistanis that Allah accepted, and today, we bow our heads in gratitude.”\n\nReflecting on the journey ahead, PM Shehbaz emphasised that it is now time to pursue the vision for which Pakistan was created. “The souls of millions of martyrs are calling on us to build the Pakistan of Quaid-e-Azam,” he stated.\n\nCalling for unity, he said, “If we can turn today’s national unity into our capital, we can elevate Pakistan to its rightful place.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier during a visit to Abu Dhabi, Trump said the now-deleted post, which showed seashells arranged to form the numbers \"86 47,\" was deliberate. \"He wasn't very competent. But he was competent enough to know what that meant. And, he did it for a reason,\" Trump said in an interview that aired Friday on \"Special Report.\" The post, shared on Instagram, featured the caption, \"Cool shell formation on my beach walk.\" Some interpreted it as a coded message, with \"86\" being slang for \"get rid of,\" and \"47\" referring to Trump, who is the 47th president of the United States. FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY MEETS WITH SECRET SERVICE AFTER CONTROVERSIAL '86 47' POST Comey later deleted the post and issued an apology, saying, \"I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" Trump, however, is not convinced. \"He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,\" he said. \"If you're the FBI director, and you don't know what that meant – that meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear.\" FLASHBACK: COMEY HAD ANOTHER ANTI-TRUMP SEASHELL PHOTO MOMENT DURING 2024 ELECTION When asked whether Comey should face consequences, Trump declined to give a definitive answer but said the Justice Department and U.S. Secret Service are investigating. \"If he had a clean history – he doesn’t, he’s a dirty cop … I could understand if there was a leniency. But I’m going to let them make that decision,\" he said. Trump also used the interview to highlight recent foreign policy developments, claiming success in brokering peace and securing economic deals in the Middle East. \"I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,\" Trump said. He pointed to a recent ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, calling it a major breakthrough that averted what he claimed was the potential for nuclear war. GABBARD SAYS COMEY SHOULD BE 'PUT BEHIND BARS' AFTER PICTURE ALLEGEDLY 'ISSUING A CALL TO ASSASSINATE' TRUMP \"That was going to be a nuclear war, I think, or close … And now everyone’s happy,\" Trump said. \"In fact, I told my people, call them up, let’s start trading immediately.\" Earlier this month, Trump announced the ceasefire in a Truth Social post, congratulating both nuclear powers for showing what he called \"common sense.\" He said he’s also looking to use his trade strategy with Iran, which he claims is looking to make a deal with the United States. The president reiterated his stance that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon, and noted the solution will either be \"violent or not violent\" and said he would prefer the peaceful option. Trump is returning to Washington with what he described as three major investment deals from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, amounting to billions of dollars in commitments to the U.S. economy. He also criticized President Joe Biden’s approach to the region, saying, \"It’s a great region, but it was never treated properly. And it was certainly not treated well by Biden, who didn’t know he was alive, frankly.\" TRUMP ANNOUNCES INDIA AND PAKISTAN AGREED TO CEASEFIRE Trump added that he has eased \"crippling\" sanctions on Syria, claiming the country’s leadership requested relief to prove they could change. The president also commented on the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is growing \"tired\" of the conflict. Trump said he believes he could pressure Russia into peace talks using economic leverage, as he claims to have done with Iran, but only if he has to. He criticized Biden for what he views as a failure to prevent the war, repeating his longstanding argument that the invasion would not have happened under his administration. Toward the end of the interview, Trump discussed the investigations into two assassination attempts against him during the 2024 campaign season. He revealed that, while some information remains classified, he has been briefed by officials and still has questions. TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT NOW FACING FIRST-DEGREE MURDER, TERRORISM CHARGES \"I thought it was strange,\" Trump said of one suspect. \"The one guy had 18 cell phones, okay? I have a lot of cell phones, but I have like two.\" Discussing the Butler, Pennsylvania incident, where a bullet grazed his ear, Trump said investigators found unusual activity on the assailant’s phone. \"Three apps. Very unusual apps. And two of them were foreign apps,\" he noted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump says that although he continues to feel uneasy, he’s been assured by officials that he is not currently at risk. \"They tell me it’s fine,\" he said. \"It's a bit hard to be believe as I get that throbbing feeling. I get a little throbbing feeling,\" he added, touching on the lingering effects of his injury.","summary":"President Trump accused James Comey of issuing a veiled threat in a cryptic social media post, while touting his Middle East economic achievements and slamming President Biden&apos;s approach to the Russia-Ukraine war.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-comey-knew-assassination-meaning-behind-deleted-social-media-post","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/trump-baier.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:55:56","author":"Madison Colombo","authors":["Madison Colombo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":322164508,"title":"Ros Atkins on... how world leaders are responding to Israel's blockade of Gaza","text":"US President Donald Trump says \"a lot of people are starving\" in Gaza, and the US will make sure the situation is \"taken care of\". \n\nGaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. \n\nThe BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how world leaders have responded to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation there.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c20x1w9xq4po","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2232/live/7d1ffc50-32ab-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:52:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.213},{"id":322164890,"title":"Why even Trump's own supporters are growing queasy that he's shamelessly using his Presidency to make him and his family yet more billions","text":"Next Thursday, 220 guests will assemble under the crystal chandeliers of the great ballroom at the Trump National Golf Club outside Washington DC for a lavish dinner that organisers have described as 'the most exclusive invitation in the world'.\n\nThe 800-acre venue boasts 'stunning views of the Potomac River' – but the most impressive view for the guests, all of them cryptocurrency investors, will be of their host, President Trump.\n\nThe 25 wealthiest of them will also attend an 'exclusive reception before dinner with YOUR FAVORITE President' followed, the next day, by a 'VIP tour' of the White House.\n\nThey include Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire best known for paying $6.2million for a banana at an art auction. \n\nHe and fellow guests will doubtless make sure that they royally flatter their host about his recent trip to the Middle East, where he was offered a $400million 'palace in the sky' Boeing 747-8 by Qatar's ruling royal family. It's just the sort of jackpot such speculators would admire.\n\nGovernments often push the boat out in this way for wealthy people, either to encourage them to invest in their country or to thank them for past generosity.\n\nHowever, what's unusual – though 'outrageous' might be a better word – about this glitzy night with The Donald is that the guests aren't being rewarded for services to the US or charity, but for services to the Trump private bank account.\n\nThe 220 attending the dinner are doing so purely because they bought a cryptocurrency token called the $TRUMP 'meme coin' that the President launched days before taking office (for good measure, First Lady Melania launched her own too). \n\nTo get an invitation to the dinner, it's estimated that 'investors' bought around $55,000 worth of the coin apiece, while to qualify for the even more selective pre-dinner reception with the President (and that VIP tour) they had to purchase $TRUMP coins worth $4.3million. (Mr Sun reportedly was the biggest spender, shelling out $19million.)\n\nLike other such tokens, the $TRUMP coin lacks any intrinsic value and its worth is instead defined by what speculators are prepared to pay for it, or 'hype' in other words.\n\nThat didn't stop buyers spending $148million snapping up the tokens in a three-week-long contest to win a dinner invitation, pushing the current market value of all $TRUMP coins to more than $2.7billion.\n\nIn the process, the investors made millions of dollars for the Trump family as the latter's businesses own a majority of the coins and they also get a transaction fee each time one of the tokens are exchanged. \n\nIt's just a shame that Justin Sun and the other 'crypto bros' won't be able to celebrate their 'favourite' president over a few high-priced late-night drinks at another Trump money-spinner nearby.\n\nBut sadly the Executive Branch, a Washington DC private club set up by Donald Trump Jr and a few other investors, isn't open yet.\n\nIt will have a joining fee of up to $500,000 and is intended, say insiders, to offer business and tech moguls the chance to hobnob with members of the Trump administration in privacy.\n\nSince Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s, every US president except Trump has agreed to sell his investments before taking office or seal them in a blind trust.\n\nTrump insists that it is enough for his sons to run the family business instead but many vigorously disagree. \n\nAccording to Forbes, his personal wealth has more than doubled to $5.1billion in the past year, half of which has been spent preparing for office or as President.\n\nEven so, what's happening with the $TRUMP has flabbergasted opponents with Trump facing a rising tide of outrage over allegations of shameless self-enrichment and corruption.\n\nIn particular, his critics say he shouldn't be involved in cryptocurrencies when he has so much power over the controversial industry and when investors can curry favour with him by buying his products.\n\n'The Trump meme coin is the single most corrupt act ever committed by a President,' howled Democrat US Senator Chris Murphy last week.\n\n'Donald Trump is essentially posting his Venmo [a US payment app] for any billionaire CEO or foreign oligarch to cash in some favours by secretly sending him millions of dollars.'\n\nAnd this week, new concerns were raised when GD Culture Group, a mysterious technology company with ties to China, announced it was buying up to $300million worth of $TRUMP.\n\nMight they expect a quid pro quo for their generosity?\n\nThe same question is being asked about the Qataris over their recent $400million gift of a luxury jet to Trump (which he delightedly plans to accept) and of the various foreign countries – mostly in the Middle East – that are agreeing billion-dollar property deals with the Trumps or investing even more eye-watering sums in their business ventures.\n\nCritics' anger over the President's financial conflicts of interests is mixed with a sense of helplessness. \n\nTrump's Republicans control Congress so, as legal and ethics experts told the Mail this week, almost nothing can be done to stop him, short of a major revolt by his own grassroots supporters.\n\nThe first Trump presidency was criticised after it emerged that foreign governments, US officials and others involved with the administration were spending millions of dollars on meals and rooms in hotels owned by the Trump Organization.\n\nBut that's nothing, say opponents, compared with the profiteering taking place now.\n\nDuring the President's first term, the Trump Organization agreed to stop doing any foreign deals, but this time round it has lined up a string of multi-million-dollar projects across the world.\n\nThe mixing of public office with private benefits is curtailed by the US Constitution's so-called 'emoluments' clause, which states that Congress must approve any gift from a 'king, prince or foreign state' to an elected US official, including the President.\n\nThe tradition was established in 1785 when King Louis XVI of France gave US founding father Benjamin Franklin a diamond-encrusted snuff box bearing a portrait of His Majesty. (Congress allowed Franklin to keep it as long as he promised not to allow any of the 408 diamonds to be taken off the box and sold separately.)\n\nBut a snuff box, even a jewelled one, pales beside the gilded 747 – a mansion with wings boasting a master bedroom, a guest bedroom, two full bathrooms with showers and ten giant-screen TVs – that Trump felt it appropriate to accept.\n\nAnd unlike Louis XVI's little keepsake, the Qatari gift comes from a controversial ally, which is friendly with the likes of Iran, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood. \n\nDuring his first term, Trump himself denounced Qatar as a 'funder of terrorism'. \n\nDubbing him the 'Emir of America', cynics have suggested that it will probably take the rest of the Trump presidency just to make sure the huge plane is clear of bugs and booby traps.\n\nThe White House insists Trump won't keep the plane outright – and therefore isn't acting unconstitutionally – pointing out that it has been given to the US government and will become part of the official Air Force One fleet.\n\nWhen he leaves office, say his spokesmen, the plane will be donated to Trump's 'presidential library'.\n\nBut critics say that even if it sits on the ground and is only used as a drinks party venue, it will still remain in Trump hands.\n\nHis US Attorney General Pam Bondi declared the gift 'legally permissible', yet her analysis may be a little undermined by the fact that she was once a paid lobbyist for the Qataris, who were charged $115,000 a month for her work in the run-up to the country's 2022 World Cup.\n\nRichard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W Bush administration, drew up the most recent guidelines on outside interests for public servants.\n\nRecalling that the only such controversy during the Bush era was when a national security adviser had to hand over a Rolex watch he was given by the Saudi government, he told the Mail it was both unprecedented and 'quite shocking' what Trump has been able to do.\n\nHe believes Trump's financial conflicts of interest are the worst in Washington since slave owners occupied the White House.\n\nTrump, says Painter, has 'crossed a line' by 'taking a $400million plane from a foreign government that was bankrolling Hamas for a decade'.\n\nRichard Briffault, a government ethics expert at Columbia Law School, agreed with the view that Trump was flouting the constitution by accepting the Qatar plane.\n\n'It's almost impossible to keep track of the number of ways he and his family are exploiting their position for personal gain,' he told the Mail.\n\nBe they jumbo jets or the buying of Trump's opaque cryptocurrency, gifts needn't have a direct 'quid pro quo' attached, said Prof Briffault. 'Gifts often elicit a sense of gratitude and obligation... and so there's a sense that [Trump is] now favourably disposed to Qatar and other countries, enterprises and businesses that invest in him.'\n\nThe crypto investors who'd 'bought access' to Trump next week had done so by 'putting money in his pocket', he adds.\n\n However, while the flying palace may be the most visible example, it's hardly the only one – and not even the only one involving the Qataris.\n\nTwo weeks ago, it was announced that the first foreign deal secured by the Trump Organization since he had returned to the Oval Office would be the building of a luxury resort and 18-hole golf course outside the Qatari capital, Doha.\n\nThe so-called Trump International Golf Club & Villas scheme will be developed by Qatari Diar, which happens to be owned by the Qatari government.\n\nCoincidence?\n\nThere are no coincidences in the Trump clan's fiercely transactional world of mutual favours, say opponents. For the record, last week Trump also visited two other Middle Eastern countries – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – where his sons, Donald Jr and Eric, recently flew in to announce billion-dollar developments: a luxury residential tower in the Saudi city of Jeddah and a top-class hotel in the UAE's Dubai.\n\n'Challenge everything, stop at nothing,' boasts the brochure for the new $1billion, 80-floor Trump International Hotel and Tower planned for Dubai, where units went on sale for up to $20million each, following a huge party there where the guest of honour was Eric Trump.\n\nAnd it's not just property. The state-controlled UAE investment fund recently bought $2billion of a new cryptocurrency issued by a Trump company, Liberty World Financial. The Gulf states have also committed more than $3.5billion to a private equity fund run by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.\n\nPerhaps it is not surprising then that even the President's flagship economic policy of tariffs has been touched by accusations of profiteering.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Vietnam – which was one of the countries hit hardest – announced various measures to curry favour with the Trump administration and get a better trade deal.\n\nThey included a plan to expedite a Trump Organization scheme –its first in the country – to build a $1.5billion development that will include hotels, resorts and golf courses.\n\nMeanwhile, there are signs that some of Trump's usual supporters aren't happy about the Qatari jet. MAGA firebrand Laura Loomer intoned that the US cannot accept presents from 'jihadists in suits'.\n\nEven the Trump-loving hosts of Fox & Friends – the President's favourite morning TV show – felt they had to quiz his press chief, Karoline Leavitt, about the wisdom of accepting such a gift.\n\n'Do you worry that, if they give us something like this, they want something in return?' she was asked. Leavitt was dismissive, assuring the hosts that Trump 'only works with the interests of the American public in mind'.\n\nAnd the UK, with whom Trump agreed the first post-tariffs trade deal last week, hasn't escaped the controversy.\n\nThe Starmer government has been accused of trying to ingratiate itself with the President over a forthcoming golf tournament in Scotland.\n\nIt was revealed two weeks ago that – at the repeated request of Trump – British government officials have asked senior executives at the R&A, which organises The Open, whether they would host the championship at his Turnberry golf resort in 2028.\n\nFunnily enough, Trump used a saying from American golfing legend Sam Snead to defend his acceptance of the Qatari plane.\n\n'When you're given a putt, say 'Thank you very much', pick up your ball and you walk to the next hole,' he told reporters.\n\nAs long as his Republican lackeys in Congress cravenly refuse to challenge him, it appears he'll be able to just keep on walking.","summary":"At an upcoming event with Donald Trump, guests aren't being rewarded for services to the US or charity, but for services to the Trump private bank account","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14720767/Why-Trumps-supporters-growing-queasy-hes-shamelessly-using-Presidency-make-family-billions.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/16/18/98462397-0-image-a-9_1747418358652.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/16/7653268138673259054/1024x576_MP4_7653268138673259054.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:51:55","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.007},{"id":322165962,"title":"Leaked audio reveals extent of Biden’s struggle to remember key details in 2023 interview, including when son died","text":"Audio of President Joe Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur concerning the improper possession of classified documents has been released more than a year after his administration released transcripts.\n\nThe recordings, published by Axios, reveal the extent to which the 46th president, then 80, struggled to remember key details and dates, was prompted by his lawyers, and spoke in a halting, whispering voice, punctuated by long silences.\n\nThey shed light on why the White House refused to release the audio while Biden was still in office amid questions regarding his mental acuity, and also perhaps why Hur’s conclusion was that jurors in any trial that might arise over his possession of the documents would have viewed him as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\nAt the time, the White House hit back at Hur’s assessment of the president, insisting he was “sharp” and that any attacks on Biden were politically motivated — yet the special counsel comes across as respectful, and the tone of the interview is friendly and mostly appears relaxed.\n\nThe release of the audio comes as the Trump administration was reportedly weighing up releasing the recordings. It also comes ahead of the publication of a new book about a White House and presidential campaign hiding the decline of the president as he ran for another term in office. Original Sin by Axios’ Alex Thompson and CNN’s Jake Tapper will be released on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the two three-hour sessions with Hur and his co-counsel Marc Kricknaum, Biden’s attorneys had to remind him of the year his son Beau died and the year that Donald Trump was elected president for the first time — 2015 and 2016, respectively. \n\nBiden spokesperson Kelly Scully told Axios: “The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago. The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.”\n\nWhere the recordings do add a new dimension to what is already known from the transcripts is the length of pauses and the slowly unfolding nature of some answers.\n\nFurther emphasizing these silent moments from the president is the sound of a ticking clock in the background.\n\nNevertheless, Biden remains engaged despite memory lapses. At times, Axios notes, he cracks jokes and makes humorous asides, and throughout, he “sounded more like a nostalgic, grandfatherly storyteller than a potential defendant who could be accused of hoarding secret papers.”\n\nPerhaps the upshot of the basis of the interview was that he had little recollection as to how or why he came to have classified documents in his possession after his two terms as vice president to President Barack Obama.\n\nAt one point, his attorney, Bob Bauer, warns about getting into speculation as to how the documents may have ended up where they did, emphasizing that the president does not recall specific details. \n\nThe timing of the interviews is also noteworthy. The first session took place on October 8, 2023, the day after Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza. In the aftermath of an international crisis that would go on to spark the conflict that continues to this day, Biden is slow, forgetful, and often veers off topic.\n\nHowever, during the second session, the following day, October 9, the president sounds more engaged and vigorous, Axios notes.\n\nWhile Hur’s report did not recommend moving ahead with a prosecution and attempting to persuade a jury of Biden’s guilt in purposefully taking classified materials.\n\n“It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him — by then a former president, well into his 80s — of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness,” he had concluded.\n\nThe Biden camp blasted comments about the president’s age as “gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate,” while Donald Trump’s super PAC said that if Biden wasn’t fit enough for trial, he wasn’t fit enough to be president.\n\nThompson and Tapper’s upcoming book is a collection of their reporting on the cover-up around Biden’s mental and physical decline. The book’s excerpts are already causing a ruckus, as they detail startling instances of Biden’s gaps in mental acuity that were reportedly hidden from the public through 2024.\n\nBiden, whom aides reportedly considered putting in a wheelchair at points, reportedly did not recognize Hollywood megastar George Clooney at an event the president had flown in to Los Angeles specifically for Clooney to host on his behalf. Other excerpts claimed he forgot the names of longtime aides, including that of his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.\n\nDemocrats are now struggling to respond to criticism of why it took so long for Biden to step aside in favor of Kamala Harris, and questions about how long any cover-up of the president’s decline had been going on.\n\nThe release of these audio recordings and the upcoming publication of Original Sin will likely completely swamp any continued denials from Biden defenders regarding the president’s mental fitness more than a year before the 2024 election.\n\nIt could be the break the Democratic Party needs to move forward and start winning back trust from the American people.\n\nWith additional reporting from John Bowden in Washington, D.C.","summary":"Recordings of then-president’s interview with special counsel Robert Hur regarding misplaced classified documents released more than one year after transcripts","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-interview-leaked-recording-special-counsel-b2752746.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/16/9/18/BRITAIN-UN-CLIMATE-COP26-kbvbqcx2.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/a98vGseh-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:48:21","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":322166752,"title":"Biden audio release puts his age and health back in the spotlight","text":"Joe Biden’s time in public office is now behind him, but his age and mental acuity have become a litmus test for the next leaders in his party.Audio was published Friday from portions of interviews Biden gave to federal prosecutors in 2023, the latest in a stream of reports putting questions about Biden's health back in the spotlight. Months after former President Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, a new book alleges that White House aides covered up Biden's physical and mental decline.Several potential Democratic contenders for the 2028 nomination have been asked in recent days whether they believe Biden was declining in office or whether he should have sought reelection before a disastrous debate performance led to his withdrawal.Many Democrats would prefer to focus on Trump's second term. Trump has done his best to prevent that — mentioning Biden's name an average of six times per day during his first 100 days in office, according to an NBC News analysis — and Republicans have followed his lead, betting that voters frustrated by Trump's policy moves will still prefer him over memories of an unpopular presidency.In the race for Virginia governor, one of this year's highest-profile contests, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears is running a pair of digital ads tying Democrat Abigail Spanberger to Biden, with images of the two hugging and the former president calling her a friend.“The stench of Joe Biden still lingers on the Democratic Party,” Democratic strategist Sawyer Hackett said. “We have to do the hard work of fixing that, and I think that includes telling the truth, frankly, about when we were wrong.”Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told Politico this week that “there’s no doubt” that Biden, now 82, experienced cognitive decline as president.Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary, wasn’t nearly as blunt but still stopped short of defending Biden’s decision to run. He responded “maybe” when asked Tuesday whether the Democratic Party would have been better off if Biden hadn’t tried to run for a second term.“Right now, with the advantage of hindsight, I think most people would agree that that’s the case,” Buttigieg told reporters during a stop in Iowa.RELATED STORY | Trump's tax bill and Biden's health: 'Grounded' podcast host Maritsa Georgiou weighs inIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he didn't see signs of mental or physical decline in his meetings with Biden.“I saw him a few times,” he told CNN this week. “I certainly went to the White House whenever there was an opportunity for me to make the case for something for people in my state. And I never had the experience of anything other than a guy who brought to the table a lot of good ideas about how to solve problems.”The book “Original Sin,” by journalists Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios, revives a core controversy of Biden’s presidency: his decision to run for a second term despite voters, including Democrats, telling pollsters that he should not run again. Biden would have been 86 at the end of a second term had he won in November.A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to a request for comment.“We continue to await anything that shows where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or where national security was threatened or where he was unable to do his job,” the spokesperson has told many media outlets in response to the book.Late Friday, Axios published portions from audio recordings of Biden's six hours of interviews with prosecutors investigating his handling of classified documents after his term as vice president ended in 2017.The Biden administration had already released transcripts of the interviews, but the recordings shed light on special counsel Robert Hur's characterization of Biden as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and appeared to validate his claim that the then-president struggled to recall key dates, including the year his son Beau died of cancer in 2015.Biden and his aides pushed back aggressively against Hur's report, which they characterized as a partisan hit. Biden was at that time — early 2024 — still planning to run for a second term and fending off accusations that he was too old for another four years in the job.The recordings released by Axios include Biden's discussion of his son's death. His responses to some of the prosecutors' questions are punctuated by long pauses, and his lawyers at times stepped in to help him recall dates and timelines.Before he dropped his reelection bid last summer, Biden faced widespread doubts within his own party, even as Democratic leaders dismissed both a series of verbal flubs and Republican allegations about his declining acuity.In January 2022, just a year into Biden’s first term, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that only 48% of Democrats wanted him to seek reelection. That fell to 37% of Democrats in an AP-NORC poll conducted in February 2023. Three-quarters of Americans — and 69% of Democrats — said in August 2023 that they believed Biden was too old to serve as president for another four-year term.And shortly after his debate flop, nearly two-thirds of Democrats said Biden should withdraw from the race.Biden and former first lady Jill Biden appeared on ABC’s “The View” in a preemptive defense of his health and decision-making before the first excerpts of “Original Sin” were published.He said he’s responsible for Trump’s victory but attributed Harris’ loss, at least in part, to sexism and racism. He maintained that he would have won had he remained the Democratic nominee. Both Bidens rejected concerns about his cognitive decline.Patricia McEnerney, a 74-year-old Democrat in Goodyear, Arizona, said Biden should not have tried to run again.“I think it’s sad the way it ended,” she said.She compared him to Douglas MacArthur, the World War II and Korean War general famously dismissed by President Harry Truman.“I think he needs to stop giving interviews. I think that would help,” McEnerney said. “Like MacArthur said, generals just fade away.”Janet Stumps, a 66-year-old Democrat also from Goodyear, a Phoenix suburb, had a different view.“I don’t think it’s going to hurt the Democrats,” Stumps said. “I feel badly that he feels he has to defend himself. I don’t think he has to. Everybody ages. And the fact that he did what he did at his age, I think he should be commended for it.”Hackett, the Democratic strategist, predicted Biden won’t be a major factor in the 2026 midterms or the 2028 presidential primaries. But he said Democrats who want voters to trust them would be well-served “by telling the truth about the mistakes that our party made in the run-up to 2024.”“Those mistakes were largely driven by Joe Biden, and I think any Democrat not willing to say that is not really prepared to face the voters, who want the truth and they want authenticity,” Hackett said.Rick Wilson, a former GOP strategist who co-founded the anti-Trump group the Lincoln Project, said Republicans want to talk about Biden to avoid defending Trump. But he said the strategy is folly.Besides “political nerds,” he said, “no one else cares.”","summary":"Audio was published Friday from portions of interviews Biden gave to federal prosecutors in 2023, reviving concerns over the effects his age and health have had on the Democratic party.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/biden-audio-release-puts-his-age-and-health-back-in-the-spotlight","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8977a3f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5420x2846+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fbe%2Fc5c044c9491882d9d45944bee692%2Fap25104778394739.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:43:06","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":322164876,"title":"Joe Biden's troubling interview with special counsel Robert Hur is revealed in bombshell leaked audio","text":"Troubling newly released audio recordings of Joe Biden speaking to special counsel Robert Hur in 2023 lay bare the declining president's memory lapses and include one particularly disturbing moment when he struggles to recall when his son Beau died. \n\nWhile in office, Biden asserted executive privilege over the audio tapes of his interview with ex-special counsel Hur, who went on record describing Biden as 'elderly' and 'forgetful' and with 'diminished faculties'. \n\nAudio was published Friday from portions of interviews Biden gave to federal prosecutors in 2023, the latest in a stream of reports putting questions about Biden's health back in the spotlight \n\nA then-80-year old Biden fails to recall when his son Beau passed away and even when he left office as vice president under Barack Obama in an interview recorded seven months before the debate disaster against Donald Trump that effectively ended his re-election run.\n\nHur asserted during the investigation over the mishandling of classified evidence that jurors would see the president as 'a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.' \n\nThe audio shows Biden - who has long had a stutter - slurring his words, losing his thought process and not being able to recall important facts about his own life. \n\nAt one point, he can even be heard asking: 'Am I making any sense to you?' \n\nHur was appointed special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in January 2022 to investigate the president's handling of classified files based on a range of areas including Afghanistan.\n\nThe Biden administration had already released transcripts of the interviews taking place on October 8 and October 9, 2023 had already revealed that Biden's lawyer had to tell him what year his son Beau died of brain cancer and the president joked about the special counsel finding pictures of his wife in a swimsuit.\n\n'What was happening though was... What month did Beau die?' Biden mused at one point, adding, 'Oh God, May 30th.'\n\nA White House lawyer then chimed in with the year, 2015. \n\n'Was it 2015 he died?' Biden asked.\n\nHe leads into the confusion by suggesting Beau died in either 2017 or 2018, or even earlier than that, as he's discussing his 2008 presidential run. \n\nBiden asks Hur: 'This is what, 2017, 18, in that area?' \n\nWhen Hur affirms, Biden says: 'Remember, in this time frame, my son is … uh … would’ve been deployed or is dying and so … it was … and by the way there were still a lot of people at the time, when I got out of the Senate, that were encouraging me to run in this period - except the president.' \n\nBeau deployed between 2008 and 2009, at the beginning of Biden's first term as vice president. \n\nHur argued: 'I understood that my explanation about this case had to include rigorous, detailed, and thorough analysis.\n\n'In other words, I needed to show my work,' he will say. 'I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why.'\n\nHur added that he had to call Biden's memory into question and could not make a charging decision without assessing the 'President's state of mind'.\n\n'For that reason, I had to consider the President's memory and overall mental state, and how a jury likely would perceive his memory and mental state in a criminal trial,' he'll say.\n\n'Because these issues were important to my ultimate decision, I had to include a discussion of them in my report.\n\n'I did not sanitize my explanation. Nor did I disparage the President unfairly.\n\n'I explained to the Attorney General my decision and the reasons for it. That's what I was required to do'.\n\nHur's report, summarizing his probe of Biden's mishandling of classified documents, contains a multitude of examples of Biden's 'hazy' memory, including one point where Biden appeared to forget when his son Beau died.\n\nHur insisted that Biden was not fit for prosecution over his mishandling of documents because he was a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.' \n\nThe special counsel noted Biden had 'diminished faculties' and at points 'did not remember when he was vice president.' \n\nBiden and his aides pushed back aggressively against Hur's report, which they characterized as a partisan hit. \n\nThe president was at that time - early 2024 - still planning to run for a second term and fending off accusations that he was too old for another four years in the job.\n\nRepublicans jumped on the material, saying it proves Biden isn't fit to run the country.\n\nIt comes as a new book 'Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,' by Jake Tapper and CNN contributor Alex Thompson blows the lid off of the Democrat inability to admit Biden was failing. \n\nA synopsis for the book provided in a press release, meanwhile, described the liberal-led plot. It frames Biden, 'his family, and his senior aides' as 'so convinced that only he could beat Trump again, they lied to themselves, allies, and the public.'\n\n'What you will learn makes President Biden’s decision to run for reelection seem shockingly narcissistic, self-delusional, and reckless - a desperate bet that went bust,' Penguin stated while announcing the book.'\n\nThe publisher further framed the attempt - fueled by coverage that likely aired on legacy stations like ABC, NBC, and CBS - as 'part of a larger act of extended public deception that has few precedents.'\n\nTapper - who also moderated a 2020 debate between the then-candidates - added in a separate statement, in which he quoted Nobel Prize winning novelist Toni Morrison.\n\n‘\"If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.\"'\n\n'That’s what inspired this book,' the Lead With Jake Tapper host said. 'We wanted to know more about what we all just lived through. \n\n'More than 200 interviews later, Alex and I have a much better idea,' he said, talking up the book's sourcing.\n\n'And soon you all will too.'\n\nThe statement was delivered a little more than six months removed from the Atlanta debate that Tapper moderated, which led to accusations that CNN's lead Washington anchor took it easy on the president.\n\nOne segment in particular sparked such accusations, after Tapper appeared to cut the 81-year-old off in the midst of a rambling, nonsensical answer - one of several later cited after the Democrats' abrupt turnaround to opting for Kamala Harris.\n\n'We'd be able to wipe out his debt,' Biden said at the time of sums incurred by Trump-era tax cuts he said 'benefited the very wealthy.'\n\n'We'd be able to help make sure all those things we need to do: child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system,' he continued, stumbling at times over his words.\n\n'Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the... with the COVID, excuse me, with um, dealing with everything we have to with, uh,' he went on, languishing at this point.\n\n'Look, if we finally beat Medicare...'\n\nHe proceeded to fully trail off. \n\nThe silence that ensued - and the overall moment - went on to live in infamy, after Tapper's timely interjection.\n\n'Thank you President Biden - President Trump?'\n\nWithin days - thanks an array of other viral flubs during the make-or-break faceoff - Biden was bombarded with bipartisan calls to drop out.\n\nHe eventually did, albeit reluctantly, after several weeks.\n\nThat said, Tapper was one of few left-leaning hosts to call attention to Biden's seemingly waning health in the months leading up the debate, while talents like Thompson gave time to accounts from White House staffers insisting the president was fine.\n\nTapper, moreover, cut off Lara Trump during a tense interview that aired on State of the Union in 2020, during an conversation about the candidate's 'cognitive decline.'\n\nThe host - who was reportedly just denied a raise - had just aired a clip of Trump's daughter-in-law criticizing Biden's tendency to stutter, calling it evidence of his 'cognitive decline'.\n\n'I'm like \"Joe, can ya get it out, let's get the words out, Joe,\" You kinda feel bad for him,' she said - leading Tapper to chide her and point out previous reporting surrounding Biden overcoming a stutter over the years. \n\n'How do you think it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that?' he asked Trump sternly. 'I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline'. \n\nBiden and former first lady Jill Biden appeared on ABC´s \"The View\" in a preemptive defense of his health and decision-making before the first excerpts of \"Original Sin\" were published.\n\nHe said he´s responsible for Trump´s victory but attributed Harris´ loss, at least in part, to sexism and racism. \n\nHe maintained that he would have won had he remained the Democratic nominee.

Donald Trump deployed it in the Middle East this week and made more progress in a few days than conventional diplomacy has made in decades.\n\nBut then the Gulf States – ‘an amazing part of the world’ he told them on Thursday – are Trump’s kind of places.\n\nThey’re run by people awash in dosh. People prepared to sprinkle it generously in America’s direction, even on to Trump’s own lap (thanks, Qatar, for that $400million jumbo jet). People with opulent palaces adorned with lashings of gold and all manner of bling, surroundings in which Trump feels very much at home.\n\nPeople who know how to suck up to the President by massaging his self-referential image as the master of the deal. People, of course, who rule by dictatorship which, for Trump, is an asset. He has always had a soft spot for ‘strongman’ rulers (keen to be seen as one himself) and he’s never given human rights much thought.\n\nTrump also knows how to suck up to them. ‘I like you too much,’ he tells Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The ruling emir of Qatar and his family are ‘tall, handsome guys’. The new President of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, only recently a jihadist rebel leader with a $10million US bounty on his head, is ‘attractive’ and ‘tough’.\n\n‘You’re a magnificent man,’ he coos to Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates), as he cosies up to him in his massive royal palace. And, in its own way, this mutual admiration society delivers.\n\nTrump left Riyadh with $600billion-worth of deals covering artificial intelligence, health care, sport and military hardware. No doubt not all will ever see the light of day – the $142billion arms ‘deal’ is twice the Saudi annual defence budget. But given their scale Trump can afford some slippage, especially since he went on to Qatar and the UAE to mop up several hundred billions more in mega deals.\n\nWith Trump in the White House, America and the Gulf States now behave like old friends. The Saudis played country music star Lee Greenwood’s God Bless The USA as he took to the stage in Riyadh and walked off to the Village People’s YMCA – both signature tunes of Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nThe Crown Prince even drove him to dinner in a golf cart – and laid on a refrigerated mobile McDonald’s should the President still hanker, after a feast in the desert, for his favourite fast food.\n\nBut there was substance amid all the smiles and glad-handing – including a radical shift in policy towards the region which was not designed to please democratic ears. Previous visiting presidents talked of the need to foster democracy and human rights. Instead, Trump talked approvingly of ‘safe and orderly’ autocracies. He attacked previous American ‘interventionists’ for ‘wrecking’ the region – a clear critique of the neo-liberals who once dominated US foreign policy and championed the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n‘The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation builders,’ he opined. ‘The birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves’ – a pointed remark aimed at the failed ‘nation-building’ presidency of George W Bush, which delighted his hosts.\n\nBut the most significant development in Trump’s four-day tour was his announcement that he was lifting all sanctions on Syria to give its new government ‘a chance for greatness’. Trump had seen off hawks in his own administration and Washington’s countless foreign policy gurus, who urged caution. It is, of course, pregnant with risk – nobody really knows if Syria’s new president has given up his jihadist ways – but it’s a gamble worth taking.\n\nAt a stroke, it removes Syria from Iran’s orbit into which it had descended under the previous dictatorship of the odious Basher al Assad. Saudi’s Crown Prince and Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan had made it clear to Trump that there was no chance of a Syrian economic recovery until the crippling sanctions were lifted.\n\nWhen Syria’s new president met Trump in Riyadh to thank him, he also invited American companies to start investing in Syria. A huge portrait of Trump already adorns a billboard in downtown Damascus. Funny old world indeed.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed in Tehran. If Trump can so easily and quickly embrace a decades-long foe like Syria – pushing America’s foreign policy establishment aside in the process – then perhaps a deal with Washington can be struck after all. A fourth round of US-Iranian talks was held last weekend in Oman. Progress has been made but not on a major stumbling block: Iran is prepared to commit to ‘never’ developing nuclear weapons yet insists it must be allowed to continue enriching uranium beyond what civil nuclear power stations would need. US intelligence believes Iran has enriched enough uranium close to weapons’ grade levels, to make it only months away from a nuclear bomb.\n\nIran is in no position to hang tough. Israel has neutralised its two most important proxy terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah. Syria is lost. The Iranian economy is a shambles, crippled by rampant inflation and unemployment thanks to sanctions.\n\nPublic unrest simmers despite the regime’s brutal repression of any dissent. Even the hardline Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is said to see merit in coming to a deal with the US. He might be further inclined to do so now Trump has sown up all the Gulf States as close, reliable American allies.\n\nThe US President started his Gulf trip this week with a couple of notches already on his belt. After the US had hit 1,000 targets in the relentless bombing of Yemen, the Houthis agreed to stop attacking ships entering the Red Sea. America also managed to get Hamas to release its last American hostage.\n\nIronically, Israel is the loser in all this. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to to visit the White House after Trump’s re-election. He had already opined that Trump was the most pro-Israeli president ever to sit in the Oval Office. Yet now America seems to be doing its own thing in the Middle East.\n\nTrump ended his war on the Houthis despite their continued missile attacks on Israel, which was not informed in advance of the ceasefire. Trump’s people engaged directly with Hamas to release the last US citizen, against Israel’s wishes. He is now engaged in talks with Tehran in which Netanyahu is kept out of the loop. Israeli intelligence keeps Netanyahu informed on the sidelines. But there are no formal updates from the Trump administration. Israel fears American and Iran could come to an agreement without its involvement. Pointedly, Trump did not stop in Israel on this swing through the region this week. Indeed Trump had almost nothing to say about Israel during his trip.\n\nNetanyahu wants America to pressure Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, the greatest foreign policy achievement of Trump’s first term in which four Arab states recognised Israel.\n\nBut Trump told the Saudis to join the Accords ‘in your own time’, a recognition that for the Saudis there can be no new relationship with Israel while the war in Gaza drags on.\n\nThe Trump administration increasingly sees Israel’s determination to prolong the war in Gaza as inimical to America’s interests in the region. That should give Israel serious pause for thought.\n\nOf course, most of the fundamental problems that hold the region back remain to be resolved, despite Trump’s breakthroughs. Some of his achievements are superficial and probably transient. No over-arching strategy is being rolled out.\n\nBut nobody has such a strategy and in its absence there is much to be said for piecemeal progress. Just because the Israeli-Palestinian problem is intractable is no reason not make advances on other fronts.\n\nIt’s a simple proposition that foreign policy-makers in Washington, London and Paris have ignored for too long. But not deal-driven Trump, which is why he’s just blindsided them all with a signal success in the Gulf.","summary":"Call it diplomacy by bromance.

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 01:03 BST, 17 May 2025 | Updated: 01:32 BST, 17 May 2025\n\nFederal authorities found everything from drugs to baby oil in Sean 'Diddy' Combs Manhattan hotel room when he was arrested last September, suggesting he was planning one last hurrah of a 'freak-off' while he was still free. \n\nThe hip hop mogul's sex trafficking trial entered its fifth day, which included the final cross-examination of ex-girlfriend and accuser Cassie Ventura.\n\nSpecial Agent Yasin Binda testified later Friday to what the feds discovered in room 2115 at the Park Hyatt Hotel on September 16, 2024, the day Combs was taken into custody following an indictment from a grand jury.\n\nBinda - who works for Homeland Security Investigations' human trafficking division - participated in searches related to the Combs investigation and was involved in coordinating logistics for his arrest last September at a Manhattan hotel. \n\nBaby oil - which has become intrinsically linked to the hip-hop mogul during the investigation - was found alongside bags of Astroglide lubricant inside a closet. \n\n'This is one zip lock bag filled with Johnson's baby oil and you see another zip lock bag filled with Astroglide that was in the hallway closet,' she said of what she found in Diddy's room at the Park Hyde hotel on the night of the arrest. \n\nShe also told the court that police found 'mood lighting' as well as drugs including ketamine and MDMA in his room. \n\nThere was also pouches of pink stuff in a bottle of medication in the drawer which may have been pink cocaine.\n\nSpecial Agent Yasin Binda testified later Friday to what the feds discovered in room 2115 at the Park Hyatt Hotel on September 16, 2024, the day Combs was taken into custody following an indictment from a grand jury (pictured: Sean 'Diddy' Combs (left) and his defense team pass notes during the cross examination of Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura during Combs)\n\nCombs revealed in a 2018 interview with Vogue that his favorite party guest was Leonardo DiCaprio. Pictured: Combs (front center) and DiCaprio (back center) pose for pictures at Combs labor day party at his house in East Hampton, 1998\n\nDiddy's homes in L.A. and Miami were raided by Homeland Security as part of the sex trafficking probe on the day of his arrest \n\nThere was also a prescription for Klonopin found, written for the name 'Frank Black' which could be a pseudonym for Combs. \n\nDiddy had been in New York for 11 days before his arrest and prosecutors said he was 'waiting potentially for his arrest.'\n\nThe mogul looked stressed as agent Binda spoke and put his hand on the back of his head.\n\nOn Friday, Combs' attorneys concluded their cross-examination of his ex-girlfriend and main accuser Cassie Ventura.\n\nDiddy's attorney Anna Estevao resumed her cross examination with questions related to the March 2016 recording of Combs attacking Cassie at the elevator bank of a Los Angeles hotel, at one point garnering a hug from the rapper. \n\nIn it, Combs can be seen pulling Cassie to the floor, kicking her and dragging her into a hotel hallway.\n\nEstevao had Cassie read aloud a text message in which she complained that Combs was out of control from drugs and alcohol that day.\n\nIn the message, Cassie told Combs: 'I'm not a rag doll. I'm somebody's child.'\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs was spotted hanging out in Central Park the day before his arrest \n\nBaby oil - which has become intrinsically linked to the hip-hop mogul during the investigation - was found alongside bags of Astroglide lubricant inside a closet\n\nAs the trial against the mogul entered its fifth day, more celebrity names came up - including Chris Brown and mystery NFL player Cassie said she had an affair with.\n\nCassie says Combs was wary of her dating or giving attention to other men, even during breaks in their decade-long relationship.\n\nShe says the hip-hop star took her phone from her on numerous occasions, including when he found out she was dating a football player and when she suspected her of dancing with the singer Chris Brown.\n\nCassie didn't name the player and denied dancing with Brown.\n\n'He'd take my phone, my car, my watch when he was angry,' Cassie said of the music mogul.\n\nDiddy's team did their best to undermine the jury's sympathy for Cassie.\n\nThey exposed more text messages where she declared her love for the rapper, despite the abuse she says she suffered, and prompted her to admit that she neither 'hated' the rapper when the alleged abuse happened, nor does she 'hate him' today.\n\nShe confirmed that they continued their relationship even after he beat her, and even cheated on her now husband, Alex Fine, with Diddy.\n\nOn Friday, Combs' attorneys concluded their cross-examination of his ex-girlfriend and main accuser Cassie Ventura (pictured left)\n\nCassie Ventura leaves her home to head to the Diddy trial, Cassie was escorted down the stairs by a security guard with her pregnant belly on full show. It was the end of Ventura's testimony, which has to be stopped due to her being over eight months pregnant\n\nCassie, who is eight months pregnant, fought back with a calm and composed demeanor.\n\nShe said Diddy raped her, was an out-of-control drug addict, and someone she felt she couldn't leave.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian admonished the defense for continuing to file documents well into the night during the trial.\n\n'Letters have come in at 3am... I've come in early,' he said on Friday. 'This is a problem, we're running out of time to address issues'.\n\nDefense attorney Teny Geragos suggested to the judge Wednesday that they had to change today's gameplan on the fly.\n\nShe told Judge Subramanian that the questioning of Cassie by prosecutors over two days 'has gone much differently than I expected. ... So we are kind of changing our strategy.'\n\nAgnifilo later told the judge that questioning Cassie about infidelities is important. \n\n'Everybody knows that we are going to bring up infidelities, that we're going to want to bring up text messages of infidelities, and these text messages are often in colorful language,' he said.\n\nVentura said Diddy raped her, was an out-of-control drug addict, and someone she felt she couldn't leave\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs drags ex-girlfriend Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura in a still image from a March 5, 2016 surveillance video taken in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, where a towel-clad Combs threw Ventura to the ground and began to kick her, which was entered as evidence in New York sex trafficking trial\n\nSubramanian also complained to lawyers during the 10-minute break that Diddy Estevao's cross examination has been interrupted too often by disputes over evidence.\n\nThe judge has tried to clear the way for jurors to be brought in on time for what was hoped to be Cassie's last day on the witness stand.\n\nIn the video, Combs says he has 'God in my heart.' The judge watched it and then decided the argument was moot because the defense agreed not to show the video to the jury.\n\nOne item in dispute: A recording Combs made when he went to rehabilitation after a March 2016 attack on Cassie at the elevator bank of a Los Angeles hotel.\n\nProsecutor Emily Johnson said the video showed Combs 'wandering through nature' as he spoke of 'religion and God.' She described it as an effort by Combs' lawyers to seek sympathy from the jury.\n\nJurors heard a recording of a distressed Cassie screaming at a friend who said he had seen a video of her performing sex acts.\n\nIn the recording, made by Cassie in 2013, the man claimed to have the video on his phone. Cassie is heard pleading to see the video and then threatening to kill him if it became public.\n\n'I've never killed anyone in my life, but I will kill you,' Cassie told the man, punctuating her threats with profanity.\n\nJudge Arun Subramanian (pictured) expressed his frustration with both legal teams throughout the day\n\nCasandra 'Cassie' Ventura cries on the stand during redirect as Judge Arun Subramanian presides during Sean 'Diddy' Combs' sex trafficking trial\n\nCassie acknowledged in her testimony that Combs subsequently made efforts to keep the video private.\n\nShe later testified that she broke up with Diddy for good in August 2018 after she saw a photo of him with another woman he'd been dating for the last few years of their decade-long relationship.\n\n'I just don't trust anymore. That last shot put the nail in the coffin,' Casse texted Combs, referring to the photo of Combs with a woman identified in court as Gina.\n\n'I promised myself I wouldn't be with you anymore if you did that to me again,' Cassie wrote, telling Combs 'you lied to me' and 'she never went away.'\n\nSoon after, Cassie said, she started dating her now husband, Alex Fine.\n\nGina Huynh, who says she dated the music executive for five years, described in a resurfaced interview from 2019 a time at which he allegedly became violent with her.\n\nVentura refused to say she hated the mogul, even after everything they'd been through. \n\n'I don't hate him,' Cassie replied when asked if she hated Diddy\n\nCassie Ventura has admitted that she and Sean 'Diddy' Combs (pictured together in 2017) had sex with Jonathan Oddi (pictured), the porn star who opened fire on Donald Trump's Doral Miami resort \n\nWhen asked if she still had love for Combs, she replied: 'I have love for the past and what it was.'\n\nVentura also admitted that she and Sean 'Diddy' Combs had sexual relations with the gunman who opened fire on Donald Trump's Doral Miami resort.\n\nThe R&B singer was questioned about her relationship with Jonathan Oddi, a former porn star who fired shots at Trump's Doral Miami resort in 2018 and claimed during his arrest that he was a 'sex slave' for Combs.\n\nVentura told the court that she had met Oddi multiple times and even once feared that he had secretly recorded video of one of their 'freak-off' sex parties.\n\nShe testified that when she informed Combs about the video that he was concerned about it getting out and vowed to 'take care of it'.\n\nVentura said she 'didn't trust' Oddi and 'believes' their relationship ended after she caught him allegedly taping the sex session.\n\nOddi claimed during his arrest in 2018 that 'I had sex with Cassie and Sean' and that Combs had asked him to sign an NDA agreement. His allegations were immediately dismissed as farfetched conspiracy theories.\n\nBut Daily Mail exclusively revealed last week that Oddi signed a non-disclosure agreement with Combs in exchange for $5 million.\n\nOddi is pictured during his interview with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement following his arrest over the 2018 shooting\n\nAs the prosecution tried to add context to some of the exchanges seen by the jury during cross-examination, Cassie broke down describing Diddy's alleged abuse.\n\n'Worthless, just like dirt, like I didn't matter to him, like I was nothing, absolutely nothing,' she said of how he made her feel.\n\nCassie also said she canceled her tour after settling with Diddy becasue she was 'overwhelmed.'\n\n'I couldn't continue doing that at that point,' she told the court.\n\n'I'd give that money back if I never had to have Freak Offs,' Cassie said of the $20M settlement.\n\n'I would have agency and autonomy. I woldn't have had to work so hard to get it back.'\n\nCassie said she was initially open to the idea of engaging in the drug-fueled sex marathons because she wanted to make Combs happy and spend time with him, but she grew weary of them as the years went on.\n\n'I worried for my safety. I worried for my career,' she told jurors, and she worried Combs wouldn't love her anymore.\n\nAlex Fine, husband of Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura, walks outside the federal court\n\nDiddy at one point blew kisses to his mother Janice during Friday's proceedings\n\nShe ended her testimony announcing she expects to receive a $10 million settlement from the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles, where she was assaulted by Combs in 2016.\n\nSecurity camera footage aired last year on CNN shows the hip-hop mogul hitting and kicking Cassie, knocking her to the floor as she attempted to leave a 'freak off' sexual encounter at the hotel.\n\nCassie revealed the figure during questioning by Combs' lawyer in a phase of her testimony known as re-cross. She said the figure was an estimate and that the settlement was reached recently. She didn't disclose the nature of her claim against the hotel.\n\nCombs remained animated while watching the trial move along, blowing kisses to his mother and attempting to make eye contact with the jury.\n\nHe maintains that all the sex he's accused of forcing was in fact consensual - and that he is being unfairly vilified for things that happened willingly years ago.\n\nDawn Richard, a member of the Diddy-created group Danity Kane, is expected to testify next during his trial.\n\nRichard claims the disgraced Bad Boy mogul sexually assaulted her, deprived her of food and sleep and refused to pay her adequately. Her case is among dozens of claims filed against Combs in various states.\n\nDefense attorney Marc Agnifilo objected to Richard testifying.\n\nProsecutors say her testimony is relevant because she witnessed Diddy being violent towards Cassie.\n\nThey said 'Richard has flown across the country to be here today.'\n\nRichard gave evidence about seeing Diddy abuse Ventura 'often'.\n\nDiddy looked at Richards as she walked to the stand wearing a yellow on white checkered suit.\n\nShe was signed to Diddy's Bad Boy Records as part of Diddy Dirty Money and Dannity Kane, and testified that she saw Diddy attack his then-girlfriend in 2009.\n\n'He came down the stairs screaming, belligerent, asking where his food was and hit her over the head and hit and kicked her on the ground,' she said.\n\nRichards was asked if she saw Diddy abuse Ventura on any other occasions. She replied yes, 'often'.\n\nFellow former Danity Kane member Aubrey O'Day is also expected to take the stand.\n\nProsecutors allege that Combs used his fame and fortune to orchestrate an empire of exploitation, coercing women into abusive sex parties. \n\nHis lawyers argue that all the sexual acts were consensual, and although he could be violent, he never veered into sex trafficking and racketeering. \n\nCombs has pleaded not guilty to federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. His defense says that, although he could be violent, nothing he did amounted to a criminal enterprise. Combs insists all the sex was consensual.\n\nDiddyLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDiddy trial hears shocking claims about what he was planning to do the SAME day he was arrested\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Special Agent Yasin Binda testified to what the feds discovered in room 2115 at the Park Hyatt Hotel on September 16, 2024, the day Combs was taken into custody.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14721221/Diddy-trial-hears-shocking-claims-planning-day-arrested.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/16/23/98468531-0-image-m-13_1747435941357.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/09/18/7367917843361450172/1024x576_MP4_7367917843361450172.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:32:33","author":"Daniel Bates,Editor,Stephen M.

She said DHS will ”use every tool and resource available\" to do so because the “safety of American citizens comes first.”\n\nUnlike the troops deployed at the southern border, these National Guard units would come from the states and be used to assist in deportation operations in the interior of the country.\n\nHow the troops would be used may depend on whether they remain under state governors’ control. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, troops under federal orders cannot be used for domestic law enforcement, but units under state control can.\n\nThe addition of 20,000 National Guard troops would provide a huge boost to immigration enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the DHS agency responsible for immigration enforcement in the interior of the country, has a total staff of about 20,000 people spread across three divisions.\n\nEnforcement and Removals Operations, which is the division directly responsible for arresting and removing people who do not have the right to stay in the country, has a total staff of roughly 7,700 people, including a little over 6,000 law enforcement officers.\n\nIt was unclear why the request was made to the Defense Department and not to the states. The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.\n\nTrump has been carrying out a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration, issuing a series of executive orders designed to stop what he has called the “invasion” of the United States.\n\nThe U.S. already has as many as 10,000 troops under state and federal orders along the U.S.-Mexico border, including some who are now empowered to detain migrants they encounter along a newly militarized narrow strip of land adjacent to the border.\n\nSo far, these troops have largely been limited to providing airlift, bolstering the wall, surveillance and administrative support to free up border agents for arrests or detentions.\n\nAlong the newly militarized zone, troops have put up warning signs and accompanied border agents but left the detention of migrants crossing the border to other agencies.\n\nIn New Mexico, where the new militarized zone was first created, federal magistrate judges have started dismissing national security charges against migrants accused of crossing the southern U.S. border through the newly designated military zone, finding little evidence that they were aware of the zone.\n\nThe request for 20,000 troops was first reported by The New York Times.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

On Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to not build and expand the company's manufacturing operations in India.However, the government officials and suppliers alike say plans remain on track, adding that there has been no communication from Apple to halt or pause the diversification of contract supply away from China, as ET reported on Friday.“We believe that Apple could ramp up iPhone assembly production in India up to 60–65% by fall in a best-case scenario but could easily pivot back to a China-driven iPhone strategy depending on the tariff situation and deal negotiations,” Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities said in a report on Friday.“We see no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US in the near term given the upside-down cost model and Herculean-like supply chain logistics needed for such an initiative,” he wrote.To be sure, analysts expect more pressure from the Trump administration on Apple to build iPhone production in the US. However, any such move would result in an inflated iPhone price point of about $3,500, as per Wedbush Securities, making the proposition a non-starter for the Cupertino-based company.“Foxconn will have to ramp up its India capacity by at least five times,” said Neil Shah, vice president at Counterpoint Research, “with almost all iPhones for the US market likely to be produced in India, depending on how the sanctions negotiations go and if Apple plans to move to India completely.”The Taiwanese firm would want the production to take off from the Bengaluru plant as soon as possible as it is “critical for Foxconn to maintain a lion's share of iPhone production and PLI incentives,” Shah said.ET reported on March 31 that Foxconn was planning to produce up to 25–30 million iPhones at its India plants in 2025, more than double it made last year.The company had been conducting limited trials at its Bengaluru campus for about four months at the time, progressing swiftly towards the ‘revenue build’ phase where the phones were ready to be shipped.Broader PortfolioEarlier on May 1, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that for the June quarter, the company expects a majority of iPhones sold in the US to have India as their country of origin.Foxconn has operations across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana. Apart from the Bengaluru unit, the Taiwanese major has opened a new unit in Hyderabad to make AirPods, reflecting the widening of the Apple portfolio in India. This is in addition to its existing large-scale operations at its Sriperumbudur campus near Chennai where the bulk of iPhone assembly takes place currently.Apple’s other major supplier Tata Electronics, which has a facility in Hosur, makes enclosures for iPhones. The electronics manufacturing arm of the Tata Group has been scaling expeditiously and has acquired the Indian arms of other Apple suppliers — Wistron and Pegatron.“We believe Apple has put itself in a very hedged supply chain strategy heading into iPhone 17 production this Fall,” said Ives.“All of our work in the supply chain throughout Asia over the past few weeks gives us a high level of confidence that Cupertino's aggressive push towards India production has been a very smart strategic move given the uncertain tariff environment facing Apple in China,” he said.(With inputs from Suraksha P)","summary":"Final checks for June shipments are underway at Foxconn's Karnataka plant. A senior Apple executive from Cupertino also visited the Tata Electronics unit to see preparedness before fresh launches.

The audio provides a deeper look into how Biden struggled through his interviews with Hur, in which his lawyers had to provide assistance to the then-president in remembering key dates and keeping him on topic.\n\nBiden said his son, who died of brain cancer in 2015, passed away in 2017 or 2018. He also said that Trump was elected in 2017, but was corrected by one of his lawyers who said it was 2016. \n\nBiden then trailed off as he recounted his memoir Promise Me Dad.\n\nBiden’s lawyer at one point offered to give him a break, but the then-president refused, saying he wanted to just “get it done.”\n\nBiden’s spokesperson Kelly Scully said in a statement to the Washington Examiner that the audio recordings do not relay any new information. \n\n“The transcripts were released by the Biden administration more than a year ago,” Scully said in a statement. “The audio does nothing but confirm what is already public.”\n\nWhite House director of rapid response Jake Schneider reacted to the leak in a post on X.\n\n“We tried to tell you,” he wrote. “We literally spent years trying to tell you. Please stop acting shocked that Biden was senile, incompetent, and unfit for office.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers pressed former Attorney General Merrick Garland to release the audio tapes last year, but every House Democrat voted against the release of the recordings.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee slammed Democrats for hiding Biden’s condition in an X post.\n\n“Democrats hid the truth from the American people—Biden was unfit to remain President. They must answer for their lock step cover up,” the NRCC posted.\n\nNRCC deputy executive director Jack Pandol said that every Democrat who voted against the release of the tapes is “complicit in the cover up of the century” in an X post. \n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Friday that he was leaving it up to Attorney General Pam Bondi as to whether the government would release the tapes.\n\n“Look, everybody understands the condition of him,” Trump said. “I know people that are 89, 90, 92, 93 years old and are literally perfect.

Now both will soon be gone.","text":"Porter Airlines, which made a splashy debut here five months ago when it launched its nonstop flight to Toronto, is now ending the flight and exiting the San Diego airport as well.\n\nThe new flight, which started Dec. 10, will come to an end on June 25, an apparent casualty of declining demand for travel by Canadians to the U.S. in the wake of rising political tensions and controversy surrounding tariffs.\n\nA spokesperson for the airline acknowledged in an email to the Union-Tribune that the decision was fueled by a drop-off in travel demand. The airline had not issued a news release about the canceled route.\n\n“We never want to leave any market; however, since the launch last December, there’s been a change in the demand between Canada and the U.S. which is preventing the market from achieving our performance expectations,” the spokesperson said. “The market and passenger preferences will continue guiding us as we make network decisions.”\n\nThe soon-to-end flight also marks an end to Porter’s presence in San Diego, which was celebrated in December with a news conference attended by Porter Airlines President Kevin Jackson. The route debuted with four weekly fights. Its termination leaves just Air Canada providing nonstop service between San Diego and Toronto.\n\nThe decision comes at a time when the U.S. is seeing diminished travel from Canada, a trend that started to surface after President Donald Trump announced plans to levy steep tariffs on many nations, including Canada. Tensions between the two countries also began to escalate amid Trump’s talk of annexing Canada and making it the 51st state.\n\nIn its most recent earnings report, Air Canada, for example, noted that uncertainty surrounding tariffs and a weaker Canadian dollar “primarily impacted demand for air services on U.S. routes, notably to U.S. leisure destinations” during the first quarter. Traffic on Canada-U.S. routes, it said, fell 7% during the first quarter, and in March, it reported a 10% year-over-year decline in bookings for U.S. transborder flights for travel between April and September.\n\nOAG (Official Airline Guide) reported in March that airline passenger bookings on Canada-U.S. routes were down by 70% compared with the same period last year.\n\nPorter’s pullback in San Diego follows its move last year to expand its presence on the West Coast, beginning with flights out of San Francisco and Los Angeles. The airline also had planned to launch a nonstop flight between Las Vegas and Montreal but that, too, apparently has been canceled, according to news reports.\n\nWhile in San Diego international travel accounts for a relatively small proportion of overnight visitors — about 10% — compared to other large California cities, it still represents a significant infusion of dollars into the local tourism economy.\n\nOf those coming here from other countries, Canada accounts for the second largest volume of overnight visitors — 313,700 in 2024, behind Mexico with 501,600, according to the San Diego Tourism Authority.\n\nThe San Diego airport said Friday it could not comment on why Porter was ending the Toronto route but noted that it had seen a slight drop in passenger traffic on Air Canada’s Toronto to San Diego flight in April. Air Canada already had decided last year to suspend its second daily flight to Toronto, which it operated last summer, airport spokesperson Nicole Hall said. That suspension, at least for now, is supposed to be from April through September, Hall said.\n\n“This was not a recent schedule change. We will continue to monitor,” she said.\n\nDespite the loss of the Canadian flight, San Diego just celebrated its latest overseas nonstop to Amsterdam aboard KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and next month Copa airlines will debut its nonstop to Panama City.","summary":"A new nonstop flight to Toronto appears to be a casualty of recent tensions between the U.S. and Canada over tariffs.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/16/san-diego-got-a-new-nonstop-and-airline-5-months-ago-now-both-will-soon-be-gone/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SUT-L-PORTER-01.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:16:00","author":"Lori Weisberg","authors":["Lori Weisberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.031},{"id":322165298,"title":"Russia-Ukraine talks end after just 90 minutes with deal struck on major PoW exchange","text":"Kyiv and Moscow failed to agree to a ceasefire at their first direct talks in more than three years, with Russia presenting conditions that a Ukrainian source described as \"non-starters\". Under pressure from US President Donald Trump to end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War Two, delegates from the warring countries met for the first time since March 2022, the month after Russia invaded its neighbour. The talks in an Istanbul palace lasted well under two hours. Russia expressed satisfaction with the meeting and said it was ready to continue contacts. Both countries said they had agreed to trade 1,000 prisoners of war each in what would be the biggest such exchange yet. But Kyiv, which wants the West to impose tighter sanctions unless Moscow accepts a proposal from Trump for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately began rallying its allies for tougher action. As soon as the talks ended, Ukraine&apos;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a phone call with Trump and the leaders of France, Germany and Poland, his spokesperson said. Zelenskyy said robust sanctions should follow if Russia rejected a ceasefire. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the Russian position was \"clearly unacceptable\" and that European leaders, Ukraine and the US were \"closely aligning\" their responses. Russia&apos;s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, told reporters his team had \"taken note\" of the Ukrainians&apos; request for direct talks between Zelenskyy and President Vladimir Putin. Putin, after proposing the direct talks, had spurned a challenge from the Ukrainian leader to meet him personally in Istanbul . \"We have agreed that each side will present its vision of a possible future ceasefire and spell it out in detail. After such a vision has been presented, we believe it would be appropriate, as also agreed, to continue our negotiations,\" Medinsky said. Crediting efforts by Trump and other US officials, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin&apos;s investment envoy, said on X the talks produced \"good results...1. Largest POW exchange, 2. Ceasefire options that may work 3. Understanding of positions and continued dialogue.\" Zelenskyy said Kyiv&apos;s top priority was \"a full, unconditional and honest ceasefire... to stop the killing and create a solid basis for diplomacy\". With Russian forces in control of about a fifth of Ukraine, Putin has insisted Kyiv cede territory, abandon NATO membership ambitions and become a neutral country. Ukraine rejects these terms as tantamount to capitulation and is seeking guarantees of its future security from world powers, especially the United States. download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"The first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in over three years lasted less than two hours.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/russia-ukraine-talks-end-after-just-90-minutes-with-deal-struck-on-major-pow-exchange/28e4kq513","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/2fef5dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4527x2547+0+461/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F61%2Fdc2a12554795b99adaa1e16639d1%2F20250516168774162482-original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:07:32","author":"Sipa Usa / Ramil Sitdikov","authors":["Sipa Usa / Ramil Sitdikov"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.112},{"id":322165374,"title":"Azealia Banks blasts Donald Trump as 'embarrassing' after Taylor Swift diss","text":"The West Australian\n\nConfidential\n\nBest Short Film\n\nCompetitions\n\nCamera IconAzealia Banks Credit: BANG - Entertainment News\n\nAzealia Banks blasts Donald Trump as 'embarrassing' after Taylor Swift diss\n\nBANG - Entertainment NewsBang Showbiz\n\nMay 17, 2025 8:05AM\n\nYour Local News\n\nShare to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to InstagramShare to YoutubeEmail UsGet Digital Edition","summary":"Azealia Banks has defended Taylor Swift after US President Donald Trump blasted her on his Truth Social platform.","url":"https://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/azealia-banks-blasts-donald-trump-as-embarrassing-after-taylor-swift-diss-c-18722487","image":"https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-18722487/ac48a34d3e570640d5b5c582938cd8fa36baf0ff-16x9-x0y192w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:05:52","author":"BANG - Entertainment News","authors":["BANG - Entertainment News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.305},{"id":322162548,"title":"Silicon rally: can Malaysia reclaim its semiconductor glory?","text":"In the northern state of Kedah, Malaysia’s hopes of climbing the semiconductor value chain stretch across thousands of acres of flatlands, cleared and primed for industrial estates.\nInside cavernous production facilities, machines hum as they transform chemical compounds and electronic components – some as thin as a strand of hair – into the micro miracles powering smartphones, supercomputers and artificial intelligence (AI) that are coveted by militaries and tech firms alike.\nMalaysia may only be the fourth-largest economy in Southeast Asia, but it punches far above its weight in semiconductors, ranking as the world’s sixth-largest exporter.\nBetter known as chips, these fingernail-sized pieces of silicon are the beating heart of modern technology – and Malaysia refuses to be left behind in the race for dominance.\nThe country’s strength lies in combining multiple chips into central processing units and graphics processors, a multibillion-dollar industry that took root in 1972 when US tech giant Intel opened its first overseas facility in Penang.\n\nBut Malaysia’s early head start has eroded over the decades. Corruption and political instability dimmed its economic ambitions just as the global competition for semiconductor supremacy began to heat up. Thailand, Vietnam and most recently Indonesia have emerged as alternative regional hubs, threatening Malaysia’s position.\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is determined to reverse this trend. His vision? To regain Malaysia’s primacy in Southeast Asia and then break into the lucrative world of front-end chip manufacturing and design. To achieve this, his government has pledged to slash red tape, offer cheap land and provide power and water subsidies to attract semiconductor investors.\nPoor but land-rich Kedah, long overshadowed by its industrial neighbour Penang, is central to Anwar’s plan to revitalise “Silicon Malaysia”.\nBut US President Donald Trump’s threatened tariff on Malaysian exports – set to rise to 24 per cent from early July – has created uncertainty, with mixed messages over levies for the semiconductor and electronics sectors.\nMost companies are now preparing for the worst\nWong Siew Hai, Malaysian Semiconductor Industry Association on US tariffs\nOn Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce scrapped an “AI diffusion rule” introduced by former president Joe Biden that was set to take effect on Thursday and would have limited access to US-made AI chips to many countries, including US allies.\nThis came a day after the US and China had agreed to a 90-day pause on their tariff war, causing markets to rally and inflating the value of the world’s largest tech firms by more than US$800 billion, according to estimates by US news outlet CNBC.\nObservers expect the Trump administration to replace Biden’s diffusion rule with separate agreements negotiated directly with individual countries – while maintaining stringent controls on shipments to China – creating further headaches.\n“Most companies are now preparing for the worst,” said Wong Siew Hai, president of the Malaysian Semiconductor Industry Association.\n“The tariffs will increase costs and very likely inflation. Global demand will slow down. When global demand slows down, everybody is affected.”\nA recent survey of association members found that most expected US trade policy to hurt profitability and drive down investments, at least over the next year.\nStill, with competing Southeast Asian chip hubs facing similar tariff pressures, Malaysia might just need to ensure it loses less to get ahead.\n\n“I expect there will be more exemptions in the coming months as the impact of tariffs begin to hit American consumers,” said Cassey Lee, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and coordinator of its regional economic studies programme. “They will progressively try to reduce the impact,” he said, citing the tariff carve-outs for tech that Trump announced last month.\n“Carefully managing the expectations of foreign investors at the start of the conversation would go a long way” towards setting minds at ease, added Adib Zalkapli, managing director of geopolitical and public affairs firm Viewfinder Global Affairs.\nAnalysts say the challenge for Malaysia will be maintaining momentum, scaling up sustainably and capitalising on its existing ecosystem despite global headwinds.\n“When the dust settles” on the tariff wars, Malaysia needs to have moved up the value chain so it is “the country that stands out in terms of tech advancements, capabilities, training of personnel”, Wong said.\n“We need to do it now, so we become the country of choice for future tech and expansion.”\n\nKedah calling\nIn Kulim, Kedah’s westernmost district bordering Penang, the groundwork for future success is already being laid.\nAustrian tech giant AT&S has invested around US$1.2 billion in a state-of-the-art facility at Kulim Hi-Tech Park, where its seven-storey production base manufactures high-end substrates – a key component in chip fabrication.\nLaunched in April, the facility is expected to reach full operational capacity next year, creating 3,000 jobs. AT&S is banking on Malaysia’s expanding ecosystem of data centres, which store the vast quantities of information required for AI.\n“The government … said they want to attract data centres, which is good for us. They also said they want to train 60,000 engineers, which will help us as well,” said Yap Suan See, AT&S’ senior vice-president and managing director for Malaysia.\n\nThe Kulim facility is AT&S’ newest factory outside China, a strategic move to hedge against risks from Washington’s trade war with Beijing. Initially set up to supply US chipmaker AMD’s Penang facilities, the Kulim plant is now being positioned as a hub for customer and product expansion in AI and high-performance computing.\n“It has the right infrastructure, it’s so near the Penang microelectronics hotspot, it has the staffing, labour, subsidies,” Yap told This Week in Asia. “It has the ecosystem.”\nThe company says it expects to sign two additional customers by the end of this year and two more by 2027 – all players in the AI space that are mostly already set up in Malaysia.\nBut challenges to future success remain. Investors often bemoan Malaysia’s labyrinthine bureaucracy and the lack of clear communication between federal and state agencies.\n“Support we get, yes, but you always wish it could be faster,” said Ingolf Schroeder, AT&S’ executive vice-president for microelectronics.\n\nBottlenecks aside, Malaysia has been aggressively securing itself a place near the top of the global semiconductor pecking order. The government has announced grand plans to attract at least 500 billion ringgit (US$116 billion) in semiconductor investments, and more than 50 data centres, including those of Chinese tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba – owner of the South China Morning Post – and US chipmaker Nvidia now operate in the country.\nIt has not all been smooth sailing, however. Intel has delayed a 7-billion-ringgit (US$1.6 billion) expansion of its Penang operations due to slowing sales and mounting losses, while Austrian-German sensor manufacturer Osram pulled out of a 2-billion-ringgit factory deal last year after losing a key client.\nMeanwhile, regional rivals Thailand and Vietnam have ramped up the pressure, attracting billions of dollars in investments from major players such as Intel, Infineon, Samsung and Sony.\nBut Malaysia is fighting back. In March, the government signed a US$250 million, 10-year deal with UK semiconductor design firm Arm Holdings, which creates the technology behind nearly all of the world’s smartphones – promising direct access to cutting-edge designs and technology for Malaysian firms.\n“These chips will be designed, manufactured, tested and assembled here, and sold to the rest of the world,” said Prime Minister Anwar at the time, describing the initiative as the dawn of Malaysia’s “second semiconductor wave”.\n\nIndustry uncertainty\nAs chip factories and data centres mushroom across the Malaysian peninsula’s west coast, however, clouds of uncertainty are also gathering over the semiconductor sector.\nIn March, authorities in Singapore and the US launched investigations into allegations that advanced Nvidia chips had been illegally routed to China through Malaysia. Washington has since doubled down on export curbs, heavily restricting the sale of Nvidia’s H2O AI chips to China, citing national security concerns.\nIn response to US pressure, Malaysia has vowed to tighten regulations, pledging to track semiconductor shipments more closely and treat violations of export rules as a “serious offence”.\nBut the geopolitical chessboard continues to shift, with US lawmakers drafting legislation to clamp down on smuggling and prevent American chips from fuelling China’s military and AI ambitions.\nCompanies like Apple, which has pledged US$500 billion to relocate some manufacturing back to the US, are already aligning with Washington’s demands.\n“Deadlines have often served more as strategic pressure points than immovable endpoints for Trump,” said Bryan DeAngelis, partner and head of the Washington office for global risk and analytics consultancy Penta Group. “Apple is a high-profile example, but the impact of Trump’s policies will be broader and affect many industries.”\nTariffs and trade wars will continue to be a concern for the industry, but AT&S’ Schroeder sees chip demand being fuelled by the breakneck growth of AI for years to come.\n“If you believe that AI is going to be the driver of growth, most probably there will not be a downside [from tariffs],” he said.","summary":"Outpacing regional chip rivals won’t be easy for ‘Silicon Malaysia’, but insiders say it has the subsidies, labour and will to succeed.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3310693/silicon-rally-can-malaysia-reclaim-its-semiconductor-glory","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/16/26068162-9eaa-4454-8a9c-d992af60ac51_c2d3d65d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-17 00:00:15","author":"Joseph Sipalan","authors":["Joseph Sipalan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":322161550,"title":"As deadly Israeli strikes pound Gaza, Trump says ‘people are starving’","text":"Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed more than 250 people since Thursday morning, local health authorities said on Friday (Gaza time), one of the deadliest phases of bombardment since a truce collapsed in March, with a new ground offensive expected soon.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who ended a Middle East tour on Friday with no apparent progress towards a new ceasefire as Israel steps up its military campaign, acknowledged Gaza’s growing hunger crisis and the need for aid deliveries.\n\n“We have to also help out the Palestinians.

And in our editorial team are several, award-winning reporters, correspondents who work undercover churning in great stories.\n\nWhat challenges did you encounter initially as a journalist relocating to the US from Nigeria?\n\nInitially, it was difficult to break even, bearing in mind that the Western media is saturated for decades with negative news about Nigeria and Africa. And more testy because we hardly find any Nigerian or African newspaper fully registered by the Government of the United States. After our registration by the Government of the State of Texas, it took us a period of six years to break even, challenge the Western press on its wrong news reportage on Nigeria and Africa.\n\n What differences have you noticed in media practice in Nigeria and the US?\n\nIn the United States, journalists are given training on the latest media tools, technology, data analysis and Google analytics to be able to excel in covering news stories, conducting exclusive interviews and going live on news publication without a delay. Also, these American journalists regularly pitch for story ideas, well paid to cover stories with good salary payment. They are given quality health insurance coverage. Freedom of the press is guaranteed as well.\n\nThe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of the press, meaning the government cannot restrict what the press publishes or the public can access. This freedom is a cornerstone of a democratic society, enabling the public to be informed and hold their leaders accountable. It also allows for a diverse marketplace of ideas and encourages public discourse.\n\nIn Nigeria, most journalists struggle on their own to go after news stories since they are hardly paid good salaries or Basic Transport Allowance as and when due. They risk their lives in conducting interviews under the most inhuman conditions. The unlucky ones lose their lives, yet have no health insurance coverage. Most journalists are deficient in the use of modern media technological tools since their employers don’t make such press tools accessible. An irony of the situation is such that most stories covered and reported by these Nigerian journalists are hailed by a section of the Western media and re-published.\n\nWhat would you regard as the Nigerian media industry’s impact in America?\n\nI must confess that, with the regular exclusive interviews, human angle and feature stories being done by the American editors of our news medium in North America, we have raised the flag of the Nigerian press with pride with our stories centred around the good, bad and ugly sides of the Nigerian community in the United States. We have consistently countered false news on Nigeria by members of the Western media. Consistency. Honesty. Facts are the keys we have used in ensuring the power and style of journalism of the Nigerian media is positively felt in America.\n\nPart of your job is coordinating all the branches of the publication around the world for your company. How challenging is this?\n\nIt is very challenging. I must confess that, since relocation to the United States as America Foreign Bureau Chief at first, I have had to be on many conference calls with other line editors and the Board of Directors of the company where we had to debate several news story ideas, media projects, deadlines and ensure we bring everything to completion. And now, after being promoted the Executive Editor and Group Managing Editor of this publication, coordinating this news medium’s branches around the world is surely not a small feat.\n\nI am confident that, with our team of other editorial leadership led by our Group Managing Editor, Samson Shoaga, who had been editorially coordinating the Nigerian Headquarters, Zambia, UAE offices before now, we will certainly take Nigeria and Africa journalism to the end of the world. Journalism is my life, and I derive maximum satisfaction from the profession.\n\nCould you briefly walk us through your media adventure?\n\nI started journalism as a society reporter close to three decades ago with the now rested TODAY’S Choice Magazine owned by Coker Onita. I worked with the then National Interest Newspaper. I worked as a reporter in the defunct TEMPO Weekly Magazine, published by ICNL, under Babafemi Ojudu, Bayo Onanuga and Kunle Ajibade.\n\nI was hired as a Society Writer in the then INSIDER Weekly Magazine, under the editorial leadership of Osa director. I worked for the WEEK Magazine as its Society Editor in its Adeniyi Jones office, Ikeja, Lagos. I was the Head, Investigations & Crime for National Daily Newspaper in Ikeja, Lagos. Under then Victor Ogenne as the Editor, I was the Society Editor for The Source Magazine in Opebi, Ikeja, Lagos covering Back-of-the-Book. Also, I was hired as a Deputy Features Editor of the now rested National LIFE Newspaper under Louis Odion. Later, I was employed in Sunday Vanguard Newspaper as a Society Writer under the editorial leadership of Kunle Oyatomi. I worked side-by-side with my good friends Ogbonna Amadi, Frank Meke and many others.\n\nI was hired as the Nigerian Editor of FOCUS Magazine, a news magazine in London, owned by Dupe Ashama. I worked as the Arts & Features Editor for AFRICA Today Magazine in Nigeria. In the course of my career, CNN African Journalist award winner, Janet Mba Afolabi, employed me as then Editor of The Scroll Magazine. Later, I became the Editor-in-Chief of African Mail International Magazine, an all-gloss, monthly publication in Ogba, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nUnder Billy Adedamola and Mayor Akinpelu, I was employed as the first Foreign Correspondent of the now rested FAME Weekly Magazine in Ghana, Foreign Bureau Chief, in South Africa. While in Kaneshi, Accra, Ghana; to pay my bills; I was hired as the first Nigerian working for Daily Graphic Newspaper – the biggest national newspaper in Ghana as a Foreign Correspondent.\n\nWhat’s the secret of Naija Standard newspaper’s progress? \n\nThe editorial team of our news medium ensured that all our news contents are based on facts. We don’t do blackmail. We are not biased in our news reportage as we balance all sides of our news content, with a right of reply for anyone who still has other issues to say. We ensure we diversify in our news gathering, brainstorm on story ideas in Nigeria and across the world, especially on stories regarding Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nWhat’s your plans for African celebrity journalism and expansion for Naija Standard in Europe and the world?\n\nNaija Standard has maintained its African society celebrity journalism in the United States in the last 15 years by ensuring top black American/African celebrities who are leaders in various sectors of the United States economy grace the lead, cover, news stories of our publication. Our next plan is to take African celebrity journalism to the highest level in the world. Remember, America is the oldest democracy in the world, and journalism here in the United States is the highest form of news media practice. We intend to re-introduce special publications in French, Spanish, Arabic editions side-by-side with our English edition in the next couple of months. This will involve special interviews with African celebrities, black American employers and Spanish public officials. Plans are on presently to have additional editorial offices in Austria, Canada and France.\n\nInterestingly, you have just been licensed as a Certified Human Resources Consultant by the U.S. Institute of Diplomacy & Human Rights in Washington DC, USA. What does this mean to you? \n\nIt means that every news item I cover, I should do so from the angle of human rights, ensuring that we defend the rights of the oppressed, the masses and people of Nigeria, either back home or in the Diaspora. Don’t forget: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights, in its 30 articles. And a Certified Global Human Rights Consultant in the United States, I promise to always be there for the less privileged in the society, fight against any form of injustice in any form whatsoever.\n\nHave your media house also tapped into the Black community in the US?\n\nYes, we have a good relationship with the Hollywood industry, American Press and the black community in the United States. I am also the thrice elected National President of the renowned Nigerian-American Press Association, NAPA, in Houston, Texas. NAPA is the foremost convergence of 50 online editors representing mainstream media establishment in the United States and Nigeria.\n\nYour paper at a time published in English and Spanish languages, which lasted for 3 years. How was the experience like and why did it stop?\n\nThe experience was exciting and great because we remain the first Nigeria newspaper publication in the United States to have ever published in English and Espanol languages.\n\nWe stopped briefly since we further delved into publications in French. As such, having the French edition really opened our eyes into the opportunities of tapping into that community. It’s worth it. That is Nigerian journalism to the highest level.\n\nBeing a Nigerian-owned media outfit abroad, do you feel discriminated against?\n\nNot at all since our news constituents are Nigerians in the Diaspora, the black American community and Nigerians at home. We have our eyes set on the price. We are focused.\n\nTell us about your most unforgettable experiences while working as a journalist in Nigeria\n\nI have several evergreen experiences as a journalist in Nigeria. Some of them: when I reported a news story of a retired Naval officer for his injustice on a helpless woman and her children in Abuja. That story got me a nomination and a United Nations Ambassadorial Media Award. I conducted the last interview with the Highlife Icon, Fatai Rolling Dollar few days before his death.\n\nI conducted several interviews with the Ozziddi King, late Sonny Okosuns. And I was the Director of Media and Publicity during his burial ceremony. I did report on many cover news stories that became hot national topics and aided the government in power then in parts of their policy formulation.\n\nDid you experience a situation in Nigeria that made you say you wouldn’t like to be a journalist again? What were your low moments as a Nigerian journalist?\n\nI had no single low moment in Nigerian journalism because journalism is my life. After God Almighty, I breathe journalism. This profession opens doors for you to sit with presidents, prime ministers and global leaders around the world.\n\nWhat can Nigerian celebrity and entertainment publications learn from their American counterparts?\n\nIntegrity. Honesty. Society Journalism. High Networking.\n\nHow was it like growing up? Were you born with a silver spoon? \n\nI grew up in an average Nigerian family of seven – four boys and three girls. I thank the Lord we are all believers in the power and salvation of Jesus Christ. And everyone is doing well to the glory of God. I was not born with a silver spoon. My parents were hardworking people. My mother, a famous entrepreneur in Ogun State, and father a retired police officer in Edo State.\n\nWhat prompted you to choose the journalism profession? Who were your early influences?\n\nPassion to correct the ills in the society, fight for the masses in the society brought me to journalism. Not once did I regret being a journalist. The likes of Dele Giwa, Ray Ekpu, Kayode Soyinka; Babafemi Ojudu, Eric Osagie; Mike Awoyinfa, Louis Odion, Mayor Akinpelu, Kunle Bakare; Femi Akintunde-Johnson, FAJ, current Editor of Daily Graphic Theophilus Yartey; Ken Aseka, a versatile multimedia journalist and editor-in-chief of Kenya Times are my media heroes.\n\nYou are also an author of three books, all written in America. One of the books is translated into French, Spanish and Arabic languages. Tell us about your writing journey?\n\nI believe when you are determined, there is no height you cannot attain, no matter the circumstance. In the course of my journalism here in the United States, I have written 3 books, published in New York that were sold out on Amazon. These books were published in French, Spanish and Arabic languages.\n\nThese books are: Fearless Reportage of Nigeria’s 2015 Election: Nigerian Journalism in USA, Democracy and Electorate’ Expectation; Version Francaise Reportages Courageux 2025 Elections du Nigeria: Le Journalisme Nigerian aux Etats-Unis, la Democratise et l’ Attente de Corps; and Using Cybersecurity Technology to Expose Fake News, Stop Hackers through Investigative.\n\nMy writing journey began from Nigeria due to my desire in documenting history. And I never looked back afterwards.\n\nTell us about your encounter with American President, Donald Trump, during his first tenure. And what did you take away from that experience?\n\nAfter one of my books in the United States was published, I embarked on an American media tour in 20 states. At a time, I used UPS to courier my book on using the media tools to fight cybercrimes to The White House in Washington DC during the first time of President Donald Trump in office. About three months later, I received a sealed UPS letter from The White House signed in the handwriting of President Trump, heaping praises on the book I wrote, pouring encomium on my practice of investigative journalism and assured me that his administration would continue to support the media in all ramifications.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s second coming has been hard on African immigrants and countries. What’s your advice to young Nigerians in pursuit of the American dream?\n\nObey all laws. Be honest. Steer clear from troubles. Don’t join bad friends. Be focused and have your priorities set straight and be prayerful at all times.","summary":"By Henry Akubuiro With close to three decades of media practice in Nigeria and the United States, George Elijah Otumu has made a name for himself in the media industry.

Original Sin by Axios’ Alex Thompson and CNN’s Jake Tapper will be released on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the two three-hour sessions with Hur and his co-counsel Marc Kricknaum, Biden’s attorneys had to remind him of the year his son Beau died and the year that Donald Trump was elected president for the first time — 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nWhere the recordings add a new dimension to what is already known from the transcripts is the length of pauses and the slowly unfolding nature of some answers. Further emphasizing these silent moments from the president is the sound of a ticking clock in the background.\n\nNevertheless, Biden remains engaged despite memory lapses. At times, Axios notes, he cracks jokes and makes humorous asides, and throughout, he “sounded more like a nostalgic, grandfatherly storyteller than a potential defendant who could be accused of hoarding secret papers.”\n\nPerhaps the upshot of the basis of the interview was that he had little recollection as to how or why he came to have classified documents in his possession after his two terms as vice president to President Barack Obama.\n\nMore follows...","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/leaked-audio-reveals-extent-biden-234441960.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/e90f9e44c6db63f682ae7fc16cb82e2d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:57:34","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.008},{"id":322163550,"title":"'It will be a no forever': Former Trump Cabinet official takes firm stance against him","text":"Rep.

That ruling was a procedural hold, not a final ruling, and did not weigh in on the legality of the deportations.\n\nIn the days following the emergency injunction, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal, reasoning that the detainees had not given the district court enough time to respond before escalating the case.\n\nThis prompted the process for the case to return before the Supreme Court as the detainees asked the high court to treat their emergency application as a formal petition for the court to hear the case, review the lower court's rulings and to settle the constitutional questions raised by their deportations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has vacated the Fifth Circuit court's dismissal and sent it back to the lower court for a proper legal review, preventing the government from further deportations until the case can be properly decided.\n\nThe high court clarified that, as on April 19, its ruling does not address the underlying merits of each side regarding removals under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\n\"We recognize the significance of the Government's national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution,\" the Supreme Court wrote. \"In light of the foregoing, lower courts should address AEA cases expeditiously.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito dissented, joined by Clarence Thomas, arguing that the Supreme Court never had the legal authority to step in because there was no valid appeal since the district court never actually denied the temporary restraining order request.","summary":"U.S. Supreme Court rules administration must give Venezuelans more time to challenge deportation under Alien Enemies Act.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/16/scotus-alien-enemies-act-trump-maintains-block-2025/1771747431210/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1771747431210/2025/upi/fdcdd64ed7b0400df2d96187efd7846b/v1.2/Supreme-Court-blocks-Trump-from-using-Alien-Enemies-Act-for-deportations.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:45:49","author":"Adam Schrader","authors":["Adam Schrader"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":322162164,"title":"Musicians Union Slams Trump’s Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen Tantrum","text":"The American Federation of Musicians (AFM) is standing by its artists.

A small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers, insisting on steeper cuts to Medicaid and President Joe Biden's green energy tax breaks, joined all Democrats in opposing it. \n\nMore Like This\n\nPublished on May 17, 2025","summary":"This makes Moody’s the third major credit rating agency to lower the federal government’s rating, following S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023.","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/moodys-strips-us-of-top-credit-rating-amid-soaring-debt-crisis/article69585426.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1h7n5u/article67231511.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/BL25_Think_US_dollar_debt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:35:54","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":322156388,"title":"Donald Trump’s goes on wild rants against Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen","text":"The US President – currently on his way home from a whirlwind diplomatic trip to the Middle East – has repeatedly targeted Swift since 2020, when she endorsed former President Joe Biden in that year’s presidential race. \n\nLast September, when the wildly-successful musician again endorsed his opponent – this time former Vice President Kamala Harris – Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post: “I hate Taylor Swift.” \n\nAnd on Friday, the President made it clear he’s still nursing a grudge against the wealthiest female musician on the planet when he took to the platform – seemingly unprompted and without further elaboration – and wrote: “Has anyone noticed that, since I said ‘I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT’, she’s no longer ‘HOT’?”. \n\nBar her endorsements of Mr Biden and Ms Harris, Swift has publicly ignored the 78-year-old’s relentless swipes. \n\nMr Trump followed his shot at Swift with a lengthy tirade against Bruce Springsteen. \n\nIn another Truth Social post, the President said the music legend was a “dried out prune” who was “dumb as a rock”, seemingly in retaliation to Springsteen criticising the leader – without naming him – at a concert in Manchester earlier this week.\n\n“In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” Springsteen told fans during his ‘Land of Hope and Dreams’ tour. \n\n“Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.” \n\n“I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,” Mr Trump wrote, before really letting rip. \n\n“Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics, and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy – Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our country.\n\n“If I wasn’t elected, it would have been GONE by now!

Sadly, they have been underfunded for years, while the need for their services has exploded.\n\nState lawmakers should actively support the Alzheimer’s Association’s request for a $2.2 million increase for the CADCs.

Now accurately reporting on the griftiness of his eldest failson, Donald Trump Jr., puts the media in the crosshairs. \n\nOn Monday, Business Insider published a piece about how much cash Don Jr. is stacking since Dad became president again. It’s not a particularly sensationalized piece, but it is a detailed look at how Don Jr.’s lot in life continues to improve. \n\nThe piece is mostly about his investment startup, 1789 Capital, was languishing as a tiny venture capital firm before Don Jr. joined as a partner, but now it’s blowing up, investing millions in Elon Musk’s companies and in defense startups that just happen to be eligible for federal Defense Department contracts. \n\nPresumably, just noting that Don Jr. is getting even richer from his connections to his father isn’t what caused so much consternation here. The administration is gleefully flouting conflict-of-interest laws, and Trump the elder is perfectly comfortable bragging about how you can buy access to him if you’re rich enough. But the piece’s real sin appears to be that it compares Don. Jr. with former President Joe Biden’s younger son, Hunter Biden, saying that Junior is doing precisely what Republicans accused Hunter Biden of: trading on his father’s name and position. \n\nIn reality, there’s not much of a comparison. \n\nAt the very worst, Hunter Biden’s misdeeds consisted of asking the federal government for help getting an energy contract in Italy on behalf of the Ukrainian company Burisma when his father was vice president. He also took a board seat at a Chinese private equity firm around that same time. The most explosive allegations about corruption in the Biden family proved to be a lie told by FBI informant Alexander Smirnov, who is now in prison for it, but—surprise, surprise—the Trump administration wants him released. \n\nAnd let’s not forget that when Joe Biden was president, he did not try to stop the Department of Justice from prosecuting Hunter over tax evasion and a gun charge, though he did pardon him shortly before leaving office. \n\nAltogether, that’s little compared with the amount of money Don Jr. has managed to acquire by implicitly or explicitly saying that if you give him money, you can talk to his dad. \n\nThe comparison so enraged the Trump administration that it’s making noises about opening a federal investigation into Business Insider’s parent company, Axel Springer. A frantic Breitbart News article waxed rhapsodic about how the BI piece “backfire[d]” because it now has drawn “massive federal attention onto its foreign ownership structure and lobbying activities before the federal government.” Breitbart even tried to give the so-called scandal a catchy name: “German Influence Operation.” \n\nIt’s laughable that the Trump administration has only just learned that Business Insider, along with Politico, is owned by a German company, Axel Springer. When Axel Springer bought Politico, it was a billion-dollar deal, and media coverage rarely failed to mention the company was based in Germany. But now everyone on the right has to pretend this was a secret, that the Germans were slipping in under the cover of night to gobble up American media companies to push their foreign agenda. \n\nTargeting Axel Springer is even more laughable given that the company has a history of pushing right-wing causes. Its CEO, Mathias Döpfner, is known in Germany for his anti-woke and libertarian views. Even before buying Politico, Döpfner was chummy with Ric Grenell, Trump’s ambassador to Germany during his first term. \n\nBut the type of mobster-style fealty that Trump demands is absolute. So even though Axel Springer is obviously not using the American media to push some sort of anti-Trump, pro-German, pro-woke socialism or whatever, even one negative article about the family is too much. \n\nAn unnamed White House official told Breitbart that the piece about Don Jr. could be considered “illegal foreign political meddling.” Perhaps that statement says more than the official realized: that writing negatively about the president’s son is somehow “illegal” and somehow meddles with American politics. \n\nThat’s not based on showing that BI’s piece was inaccurate. It’s saying that the mere act of talking bad about Don Jr. is criminal, and that doing so interferes with America’s political goals. Junior’s business interests must be protected, for freedom’s sake or something. \n\nThere are things, of course, that do raise the specter of illegal foreign political meddling, such as letting the Qatari government give Trump a $400 million plane. Or Don Jr. reportedly dangling access to himself—and, by implication, the president—as a way to get people to buy Trump condos in India. Indeed, either Junior or Eric Trump, one of the president’s other nepo babies, is apparently set to return to India next month to oversee the development of two Trump-branded towers. \n\nMeanwhile, their father, the president, has taken aim at media outlets, and some of them are not covering themselves in glory here. ABC News kicked things off before Trump even took office, coughing up $15 million to settle the defamation lawsuit he had brought against the network. He barred the Associated Press from access to White House events because they refused to change how they referred to the Gulf of Mexico, disinterested in adopting Trump’s dumb, jingoistic renaming. He issued an executive order that seeks to defund public media, which is not a thing he can do via executive order, but it’s the thought that counts. \n\nIt’s not clear what stage of fascism it is when accurate reporting on the family of the president warrants the threat of federal investigation, but that appears to be where we are now.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s war on the media is expanding.

Gu is chairman at Unisync Corp. (TSX: UNI), a Canadian uniform-clothing company, as well as an investor in venerable Canadian brands, such as Tilley and Roots.\n\nThis is the second day in a row that Canadian investors have bought a legendary Canadian retail company, or its assets. Yesterday, Canadian Tire said it would pay $30 million for intellectual property belonging to the Hudson's Bay Co., which is Canada's oldest company.\n\nBIV first reported in January that MEC was rumoured to be up for sale for the second time in five years and was struggling to get sufficient cashflow to pay suppliers.\n\nBIV then reported on many suppliers suing MEC over alleged unpaid bills. \n\nMEC said today that partnering with Gu strengthens its ability to reinvest in domestic manufacturing. Much MEC design work has historically taken place in Vancouver, although retail analyst and DIG360 principal David Ian Gray told BIV this afternoon that most of its manufacturing has taken place offshore.\n\nGu, who also founded and operates Toronto-based clothing manufacturer E.star International Inc. said he has been a lifelong believer in Canadian manufacturing and innovation.\n\n\"I’m proud to join MEC’s journey,\" he said. \"Together, we’ll strengthen its foundation, expand its reach, and ensure that MEC remains an essential part of Canada’s outdoor culture for generations to come.”\n\nThe move toward investing more heavily in domestic manufacturing is to \"enhance the authenticity, quality, and innovation of the MEC Label product line,\" according to the company. \n\nOther investors also hinted that the upsurge in Canadian nationalism in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats and actions may have helped propel the deal. \n\n“There has never been a better time to celebrate being Canadian” said Hlynsky.\n\n“Today marks the beginning of MEC’s next chapter, grounded in the values that built MEC from the start. We will continue to evolve and innovate in order to stay relevant to the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts, and we will remain true to what sets MEC apart: expert staff who live and breathe the outdoors, stores that are anchors for outdoor communities and an unwavering commitment to providing the best assortment of outdoor gear found anywhere. MEC being back in Canadian hands means we are more committed than ever to equip Canadians for all trails ahead.”\n\nThe 1971-founded venture in October 2020 got court approval to be sold to Kingswood Capital Management after entering creditor protection. That company is a Los Angeles-based investment firm that has separate owners and no connection to Kingswood Capital Corp. or Kingswood Properties, which are holdings of Vancouver's Segal family.\n\nAlex Wolf, managing partner at Kingswood said he was pleased with investments made in the business since taking it over, and what he called \"resulting growth in MEC’s brand offerings and private label [products.]\"\n\nHe added that turning the venture over to the new ownership group made sense because it positions MEC to better grow its presence across Canada. \n\nThe sale has been in the works for months, MEC said.","summary":"Investors include textile executive Tim Gu and MEC's own executives Peter Hlynsky and Chris Speyer","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/retail-manufacturing/mec-acquired-by-canadian-investors-including-own-executives-10676074","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/images/peter-hlynsky-21-cc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:30:00","author":"Glen Korstrom","authors":["Glen Korstrom"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.142},{"id":322157534,"title":"Trump’s ‘knock-down-drag-out counterrevolution’ is tackling long-festering ills no one else would","text":"Pundits are confused about what to make of the first 100 days of the second Trump administration.\n\nSupporters talk of “flooding the zone,” believing President Donald Trump is making so many changes so quickly that his opposition is reduced to deer-in-the-headlights infancy.\n\nThey must be right when the nation suffers daily Democratic potty-mouth videos, vandalism of Teslas, infantile meltdowns at congressional witnesses, rioting against federal agents to protect illegal-alien felons, protesting on behalf of women beaters, M-13 gangbangers, human traffickers and assaulters, and visa-holding violent students praising Hamas terrorists.\n\nIn contrast, opponents either claim Trump’s first three months are either directionless chaos or a Hitlerian nightmare or both.\n\nBut what is really happening?\n\nOne, Trump is finally addressing the problems that proverbially “cannot go on forever, and so they won’t go on.”\n\nWhen, if ever, would the left have closed the southern border? \n\nAfter 10 million, 30 million, 50 million illegal aliens?\n\nHow many more criminal illegal entrants was the Biden administration willing to allow into American neighborhoods — 500,000? \n\n1 million? \n\nHow long was the world simply going to ignore the human destruction on the doorstep of Europe?\n\nWould former President Joe Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris have sought a Ukraine War cease-fire? \n\nOr would it have taken another 1.5 million, 3 million or even 5 million more dead, wounded, and missing Ukrainians and Russians?\n\nNor did past administrations ever seek a solution to the massive national debt, much less the uncontrollable budget and trade deficits.\n\nAll prior presidents passed the day of judgment on to some vague future presidency, assured that their money printing would at least not blow up on their watch.\n\nAll moaned that China was piling up huge trade surpluses while denying its own population the usual modern safety net. \n\nThey knew Beijing’s aim was to use the trillions of dollars in trade surpluses to build a new massive military, a greater arsenal of nuclear bombs and a new imperial Belt and Road overseas empire.\n\nYet no administration did anything but greenlight American offshoring while ignoring Chinese trade cheating and technology theft.\n\nIndeed, prior presidencies appeased and enriched China on the foolish belief that such indulgence would lead to Chinese prosperity, and with such Western-style affluence, soon a globalized, democratic and supposedly friendly China.\n\nIn sum, we just witnessed all at once a 100-day, 360-degree effort to address all the existential challenges that we knew were unsustainable but were either afraid or incompetent to address.\n\nSecond, the administration apparently wants to confront the source of these crises and believes it is the progressive project.\n\nThe left maintains real political power not by grass-roots popularity, but rather by unelected institutional clout. The party of democracy uses anti-democratic means to achieve its ends of perpetual control.\n\nIt wages lawfare through the weaponization of the state, local and federal courts.\n\nIt exercises executive power through cherry-picked federal district and circuit judges and their state and local counterparts.\n\nThe permanent bureaucracies and huge federal workforce are mostly left-wing, unionized and weaponized by a progressive apparat.\n\nTheir supreme directive is to amalgamate legislative, judicial and executive power into the hands of the unelected Anthony Faucis, Jim Comeys and Lois Lerners of the world — and thus to override or ignore both popular plebiscites and the work of the elected Congress.\n\nOver 90% of the media — legacy, network, social and state — are left-wing. \n\nTheir mission is not objectivity but, admittedly, indoctrination.\n\nAcademia is the font of the progressive project;

it certainly does not to the majority of Americans who finally wanted an end to the madness.","summary":"Supporters talk of \"flooding the zone,\" believing President Donald Trump is making so many changes so quickly that his opposition is reduced to deer-in-the-headlights infancy.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/16/opinion/trump-is-taking-on-long-festering-ills-no-one-else-would-via-his-knock-down-drag-out-counterrevolution/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/u-s-president-donald-trump-104659064-e1747435046136.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:28:57","author":"Victor Davis Hanson","authors":["Victor Davis Hanson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":322160748,"title":"Syarikat AS tidak bersedia saing dengan Russia, China di Afrika","text":"WASHINGTON: Pendekatan bersejarah Amerika Syarikat (AS) terhadap perdagangan dengan Afrika telah mengabaikan kepentingan perniagaan.\n\nIni menyebabkan syarikat-syarikat AS 'tidak bersedia' untuk bersaing dengan Russia dan China, kata Timbalan Penolong Setiausaha Negara bagi Hal Ehwal Afrika, Corina Sanders, pada Jumaat.\n\n\"AS secara sejarahnya memberi tumpuan kepada peningkatan keadaan makroekonomi di Afrika berbanding memudahkan akses syarikat AS kepada peluang perniagaan.\n\n\"Jadi, dalam hal promosi eksport, persediaan projek, dan alat pembiayaan, mereka bergerak perlahan. \n\n\"Mereka agak terasing dan tidak bersedia untuk bersaing dengan pesaing global seperti China dan Russia,\" kata Sanders kepada Majlis Atlantik, lapor Sputnik/RIA Novosti.\n\nBeliau berkata Afrika mewakili 'pasaran yang berkembang dan belum diterokai untuk eksport AS'.\n\nPentadbiran Presiden AS, Donald Trump telah menyatakan dengan jelas matlamatnya untuk meningkatkan eksport dan pelaburan negara itu ke benua berkenaan.\n\n\"Afrika sepatutnya, pada pandangan kami, menjadi satu daripada rakan dagang utama. \n\n\"Namun, eksport AS ke sub-Sahara Afrika tidak banyak berubah dalam tempoh 20 tahun dan sebenarnya mewakili kurang satu peratus daripada jumlah perdagangan barangan,\" katanya.\n\nBeliau juga berkata 'penekanan besar' pada industri dan sokongan ekonomi di kedua-dua belah Atlantik akan diperlukan untuk mengubah leadaan itu.\n\nPada 2024, AS mengimport barangan bernilai lebih AS$39.5 bilion (RM170 bilion) dari Afrika dan mengeksport barangan bernilai AS$32.1 bilion (RM138 bilion), menurut data Biro Banci AS. \n\nDalam tiga bulan pertama 2025, import berjumlah lebih AS$13.2 bilion (RM57 bilion) manakala eksport mencecah AS$9.6 bilion (RM41 bilion).","summary":"WASHINGTON: Pendekatan bersejarah Amerika Syarikat (AS) terhadap perdagangan dengan Afrika telah mengabaikan kepentingan perniagaan.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/amerika/2025/05/1396909/syarikat-tidak-bersedia-saing-dengan-russia-china-di-afrika","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/bh17saing-o_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1747438077.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:28:05","author":"BERNAMA","authors":["BERNAMA"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":322158184,"title":"Emmanuel Macron Slams Gaza Crisis As &#8216;Intolerable&#8217;, Urges Talks With Netanyahu And Trump For Ceasefire","text":"French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “intolerable” and called for immediate action to restore access to aid and achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

and in defiance of, the Trump administration","text":"By ASHRAF KHALIL, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The World Pride 2025 welcome concert, with pop icon Shakira performing at Nationals Stadium, isn’t until May 31. But for host city Washington D.C., the festivities start with a string of localized Pride events beginning with Trans Pride on Saturday.\n\nHundreds of LGBTQ+ rallies, seminars, parties, after-parties and after-after-parties are planned for the next three weeks across the nation’s capital, including Black Pride and Latin Pride. It all culminates in a two-day closing festival on June 7 and 8 with a parade, rally and concerts on Pennsylvania Avenue by Cynthia Erivo and Doechii.\n\nThe biannual international event typically draws more than a million visitors from around the world and across the LGBTQ+ spectrum. But this year’s events will carry both a special resonance and a particular sense of community-wide anxiety due to the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nTrump’s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Egale Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against travelling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals will face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration’s strict binary view of gender status.\n\n“I think it’s a fair assumption that the international numbers won’t be as high due to the climate and the uncertainties,” said Ryan Bos, executive director of the Capital Pride Alliance. “At the same time we know that there’s an urgency and importance to showing up and making sure we remain visible and seen and protect our freedoms.”\n\nThere’s major anxiety over Trump’s approach to LGBTQ+ rights\n\nOpposition to transgender rights was a key point for Trump’s presidential campaign last year and he’s been following through since returning to the White House in January, with orders to recognize people as being only male or female, keep transgender girls and women out of sports competitions for females, oust transgender military troops, restrict federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19 and threaten research funding for institutions that provide the care.\n\nAll the efforts are being challenged in court; judges have put some policies on hold but are currently letting the push to remove transgender service members move forward. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found support for some of his efforts.\n\nIn February, Trump launched a takeover at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, publicly promising to purge drag shows from the institution’s stages. Within days of that takeover, the Kennedy Center abruptly pulled out of plans to host the International Pride Orchestra as part of a week-long series of World Pride crossover events entitled Tapestry of Pride. In the wake of that cancellation, the Capital Pride Alliance cancelled the entire week and moved some of the Tapestry events to alternate venues.\n\nSome potential international participants have already announced plans to skip this year’s events, either out of fear of harassment or as a boycott against Trump’s policies. But others have called for a mobilization to flood the capital, arguing that establishing a presence in potentially hostile spaces is the precise and proud history of the community.\n\n“We’ve been here before. There is nothing new under the sun,” said D.C. Council Member Zachary Parker, who is gay. “While this is uncharted territory … a fight for humanity is not new to those in the LGBTQ+ community.”\n\nSupporters say showing up would carry symbolic weight\n\nA recent editorial in the The Blade by Argentinian activist Mariano Ruiz argued for “the symbolic weight of showing up anyway,” despite the legitimate concerns.\n\n“If we set the precedent that global LGBTQI+ events cannot happen under right-wing or anti-LGBTQI+ governments, we will effectively disqualify a growing list of countries from hosting,” Ruiz wrote. “To those who say attending World Pride in D.C. normalizes Trump’s policies, I say: What greater statement than queer, trans, intersex, and nonbinary people from around the world gathering defiantly in his capital? What more powerful declaration than standing visible where he would rather we vanish?”\n\nThe last World Pride, in 2023, drew more than 1 million visitors to Sydney, Australia, according to estimates. It’s too early to tell whether the numbers this year will match those, but organizers admit they are expecting international attendance to be impacted.\n\nDestination D.C., which tracks hotel booking numbers, estimated that bookings for this year during World Pride are about 10% behind the same period in 2024, but the organization notes in a statement that the numbers may be skewed by a “major citywide convention” last year that coincided with what would be the final week of World Pride this year.\n\nStill, as the date approaches, organizers and advocates are predicting a memorable party. If international participation is measurably down this year, as many are predicting, the hope is that domestic participants will make a point of attending.\n\n“The revolution is now,” said Parker, the D.C. council member. “There is no greater demonstration of resistance than being present and being you, and that is what World Pride is going to represent for millions of folks.”\n\nAssociated Press reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.","summary":"The festivities start with a string of localized Pride events beginning with Trans Pride on Saturday.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/16/world-pride/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Supreme_Court_Public_Schools_LGBTQ_Books_23577.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:24:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.132},{"id":322162812,"title":"Judge Rips Trump Admin for Repeat \"I Don't Knows\" in Abrego Garcia Hearing","text":"Federal District Judge Paula Xinis ripped into the Trump administration on Friday in a hearing related to the deportation of El Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying government officials are bogging down the process with \"I don't knows.\"Newsweek reached out to the Department of Justice (DOJ) via online form Friday for comment.Why It MattersAbrego Garcia was detained in 2019 and has since been accused of being a member of the MS-13 El Salvadoran gang, which President Donald Trump's administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization.He and his lawyer have denied involvement in the gang, but two judges, in separate rulings, concluded that he was an MS-13 member, based on confidential information provided to the court.Abrego Garcia was shielded from deportation to his native country because he said that he would be a target of MS-13's gang rivals. He was ultimately deported to El Salvador after being arrested in what Trump administration lawyers called an \"administrative error\" but not \"misconduct.\"His family denies any ties to gangs and Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the United States. In 2021, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, accused him of domestic violence and filed paperwork to obtain a restraining order, but says they have since reconciled.In an exclusive statement to Newsweek, Vasquez Sura said, in part: \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through the situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling.\"What To KnowIn court on Friday, Trump officials were asked about updates regarding the process to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the United States.According to Politico reporter Kyle Cheney, the judge expressed frustration with the DOJ amid questioning, saying that depositions with the available Justice Department officials were filled with \"I don't knows\" from the witnesses.Scripps News correspondent Ava-Joye also noted this back-and-forth, saying on X, formerly Twitter, that lawyers for Abrego Garcia wanted to know his custodial process, the future of his facilitated return and \"who are the knowledgeable people.\"\"Judge said it has taken a long time for her law clerks to count up the 'I don't knows,'\" Ava-Joye reports.According to The New York Times, Xinis also expressed frustration with the Trump officials, accusing them of \"deliberately stonewalling lawyers\" for Abrego Garcia and exhibiting \"a willful refusal to answer the question\" about what U.S. officials have done to facilitate his return.The government's use of the state secret privilege also was discussed, as the judge again railed against the administration's reason behind invoking it: \"There's simply no details,\" adding, \"This is basically 'take my word for it,'\" the Associated Press (AP) reported.Trump was also dealt a legal blow on Friday by the Supreme Court in a 7-2 ruling, temporarily blocking his administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to detain or deport Venezuelan nationals.What People Are SayingHomeland Security posted to X on Wednesday: \"Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a confirmed MS-13 terrorist, wife beater, and human trafficker. We have confronted the media and public with overwhelming evidence. Still, members like @RepSwalwell continue to call him a victim while ignoring the REAL victims: the women he battered, the children he terrorized, and the communities he endangered. It's astonishing Democrats spend more time fighting for criminal illegal aliens than law-abiding Americans.\"Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland posted to X on Thursday: \"Today Republicans blocked our bill to hold the Trump Admin and the government of El Salvador accountable for their conspiracy to violate due process rights of people living in the U.S. This isn't just about Mr. Abrego Garcia — this is about defending the rights of ALL. Shameful.\"Trump posted to Truth Social on Friday after the Supreme Court ruling: \"The Supreme Court has just ruled that the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally, are not allowed to be forced out without going through a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person, and one that will allow these people to commit many crimes before they even see the inside of a Courthouse.\"Trump continued, \"The result of this decision will let more CRIMINALS pour into our Country, doing great harm to our cherished American public. It will also encourage other criminals to illegally enter our Country, wreaking havoc and bedlam wherever they go. The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do.\"Trump concluded by saying, \"Sleepy Joe Biden allowed MILLIONS of Criminal Aliens to come into our Country without any 'PROCESS' but, in order to get them out of our Country, we have to go through a long and extended PROCESS. In any event, thank you to Justice [Samuel] Alito and Justice [Clarence] Thomas for attempting to protect our Country. This is a bad and dangerous day for America!\"What Happens NextIt is unknown when or if Abrego Garcia will return to the United States, but Trump lawyers in court said that if he returns, he will \"never walk free,\" the AP reports.","summary":"Judge Paula Xinis pressed Trump officials in court on Friday about state secret privilege and apparent stonewalling of the case.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/judge-rips-trump-admin-repeat-i-dont-knows-abrego-garcia-hearing-2073535","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2646529/kilmar-abrego-garcia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:23:50","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":322157678,"title":"Trump's Middle East tour showed the 'art of the deal' at its best and worst","text":"Donald Trump's latest trip to the Middle East has revealed the president's agenda for this often-troubled region: a honey pot of business deals which will benefit the United States and, possibly, his own family.\n\nTraditionally, when US presidents have travelled through the Middle East they've had the region's many conflicts at front of mind — particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nBut not Trump.\n\nMore than anything else on this trip, Trump locked the US into a closer relationship with Saudi Arabia than any president before him.\n\nSeveral US presidents have been stand-offish with the kingdom: Saudi Arabia was, after all, home to the culture that brought America the September 11 attacks, driven by Saudis such as Osama bin Laden who were imbued with Saudi Arabia's prevailing interpretation of Sunni Islam, Wahhabiism.\n\nThe House of Saud — the dynasty which rules Saudi Arabia — is Wahhabist to its core: a sect that follows a fundamentalist, puritanical definition of the Koran. Under Wahhabiism, the West is widely seen as morally corrupt and to be avoided.\n\nUnless, of course, you are Trump, who comes bearing gifts of multi-billion-dollar contracts of weapons, aircraft and more.\n\nTrump's predecessor, Joe Biden, had another reason to dislike Saudi Arabia — he protested at the cutting up, literally, of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in 2018 to get a visa to return home so he could be married, and was never seen again — believed to have been cut to pieces by a chainsaw and disposed of in garbage bags.\n\nSaudi Arabia's official position was that he was killed in a \"rogue operation\" which went wrong and had been intended to encourage him to return to live in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for Trump, both the horrors of September 11 and the Khashoggi murder are in the past. For him, he saw another side of Saudi Arabia — the glittering economic jewel that Riyadh represents.\n\nHe signed a deal for US companies to export $US142 billion ($221 billion) worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia — one of the largest arms deals in history. That, in turn, posed an intriguing question: why does Saudi Arabia think that it may need such a powerhouse of weapons?\n\nBut from a US point of view, this Trump-brokered deal, and the entire trip, was a huge success. This is Trump at his best — the businessman doing deals, this time with the full force of the presidency of the US.\n\nThe Saudis and the son-in-law\n\nTrump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been a key force behind creating business opportunities between the US and Saudi Arabia. He has also been a key driver behind Saudi Arabia and Israel potentially signing one of the Abraham Accords — agreements between Israel and various Arab countries normalising relations and creating, in effect, free trade agreements across the Middle East.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Israel were on the brink of signing one of these when Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel. Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak told me he believed Hamas timed the attack to sabotage such an agreement on the basis that it would have left the Palestinians without any leverage.\n\nKushner's relationship with Saudi Arabia is intriguing. Forbes magazine reported that after Trump left office in 2021, Kushner set up a new private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which raised more than $US3 billion in one year, with about $US2 billion coming directly from the Saudi Public Investment Fund, run by the government.\n\n\"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman serves as the chair of the Public Investment Fund and reportedly personally intervened to approve the investment and overruled a panel of advisors who called the sum 'unsatisfactory in all aspects,'\" Forbes reported.\n\n\"Kushner developed a close relationship with bin Salman while he served as a White House advisor during Trump's presidency, helping to approve a $US110 million weapons sale to the kingdom after it faced public backlash for the murder of Khashoggi — which the [US] Department of National Intelligence later reported was directed by the crown prince.\"\n\nSkipping over Israel as famine threatens Gaza\n\nOne issue that has arisen from the trip is why Trump did not visit Israel. Former US envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross says it is \"remarkable\" that Trump visited three Arab countries and not Israel, but says that it was clear that the president went to the Middle East to do business \"and didn't see Israel as part of that\".\n\nWhile travelling, Trump referred to the growing humanitarian crisis in Israel. For the last 71 days, Israel has not permitted any food, water or other supplies into Gaza, adding to what was already a desperate situation after more than 18 months of bombing. Israel says it is doing this to force Hamas to release the remaining hostages.\n\n\"We're looking at Gaza, and we got to get that taken care of,\" Trump said. \"A lot of people are starving. A lot of people. There's a lot of bad things going on.\" He added that the US had to \"help out\" the Palestinians.\n\nThe sense from Trump of a looming humanitarian catastrophe was echoed by former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, who said most Israelis were against what was now happening in Gaza and that \"large numbers\" of the army's commanders were against expanding the military operation and wanted the war to end.\n\nSpeaking about the humanitarian crisis, he told the BBC: \"It's totally intolerable, unacceptable and unforgivable, it needs to be stopped right away.\"\n\nOlmert said Israel must provide for the humanitarian needs of the population. \"We can't allow morally the beginning of famine in Gaza. That has to stop.\"\n\nWhile Trump made a brief comment about Gaza, this week the trip was all about business opportunities. After Saudia Arabia he flew into Qatar — and another deal. Trump inked a deal for Qatar Airways to buy 160 jetliners with an option for an additional 50, a deal the White House said was worth $US96 billion.\n\nBut that deal was partly overshadowed by another, less formal deal. Qatar has offered as a gift a free plane to replace the ageing Air Force One which Trump has often criticised as old and in need of replacement.\n\nAnd here lies Trump at his worst — he has made clear that he intends to accept the gift, saying he'd be \"stupid\" not to and characterising the offer as a \"great gesture\".\n\n'Qatari Force One'\n\nWhat does Qatar get in return for this \"gift\"? Surely it opens the possibility of corruption — at what point are the hard men of Qatar going to want something in return?\n\nThe gift has even raised the eyebrows of some Republicans. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, when asked generally how Trump's trip to the Middle East had gone, replied: \"Well, first, quickly Qatar. I trust Qatar like I trust a rest stop bathroom. If they wanna be friendly, I wanna be friendly back. But with those guys … trust in God but tie up your camel.\"\n\nFellow Republican Senator Mike Rounds said: \"It seems to me that the Greeks actually had something like that happen a long time a long, long time ago. Somebody happened to have brought a golden horse inside of a community. This aircraft is beautiful and it would be great if we could accept it, but security concerns are also there.\"\n\nQatar has been a major supporter of Hamas, so security issues surrounding the jet have also been raised, including by Leon Panetta, a former CIA chief. While the US has sophisticated de-bugging equipment, some bugs can be blended into walls and lights so discreetly that they can be difficult to detect.\n\nRepublican Senator Rick Scott of Florida raised the security concern: \"Qatar's not, in my opinion, a great ally. I mean they support Hamas, and so what I'm worried about is the safety of the president of the United States.\"\n\nIt wasn't just some Republicans who felt the plane was a bridge too far. The New York Post, one of the most prominent of the Murdoch newspapers, wrote: \"Despite his administration's insistence that the jet is a gesture of goodwill to the US government, ethics watchdogs have raised concerns about transparency and foreign influence, particularly given Qatar's efforts to bolster its profile in Washington over the past decade.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the gift: \"The Qatari Government has graciously offered to donate a plane to the Department of Defense. The legal details of that are still being worked out but of course, any donation to this government is always done with full compliance with the law and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency and we will continue to do that.\"\n\nAsked if she was worried that the Qataris may want something in return, Leavitt replied: \"Absolutely not, because they know President Trump and they know he only works with the interests of the American people in mind.\"\n\nApart from the business deals, the trip included a fascinating meeting — between Trump and Ahmed al-Sharaa, the new leader of Syria.\n\nAn extraordinary meeting in Syria\n\nAl-Sharaa took power from Iran's long-time ally, Bashar al-Assad, when fighters with his militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched an extraordinary military operation: an eight-day campaign during which they essentially marched on Syria's capital, Damascus, with little resistance.\n\nAssad fled to Moscow, allowing Al-Sharaa to seize control. One of the remarkable aspects of the meeting was that until recently the US's intelligence services have long designated Al-Sharaa and HTS as terrorists.\n\nUntil December, Al-Sharaa even had a bounty on his head of $US10 million for anyone who managed to capture him.\n\nHTS was a Sunni Islamist group that made its base in the northern Syrian province of Idlib, bordering Türkiye. They became political close to Türkiye, and Al-Sharaa ran the province of about 3 million people as a province independent from Syria. Politically, they were committed to the destruction of the ruling regime of Al-Assad, who was aligned with the Shia regime of Iran.\n\nDuring the trip, Trump made clear that the window was closing for Iran to make a deal with the US under which it would agree to limit its enrichment of uranium.\n\n\"Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said. But he then added that there appeared to be the chance of a new deal with Iran. \"Iran has agreed to the terms,\" he said. \"They're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran.\"\n\nFrom what is known, Trump's Iran deal will be substantially similar to the Iran deal struck by the Obama administration (and subsequently terminated by the first Trump administration): They can maintain a civilian nuclear program but there should be \"minimal\" enrichment.\n\nThere has now been four rounds of negotiations between the US and Iran, with a fifth planned.\n\nPutin's no-show\n\nIn the middle of the trip, news emerged that Russia's Vladimir Putin had decided he would not turn up to Istanbul for ceasefire talks with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nFor someone who said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours, Trump was very relaxed about Putin's no-show. It demonstrated, Trump said, that this war could only be solved if he turned up. There was no reprimand whatever for the Russian leader.\n\nIn other words, the problem was not that Putin had shunned an opportunity in Istanbul but rather because Trump the deal-maker had not been involved.\n\nThe trip to the Middle East this week was a whirlwind of deals and talk of possible deals.\n\nIt showed that for all his talk of the US withdrawing from the rest of the world, Trump will in fact be eagle-eyed when it comes to opportunities around the world.\n\nBut it seems that while he gives lip-service to ending wars in Ukraine or Gaza, for Trump 2.0 these trips will be opportunities for business deals rather than solving conflicts.","summary":"Donald Trump's latest trip to the Middle East has revealed the US president's agenda for this often-troubled region.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-17/trump-middle-east-tour-shows-art-of-the-deal-at-best-and-worst/105304652","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/78d6a83cc510053bbc5a996d3aaab7df?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:20:15","author":"John Lyons","authors":["John Lyons"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":322163546,"title":"'Judicial sabotage': MAGA rages at right-wing Supreme Court judges who ruled against Trump","text":"On Friday, President Donald Trump's agenda suffered a major setback after seven Supreme Court justices ruled his administration wasn't giving immigrants proper due process rights under the Constitution.

I’m HIV positive. For 20 years, I have survived on my meds that are $10,000 a month.’\n\nShe was slowly wheeled out Capitol Police after yelling ‘Look at me!’ to lawmakers on the dais.\n\nHearing rooms across the Hill were filled with tense debates this week over the White House’s proposed budget bill, which must be fine-tuned, debated, and voted on by Congress.\n\nBut to pay for the staggering $5 trillion in tax cuts that President Donald Trump is requesting, Republicans are seeking to slash federal spending and Medicaid is on the chopping block, leaving people like Olga potentially responsible for staggeringly high drug costs.\n\nWithout insurance, infusions of HIV drugs such as Trogarzo and Lenacapavir can cost between $9,000 and $12,000 per month. Without them, people with advanced or drug-resistant HIV can die.\n\nOther Medicaid Beneficiaries with various health conditions – high blood pressure, bipolar disorder, and rheumatoid arthritis, for instance – could soon see their out-of-pocket costs go from zero to several thousand dollars, as well.\n\nOlga’s explosive presence in the Ways and Means Committee hearing room was just one of many on Capitol Hill as people seek to pressure lawmakers to abandon proposed cuts to Medicaid as well as the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and policies that would disqualify millions from coverage.\n\nThe proposed Republican bill would require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to meet new eligibility conditions, including working at least 80 hours per month, participating in an education or job training program for the same amount of time, or fulfilling a combination of both. \n\nIt exempts people who are disabled, pregnant or in postpartum care.\n\nMore than 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, including one in six adults and two in five children. \n\nCritics of the work requirement proposal say it imposes significant bureaucratic hurdles on both beneficiaries and state agencies, often leading to eligible people losing coverage due to paperwork issues rather than actual non-compliance.\n\nGeorgia’s experiment with Medicaid work requirements — a conservative alternative to full Medicaid expansion- had the opposite effect on money spent per person on healthcare.\n\nThe state’s per-enrollee spending surged to $13,360 annually, more than five times initial projections. Instead of funding care, most of these costs were swallowed by administrative bureaucracy — verifying compliance with work rules, paperwork processing, and managing enrollment churn. \n\nMeanwhile, thousands lost coverage, and the state saw no significant improvement in health outcomes. \n\nDespite projections that 240,000 low-income residents would gain coverage, only 6,500 enrolled in the program’s first 18 months, as complex paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles locked out eligible applicants.\n\nThat policy is still in place. \n\nMeanwhile, in a House Energy and Commerce meeting, Capitol Police removed 26 protesters, including disability advocates, from the hearing as chants of ‘protect Medicaid’ and heated denials of program abuse allegations disrupted proceedings.\n\nSeveral Republicans, though, have stood up against the cuts. \n\nThe bill failed to advance out of the House Budget Committee on Friday after five Republicans broke ranks to join all Democrats in opposition, with Medicaid cuts being a major sticking point.\n\nConservative hardliners Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) and Josh Brecheen (R-Okla.) rejected the measure on ideological grounds, while Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.) made a last-minute switch from ‘yes’ to ‘no’ to preserve the panel’s ability to reconsider the legislation later.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCapitol Hill was blanketed in protesters earlier this week as lawmakers debated&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Congressional Turmoil: HIV-Positive Disabled Woman Removed Following Intense Debate Over Trump Health Policies first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/congressional-turmoil-hiv-positive-disabled-woman-removed-following-intense-debate-over-trump-health-policies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rewrite-this-title-Chaos-in-Congress-as-HIV-positive-disabled-woman.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:11:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":322153706,"title":"Conservative lawmakers block Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax-cut bill in major setback","text":"House Republicans have failed to push their big package of tax breaks and spending cuts through the Budget Committee, in a major setback for the Trump administration.A handful of hard-right lawmakers unexpectedly joined Democrats in voting against the bill, insisting on steeper spending cuts to Medicaid and the Biden-era green energy tax breaks, among other changes. Democrats on the other hand slammed the bill as \"unconscionable,\" emphasising that millions of people would lose their health coverage and food stamps assistance if the bill passes while the wealthiest Americans would reap enormous tax cuts.

But the Budget Committee plans to reconvene Sunday to try again.'One, big beautiful bill'Ahead of Friday's vote, US President Donald Trump had implored his party to fall in line.“Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’” he posted on social media. \"We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!”Tallying a whopping 1,116 pages, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, named with a nod to Trump, is teetering at a critical moment.The Budget panel is one of the final stops before the package is sent to the full House floor for a vote, which is still expected sometime next week. Typically, the job of the Budget Committee is more administrative as it compiles the work of 11 committees that drew up various parts of the big bill.Four Republican conservatives initially voted against the package — Roy and Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia. Then one, Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, switched his vote to no in a procedural step so it could be reconsidered later, saying afterward he was confident they’d “get this done.”Norman insisted he was not defying the president — “this isn't a 'grandstand,’” he said — as he and the others push from Trump's priorities.Millions to lose out on health insuranceAs it stands, the bill proposes tripling what's currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.At its core, the sprawling package extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump's first term, in 2017, and adds new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and some auto loans.It increases some tax breaks for middle-income earners, including a bolstered standard deduction of $32,000 for joint filers and a temporary $500 boost to the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500.It also provides an infusion of $350 billion for Trump’s deportation agenda and to bolster the Pentagon.Certain Medicaid recipients would need to engage in 80 hours a month of work or other community options to receive health care. Older Americans receiving food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would also see the program's current work requirement for able-bodied participants without dependents extended to include those ages 55-64. States would also be required to shoulder a greater share of the program's cost.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates at least 7.6 million fewer people with health insurance and about 3 million a month fewer SNAP recipients with the changes.","summary":"A handful of hard-right lawmakers joined all Democrats in voting against a package of tax breaks and spending cuts, insisting on steeper cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/05/17/conservative-lawmakers-block-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut-bill-in-major-setback","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/29/03/69/1440x810_cmsv2_37b9b5f3-6718-5021-b1b8-80737d4bcc3f-9290369.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:11:24","author":"Emma de Ruiter","authors":["Emma de Ruiter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":322155588,"title":"Tom Cruise Reveals Fascinating Tale of Winning ‘Rain Man’ Role, Teases Future Beyond ‘Mission: Impossible’","text":"At a promotional event at the British Film Institute for the final “Mission: Impossible” film, titled “Mission: Impossible–The Final Reckoning,” 62-year-old actor Tom Cruise reminisced about the start of his film career. He spoke about his initial meeting with actor Dustin Hoffman after his success with “Risky Business.”\n\nCruise recollected having lunch with one of his sisters, Cass Cruise, when they noticed Hoffman nearby. At that time, Cruise had just completed his first movie and was reluctant to approach the famous actor, despite knowing he needed a different project than the one he was working on, “Legend,” a coming-of-age film.\n\n“My sister insisted, saying, ‘If you don’t approach him, I will go and introduce you myself,'” Cruise recalled. He felt apprehensive, thinking, “He won’t recognize me. This could be embarrassing. I’m not doing it.” \n\n“Finally, she pestered me so much I said fine and walked over there,” Cruise continued. “He had his hat on and was obviously ordering takeout, and I said ‘Mr Hoffman, I’m sorry,’ And he looked at me and said ‘Cruise!’ And I went f—.”\n\nHoffman invited Cruise and his sister to see the play, and after the show, the two actors chatted backstage about working together.\n\n“So we were there, and as I was leaving, he said, ‘I want to make a movie with you.’ I was like, ‘That’d be nice,'” Cruise explained that “[he] was very Southern: Yes, sir, no, sir, yes, ma’am, no ma’am. . . And basically a year later, [Hoffman] sent [him] ‘Rain Man.'”\n\nThe “Top Gun” star also appeared at the Cannes Film Festival to promote the new action flick, where he hinted that his movie career might look different after the “M:I” franchise.\n\n“It went beyond our expectations,” Cruise said to the director of the final “Mission: Impossible” movie, Christopher McQuarrie, at an event following the movie premiere. “It’s been a real privilege and a pleasure. I look forward to making a bunch of other kinds of movies with you. I can’t wait.”\n\n“We just want to thank you all,” Cruise said, to applause from the crowd. “Thank you so much for everything, for allowing us to entertain you. It’s very special.”\n\nCruise genuinely looked like he was having a great time at the annual film festival, greeting fans, signing autographs, and taking pictures, reminding Hollywood how to be a true movie star. \n\nThe actor also refused to make his appearance about anything other than promoting his new movie. During a press event, he refused to give the media anything when they wanted him to talk politics, when someone asked about President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs for movies shot outside of the U.S.\n\nCruise knows we don’t want to hear his thoughts on politics. It’s refreshing and smart, as RedState’s Brandon Morse noted:\n\nWhat’s great about this is that Cruise may very well be incredibly against Trump’s tariffs and have a lot of opinions about them… but we, the audience, will never know, because most of us don’t care. We’re not going to Cruise for political opinion, we’re going to him because he entertains us, and provides an escape with his films.\n\nYou can watch the full video of the BFI event here.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAt a promotional event at the British Film Institute for the final&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Tom Cruise Reveals Fascinating Tale of Winning &#8216;Rain Man&#8217; Role, Teases Future Beyond &#8216;Mission: Impossible&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/tom-cruise-reveals-fascinating-tale-of-winning-rain-man-role-teases-future-beyond-mission-impossible/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cruise-Shares-Incredible-Story-of-How-He-Landed-‘Rain-Man.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 23:10:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.281}]}
