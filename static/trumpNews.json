The day before the inauguration, Vaughn was also pictured with Tucker Carlson. \n\nHe has not yet commented on his picture with Trump on Friday, which reportedly came after he attended a prayer service at the U.S. Capitol. \n\nReverend Patrick Mahoney, the Director of the Christian Defense Coalition, also took to X to share a selfie with Vaughn from Friday, saying the actor was with me at the US Capitol before he crashed the White House with President Trump... Just sayin.' \n\nAfter some criticized Vaughn for his interaction with Trump at the baseball game, he defended the move and said it did not imply an endorsement of Trump or his policies. \n\n'In my career I've met a lot of politicians who I've always been cordial to; I've met Nancy Pelosi and was cordial to her as well,' he said of the Democratic Speaker of the House. \n\nAs evidence, Vaughn added that he greeted the Democratic strategist James Carville, who had a cameo in Wedding Crashers, at the same game.\n\n'It was the only time I've ever met him. We said hello. He was very personable,' he said, adding with a laugh, 'I didn't get into policies.'\n\nThe True Detective star continued, ascribing much of the outrage to a minority of people online.\n\n'I think people are more charged than ever about these things,' he continued. \n\n'But I don't think most people take that stuff as seriously as the small percentage that's making noise about it.\n\n'I was raised with the idea that you could have different likes and beliefs and you should respect and defend that in other people, not shout it down. \n\n'The people you disagree with the most, you should stand up for their right to do that.","summary":"The Hollywood actor surprised fans after the White House shared a picture of him smiling next to President Trump in the Oval Office, with many saying they were unaware of his political leanings.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14628555/Vince-Vaughn-Trump-Oval-Office.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/23/97472985-0-image-m-31_1745101671689.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2020/11/14/1971220325957480975/1024x576_MP4_1971220325957480975.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 01:07:54","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":312855488,"title":"Anti-Trump protesters rally in New York, Washington and elsewhere across the country","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Opponents of President Donald Trump’s administration took to the streets of communities large and small across the U.S. on Saturday, decrying what they see as threats to the nation’s democratic ideals.\n\nThe disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of “the shot heard ’round the world” on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago.\n\nThomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston.

As a result, Harvard is now facing the threat of losing its tax-exempt status and a $2.2 billion funding freeze with layoffs and stop-work orders expected. Despite this, the university has stood its ground and received support from political figures and activist groups.\nIn the midst of this, former President Joe Biden made a public appearance at Harvard which drew attention due to a series of gaffes. The event was held at the Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) as part of an Institute of Politics (IOP) seminar. It was attended by 50 students and was an off-the-record gathering. During the seminar, Biden celebrated Harvard’s decision to stand strong against the Trump administration. He told the students in attendance, “Harvard stepped up in a way no one else has. You should be thankful,” he said, according to The Harvard Crimson.\nBiden further praised the university’s actions, saying, “I think Harvard should just do what it’s doing — lifting everybody.”\n\n? NEW: President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to the Harvard Kennedy School on Wednesday, sitting in on a seminar led by longtime adviser Mike Donilon.\nRoughly 50 students attended the off-the-record Q&A.

Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) April 17, 2025\n\nBut his visit didn’t go without awkward moments. At the event, Biden confused Ukraine with Iraq while discussing Russia’s invasion. Mike Donilon, a former White House senior adviser, corrected him, as per the publication. In another moment, Biden took a bite of an ice cream bar but it fell to the floor.\nOutside the event, roughly a dozen protesters condemned Biden’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza at a demonstration organised by Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine.\nThey chanted “Biden, Biden, you can’t hide. You’re committing genocide” and tried to disrupt the event with bells and drums.\n“We are here to protest the arrival of yet another genocidaire onto our campus, particularly the president, who gave billions and billions of dollars of support to Israel,” Olivia G. Pasquerella ’26, a Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee group organiser, said as quoted by the publication.\nBiden’s appearance added to a growing wave of support for Harvard with figures like former President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders backing the university’s stance.\nBut a recent report in The New York Times claimed that the April 11 letter with the demands sent by the officials was “unauthorised.” A Donald Trump official contacted Harvard to claim that the letter had been sent in error.\nThe report, citing two individuals with knowledge of the matter, stated the letter was sent by Sean Keveney, the acting general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services. He is also part of the antisemitism task force.","summary":"During the seminar, former US President Joe Biden celebrated Harvard’s decision to stand strong against the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.news18.com/viral/joe-biden-visits-harvard-praises-universitys-resistance-to-donald-trumps-demands-aa-9305677.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/04/image-by-nvnbhanwala-naveen-bhanwala-2025-04-64df4460c1f90bc615065d7ecb9512fe.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 01:00:29","author":"News18,Sahas","authors":["News18","Sahas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":312856406,"title":"Musk to Force Pentagon to Build and Then Pay Him to Use Network of Killer Satellites","text":"This is a two day old article. But with so much else going on I hadn’t seen it. If you haven’t really must read it. It’s one of growing number of examples that the US government is at present essentially being held hostage by the clique surrounding Elon Musk. \n\nDonald Trump got really jazzed up about Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system. Based on that he decided that the US should build one as well. But the US is quite a bit larger than Israel. And because of that nothing like that is really feasible at all. So the plan quickly evolved into a new version of Reagan’s SDI. All of this was contained in a late January executive order in which Trump committed the country (purportedly) to building it. There are many reasons why this is a bad idea, both destabilizing but also unfeasible. But let’s set that aside for the moment.\n\nIt now emerges that Musk’s SpaceX, Thiel’s Palantir and Palmer Luckey’s Ardruil have combined forces to build what Trump is calling ‘Golden Dome’. Needless to say, since Musk basically controls federal contracting he’s essentially giving the contract to himself. Through the article there are gently phrased characterizations of the situation like this (emphasis added). \n\nOne of the sources familiar with the talks described them as “a departure from the usual acquisition process. There’s an attitude that the national security and defense community has to be sensitive and deferential to Elon Musk because of his role in the government.”\n\nAs I said, Musk runs things. So, much as it’s necessary to be sensitive to the needs of the guy with the gun during a stick-up, people at the Pentagon are doing just that.\n\nBut none of this gets to the most jaw-dropping part of this. Musk and Thiel propose making this network of hundreds of surveillance and attack satellites into a subscription service that the Musk/Thiel/Luckey consortium would own and the Pentagon would subscribe to. Not only is this crazy and absurd but it goes without saying that in no normal time would anyone at the Pentagon be okay with the US not owning the hardware at the center of national defense. We’ve seen how this goes with Starlink, where Musk routinely threatens to turn the system on or off based on his whims and opens up separate lines of communications and perhaps deals with adversary leaders like Vladimir Putin.\n\nAgain, more gentle phrasings (emphasis added) …\n\nSome Pentagon officials have expressed concerns internally about relying on the subscription-based model for any part of the Golden Dome, two sources told Reuters. Such an arrangement would be unusual for such a large and critical defense program.\n\nU.S. Space Force General Michael Guetlein has been in talks on whether SpaceX should be the owner and operator of its part of the system, the two sources said. Other options include having the U.S. own and operate the system, or having the U.S. own it while contractors handle operations. Guetlein did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI’ll bet they’re “in talks” about that. The whole suggestion is absurd. Of course, Congress hasn’t appropriated money for any of this. It all comes from the fact that Musk is currently running the government.","summary":"This is a two day old article. But with so much else going on I hadn&#8217;t seen it.

It aligns the couple with centuries of history and a pedigree of elegant A-list nuptials, from the Clooneys in 2014 to Alexandre Arnault and Geraldine Guyot in 2021.’\n\nShe adds: ‘This is PR gold, attracting attention and investment at a time when the city is going through a new cultural renaissance.’ Three of the city’s best hotels are booked out for the festivities: The Aman Palace, The St Regis and the Gritti Palace.\n\nThese will take the 200 or so guests, thought to include celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Barbra Streisand and Leonardo DiCaprio, plus Vogue chief Anna Wintour and tycoons Barry Diller and Bill Gates.\n\nAnother 200 support staff will also need to be accommodated between June 26 and 29, with sources talking about multiple events over three days.\n\nBut the highlight will be the ceremony and many in Venice believe the private island of San Giorgio Maggiore is the place the couple have chosen for the event. The beautiful, secluded spot is home to the former San Giorgio monastery which now houses the Cini Foundation, a cultural charity.\n\nIt has incomparable views across the lagoon to St Mark’s Square and the Doge’s Palace.\n\nThe buildings are filled with artworks and a valuable archive and its cloisters would make the perfect setting.\n\nA spokesman for the foundation says that they are ‘not able to confirm, comment on or deny’ anything to do with the nuptials, which falls short of a denial.\n\nA city hall source in Venice says the Cini is certainly in the running to host Amazon chief Mr Bezos, who arrived this week to look at potential venues and meet Venice’s mayor Luigi Brugnaro.\n\nMr Bezos, I am told, was ‘extremely concerned about privacy’ and the Cini would shield the event from prying eyes.\n\nCity hall sources added no public spaces will be cordoned off and tourists will still be able to enjoy the city while the wedding takes place, which also points to the private island monastery being at the centre of the festivities.\n\n‘Everyone is making a big deal about the wedding causing chaos but the planning is under way to keep the city open throughout,’ says a source. \n\n‘Taxis will still be available, people will still be able to get around and see the sights. This will be a very private event, and very well-planned.’ \n\nAs for security concerns, the Cini Foundation has twice hosted the G7 summit, with world leaders including Francois Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher attending.\n\nIf Donald Trump turns up, as expected, he will follow in Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter’s footsteps. A source says: ‘The island isn’t just private, its practically sovereign territory.’\n\nMs Nay, who has worked with royalty and A-list stars via her company Blu Fire, says the Cini would be the perfect choice.\n\n‘Venice’s historic sites are in a constant state of competitive fundraising and this wedding will be supporting the preservation of the incredible Cini art collection and architectural restoration at the site, including the gorgeous amphitheatre at the back,’ she says.\n\n‘I hope that the weekend’s itinerary will include cultural visits to some of the city’s off-market palazzi and other secret treasures – that’s always my favourite part of Venetian itinerary planning.’\n\nShe adds: ‘For Mr Bezos and his bride, this isn’t just a wedding. It’s a major event, a statement of class and a sort of cultural takeover, done tastefully one hopes.\n\n‘He comes from a philanthropic family and will be giving back to the city by fundraising restoration of key parts of the Fondazione Cini, such as the wonderful amphitheatre in the gardens. It’s all very considered. Luxe, but with legacy.’\n\nAnd the cost? Wild reports circulated last year that the wedding would cost $500million, which Bezos scoffed at as ‘fake news’.\n\nA wedding planner, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: ‘You can do a perfectly nice wedding in Venice for half a million but I would say $30million is the floor, not the ceiling.\n\n ‘When you factor in A-list and other performers, private jets, luxury accommodation and gold standard discretion, the total could easily soar.’\n\nThat source adds: ‘If you think spending tens of millions on a wedding is vulgar, consider that Mr Bezos, like many billionaires, will see this an act of cultural charity and value, as well as job creation.\n\n‘When you’re Jeff Bezos, there’s no such thing as OTT. As my San Francisco clients say, “There’s always another level”.’\n\nOthers say there is no way the wedding will cost as much as $30million and that it is likely to be a small fraction of that. If so, good for Jeff for driving a bargain.\n\nHe’s certainly got the best of the best in his corner. The wedding weekend is understood to be orchestrated by the uber-discreet company Lanza and Baucina, which is run by one Italian Prince (Prince Antonio Licata di Baucina) and two Italian counts (his cousins Count Riccardo and Aleramo Lanza). Their website is blank save for the words: ‘Leaders in global event creation, design and management with experience ranging from Royal and A-list celebrity weddings to groundbreaking productions in extraordinary and unchartered locations.\n\n‘Established in 2000, we have worked on every continent and are responsible for masterminding the world’s most exclusive, private and spectacular parties.\n\n‘Discretion is paramount to us. We have no social media presence and no examples of previous work are published.’\n\nIt’s widely known, though, that the luxe company masterminded George Clooney’s romantic 2014 Venice wedding to Amal, which was largely at the Aman Palace Hotel, a 16th century palazzo.\n\nLanza and Baucina also arranged actress Salma Hayek’s Venetian wedding to fashion billionaire François-Henri Pinault in 2009, which was held at La Fenice opera house (it is understood La Fenice is booked out for other events at the time of the Bezos nuptials so has been ruled out as a venue).\n\nOther events put on by the company include the Google summit in Sicily in 2018, where a group of billionaires were addressed on eco issues by a barefoot Prince Harry.\n\nIn a rare interview a decade ago, Prince Antonio said: ‘With our family connections, we always know someone who can open secret doors in Italy.’\n\nThey have put on dinner parties at the Colosseum in Rome and specialise in negotiating access to ‘off-limits’ settings for their rich clients.\n\nWhen Meghan Markle’s close friend Misha Nonoo married her first husband, art gallerist Alexander Gilkes, Lanza and Baucina arranged for them to hold the wedding at Forte di Sant’Andrea, a 16th century island fort that once guarded Venice and had never been used for a private event.\n\nThe mayor of Venice gave permission, with Princess Beatrice and James Middleton among the guests. He is involved again with the Bezos wedding, the organisers hand-in-hand with him.\n\nThey will need his help. As Ms Nay says: ‘People love the fun stuff – design ideas, venue and menu selection – but logistics in Venice are challenging. You can’t drive. Everyone arrives by commercial boat. It’s like producing a West End show on water, with a budget in the tens of millions.’\n\nThe mayor Sr Brugnaro has already stepped in to quash reports in the local media that the wedding is set to consume the city.\n\n‘The many speculations and fake news circulating about Jeff Bezos’s wedding are completely unfounded,’ he stressed at the weekend, adding the city is working with wedding organisers.\n\nHe clarified that about 200 guests will be attending the ceremony, noting that Venice in the past has hosted international events ‘with much greater impact than this one’, citing, among others, the Venice Film Festival.\n\nMr Bezos, 61, and Ms Sanchez, 55, were spotted in Venice on Tuesday and also in Milan later in the week, with Ms Sanchez carrying several bags from Dolce & Gabbana. She will – like Amal Clooney – have a number of looks planned for the wedding but sources suggest she has chosen American house Oscar de la Renta for her wedding dress, at the suggestion of Vogue supremo Anna Wintour.\n\nRumours that the wedding will take place on Mr Bezos’s $500million superyacht Koru have been rebuffed but there will likely be at least one party aboard the boat, which will be anchored in the Venetian Lagoon.\n\nAt 127 metres long, the Koru, meaning ‘loop’ in Maori, is the largest masted yacht ever built – and the place where Mr Bezos proposed to Ms Sanchez.\n\nA source said: ‘The wedding is based on a buy-out of at least three top hotels for guests and VIPs – take your pick between the Aman, Belmond Cipriani and St Regis. Then the supporting cast of hundreds would more likely be at the Gritti – the performers, producers, art department, florists, guest wranglers, logistics crew and so on.\n\n‘The size of a high calibre wedding guest list in Venice is usually dictated by the number of hotels that are available to buy out at the time of booking.\n\n‘Rumours abound that the island of San Giorgio Maggiore will be privatised for the ceremony, which, like the Arnault wedding, is said to be taking place at art destination Fondazione Cini.\n\n‘Mr Bezos is in safe hands with his agency who work only with ultra-high net-worth individuals and luxury brands, though they will bolster their core team massively. Venice is one of the most logistically challenging places on Earth to deliver a wedding.\n\n‘You need deep experience, immaculate logistics planning and the best address book to move all of the people and equipment around the city from one venue to the next on time, especially during June, which is so busy.’\n\nThe source adds Venice is infamously expensive, which will inflate costs: ‘A coordinated fleet of water taxis could cost upwards of $250,000, depending on how many days guests are staying.\n\n‘Similarly, large jets can’t land at the tiny private terminal, so if Jeff Bezos doesn’t want his guests dragging their own baggage off the carousel, they’ll need to arrive in small private planes and be whisked straight into water taxis at the nearby dock.\n\n‘I imagine the reality will be a combination of the two.’\n\nBut then Mr Bezos has built his Amazon fortune by constantly, and reliably, fulfilling logistical challenges of delivering any product to any consumer. The team putting on his wedding will surely understand that there can be no falling short.\n\nAdditional reporting from Silvia Marchetti in Italy.","summary":"The world's second richest man has chosen Italy's historic 'Floating City', Venice, for his wedding in June to his pneumatic second wife.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14627931/Jeff-Bezos-Venice-wedding-extravaganza-guests-Trump-ALISON-BOSHOFF.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/19/15/97462125-0-image-m-26_1745074231258.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:57:59","author":"Alison Boshoff,Editor","authors":["Alison Boshoff","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.294},{"id":312855762,"title":"Troubled star Hayden Panettiere sends fans in frenzy as she debuts 'wild' transformation","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Apr 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle is accused of ripping off British author's book series for feminist Netflix show - after writer spots 'striking similarities' between her character and the Duchess' animation\n\nLabour's WhatsApp plot to defy trans ruling: Ministers' leaked messages reveal their fury at calls to ban transgender women from female-only changing rooms\n\nThe healthy superfood shockingly linked to cancer that could be in your pantry right now\n\nHow Cat Deeley rediscovered her Brummie accent to win over viewers!

Sleep is massive. It affects your motor skills, your ability to think, and your overall health.' \nShe added, 'My body was like, \"enough.\" I hit 30. My face was swollen. I had jaundice. My eyes were yellow. I had to go to a liver specialist.\n'I was holding on to weight that wasn't normally there.

The interview started well, and for the record, its beginning is not included in the version People Magazine posted. I was exhausted.\n'My rep stopped the interview early as it became obvious that I was fading - especially as the subject matter became heavier.'\nHayden asked to re-do the interview but was told 'that it wasn't necessary' and added, 'The magazine does not grant approval for images or video interviews before they run. We see the interview when it goes live.'\nThe actress expressed that, 'Grief looks different on everyone. Whether or not I am on medication is none of anyone's business and is between me and my doctor.'\nShe also added, 'The real issue here is the toxicity of social media, and a news cycle that is driven by click bait.\n'Mental health is so important, and I hope those reading this now understand that what you say hiding behind a computer screen can have a detrimental impact on someone.'\nHayden concluded with, 'For those of you who have come to my defense amidst this chaos I am so grateful. Like I've said before, I am a work in progress. We all are.'\nHowever, she sparked worry once again as she sat down for a separate interview on Today. \nDuring the interview, she promoted her film Amber Alert - as well as talking about her late brother and mental health. \n\nHayden concluded with, 'For those of you who have come to my defense amidst this chaos I am so grateful. Like I've said before, I am a work in progress. We all are'; seen in 2023 \n\nDuring the interview, she promoted her film Amber Alert - as well as talking about her late brother and mental health; seen with late brother Jansen in 2019 in Hollywood \nIn regards to her mental health following her brother's death, Hayden said, 'I thought that people would have empathy, was going to be the only thing that was there, but I had no idea how my body, my mind, was going to react to grief.\n'It's wild what stress and grief and all these hormones and running through your body can do...\nShe added, 'I mean, make you faint. My mother, when she got stressed - she's gonna kill me for saying this - she used to get knots on her head. It comes in all different forms, so nobody should be embarrassed by it or judged for it.'\nWhen asked if she has 'processed' her brother's death, Panettiere admitted, 'I don't know that I fully have. I think it's something that transforms over time.'\nEarlier this year in February, she posted on social media on the two-year anniversary of her brother's passing. \nShe uploaded a throwback photo of the pair and penned, '2 years ago today, I lost my little brother.

Thousands of people have been detained and deported since he took office, and the administration faces several lawsuits over the matter.The president has said most detentions and deportations would target individuals with criminal records. However, in recent weeks, there have been multiple reports of people without criminal convictions, and some with valid documentation, being detained for deportation.With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House and Senate, the courts have arguably become the main avenue for challenging the Trump administration's policy.Saturday's ruling is particularly significant since it comes from a Court with a 6-3 conservative majority, including justices appointed during Trump's first term.What To KnowAccording to Reuters, on Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed an urgent request to the Supreme Court following reports that some of the men had been placed on buses and were about to be deported.A government lawyer said during the hearing that they weren't aware of plans to deport the men that day, but that it could happen on Saturday.Stern, a senior writer covering courts and the law for Slate Magazine who has reported on the Supreme Court and federal courts since 2013, described the legal battle on Bluesky as \"a huge victory for the migrants here and a major defeat for Trump's lawless effort to rush out a rendition flight before the courts could act.\"Trump invoked the AEA on March 15, targeting Tren de Aragua members, a criminal group it has designated as a terrorist organization, to deport Venezuelan men accused of having membership in the group. This is the same law used to intern Japanese, German, and Italian nationals during World War II.On April 7, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration could use the AEA to deport alleged Tren de Aragua members, but only if judicial review could take place.The Court specified that notice \"must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"Earlier this month, the Court instructed the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. from El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said Abrego Garcia was deported last month due to an \"administrative error.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded that Abrego Garcia would \"never live in the United States of America again.\"Abrego Garcia, who came to the U.S. illegally, was arrested in 2019 and accused of being a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization. Abrego Garcia denied being a member of the gang, but two judges, in separate rulings, concluded that he was, based on confidential information provided to the court. He was shielded from deportation to El Salvador because he said he would be targeted by MS-13's gangland rivals.Abrego Garcia lived in Maryland with his wife and children, with his family denying that he has any ties to gangs. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S., although his wife accused him of domestic violence and obtained a restraining order against him. They have since been reconciled.The Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele have said they lack the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S.What People Are SayingLegal analyst Mark Joseph Stern wrote on Bluesky on Saturday: \"I think the majority that lifted [U.S. District Judge James] Boasberg's restraining order truly believed Trump would heed its warning about due process and pause further AEA renditions until SCOTUS ruled on their legality. Instead Trump tried to sneak out migrants before courts could act. And now I think SCOTUS is pissed.\"He added: \"It is SO unusual for the Supreme Court to issue an order this late at night and honestly incredible only Thomas and Alito noted their dissents. Also fascinating that SCOTUS rushed out the order before Alito could finish writing his dissent. That basically never happens! Again—majority seems pissed.\"In its ruling, the Supreme Court wrote: \"There is before the Court an application on behalf of a putative class of detainees seeking an injunction against their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. The matter is currently pending before the Fifth Circuit.\"It added: \"Upon action by the Fifth Circuit, the Solicitor General is invited to file a response to the application before this Court as soon as possible. The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.\"What Happens Next?Saturday's ruling temporarily suspended deportation rather than banning it outright. This leaves open the possibility that deportations could proceed if the Trump administration provides further legal assurances that satisfy the Court's requirements for judicial review.The response from the administration will likely determine the next steps in this ongoing legal battle between executive authority and judicial oversight.","summary":"Supreme Court halted Trump's Alien Enemies Act deportations, signaling potential judicial resistance despite conservative majority.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-signaled-toe-toe-trump-legal-analyst-2061841","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2630200/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:54:59","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":312855766,"title":"Jennifer Lopez's producing partner exposes Hollywood's darkest sex secrets in explosive new book","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Apr 20th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle is accused of ripping off British author's book series for feminist Netflix show - after writer spots 'striking similarities' between her character and the Duchess' animation\n\nLabour's WhatsApp plot to defy trans ruling: Ministers' leaked messages reveal their fury at calls to ban transgender women from female-only changing rooms\n\nThe healthy superfood shockingly linked to cancer that could be in your pantry right now\n\nHow Cat Deeley rediscovered her Brummie accent to win over viewers!

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy ALESIA STANFORD FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:00:43 BST, 20 April 2025 |Updated:01:50 BST, 20 April 2025 \n\nJennifer Lopez's producing partner is getting ready to reveal some of Hollywood's darkest secrets in a new book.\nElaine Goldsmith-Thomas has drawn from her years in show business to write her debut novel, Climbing in Heels.\nThe book written by the former secretary-turned-executive follows three young women working at one of Tinseltown's biggest talent agencies and some of its biggest stars including Julia Roberts, Madonna and Nicolas Cage.\nGoldsmith-Thomas, who began her own career at the William Morris Agency in the early 1980s, told Page Six it was like working in the 'Wild Wild West.'\n'You know, people like Harvey Weinstein were not the anomaly, they were the norm,' she told the outlet.\nDetails in the book include a male assistant who is allowed to listen in on his boss while he is having sex with actresses auditioning for a role.\n\nJennifer Lopez's producing partner, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, is getting ready to reveal some of her Hollywood insider knowledge in a new novel; Pictured in Toronto in September 2019\n'That was a story I had heard from a trainee who was allowed to listen in as his boss, that was his bonus … his little treat. His boss let him listen in as he f–ked actresses.'\nGoldsmith-Thomas recalled her own close call when she met Bill Cosby.\n\n Jennifer Lopez reveals where she is jetting off to next \nThe Cosby Show star threw a luncheon for all the William Morris secretaries to show his thanks for the success of the sitcom.\nDuring a brief encounter, the Emmy winner asked her about her future plans. She had recently graduated from college and Goldsmith-Thomas told the comic she would love to represent him one day. \n'Later, I got a call from the executive secretary on the first floor saying, \"Mr. Cosby was very impressed by you. And we're going to give you contracts to sign, bring them over to his hotel, The Beverly Wilshire,\" she explained.\n'And I went into the bathroom, I was really excited getting ready — oh my God, I felt seen, I felt really seen. And my friend who worked for the president of the agency happened to be there. I told her and she said, \"Don't do it.\" I said, Why? She said, \"Don't do it.\"\n'Now she didn't say anything bad would happen … there was just something about the way she said it that frightened me enough that I didn't go.'\nCosby has been accused by some 60 women of drugging and raping them.\nHe was convicted of aggravated indecent assault in 2018. The conviction was later overturned, and Cosby, who has denied all the allegations, was released in 2021. \n\nThe secretary-turned-agent has included some of her Hollywood experiences in her debut novel, Climbing in Heels, which will be on store shelves April 29\n\nWhile Goldsmith-Thomas made no mentioned of Lopez's disgraced ex Diddy — who has been charged with sex trafficking and other serious crimes — she did discuss her run-in with Bill Cosby; Lopez and Diddy seen in 2000\n\nGoldsmith-Thomas began her career as a secretary at the William Morris Agency in the early 1980s and later became an agent for Julia Roberts, Madonna and Nicholas Cage; pictured in New York City in March\n\nWriting the book 'made me look back,' she recalled, revealing that when she was still fresh in the business when agents in Los Angeles would have their secretaries send cocaine cross-country in something called the 'New York pouch that went back and forth to New York overnight.'\nSexual harassment was common in the workplace when the Second Act producer was still new in the business.\n'I mean the guys in the mail room, they'd go, \"Hey, could I have a little keppy?\" — meaning, \"Can I have a little [oral sex]?\" I'd go, \"How can you ask me that? We're friends\" … \"Well, you don't ask, you don't get,\" they'd say.'\nLopez and her future producing partner met when they were both attending a performance of Cabaret starring the late Natasha Richardson in 1998 and the two connected 'on a very visceral level.'\nTogether they have worked on more than a dozen projects together including Hustlers, Kiss of the Spider Woman, which will be released in October, and Office Romance, in which Lopez is starring with Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein. \n\nGoldsmith-Thomas and Lopez, 55, met in 1998. They have produced several projects together, including Hustlers and Kiss of the Spider Woman; Pictured in New York City in September 2019 with Jessica Elbaum, Lorene Scafaria and Benny Medina\n\nLopez and Goldsmith-Thomas are now working on Office Romance, which is currently in production, starring Lopez and Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein; pictured in Hoboken, NJ on April 7\n\n'Jennifer is extraordinary because here's a dancer who became an actor, who became a singer, who became a global brand, who is probably one of the biggest stars on earth and she's incredibly kind,' Goldsmith-Thomas said of her friend; Pictured in Hoboken, NY April 7\n\nIt was the Hustlers star who insisted Goldsmith-Thomas write the book. \n'Jennifer is extraordinary because here's a dancer who became an actor, who became a singer, who became a global brand, who is probably one of the biggest stars on earth and she's incredibly kind,' she said of her friend. \n'I felt when I worked with Jennifer that I had a partner — that she put her shoulder next to mine and we'd push. It sounds funny, but the sky wasn't the limit; it was a resting place.'\nClimbing In Heels is scheduled to be release April 29. \nNicolas CageJennifer LopezNew YorkMadonna\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Lopez's producing partner exposes Hollywood's darkest sex secrets in explosive new book\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 11\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

They performed without Hannah Spearritt, 43, who quit the group following his death. \nSpeaking about how touring helped them grieve, Rachel told The Mirror: 'It was amazing to have the tour and be able to celebrate him. \n'It gave us a chance to grieve and to grieve together as well, which was special, and share all our amazing memories of him.

T\nThe pair divorced in 2022, and reflecting on the huge life change she explained her life has taken a 'whole new direction'. \nShe added: 'The thing I've learnt is to give yourself space for how you feel and to be kind to yourself about it and to talk to people.'\nRachel announced her separation from her childhood sweetheart Alex in July 2022, just one month shy of their 13-year anniversary.\nThe S Club icon went on to find love again with Dancing On Ice skater Brendyn Hatfield. \nTheir relationship went official in November 2023 after they were first paired together on the ITV show.\nRachel previously revealed that S Club had group therapy to help cope with the 'devastating' death of Paul.\nSpeaking on the Happy Place podcast, Rachel detailed how the band had therapy together to 'open conversations' and 'share memories' of Paul.\n\nRachel said: 'It gave us a chance to grieve and to grieve together as well, which was special, and share all our amazing memories of him.

I think talking is just the best thing ever and it can never be a bad thing.\n'It opens up conversations and it helps you, it's as simple as that. It was just a really special way to celebrate him and his life, but it was just tragic.'\nRachel said there was no question the tour would not continue, but explained the experience brought her and her bandmates Tina Barrett, Jon Lee Bradley McIntosh and Jo O'Meara 'even closer together'.\nShe explained: 'It brought us even closer together. It was devastating but we just were together actually.\n'Obviously the tour was all happening, there was no talk about it not happening but we just stopped and took a step back. We talked and we were there for each other and that's all you can do.'\nThe reunion tour then became a way to celebrate Paul, with the group renaming it The Good Times Tour in tribute to Paul's song Good Times on their third album. \nRachel said: 'We really wanted to just be mindful of his family and be respectful. We were talking all the time and sharing memories of him. \n\nRachel has also had a rollercoaster few years in her personal life after she split from her ex husband Alex Bourne (pictured with ex Alex in 2017)\n\nAfter splitting from Alex, Rachel went on to find found love with Dancing On Ice skater Brendyn Hatfield (both pictured together last year)\n'The tour took on a whole different meaning and became a really beautiful tribute and celebration of him.'\nPaul's sad passing was announced in a joint statement from his family and S Club that said: 'It is with great sadness that we announce the unexpected passing of our beloved son and brother Paul Cattermole.\n'Paul was found yesterday, 6th April 2023 at his home in Dorset and was pronounced dead later that afternoon.\n'While the cause of death is currently unknown, Dorset Police has confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances.

The protestors gathered outside the White House, repeatedly chanting \"shame!\" to voice their dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. Thousands more marched from the Washington Monument, many demanding that the administration bring back Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia -- a Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador, The New York Times reported. \"I am worried that the administration would not stop at deporting undocumented immigrants without due process and would imprison and deport U.S. citizens,\" said Aaron Burk, who joined the rally in Washington. He added, \"Where does it stop?\" he said. Burk also said that his daughter is transgender and that he was most concerned about the dehumanisation of minorities, The New York Times reported.

(Bernama pic)PETALING JAYA: Malaysia and its partners in Asean should make fuller use of existing free trade agreements rather than enter a new economic grouping as a buffer against the US-China trade war, according to two economists.Afzanizam Rashid of Bank Muamalat said entering into “too many trade agreements” might be risky, leading to confusion for businesses and countries involved. “As it is both bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements are already complex,” he said.Nazari Ismail of Universiti Malaya said a new regional bloc, while possible, would not shield the region from trade shocks if companies in the region continued to depend heavily on trade with the US.“If the US continues to impose high tariffs on countries in this region, the sudden drop in exports and earnings could still be severe, potentially leading to a regional recession,” he said.The two economists were commenting on a recent proposal by noted economist Woo Wing Thye who suggested an East Asian buffer bloc backed by the European Union, to shield its members from unpredictable tariff policies, particularly from US president Donald Trump.Afzanizam said “it might be wiser to make full use of existing agreements” such as the Asean-China free trade agreement and the Asia-Pacific regional pact known as RCEP involving Asean, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The RCEP is the world’s largest free trade agreement,Afzanizam said many small and medium enterprises still lacked awareness of existing trade agreements or the capacity to make use of the agreements.“If utilisation is low, then more effort is needed through outreach programmes to help them understand how to tap into these agreements to access overseas markets,” he said.Afzanizam said the purpose of trade deals was to make it easier for businesses to expand and be more productive. “I’m not sure if establishing a new economic bloc would truly help mitigate the impact of the US-China tariff war.”Nazari called for a focus on boosting long-term competitiveness against other companies in the region, and to build resilience in the domestic economy. “One key way to do this is by reducing debt levels in our economy. High indebtedness will weaken resilience over the long term.”On Wednesday, Woo had argued that Asean alone was “too small to stand on its own” as a region to withstand shocks from Trump’s tariffs.He said Asean needed to join hands with stronger allies such as Japan and South Korea to form a neutral economic bloc which could grow to twice the size of the US or China by 2045.","summary":"A new regional grouping might not be a shield against trade shocks if companies in the region continue to depend heavily on trade with the US.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2025/04/20/economists-call-for-better-use-of-trade-deals-instead-of-new-bloc/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/9bfa6a4e-sabah-container-ship-bernama-resize-190425.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:30:13","author":"Predeep Nambiar","authors":["Predeep Nambiar"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.315},{"id":312852628,"title":"World News | US Vice President Vance Meets Vatican Officials, Discusses Migrants, Refugees, and Prisoners","text":"Rome [Italy], April 20 (ANI): US Vice President JD Vance met with top Vatican officials on Saturday to exchange views on issues concerning migrants, refugees, and prisoners.

DOGE' if he ever makes it to No 10\n\nLISTEN: Trump, Zelensky, the rise of Europe’s Far Right and what’s next for NATO – listen to Alas Vine & Hitchens wherever you get your podcasts..\n\nBy ROBERT FOLKER\n\nPublished: 01:01 BST, 20 April 2025 | Updated: 01:18 BST, 20 April 2025\n\nNigel Farage is as likely as Sir Keir Starmer to become the new prime minister after the next election, according to a new poll.\n\nThe survey, by More in Common, reveals that the Reform UK leader is in joint poll position to make it to Downing Street in four years time.\n\nIt comes ahead of local elections on May 1, at which Mr Farage's party is looking to make notable breakthroughs.\n\nAfter consistently polling at over 20 per cent of the national vote all year, Reform has pushed the Conservatives into third place.\n\nVoters were asked who they thought would be the prime minister after the next election and 13 per cent of said Mr Farage.\n\nThis was the same as the percentage of people who think Sir Keir will still be prime minister in four years.\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch only received 5 per cent of the vote while Some 10 per cent backed a different Tory leader to become prime minister.\n\nAround 40 per cent admitted they did not know who would be the country's next leader. \n\nFarage said the Reform-run councils would introduce 'a British equivalent of DOGE in every single council'\n\nA new poll suggests the Reform leader is on an even footing with Sir Keir Starmer in the future race fofr No 10\n\nKemi Badenoch (pictured) has attacked what she sees as the civil service's reluctance to tackle 'difficult' issues\n\nLuke Tryl, the executive director of More in Common UK told the Telegraph: 'Only 13 per cent of Britons are confident Keir Starmer will remain in post after the next election, while a striking 41 per cent say they simply don't know what the next elected government will look like.\n\n'In fact, the public rate Nigel Farage's chances of becoming prime minister as highly as those of the current PM, with Reform voters particularly convinced their man will be walking into Downing Street.\n\n'It's yet another sign of the Reform leader's ability to cast a political shadow far larger than his party's presence in Westminster.'\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Farage warned Labour that Reform was 'parking our tanks on the Red Wall lawn' as he fired the starting gun on his party's local elections campaign.\n\nIn a major speech in Durham, the Reform leader insisted Labour had just as much to fear from his insurgent party as the Tories in its traditional working-class heartlands.\n\nHe even joked of a 'Nige-mare on Downing Street' as he taunted Sir Keir Starmer over the prospect of winning the next general election, with the populist party continuing to ride high in the polls.\n\nBut the Tories accused him of 'cosying up to the far-Left' in a cynical bid to win more votes after he used the speech to talk of the need for a 'good partnership' with militant trade union bosses.\n\nNigel Farage launched the Reform party's local election campaign in Durham earlier this week\n\nFarage joked of a 'Nige-mare on Downing Street' as he taunted Sir Keir Starmer over the prospect of winning the next general election\n\nFarage warns of 'Nige-mare on Downing Street' as he kickstarts local election campaign\n\nStriking a similar tone to Sir Keir in some of his speeches, Mr Farage added that 'a pragmatic, sensible relationship' was 'vital' when dealing with hard-Left barons.\n\nMr Farage added, however, that in the wake of the Birmingham bin strikes, he would take a 'firm but fair' approach with the unions if he were negotiating with them.\n\nIt comes after Reform led the crusade for nationalising British Steel and after Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader and MP for Skegness, wore a trade union Save Our Steel badge in the Commons chamber during a crunch debate last Saturday.\n\nAsked if Reform may propose nationalising further industries in the future, Mr Farage did not rule it out and said it was the party's aim to 're-industrialise' Britain.\n\nSpeaking on whether he really believed he could turn 'the Red Wall' – the label given to Labour heartlands in the Midlands and North – into 'the Reform Wall', he said: 'Yeah, you know what, I think voting has become much more transitory than it's ever been before. \n\n'And while Labour did win back the heartlands [in last year's general election], it was a loveless win in many of those seats, actually with fewer votes than they got under Jeremy Corbyn in 2019.'\n\nThe local elections on May 1, when 1,641 seats across 24 councils will be up for grabs, are the first Reform will stand in after winning five parliamentary seats in last year's election.\n\nAsked what a Reform-run council would look like, Mr Farage said the party would introduce 'a British equivalent of DOGE in every single council'. \n\nThis was a reference to US President Donald Trump's bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla tycoon Elon Musk.\n\nHe added: 'We've got to see the long-term contracts that many of these county or unitary authorities have signed up to.\n\n'We will look at the sums spent on DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives). A massive change of culture, that's what we're going to bring to these county councils.'\n\nHe also admitted that women have been more 'cautious' about voting Reform than men but insisted that new polling shows the split is now '50:50'.\n\nIt came after polling by Survation across Red Wall seats found Reform's support since the last election has soared from 18 to 30 per cent. \n\nAt the same time, Sir Keir's net rating in the North and Midlands was -26 per cent, based on 27 per cent approving of him and 53 per cent disapproving.\n\nBy contrast, the polling agency had Mr Farage on -4 and Tory leader Kemi Badenoch on -8.\n\nA Tory spokesman said: 'He's cosying up to the far-Left and will always side with vested interests, rather than the national interest.'\n\nThe Reform leader also called for a 'good partnership' with militant trade union bosses\n\nLabour has been mobilising in a bid to head off a Reform surge on May 1, with the premier turning his fire on Mr Farage.\n\nThe party's approach of ignoring the newcomers appears to have been abandoned, with strategists convinced Reform will be a bigger threat than the Tories by 2029.\n\nThe prime minister has been focusing on Mr Farage's NHS views, close ties to Donald Trump, and claims he has a soft stance on Russia.\n\nTony Blair's spin chief Alastair Campbell is said to have warned at a recent pep talk for Labour special advisers that they need to treat Reform as a more serious electoral threat.\n\nHe apparently suggested setting up a hit squad of backbench Labour MPs to attack Reform's policy positions.\n\nMr Farage's outfit has often been seen as eating into the Tory vote.\n\nBut the party came second in 98 seats at last year's general election - and 89 of them were won by Labour.\n\nReform UKKemi BadenochLabourKeir Starmer\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNigel Farage just as likely to be next PM as Keir Starmer, poll finds - as Reform leader vows to create 'British DOGE' if he ever makes it to No 10\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The survey, by More in Common, reveals that the Reform UK leader is in joint poll position with Sir Keir Starmer to make it to Downing Street in four years time.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14628823/Nigel-Farage-PM-Keir-Starmer-poll-Reform.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/20/00/97322589-0-Farage_said_the_Reform_run_councils_would_introduce_a_British_eq-a-23_1745107009322.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:18:25","author":"Editor,Robert Folker","authors":["Editor","Robert Folker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":312856036,"title":"The desperate measures comedians are taking to get on 'Kill Tony'","text":"Fresh off its Netflix debut, Tony Hinchcliffe's podcast 'Kill Tony' has prompted budding comedians to move lock, stock and barrel to Austin, Texas, for a shot at fame.\n\nAspiring comedians from across the country - and beyond - are uprooting their lives, draining their savings and spending hours on the road every week for just one chance: to get their name pulled out of a bucket on Kill Tony, the wildly popular live podcast.\n\nEvery Monday night in Austin, hopeful comedians line up outside Pour Choices - the bar catty-corner from Joe Rogan's Comedy Mothership - to enter a raffle known as the 'bucket pull'.\n\nIf their name is drawn, they get just 60 seconds to deliver a stand-up set in front of a rowdy live audience and a rotating panel of comedy heavyweights. For many, it's the ultimate gamble - a single minute that could propel them to fame.\n\nAnd some are going to extreme lengths for the shot.\n\nDusty Carter, 44, a general contractor in Fort Worth, drives 400 miles round trip every week and spends roughly $700 a month on diesel just to put his name in the bucket. \n\nOver the past two years, he’s entered the bucket over 100 times - and only been pulled once. \n\n'I look at it as going to college and paying my dues,' Carter told DailyMail.com.\n\nNow a talent coordinator for Kill Tony, he credits relentless persistence and networking at the show with helping him land the job.\n\nJason Farn, 31, moved to Texas for the sole purpose of increasing his odds.\n\nThe Waco-based ironworker works 58 hours a week and has entered 137 times - also with just one call-up to show for it.\n\nHe said he believes that being discovered on Kill Tony offers a more promising route than traditional networking efforts in New York and Los Angeles, which have historically been the epicenters of American entertainment.\n\n'I leave my house at 5am and don't get back from work until 7pm, and then I come straight to Austin,' he said. 'It's the number one comedy podcast in the world - I mean, why not?'\n\nBut while some grind away week after week without a shot, others seem to get lucky without trying.\n\nKent Hunter, 22, stocks shelves at HEB and works as a doorman at Vulcan Gas Company. He admits he's not a devoted fan and rarely listens to the podcast - yet he's been bucket-pulled six times. \n\n'It really is the luck of the draw,' he said. \n\nEven I know the shock of a surprise bucket pull firsthand - I was bucket pulled at Kill Tony's sold-out Madison Square Garden show.\n\nLaunched 11 years ago in the Belly Room of LA's Comedy Store with just four names in a bucket, Kill Tony found new life during the pandemic when host Tony Hinchcliffe and friends followed Joe Rogan to Austin, where live shows were still permitted.\n\nIn 2022, Rogan opened the Comedy Mothership, where Kill Tony now films weekly to a packed house.\n\nThough the show has been a comedy cult favorite for years, it reached a new stratosphere of popularity in the past year, selling out arenas across the country.\n\nOne pivotal moment came in July 2024, when Shane Gillis and Adam Ray impersonated Donald Trump and Joe Biden on the panel - a viral episode that helped the show gain 330,000 YouTube subscribers that month alone.\n\nThe once-underground show has exploded into a juggernaut.\n\nIt now racks up 15 million to 30 million monthly views, boasts 2.21 million YouTube subscribers, and recently debuted the first of three Netflix specials on April 7 - all without spending a dime on advertising.\n\nWith millions tuning in each month, the 'Kill Tony bump' - a fan-coined term for the career jolt that comes from crushing your minute - is very real, and often life-changing.\n\nKam Patterson, 26, went from mowing greens in Orlando to headlining sold-out comedy clubs at $30,000 per weekend, an insider close to the podcast reports.\n\nHans Kim, once living out of his van, said he now pulls in $10,000 a weekend, the comedian dished in a podcast interview with Caleb Hammer.\n\nDrew Nickens, 31, a former Air Force serviceman who once cleaned toilets in poker rooms, now reportedly earns upwards of $600 per 15-minute set after his breakout on the show, the insider adds.\n\nEven comics with disabilities have made names for themselves on the show's brutally honest stage, where the show's raffle system - and its roster of disabled 'golden ticket' winners - underscores its reputation as a 'safe space' for dark humor and a rare equal-opportunity platform where anyone truly has a shot.\n\nAhren Belisle, 30, a mute software engineer from Canada with cerebral palsy, delivers his sets via text-to-speech app.\n\nMartin Phillipps, who has muscular dystrophy and walks with a cane, refuses to rely on disability jokes.\n\nAnd Diamond Deb Miller, 66, who has Parkinson's Disease and tardive dyskinesia, has lined up 76 times - and still hasn't been called.\n\nSometimes, a spot on the show comes too soon.\n\nQuinn Collins, 27, a waitress at Sunset Strip Comedy Club, said she fell victim to the 'Kill Tony curse' - getting pulled before she had enough stage experience.\n\n'I didn't do bad, but I was just way too new to comedy,' she said. 'I definitely want to try again to prove how much I've evolved since then.'\n\nThat one minute of stage time isn't just about telling jokes. It's a high-pressure test of timing, delivery, and vulnerability.\n\nIvory Jones, 44, has spent over $15,000 commuting from his farm in Elmo to Austin every Monday. He insists the time limit is the perfect challenge.\n\n'The judges can tell three things based on your one-minute performance: whether or not you are comfortable on stage, can you get laughs that roll the room, and can you get a pop every 10 seconds,' said Jones.\n\n'If you can do all that and be relatable and let us know anything personal about you in those 60 seconds, you're golden.","summary":"Aspiring comedians from across the country - and beyond - are uprooting their lives, draining their savings and spending hours on the road every week to get to Austin for the chance of fame.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14625605/desperate-measures-comedians-kill-tony-netflix-show.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/18/19/97439079-0-image-m-68_1745000693522.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/18/6780269239906120865/1024x576_MP4_6780269239906120865.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:17:20","author":"Alexa Cimino,Editor","authors":["Alexa Cimino","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.007},{"id":312851908,"title":"Putin declares unilateral Easter truce, asks Kyiv to reciprocate","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a unilateral 30-hour Easter ceasefire in Ukraine on Saturday, after Washington said it could abandon peace talks within days unless the Moscow and Kyiv show they are ready to stop the war.Putin ordered fighting to stop as of 6 pm Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday night.“Based on humanitarian considerations...the Russian side announces an Easter truce.

He’s kidnapping students. He’s eviscerating the checks and balances,” Mr Bryant said. “This is fascism.”\n\nIn Washington, Bob Fasick, a 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, said he came out to the rally near the White House out of concern over threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, Social Security and other federal safety-net programmes.\n\nThe Trump administration, among other things, has moved to shutter Social Security Administration field offices, cut funding for government health programmes and scale back protections for transgender people.\n\n“I cannot sit still knowing that if I don’t do anything and everybody doesn’t do something to change this, that the world that we collectively are leaving for the little children, for our neighbours is simply not one that I would want to live,” Mr Fasick said.\n\nIn Columbia, South Carolina, several hundred people protested at the statehouse holding signs with slogans such as “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight”.\n\nAnd in Manhattan, protesters rallied against continued deportations of immigrants as they marched from the New York Public Library north toward Central Park and past Trump Tower.\n\n“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted to a steady drumbeat, referring to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMarshall Green said he is most concerned that Mr Trump invoked the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 by claiming the country is at war with Venezuelan gangs linked to the South American nation’s government, even though a recent US intelligence assessment found no co-ordination between them.\n\n“Congress should be stepping up and saying no, we are not at war. You cannot use that,” said the 61-year-old from Morristown, New Jersey.\n\n“You cannot deport people without due process, and everyone in this country has the right to due process no matter what.”\n\nMeanwhile Melinda Charles, of Connecticut, said she worries about “executive overreach”, citing clashes with the federal courts, Harvard University and other elite colleges.\n\n“We’re supposed to have three equal branches of government,” she said, “and to have the executive branch become so strong, I mean it’s just unbelievable”.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/anti-trump-protesters-rally-across-000816029.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0T4XbEagh8SgNkyXDDJzXQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_704/5bb1146e96d6b66caac4b74558ed325c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:08:16","author":"Philip Marcelo, Associated Press","authors":["Philip Marcelo, Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.303},{"id":312853102,"title":"Carville rips ‘supremely naive’ Bill Maher for meeting Trump and praising his hospitality","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville said he thinks HBO host Bill Maher was fooled by President Donald Trump’s charm during their recent White House meeting.\n\nThe former Bill Clinton adviser and his co-host Al Hunt criticized the “Real Time with Bill Maher” host for having the meeting in a portion of their “Politics War Room” podcast that was released on Saturday and flagged by Mediaite.\n\n“I think the problem that people have with Bill – I have the same one – is you’re kind of leading legitimacy and credence to this,” Carville said, saying that Maher is normalizing Trump, who he elsewhere said “s—-” on the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMaher, a staunch, longtime critic of Trump, had dinner with Trump at the White House earlier this month. While finally recapping the meeting during his HBO show last week, the host marveled at how “gracious and measured” the president was behind closed doors.\n\n“I never felt I had to walk on eggshells around him,” Maher told his “Real Time” audience. “And honestly, I voted for Clinton and Obama, but I would never feel comfortable talking to them the way I was able to talk with Donald Trump. That’s just how it went down. Make of it what you will. Me? I feel it’s emblematic of why the Democrats are so unpopular these days.”\n\nDuring a podcast appearance later that week, Maher responded to backlash he got from the left for the meeting.\n\n“I had the opportunity to go to the White House and talk to the president and not give up my principles. It seems like nobody noticed that,” Maher said. “I didn’t go MAGA. I had the opportunity to talk to Donald Trump and say things to him that maybe he never hears, literally to speak truth to power. I shouldn’t take that opportunity?”\n\nOn their program, Hunt told Carville he thought Maher had been “had,” or duped into finding Trump charming.\n\n“I think Bill Maher was had. He went there and he talked about how charming and nice Trump was. This was the same guy that day who was reveling in a guy who was illegally deported to El Salvador and refuses to bring him back, who loves to hurt people, loves to inflict pain.”\n\n“But, you know, Bill is just the latest in a whole series of people who get had by the personal charm, if you will, of some really bad people,” Hunt continued.\n\nCarville chimed in, stating that while he considers Maher a “friend,” he believes he was duped as well.\n\n“I think [Maher’s] a supremely naive man,” the strategist declared, reminding his audience that the comedian met with “somebody who s—- on the Constitution.”\n\n“That’s exactly what he does – has been caught lying 36,411 times or whatever that number is… someone who’s convicted of 34 felonies in a court of competent jurisdiction, a person who set up every grift that you can imagine,” he said.\n\nHunt replied, “I agree with you on the naiveté. When you lie down with dogs, you get fleas.”\n\nReps for Bill Maher did not immediately reply to Fox News Digital for comment.","summary":"Maher responded to backlash over the meeting, calling himself a 'hero' for speaking to Trump and keeping his principles.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/19/media/carville-rips-supremely-naive-bill-maher-for-meeting-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-g8df6br1r-1745107376567.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1745092985&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/CitAl28D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:05:34","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.55},{"id":312850172,"title":"Putin announces 30 hour Ukraine ceasefire over Easter.

I order that all military actions be stopped for this period,” Putin said at a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, the Kremlin’s Press Service quoted him as saying. “We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the ceasefire “another attempt by Putin to play with human lives.” He wrote on X that “air raid alerts are spreading across Ukraine,” and “Shahed drones in our skies reveal Putin’s true attitude toward Easter and toward human life.” The two sides meanwhile exchanged hundreds of POWs on Saturday. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said that 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that “as a gesture of goodwill” 31 wounded Ukrainian POWs were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care. Both sides thanked the United Arab Emirates for their mediation. In a further post, Zelenskyy welcomed the prisoner of war exchange, saying that 277 Ukrainian servicemen had returned. In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March “agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,” which Russia rejected. Putin’s ceasefire announcement comes after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are “coming to a head” and insisted that neither side is “playing” him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary Easter ceasefire in Ukraine, as Russia and Ukraine swapped hundreds of captured soldiers in the largest exchange since Moscow's full-scale invasion started over three years ago.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/20/putin-announces-36-hour-ukraine-ceasefire-over-easter","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/21/67/92/1440x810_cmsv2_b0e988b8-3b92-5cba-882a-40f9bae3e29e-9216792.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:04:25","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":312850370,"title":"Anti-Trump protesters decry 'dangerous time in America'","text":"Opponents of President Donald Trump's administration have taken to the streets of communities large and small across the US, decrying what they see as threats to the nation's democratic ideals.\n\nThe disparate events on Saturday ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration of \"the shot heard 'round the world\" on April 19, 1775, marking the start of the Revolutionary War 250 years ago.\n\nThomas Bassford was among the demonstrators at the re-enactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside Boston.

Australia is expected to incur costs of A$368 billion (US$234.3 billion) for the deal by 2055, according to government estimates.\n“However, there are some risks in the timetable, especially if the US cannot increase its submarine building capacity, or if there are challenges in the UK with the first of the SSN Aukus boats in the 2040s.”\nThe US is likely to require additional funding for the submarines, according to Davis. Washington has already suggested that Canberra is not spending enough on defence.\nElbridge Colby, the US undersecretary of defence for policy, has said that Australia should spend 3 per cent of its gross domestic product – up from its current 2 per cent – on defence. The Pentagon policy chief previously criticised the Aukus agreement over concerns it would leave the US with limited submarine capacity.\nNoting that Australia was doing “too little, too late” to respond to the growing threat environment, Davis said the Trump administration could pressure the next government in Australia to increase defence spending after the country’s election in May.\n“If we don’t, then it is possible that questions might be asked about Aukus,” Davis said, pointing out that if the risk of delays in acquiring the Virginia-class submarines were to increase, calls for a “Plan B” would grow louder. The alternative plan involves building smaller and cheaper French Suffren-class submarines.\n\nDavis, however, said he supported a “Plan A Plus”, which would keep Aukus on track with investments in complementary defence capabilities in areas such as air, space and cyber to offset any potential setbacks in submarine delivery.\n“Of course, that does demand an increase in defence spending … is the [Australian] government willing to do that? I’d hope so,” he said.\nIan Hall, an international-relations professor at Australia’s Griffith University, said the bigger issue was the damage that the new tariffs could do to the US economy, which was doing quite well “but which is now threatened by a global loss of confidence in the reliability of Washington”.\nTom Corben, a research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, said tariffs would have major ramifications for Washington’s goal of encouraging allies to do more to share the burden of defence spending and look after their own security.\nIt was also possible that the Trump administration could ask Australia to make further financial contributions to the US submarine industrial base, Corben added.\n“The irony is that America needs the industrial capacity of its allies and partners to build the very same weapons that it wants these same allies and partners to buy, let alone the ones that America needs to meet its own defence requirements,” Corben said.\n\nHe added that Australia had done well to show to the second Trump administration that Aukus was good for the US, due to the investments in the US defence industrial base and expanded access to Australian navy facilities for the replenishment and repair of US submarines.\nNonetheless, the US tariffs could lead to higher costs of components and technologies required to build the submarines.\n“Tariffs that hurt allied industries and raise the costs of defence trade will only undercut those [burden-sharing] objectives,” Corben said.","summary":"About one-third of the steel and aluminium used in US naval vessels, including the Aukus submarines, have been hit by Donald Trump’s tariffs.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3307109/will-us-tariffs-sink-australias-aukus-submarine-delivery-goals","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/18/0652600b-91f7-404d-8242-ccc781b77f10_ed99999d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-20 00:00:09","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":312849364,"title":"Sudan and South Sudan conflicts: Fleeing civilians trapped in border town of Renk","text":"Hundreds wait under a scorching sun to board metal boats bound for Malakal.

If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”The result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganisation of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.Lombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.”It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National economic council director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.President Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.Even so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.On tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.The 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.The finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.On Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.","summary":"Finance minister Eric Lombard says the move could further harm US credibility, escalating the bond market impact.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/04/20/france-warns-firing-powell-would-hurt-dollar-us-economy/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1ead1c82-jerome-powell_1600x1000_1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 23:33:08","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":312850834,"title":"Emmanuel Macron to make UK state visit for first time – months before Donald Trump makes trip to meet King Charles","text":"EMMANUEL Macron is to make a UK state visit for the first time - months before Donald Trump makes his own trip to meet King Charles.\n\nThe French president has been invited by the King to visit at the end of next month as it marks eight years since he first took office.\n\nThe plans of the visit are being kept strictly under wraps, with a mere few government and royal officials having knowledge on who's been invited and the timings.\n\nUS President Trump suggested on Thursday from the Oval Office that his own visit was being planned for September.\n\nHe said of his second invitation: \"The reason is we have two separate terms, and it’s an honour.\n\n\"I’m a friend of Charles, I have great respect for King Charles and the family, William, we have really just a great respect for the family.\"\n\nThe invitation from Charles was revealed when Sir Keir Starmer visited Washington in February.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump publicly accepted the King’s invitation and said: “The answer is yes.

The demonstrations took different forms — some were marches, others were food drives, and others still were voter registration events — but all focused on the same purpose: to rise against what organizers call “authoritarian threats, political overreach, and the erosion of democracy.”\n\nIt’s not immediately clear how many people participated in Saturday’s protests but photos captured swaths of Americans’ discontent with the administration’s dismantling of government agencies, treatment of immigrants, and attitude toward the rule of law.\n\nA day earlier, demonstrations across the country cropped up near Tesla dealerships in a statement about the involvement of Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and Trump’s senior adviser. The tech billionaire has been tasked with slashing government contracts, shrinking the federal workforce, and reducing the federal government’s real estate footprint. Saturday’s protests come just two weeks after the nationwide “Hands Off” protests when millions took to the streets to denounce the efforts of Trump and Musk.\n\nTeri Lenfest, a 79-year-old docent at California Academy of Sciences and San Francisco Zoo, showed up to the San Francisco protest dressed as Captain America with “punch Nazis” written on a shield.\n\n“I've been protesting for 60 years…There has never been anything like this in my life. Never,” Lenfest told The Independent. “It’s horrifying and terrifying. I'm watching my country be destroyed really fast and I feel hopeless,” she said. \n\nLenfest, who served in the Women’s Army Corps, said: “This is my country, I fought for this country, I was in the service, I put my life on the line for this country and the Trump administration has dismantled everything – they ignore the laws, they flaunt their criminality, they're disgusting, rude, vulgar.” Trump has not been formally accused of committing a crime related to the policies implemented during his second term.\n\nProtesters in Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. held up signs calling to “Free Kilmar,” a reference to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongfully deported Salvadoran father living in Maryland whom the Trump administration has labeled as a MS-13 gang member. Abrego Garcia’s family and his attorneys have denied these claims. \n\nHe was sent to a brutal mega-prison known as CECOT in El Salvador last month. The administration admitted it made an “administrative error” and judges — as well as the Supreme Court — have ordered the administration to “facilitate” his release, but Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele have refused to commit to do so. This week during a trip to El Salvador, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen learned that Abrego Garcia had been moved from CECOT to a different facility; he remains in the country while his attorneys fight for his return.\n\nSome demonstrators held up signs saying “due process is for everyone” while others carried signs boasting the names of international students who have been detained by immigration enforcement authorities. Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, and Columbia senior Mohsen Mahdawi were among the names plastered on signs. Mahdawi, a student activist and green card holder, was arrested this week when he arrived for a citizenship interview. Some protesters held up signs saying they were “kidnapped” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Rule of law is America!” one sign held by a New York City protester read. In recent weeks, Trump officials have been accused of making “likely unconstitutional\" moves, removing U.S. residents to be held in foreign prisons “without due process”, and defying court orders In one case, a judge said he found probable cause to hold the administration in criminal contempt of court.\n\nPaul Wermer, a retired 70-year-old, marched in San Francisco while carrying a sign that said: “Honor the Constitution.”\n\nWermer told The Independent: “My dad was a refugee from the Nazis and what I see happening here is in many ways similar to what I heard him talking about as a child.”\n\n“People being disappeared, picked up off the street…The strange relationship between Trump and Putin and Trump and Netanyahu is vaguely reminiscent of Hitler and Mussolini, or Hitler and Stalin before they turned on each other,” Wermer continued. \n\nOthers also made comparisons to dictators, including citing Trump’s own declaration that he is a “king.” \n\n“No kings, no dictator, no Trump!” one demonstrator’s sign read just outside the White House gate. Another sign nearby depicted Trump with a Hitler-esque mustache along with the words: “Mein Trumpf.”\n\nMeanwhile, the president spent the day at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia.","summary":"‘I've been protesting for 60 years…There has never been anything like this in my life.

(AP pic)TORONTO: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s campaign platform plans released on Saturday include tax cuts and new spending on infrastructure and defence, as he pledges a new economic order that is less reliant on the US.Carney has campaigned on his experience managing crises while running the central bank of Canada during the 2008 financial crisis and that of Britain during Brexit. He often says he is the best person to stand up to US President Donald Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened to annex the country.“We’re in an enormous crisis, so we have to be able to do two things. One, hold down on that wasteful spending, which we will do, but much more than that, we need to be bold and drive investment in the economy and take the amazing opportunities we have,” Carney said at a press conference.Carney has also aimed to distance himself from predecessor Justin Trudeau by promising a leaner government.Carney’s plan would push the federal government’s deficit to 1.96% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the 2025-26 fiscal year, down to 1.83% of GDP the following year, and to 1.35% by 2028-29, the platform says.Trudeau’s government had last forecast a deficit of 1.6% of GDP for the previous fiscal year that ended in March.Carney plans to break up spending into operating and capital spending, which would be new in Canada.Carney told the press conference government spending had been growing by around 9% every year and his government would bring that rate of spending growth to around 2% without cutting any transfers to provinces, territories or individuals.He promised to balance the operating budget over the next three years.“Our plan gets government spending under control because the government has been spending too much and Canada has been investing too little,” Carney said.Carney plans to increase defence spending to exceed a Nato target of 2% of GDP and said Canada would invest in transatlantic security with “like minded” European partners.","summary":"The PM sees a new economic order less reliant on the US, investing in security with European partners.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/business/2025/04/20/carney-vows-tax-cuts-defence-boost-in-canada-election-bid/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8cbaac2c-mark-carney.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 23:12:30","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.279},{"id":312845600,"title":"Thousands protest, as new round of anti-Trump rallies hits US cities","text":"Thousands of protesters rallied on Saturday in New York, Washington and other cities across the United States for a second major round of demonstrations against Donald Trump and his hardline policies.\nIn New York, people gathered outside the city’s main library carrying signs targeting the US president with slogans like “No Kings in America” and “Resist Tyranny”.\nMany took aim at Trump’s deportations of undocumented migrants, chanting “No ICE, no fear, immigrants are welcome here”, a reference to the role of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in rounding up migrants.\nIn Washington, protesters voiced concern that Trump was threatening long-respected constitutional norms, including the right to due process.\nThe administration is carrying out “a direct assault on the idea of the rule of law and the idea that the government should be restrained from abusing the people who live here in the United States,” Benjamin Douglas, 41, said outside the White House.\nWearing a keffiyeh and carrying a sign calling for the freeing of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian student protester arrested last month, Douglas said individuals were being singled out as “test cases to rile up xenophobia and erode long-standing legal protections”.\n\n“We are in a great danger,” said 73-year-old New York protester Kathy Valy, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, adding that their stories of how Nazi leader Adolf Hitler rose to power “are what’s happening here.”\n“The one thing is that Trump is a lot more stupid than Hitler or than the other fascists,” she said. “He’s being played … and his own team is divided.”\nDaniella Butler, 26, said she wanted to “call attention specifically to the defunding of science and health work” by the government.\nStudying for a PhD in immunology at Johns Hopkins University, she was carrying a map of Texas covered with spots in reference to the ongoing measles outbreak there.\nTrump’s health chief Robert F.

On Friday, Washington even threatened to withdraw from talks if no progress was made.\"Today from 1800 (1500 GMT) to midnight Sunday (2100 GMT Sunday), the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said earlier Saturday in televised comments during a meeting with the Russian chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov.Zelensky responded by saying Ukraine would follow suit, and proposed extending the truce beyond Sunday. But the Ukrainian leader also accused Russia of having already broken its promises. 'Give peace a chance'Air-raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and several other regions Saturday evening.\"Russian assault operations continue on several frontline sectors, and Russian artillery fire has not subsided,\" Zelensky said.Putin had said the truce for the Easter holiday celebrated on Sunday was motivated by \"humanitarian reasons\".While he expected Ukraine to comply, he said that Russian troops \"must be ready to resist possible breaches of the truce and provocations by the enemy\".Zelensky in a social media post wrote: \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly -- mirroring Russia's actions.\"He added: \"If a complete ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond the Easter day of April 20.\"He proposed that \"30 days could give peace a chance\", while pointing out that Putin had earlier rejected a proposed 30-day full and unconditional ceasefire. 'Killings will continue'\"The fighting is ongoing, and Russian attacks continue,\" Ukraine's military command, the Chief of Staff, reported Saturday evening.\"In some areas on the frontline, Russian artillery continues to be heard, despite the promise of silence from the Russian leader. Russian drones are being used. It is quieter in some areas.\"Soldiers in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk close to the front line earlier greeted the truce announcement with scepticism..Putin \"might do it to give some hope or to show his humanity,\" said Dmitry, a 40-year-old soldier. \"But either way, of course, we don't trust (Russia).Putin said the latest truce proposal would show \"how sincere is the Kyiv's regime's readiness, its desire and ability to observe agreements and participate in a process of peace talks\".Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. 'No trust'Ukraine last month agreed to Trump's proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, only for Putin to reject it.\"For millions of Ukrainians, Easter is one of the most important holidays. And millions of Ukrainians will go to church,\" said Zelensky in his evening address.\"Over the years of this full-scale war, Russian attacks have destroyed or damaged more than six hundred churches, prayer houses and places of worship.\"In Kramatorsk, one soldier, Vladislav, 22, recalled a ceasefire agreement soon after the start of armed hostilities in 2014, the year Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. That truce had collapsed days afterwards, he said.\"I feel like it's going to start again after a while, and it's going to go on and on,\" he said of the conflict.On the streets of Moscow Yevgeny Pavlov, 58, said he did not think Russia should give Ukraine a breather.\"There is no need to give them respite. If we press, it means we should press to the end,\" he told AFP.Earlier Saturday, Ukraine and Russia said they had each returned 246 soldiers being held as prisoners of war in a swap mediated by the UAE. Zelensky said the total of returned POWs now stood at 4,552.Russia also said it had retaken the penultimate village still under Ukrainian control in its Kursk frontier region.Kyiv had hoped to use its hold on the region as a bargaining chip in the talks.

Iran has denied any wrongdoing but has since rolled back its commitments under the JCPOA, increasing its enrichment of uranium.\n\n“Iran’s nuclear program is completely peaceful, and Iran is ready to dispel any doubts in this regard,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Saturday.\n\nTechnical experts are scheduled to meet again ahead of the next round of negotiations between Witkoff and Araghchi in Oman on April 26, according to the Iranian foreign minister.","summary":"The US and Iran held indirect negotiations in Rome on Saturday \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/616008-us-iran-talks-nuclear/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/68042bf585f54001e0613f10.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 23:05:08","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":312850508,"title":"Bay Area protesters rally against Trump Administration","text":"Waving American flags and calling for an end to “fascism,” herds of protesters across the Bay Area rallied against President Donald Trump’s administration Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe proclaimed “No Kings” protests drew thousands of supporters, stretching across the country in cities from California to Washington D.C and New York. Organizers say they’re protesting against what they view as Trump’s civil rights and constitutional violations, including efforts to deport scores of immigrants, shrink social security benefits and scale back on the federal government by dismissing thousands of government workers and entire agencies.\n\nThe protests come just two weeks after similar nationwide anti-Trump rallies also attracted thousands.\n\nRoughly 2,000 people in downtown San Jose lined the block of St. James Park, chanting “This is what democracy looks like,” and holding colorful signs that read “Remove the Dictator,” and “Hands Off our Democracy.”\n\nSaturday’s protest also coincided with the 250th anniversary of the Revolutionary War, a gesture many protesters, like Sunnyvale resident Karen Hurst, found symbolic.\n\nHurst trekked through the park wearing a yellow craft crown on her head with the word “King” written on it — but X’ed out.\n\n“Two-hundred and fifty years ago, we decided we weren’t going to have kings in this country,” the 58-year-old said, referencing the Revolutionary War “It seems like right now we’re headed in the wrong direction and towards someone who wants to be a king.”\n\nHurst, who is a teacher at San Jose City College, said she is protesting to support her students. Many are immigrants or international students, Hurst said, who are afraid to come to class.\n\n“It makes me angry, I want to defend them,” she said.\n\nA couple of yards away, Santa Clara resident Tom Thomas carried a purple flag that read “Don’t Give Up the Ship,” a reference to the U.S’s famous battle cry during the War of 1812. To Thomas, the phrase is meant to encourage people to not give up on democracy.\n\n“This (dictatorship) has happened to other countries before, and to think that this can’t happen in the United States is just ridiculous,” the 53-year-old said. “We have to do stuff like this, we have to do more than this.”\n\nIn Santa Cruz, several hundred people gathered at the corner of Ocean and Water streets at a busy intersection near the county government center to protest Trump and his policies.\n\nThe demonstrators, many of whom were seniors, held signs saying “Hands of Social Security and Medicare,” “Resist,” and “Nobody elected Elon Musk.” Several people carried upside down American flags, to signal their distress while dozens of motorists drove by, honking in support.\n\nOver in San Francisco, close to 1,000 people gathered at Civic Center Plaza, many waving homemade signs that also criticized the current administration.\n\nHolding a large American flag, San Francisco resident Andrew Hudlow said the anti-Trump movement is for “all Americans.”\n\n“I’m here because I’m concerned about democracy,” the newly-minted lawyer said. “I know history, I know what happens in other countries. I know what the start of authoritarianism looks like, and that’s what we’re seeing right now. If nobody backs up the courts, then it’s just Trump, and that’s not the country I want to live in.”\n\nAlso among the crowds was 72-year-old Hal Christiansen, walking slowly with a cane in one hand and a sign that read, “Hands off my Social Security” in another. The San Francisco resident relies on social security for his income. Despite his health issues, Christiansen said he wanted to came out and support the cause.\n\n“I really, really care about my country,” he said. “My third great grandfather fought in the Revolutionary War, and I will lay down my life to fight against a dictator. I’m here today to show my strong feelings. I’ve had several strokes, so I don’t walk well, I have neuropathy in my feet, and crowds frighten me. But I am here to support my people.”\n\nSimilar sentiments were found in Berkeley. A few hundred people gathered at the North Berkeley BART, holding signs and encouraging passersby to honk and support.\n\nResident Darlene Wang showed up to the protest wearing a Revolutionary War era costume and carrying a sign that read “Time for Revolution.”\n\n“I think what is happening to the nation is deplorable,” Wang said. “So it’s time to show up, be loud, make your voices known and make your body seen, and to put up a fuss. This is not normal and it is not right.”\n\nStaff writer Paul Rogers contributed to this report.","summary":"Organizers say they're protesting against what they view as Trump’s civil rights and constitutional violations.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/19/bay-area-protesters-rally-against-trump-administration/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SJM-L-DAYOFACTION-0420-9.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 23:02:24","author":"Harriet Blair Rowan,Stephanie Lam","authors":["Harriet Blair Rowan","Stephanie Lam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":312845814,"title":"The Global South will pay for Trump’s trade war","text":"US president Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have unleashed economic chaos, roiling stock and bond markets and triggering panic around the world, especially in lower-income countries that rely heavily on exports to the US. The result could be an entirely manufactured global recession, with the developing world bearing the brunt.The brief calm in financial markets following Trump’s abrupt announcement of a 90-day “pause” on most of his “reciprocal” tariffs – excluding those on Chinese imports, which he raised to 145% – has proven premature.While some billionaires and loyalists may have made a killing by correctly interpreting Trump’s social media posts ahead of his sudden policy reversal, the disruptions to global trade and finance caused by his tariffs continue to pose serious risks.Moreover, despite the pause on some tariffs, a universal 10% tariff on all US imports remains in effect, along with sector-specific tariffs of 25% on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and auto parts.There are new exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices, even as Trump has also threatened new duties on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, and lumber. Taken together, these measures will reduce the availability of imported goods, raise prices for US consumers, and impose steep costs on exporting countries.But ultimately, the tariffs imposed on each country will depend on future negotiations, where the US is expected to play hardball. Trump has already made clear his disdain for foreign leaders, boasting that many were “kissing my ass” and willing to “do anything” to reverse the tariffs. As a result, the final scope of Trump’s tariffs remains uncertain.Most critically, Trump’s latest tariff hike on Chinese imports all but ensures that the Sino-American trade war will continue to escalate.The increase to 145% is largely symbolic – a tit-for-tat move after China raised its own tariffs – since the previous 104% rate had already made most Chinese imports commercially unviable. In effect, the administration has signalled its intent to shut down trade with China.The implications for US consumers and domestic producers that rely on Chinese inputs are profound. Trump’s open distrust of goods from Chinese-owned factories – even when routed through third countries – has forced governments hoping to maintain access to the US market to scramble for alternative sourcing and production options.The mere expectation of such shifts has already severely disrupted global supply chains.Uncertainty has always been a major deterrent to economic activity, and the unpredictability of the Trump administration’s policies – marked by erratic decision-making, sudden reversals, and on-again, off-again announcements – has made future developments nearly impossible to anticipate using standard risk models.Trump’s preference for shock-and-awe tactics, reminiscent of other “strongmen” like Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, compounds the problem.Rising uncertainty will inevitably discourage investment, as businesses shelve new projects and postpone planned expansions while waiting to see how events unfold. The subsequent slowdown could weigh heavily on US growth and employment, with consequences that extend far beyond the direct economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.Worse still, the US cannot win its trade war with China. The Chinese government clearly knows this and is playing the long game. At any moment, the two superpowers’ economic war of attrition could spiral into a major financial crisis or even a military confrontation.The alarm bells are already ringing. The falloff in demand for US Treasury bills, long considered the world’s safest asset, signals diminishing confidence in America’s economic leadership.Moreover, the simultaneous drop in US stocks, bonds, and the dollar points to growing doubts about US Treasuries’ ability to serve as the global benchmark for asset prices, even as they remain the preferred vehicle for high-volume financial transactions.As with previous self-inflicted economic crises, the US economy will undoubtedly suffer, but the heaviest burden will fall on the developing world. Cancelled or delayed export orders are already undermining production and fuelling unemployment.Meanwhile, financial volatility is threatening economic stability long before the full impact of Trump’s tariffs can be felt.These developments are already reflected in the yield spreads on developing countries’ sovereign bonds, particularly those of lower- and middle-income economies. In the month leading up to April 9, emerging-market sovereign dollar debt values fell by an average of 2.9%, while average yields rose to 7.4%. The sovereign bonds of debt-stressed countries like the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Gabon, and Zambia dropped by more than 10%.Unfortunately, developing countries are all too familiar with this kind of financial and economic turmoil. For decades, many have been trapped in a cycle of currency depreciation, rising borrowing costs, strained public finances, forced spending cuts, and domestic market instability that constrained investment and private-sector activity.The lessons for developing economies are clear. Not only is globalised trade being upended, but financial globalisation is bound to become even less appealing to countries seeking stable, long-term financing to support their development goals.Trump is determined to dismantle the global economic order, which in his view allows other countries to take advantage of the US. In response, many developing economies will likely begin to reconsider their participation in – and subordination to – an unequal system that no longer serves their interests. But the road ahead will remain perilous until a credible alternative takes shape.

Their trips do not, however, highlight the deplorable conditions of CECOT, which the State Department under President Joe Biden described in 2023 as “harsh and life threatening.”\n\nThe visits to the facility, where Maryland father Kilmar Abrego Garcia is wrongly being detained, are the latest chapter of the right’s love affair with state-sanctioned abuse and torture.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has often openly expressed his love of abuse. In one disturbing instance in 2017, he laughed as he told a crowd of police officers in New York that they should abuse people as they arrest them.\n\nDiscussing the practice of protecting suspects’ heads as they are loaded into police cars, he said, “You can take the hand off.” \n\nTrump used much of his first term to endorse police brutality, particularly of Black people. He lashed out at Black Lives Matters protests and encouraged police officers to attack protesters.\n\nBut long before Trump entered politics, this mindset has been mainstream with Republicans.\n\nUnder President George W. Bush, one of the key methods used in response to terrorism was torture, which the administration tried to sell to the public as “enhanced interrogation.” \n\nA 2008 ABC News report revealed that senior Bush administration officials were given briefings on how people who were detained would be abused. ABC noted that “some of the interrogation sessions were almost choreographed—down to the number of times CIA agents could use a specific tactic.”\n\nThe Bush administration faced worldwide condemnation in 2004 after pictures and recordings of torture emerged from Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison. \n\nDespite claims that torture was used to find weapons of mass destruction and 9/11 mastermind Osaba bin Laden, the Bush administration did not find any WMDs in Iraq. Similarly, bin Laden was not found and eventually killed until years later under President Barack Obama.\n\nRight-wing media has of course fulfilled its decades-long role by supporting torture and abuse and defending the use of those techniques by Republican officials. Under the Bush administration, Fox News would often praise the use of torture as a terror-fighting tool, pointing to the fictional television series “24” as proof.\n\nWhen the stomach-turning Abu Ghraib torture evidence surfaced, now-deceased conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh excused the human rights abuses by comparing it to college fraternity hazing, saying that the torture was done to “blow some steam” while “having a good time.”\n\nBut what is the motivation behind this blasé attitude toward human rights abuses and embracing barbaric techniques that are proven to be ineffective in fighting crime and terrorism?\n\nConservatism is weak. \n\nProblems like immigration, terrorism, and crime are complex. There is no magical button to make the fallout from these issues disappear. These are systemic issues that have to be addressed from multiple angles, which sometimes involves diplomacy, science, study, and reason.\n\nConservatism would rather tell the public that the bad people will go away as long as they act “tough” instead of addressing root causes, which sometimes can indicate that the United States’ actions created the problem or made the problem worse. The right would rather just back torture and abuse—particularly if the subjects in question have brown skin.\n\nThe right loves to use all-hands approaches as evidence of left-wing weakness and disconnection from reality. But while none of these issues has been solved, real progress has been made without violating core international and American principles.\n\nIt’s weak to resort to abuse and torture and posing in front of incarcerated people to get clout with the in-crowd. What is stronger is standing up against abuse and championing human rights. \n\nBut the right would rather choose the easy path, and we all reap the whirlwind of the blowback.","summary":"In recent weeks, Republican officials have taken part in the ghoulish spectacle of posing for photos in front of immigrants being held in El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

(AP pic)NEW YORK: Thousands of protesters rallied Saturday in New York, Washington and other cities across the US for a second major round of demonstrations against Donald Trump and his hard-line policies.In New York, people gathered outside the city’s main library carrying signs targeting the US president with slogans like “No Kings in America” and “Resist Tyranny.”Many took aim at Trump’s deportations of undocumented migrants, chanting “No ICE, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” a reference to the role of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in rounding up migrants.In Washington, protesters voiced concern that Trump was threatening long-respected constitutional norms, including the right to due process.The administration is carrying out “a direct assault on the idea of the rule of law and the idea that the government should be restrained from abusing the people who live here in the US,” Benjamin Douglas, 41, told AFP outside the White House.Wearing a keffiyeh and carrying a sign calling for the freeing of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian student protester arrested last month, Douglas said individuals were being singled out as “test cases to rile up xenophobia and erode long-standing legal protections.”“We are in a great danger,” said 73-year-old New York protester Kathy Valy, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, adding that their stories of how Nazi leader Adolf Hitler rose to power “are what’s happening here.”“The one thing is that Trump is a lot more stupid than Hitler or than the other fascists,” she said. “He’s being played… and his own team is divided.”‘Science ignored’Daniella Butler, 26, said she wanted to “call attention specifically to the defunding of science and health work” by the government.Studying for a PhD in immunology at Johns Hopkins University, she was carrying a map of Texas covered with spots in reference to the ongoing measles outbreak there.Trump’s health chief Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a noted vaccine skeptic, spent decades falsely linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) jab to autism.“When science is ignored, people die,” Butler said.In deeply conservative Texas, the coastal city of Galveston saw a small gathering of anti-Trump demonstrators.“This is my fourth protest and typically I would sit back and wait for the next election,” said 63-year-old writer Patsy Oliver. “We cannot do that right now. We’ve lost too much already.”On the West Coast, several hundred people gathered on a beach in San Francisco to spell out the words “IMPEACH + REMOVE,” the San Francisco Chronicle reported.Others nearby held an upside-down US flag, traditionally a symbol of distress.Organisers hope to use building resentment over Trump’s immigration crackdown, his drastic cuts to government agencies and his pressuring of universities, news media and law firms, to forge a lasting movement.The chief organiser of Saturday’s protests – the group 50501, a number representing 50 protests in 50 states and one movement – said some 400 demonstrations were planned.Its website said the protests are “a decentralised rapid response to the anti-democratic and illegal actions of the Trump administration and its plutocratic allies” — and it insisted on all protests being non-violent.The group called for millions to take part Saturday, though turnout appeared smaller than the “Hands Off” protests across the country on April 5.","summary":"Many voice opposition to the US leader's hard-line policies that threaten long-respected constitutional norms.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/04/20/another-round-of-anti-trump-protests-hits-us-cities/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/7a4274d0-anti-trump-protests.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 22:50:05","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":312855482,"title":"Trump administration ready to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part of framework to end Ukraine war, source says","text":"(CNN) — The Trump administration is ready to recognize Russian control of Crimea as part of the US proposal to drive an end to the war with Ukraine, an official familiar with the framework told CNN on Friday.\n\nCrimea, southern Ukraine, has been under Russian occupation since it was illegally annexed in 2014. Four other Ukrainian regions – Donetsk and Luhansk in the east and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south – have also been partially occupied by Russia since its full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nThere has been no immediate comment from Kyiv but the suggestion the US could recognize Russian control of Crimea is unlikely to be welcomed – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in March that his government would not recognize any occupied territories as Russian, calling that a “red line.”\n\nZelensky said at the time that the territories would “probably be one of the most sensitive and difficult issues” in peace negotiations, adding that, “for us, the red line is the recognition of the Ukrainian temporarily occupied territories as Russian. We will not go for it.”\n\nThe US proposal for an end to the war would also put a ceasefire in place along the front lines of the conflict, the source told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe framework was shared with the Europeans and the Ukrainians in Paris, France, on Thursday, the source said. It was also communicated to the Russians in a phone call between US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nDespite US President Donald Trump’s claim that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine in one day, American attempts to reach a peace agreement have largely stalled in the face of Russian intransigence, leading to a growing sense of frustration in the White House.\n\nAfter Rubio warned Friday that the US was ready to “move on” from efforts to bring peace to Ukraine within days if there were no tangible signs of progress, Trump offered a less hardline approach, saying that Rubio was “right” but projecting more optimism about the prospects of a deal.\n\nPressed on a timeline for the US to walk away, Trump said: “No specific number of days, but quickly, we want to get it done.”\n\nThe source that spoke to CNN on Friday said that there are still pieces of the framework to be filled out, adding that the US plans to work with the Europeans and the Ukrainians on that next week in London.\n\nThe Trump administration is simultaneously planning another meeting between Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the Russians to get Moscow on board with the framework, the source said.\n\nUN alleges human rights abuses\n\nRussia has imposed a brutal and repressive regime on Crimea and its people over the past 11 years, human rights observers say, stomping out any sign of opposition.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has repeatedly reported on the human rights violations allegedly committed by Russia in occupied Crimea – from unlawful detentions, to sexual abuse and torture, to forcing people to send their children to Russian schools and training programs.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied accusations of human rights abuses, despite substantial evidence and victim testimonies.\n\nRoughly 2.5 million people lived in Crimea before 2014 and many more would regularly visit the tourist hotspot, known for its beaches and nature reserves.\n\nAccording to official data from the Ukrainian government, more than 64,000 have fled the peninsula to other parts of Ukraine since the annexation. However, Crimean NGOs estimate the number of refugees might be twice as high, as not everyone has officially registered with the government.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow has worked on its plan to “Russify” the peninsula. It put in place incentives to persuade Russian citizens to relocate to Crimea and the Ukrainian government estimated in 2023 that some 500,000 to 800,000 Russians had moved there permanently since it was annexed, with the number jumping sharply after the opening of the Kerch bridge that connects Crimea to Russia.\n\nMaksym Vishchyk, a lawyer at Global Rights Compliance, a non-profit that advises the Ukrainian authorities on investigating and prosecuting international crimes, said Moscow has repeated the same pattern across other occupied territories.\n\n“When Russia occupied the Crimean peninsula, it commenced a campaign of systematic targeting of communities or individuals it perceived as those who became an obstacle in the Russification campaign… with devastating effects on the social fabric in general, but also communities, families and individuals,” he told CNN in an interview last year.\n\n“And Crimea has been kind of their playbook. Policies and patterns and tactics (Russia) applied in Crimea were then applied as well in other occupied territories. So, we see essentially the same patterns in all occupied territories, both since 2014 and since 2022.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But Ukrainian politicians and soldiers said Russia’s president was not to be trusted, with Mr Zelensky saying that shelling had continued past the 6pm start time.\n\n“If a complete ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond the Easter day of April 20,” Mr Zelensky said. “If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly – mirroring Russia’s actions,” he added.\n\nPutin’s proposal was seen by critics as a naked attempt to curry favour with Donald Trump, the US president, who threatened on Friday to walk out of peace talks unless a ceasefire agreement was reached soon. Mr Zelensky had earlier labelled the proposed truce as nothing more than Putin trying to “play with human lives”.\n\nAndrii Sybiha, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said Ukraine had endured a “long history” of Putin’s deceptions and that the dictator’s words “cannot be trusted”.\n\nHe added that Kyiv stood by its original agreement with the US in March to abide by a 30-day cease fire.\n\n“Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions,” Mr Sybiha said.\n\n“We know his words cannot be trusted and we will look at actions, not words. Russia can agree at any time to the proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which has been on the table since March.”\n\nA senior Ukrainian military officer reportedly received orders to stop firing on Russian positions minutes after the truce was due to start, suggesting that Kyiv had given the order to observe it.\n\nCaptain Oleksandr Shyrshyn, battalion commander in the 47th Mechanized Brigade, told The Sunday Telegraph that Ukraine had “encountered similar situations in the past when Russia made statements about a truce or a ceasefire”.\n\nRussians “consistently disregarded the statements [and tried] to blame us. I don’t trust Russians, and I believe they will fabricate scenarios”, he added.\n\nMykola Bielieskov, a senior analyst at the Kyiv-based National Institute for Strategic Studies, said he saw the Russian president’s proposal as “classic Putin who wants to manipulate Donald Trump’s perception and drive a wedge between Ukraine and the US”.\n\n“Ukraine should remind everyone about the comprehensive, unconditional ceasefire that Russia rejected,” he added.\n\nYesterday also saw 277 Ukrainian soldiers being returned from captivity in the largest exchange of PoWs in the conflict’s history. Footage showed hundreds of the former prisoners hugging one another with the blue and yellow flag draped over their shoulders.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defence said 246 of its service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that “as a gesture of goodwill” 31 wounded Ukrainian PoWs were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers.\n\nThe Ministry said its troops had been instructed about the ceasefire and would adhere to it, provided it was “mutually respected” by Ukraine. Putin told Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of Russia’s General Staff, during the televised address to have his forces ready to “repel possible violations of the truce”.\n\nRussia on Friday had abandoned a moratorium on striking Ukrainian energy targets after each side accused the other of breaking a supposed deal without any formal agreement in place.\n\nThe latest truce proposal will show “how sincere is the Kyiv’s regime’s readiness, its desire and ability to observe agreements and participate in a process of peace talks,” Putin said.\n\nPrevious attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in Jan 2023 collapsed after both sides failed to agree on them. The proposal comes after months of Mr Trump pushing both Moscow and Kyiv to agree to a truce. He has so far failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin.\n\nRichard Kemp, a former British Army officer, said the truce would allow Putin to falsely paint Mr Zelensky to Mr Trump as the aggressor if the fighting continued. He said: “He is likely attempting to seize the narrative to appease Trump and allow him to declare some kind of negotiating victory.\n\n“The Kremlin’s emphasis on bracing for Ukrainian ‘provocations’ indicates his intent to seize on or manufacture any such incidents to proclaim that Zelensky is not serious about peace and parry the ball back into Kyiv’s court, so inciting further demands on Ukraine from the White House,” he added. Only a few kilometres from the front lines in the east, Ukrainian soldiers shared their leader’s distrust of the proposed ceasefire.\n\nDmitry, a 40-year-old soldier, said: “I think this man [Putin] is evil, a murderer, but he can do it. He might do it to give some hope or to show his humanity. But either way, of course, we don’t trust. These 30 hours will lead to nothing. The killings of our people, and theirs, will 100 per cent continue.”\n\nA spokesman for the Foreign Office said: “Ukraine has committed to a full ceasefire. We urge Russia to do the same – not just a one-day pause. That will create space for talks on a just and lasting peace. We deplore the Kremlin’s bombing of Ukrainian cities. Now is the moment for Putin to show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion.”\n\nCap Shyrshyn, of the 47th Mechanized Brigade, told The Sunday Telegraph: “We have encountered similar situations in the past when Russia made statements about a truce or a ceasefire, yet they consistently disregarded the statements [and tried] to blame us.\n\n“I don’t trust Russians, and I believe they will fabricate scenarios, similar to the numerous instances where they have publicly expressed their desire to end the war, only to claim that Ukrainian officials fail to adhere to their agreements and threaten to respond by attacking civilians”.\n\n11:41 PM BST\n\nThat’s all for today\n\nThanks for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. We’ll be back soon with more updates and analysis from the conflict.\n\n11:14 PM BST\n\nRussia ‘one of the biggest threats’ to Christians, Zelensky says\n\nOn the eve of Easter, President Volodymyr Zelensky has called Russia “one of the biggest threats to Christian churches and believers”.\n\nUkrainians will go to church on Sunday under the shadow of a ceasefire announced by Vladimir Putin which both sides have accused each other of violating. Easter falls on the same day this year for Orthodox and Western sects of Christianity, which is a rare occurrence.\n\n“For millions of Ukrainians, Easter is one of the most important holidays. And millions of Ukrainians will go to church. Sadly, many will go to churches that are damaged or destroyed,” Mr Zelensky wrote in a post on X.\n\nRussia has destroyed over 600 religious sites in Ukraine throughout the three-year conflict and killed or tortured 67 priests, pastors and monks, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nMr Zelensky said: “Just like we’re bringing back priests and pastors from Russian captivity, just like we’re doing everything to protect Ukrainian towns and villages and the lives of people there – we are also bringing back the chance to believe, to believe that evil and destruction will not win.”\n\n10:44 PM BST\n\nZelensky: ‘Fighting continues’ in Kursk and Belgorod\n\nThe Ukrainian president in a further update said that “fighting continues” in the Kursk and Belgorod regions.\n\nMr Zelensky, citing a report from his commander-in-chief, suggests that “Easter statements by Putin did not extend to this territory”.\n\n“Russian artillery can still be heard in certain directions of the front, regardless of the Russian leader’s promise of silence,” he said but added that it “has become quieter” in some areas.\n\nHe said a proposal for a 30-day full and unconditional ceasefire “remains on the table” and that Ukraine’s actions are “symmetrical” to Russia’s.\n\n10:15 PM BST\n\nMoscow residents not optimistic ceasefire will bring peace\n\nResidents of Moscow had a bleak outlook on the chances of peace after Putin’s announcement of an Easter ceasefire.\n\nIn the south of the Russian capital, people said it was unlikely the pause in fighting would provide a breakthrough that could end the three-year conflict because Ukraine “could not be trusted”.\n\n“The Easter truce will lead to nothing, because Ukraine will not honour these agreements,” said Svetlana, 61, who did not give her surname.\n\nAnother resident, Maria Goranina, 85, told AFP that Ukraine will “regroup after this truce and come at us again”.\n\nThis is despite testimony by a Ukrainian soldier that Russia has already violated its own ceasefire with constant drone attacks and shelling.\n\nCritics of the invasion face harsh punishment in Russia under its censorship rules instituted shortly after the outbreak of war, with many people sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\n\nSvetlana also questioned Putin’s decision to halt fighting.\n\n“Three years have gone by, so many maimed, disabled, dead. And we’ve gone through some part of Ukraine, and that’s it?” she said.\n\n“I don’t understand at all then, what it’s all for.”\n\nOther residents were more hawkish and backed a more aggressive campaign over the ceasefire.\n\n“I do not believe in Ukraine. There will be no such truce, there will be shelling and so on,” Yevgeny Pavlov, 58, told AFP.\n\n“There is no need to give a respite. If we press, it means we should press to the end.”\n\n09:56 PM BST\n\nUkraine says it will reciprocate a ‘genuine’ ceasefire\n\nUkraine said it would reciprocate any “genuine” ceasefire efforts from Russia, but was wary of Putin’s announcement of an Easter pause.\n\nPutin has not offered details as to how the “humanitarian” ceasefire will be enforced and if it would only cover airstrikes or also ground battles.\n\nRussia said the ceasefire was supposed to begin at 6pm Moscow time on Saturday and would end at midnight after Easter Sunday, despite accusations from Ukraine that Russia has already violated its own agreement.\n\nWhether the ceasefire is upheld will “reveal Russia’s true intentions”, President Volodymyr Zelensky said, proposing an extension of the truce beyond Easter.\n\n“If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,” Mr Zelensky said in a post on Telegram.\n\n“That will reveal Russia’s true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.”\n\n09:13 PM BST\n\nFighting ongoing despite ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian soldier says\n\nRussia is “constantly launching drones” and shelling despite Putin’s announcement of an Easter ceasefire, a Ukrainian soldier told The Telegraph.\n\nMaksym, a drone pilot fighting between Kharkiv and Russia’s Belgorod region, said: “At the moment, they are constantly launching drones, not to mention shelling.”\n\nThe truce is not sustainable or “realistic – at least not for now”, Maksym said, because Russia has violated other similar agreements.\n\n“These things aren’t arranged so quickly or easily. Besides, they’ve already shown they don’t stick to such agreements,” he said.\n\n“It is not realistic to stop hostilities at one moment.”\n\n09:06 PM BST\n\nReleased Ukrainian soldiers reunite with families\n\nUkrainian soldiers released from captivity were shown reuniting with their families in new footage posted by President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe soldiers, many of them draped in Ukrainian flags, hugged or called their family members as they wiped tears from their eyes.\n\n“Today. Our people are home,” Mr Zelensky wrote on X.\n\n08:46 PM BST\n\n277 Ukrainian prisoners of war released from Russian captivity\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky announced that 277 Ukrainian prisoners of war have been released.\n\n“Our people are home – one of the best pieces of news that can be. Another 277 warriors have returned home from Russian captivity,” Mr Zelensky wrote in a post on X.\n\n“I thank everyone who made this return of our people possible.”\n\nThe release was part of the largest prisoner exchange in the three-year conflict, with over 500 troops on both sides involved.\n\nSoldiers who fought in Mariupol are among those who have been freed, along with troops who were captured in Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates mediated to secure the release of the soldiers, Mr Zelensky said.\n\nA total of 4,552 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been brought back from Russian captivity since Putin’s invasion began in Feb 2022.\n\n08:31 PM BST\n\nZelensky proposes extending the ceasefire\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky pledged that Ukraine would abide by the ceasefire and suggested the truce be extended.\n\n“If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia’s actions,” he wrote on X.\n\nBut at the same time, he said that Russia was continuing military action on several frontline sectors.\n\nOleksandr Prokudin, governor of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, said there had been eight Russian drone attacks, setting fire to a high-rise block as well as hitting two villages.\n\n08:24 PM BST\n\nAir-raid sirens sound in Kyiv\n\nAir-raid sirens sounded in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Saturday evening, despite the start of Putin’s “Easter truce”.\n\nAn alert message told Kyiv residents to proceed to shelters.\n\nAFP journalists heard sirens sound shortly before 10:00pm (local time) as the air force warned of a “missile threat” in the surrounding Kyiv region.\n\n08:18 PM BST\n\nBattalion commander: ‘I don’t trust Russians’\n\nCaptain Oleksandr Shyrshyn, battalion commander in the 47th Mechanized Brigade, says he does not trust Russia’s “Easter truce”.\n\n“We have encountered similar situations in the past ... they consistently disregarded the statements made by them, trying to blame us.\n\n“I don’t trust Russians, and I believe they will fabricate scenarios ... where they have publicly expressed their desire to end the war, only to have Ukrainian officials fail to adhere to their agreements and threaten to respond by attacking civilians”.\n\n07:26 PM BST\n\nPutin ‘wants to manipulate Donald Trump perception’\n\nMykola Bielieskov, a senior analyst at the Kyiv-based National Institute for Strategic Studies said: “I think it’s a classic Putin who wants to manipulate Donald Trump perception and drive a wedge between UA and US making Trump think that’s RU open to dialogue while Ukraine shall be squeezed by US to make concessions.\n\n“Ukraine shall remind about comprehensive unconditional ceasefire in all domains of war Russia rejected.”\n\n06:37 PM BST\n\nRussians continue heavy shelling, Ukraine claims\n\nAndriy Kovalenko, an official on Ukraine’s national security and defence council, has claimed Russia is continuing its attacks.\n\n“The Russians keep firing on all fronts — just like before,” he wrote on X.\n\n“The heaviest shelling is in the East. So much for Putin’s so-called ‘ceasefire’. He never meant to keep it.”\n\n06:36 PM BST\n\nUkrainian soldiers sceptical of truce declaration\n\nVladimir Putin’s announcement of an Easter ceasefire was greeted sceptically by Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThey did not trust the Russian president to keep his word and were doubtful that a pause in the fighting would lead to a prolonged end to the hostilities.\n\n“Of course there’s distrust,” said 40-year-old soldier, Dmitry, told AFP in the city of Kramatorsk, around 20 kilometres from the front in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\n“I think this man (Putin) is evil, a murderer, but he can do it. He might do it to give some hope or to show his humanity. But either way, of course, we don’t trust.

The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.\n\n“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.\n\nThe Trump administration filed paperwork urging the high court to rescind its hold. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Saturday in a post on X: “We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people.”\n\nOn Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation, even as one judge said the case raised legitimate concerns. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.\n\nThe ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nIn an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to President Donald Trump’s use of the act.\n\nThe act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended it gave them power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nFollowing the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas promptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.\n\nBut there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn’t started yet.\n\nBut the ACLU’s Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. In one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials, was told to sign papers in English even though the client only spoke Spanish.\n\n“ICE informed F.G.M. that these papers were coming from the President, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,” Brown wrote.\n\nGelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.\n\nWith Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU’s request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless Friday.\n\n“I’m sympathetic to everything you’re saying,” Boasberg told Gelernt. “I just don’t think I have the power to do anything about it.”\n\nBoasberg this week found there’s probable cause that the Trump administration committed criminal contempt by disobeying his initial deportation ban. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.\n\nDrew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a “minimum” of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.\n\nICE said it would not comment on the litigation.\n\nAlso Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they’d face torture or death there.\n\nSome Venezuelans subject to Trump’s Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its notorious main prison.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Those divisions have broken out in public in recent days, even as Witkoff, a real estate developer and friend of the president, was preparing for the talks that took place today at the residence of the Omani ambassador in Rome. Oman is acting as mediator in the talks.\n\nIran hawks in the administration, led by Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have argued that it is far too risky to leave Iran with the ability to make its own nuclear fuel.\n\nAnd agreeing to limits on how much uranium Iran can possess and how much enrichment it can perform exposes Trump to the critique that he is simply replicating key elements of the 2015 Obama-era nuclear agreement, which he called a “disaster” and ultimately ripped up in 2018.\n\nIranian officials have said that they will not disassemble or destroy the nuclear infrastructure in which they have invested billions of dollars. Witkoff has told administration officials privately that if they insist on full dismantlement, he is unlikely to emerge from the talks with a deal — the only way to avoid a military attack on Iran’s facilities, Trump has said. Israel has been pressing for military action against Iran’s nuclear sites, which would likely involve the United States.\n\nSpeaking after the talks ended, a senior administration official noted “very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” meaning that the parties spoke face-to-face as well as through their Omani host.\n\nIn private conversations leading up to the session, the Iranians told U.S. officials that they were willing to reduce enrichment levels to those specified in the 2015 agreement struck with the Obama administration: 3.67%, the level needed to produce fuel for nuclear power plants.\n\nSince Trump pulled out of that accord, Iran has been enriching to far higher levels of around 60% purity, just shy of what is needed to produce a nuclear weapon. That gives Tehran two options: race to produce weapons-grade fuel, or negotiate with the United States to return to the original levels in the 2015 accord.\n\n“What’s happening in Rome and Oman, in an irony of ironies, is the resurrection of something looking pretty close” to the agreement that President Barack Obama approved and that Trump disparaged, said Aaron David Miller of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nIt may be the best Trump can get.\n\nWitkoff paved the way for such an agreement, describing in an interview Tuesday a possible agreement that would essentially allow Iran to produce fuel at low levels, with careful inspection and monitoring. But he was forced to backtrack. He then posted on social media that the U.S. position was that “Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.” The key word was “eliminate.”\n\nWitkoff did not speak immediately after the negotiations — the second round in two weeks — ended this afternoon in Rome. Oman said those technical negotiations would take place in Muscat, its capital, in the coming days.\n\nWhen pressed this past week on whether the United States could live with Iran having a limited nuclear-enrichment capability, U.S. officials dodged the question, saying only that Trump had vowed that Iran would not be permitted to have a nuclear weapon.\n\nWitkoff will now have to brief Trump and his administration colleagues about the latest round of talks. Officials familiar with the internal debate say that Waltz and Rubio, both of whom were harsh critics of the Obama-era deal when they served in Congress, remain opposed to leaving Iran with any nuclear production capability.\n\nOn Friday, Rubio said that any deal must keep Iran from ever possessing a nuclear weapon. “It has to be something that not just prevents Iran from having a nuclear weapon now, but in the future as well,” he told reporters on a trip to Paris.\n\nTrump has been vague about the strategic objectives of the negotiations, other than to repeat that Iran must never get a bomb — a declaration that avoids the critical question of whether the United States can live with an Iran that is a “threshold state,” able to produce a weapon on short notice.\n\nAli Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group, said that talks advancing to the technical phase showed a level of pragmatism, suggesting that the discussion of dismantling Iran’s nuclear program was mostly public posturing.\n\nIran has raised the possibility of a joint venture to run its nuclear enrichment facilities, an option that would allow the Trump administration to declare it has struck a different kind of deal than the Obama administration did.\n\nIt is unclear if the United States or a third country, preferably one of Iran’s Arab neighbors in the Persian Gulf, would be the partner, offering an extra layer of assurance that its program is peaceful, according to Vaez and a senior Iranian official familiar with the discussions. The official declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks.\n\nThe concept of an Iranian nuclear program that is a joint venture with either Arab countries or the U.S., Vaez said, “creates an extra layer of eyes and ears on the ground to safeguard the peaceful nature of its nuclear program.”\n\nThe senior Iranian official also said that Iran was open to transferring its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia or another nation, much as it did in early 2016 as the Obama-era deal went into effect. Iran has since dramatically increased the size of that stockpile, and has enough 60% enriched material to make upward of six nuclear bombs if it chooses to weaponize the material.\n\n(Unlike the 2015 negotiations, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China have been frozen out of these talks.)\n\nAraghchi told Iranian media traveling with him in Rome that the Americans had not brought up any other issue outside of the nuclear program. “We have told them our negotiations is about the nuclear issue, and we will not discuss anything else,” he said.\n\nHamid Aboutalebi, a former diplomat and political adviser to former President Hassan Rouhani, said in an interview from Tehran that it was a positive sign that talks were moving forward but that many challenges remained before an agreement could be reached.\n\n“The real challenge isn’t the technical details; we did negotiate these details before,” Aboutalebi said. “The issue is staying power. Without a stable political and diplomatic foundation, even the most meticulous technical agreement won’t hold.”\n\nIranian media and some conservative pundits posted a photo of miniature Iranian and U.S. flags side by side on a table, a departure from the typical burning and stomping of the American flag that has become a staple of demonstrations by government supporters.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"ROME >> Iran and the United States wrapped up a second round of diplomatic talks Saturday over Tehran&#8217;s nuclear activities, setting an agenda for rapid-paced negotiations that, according to Iranian officials, would not require the dismantlement of the country&#8217;s extensive nuclear infrastructure.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/19/breaking-news/u-s-iran-conclude-second-round-of-nuclear-talks/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/web1_20250419_WEB_US-IRAN-NUKES-3.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 22:36:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":312846446,"title":"Macron ‘to make state visit before Trump’ as UK seeks closer ties with Europe","text":"Emmanuel Macron will be granted a state visit before Donald Trump’s expected trip in September as Britain seeks closer ties with Europe, according to a report.\n\nThe French President is said to have received an invitation from the King to travel to the UK at the end of May, eight years after taking office.\n\nFew Government and royal officials know the details of the engagement, which would be Mr Macron’s first state visit to Britain, according to the Sunday Times.\n\nIt comes after the US leader suggested Buckingham Palace was “setting a date for September” for him to meet Charles when asked about reports that he was expecting to fly to the UK at the end of summer.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said: “They’re going to do a second, as you know, a second fest … that’s what it is: a fest, and it’s beautiful, and it’s the first time it’s ever happened to one person.\n\n“And the reason is we have two separate terms, and it’s an honour … I’m a friend of Charles, I have great respect for King Charles and the family, William, we have really just a great respect for the family.”\n\nPrecedent for second-term US presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer handed Mr Trump what he described at the time as a “truly historic” personal invitation from the King for a second state visit when he visited the White House in February.\n\nHowever, reports suggest that the venue for the trip is now expected to be Windsor Castle, rather than Balmoral or Dumfries House, as previously thought.\n\nMr Macron’s visit is also expected to take place at Windsor due to a refurbishment of Buckingham Palace.\n\nSir Keir Starmer has repeatedly insisted he does not need to choose between pursuing a closer relationship with Europe and strengthening US-UK trade.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves will travel to Washington next week for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and is expected to speak with counterparts about the prospect of a wider economic agreement to mitigate the impact of Mr Trump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on all goods entering America.\n\nHowever, ministers have also said Britain must look at co-ordinating better across Europe to protect its economy.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir and Mr Macron have been cooperating closely on defence, with plans for an Anglo-French-led “coalition of the willing” to defend any potential peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nDowning Street declined to comment.\n\nThe palace has been contacted for comment.","summary":"Emmanuel Macron will be granted a state visit before Donald Trump’s expected trip in September as Britain seeks closer ties with Europe, according to a report.

Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial","text":"At a solemn memorial for the 30th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Bill Clinton decided to lighten the mood with a crack at Donald Trump—before delivering a pointed critique of modern political division.\n\n“I’m old and I can’t run for anything anymore,” the 78-year-old former president told the crowd in downtown Oklahoma City on Saturday. “I’m almost as old as President Trump!”\n\nThe quip drew laughter from the crowd, but Clinton quickly pivoted to more serious matters, urging Americans to abandon grievance politics and embrace the so-called “Oklahoma Standard”—a post-tragedy display of kindness, respect, and unity.\n\n“Everybody is arguing about whose resentments matter most,” he said. “If our lives are going to be dominated by the effort to dominate people we disagree with, we’re going to put the 250-year march toward a more perfect union at risk.” \n\nClinton was in office during the 1995 domestic terror attack, in which anti-government extremists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols parked a truck filled with explosives outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was home to the America’s Kids Day Care Center. It detonated at 9 a.m. as employees were starting their day, killing 168 people, including 19 children. \n\n“The nation’s eyes were there. The nation’s heart was broken there,” Clinton said in a separate reflection posted by the Clinton Foundation. \n\nThe speech was delivered at First Church, with the victims’ names read aloud and survivors in attendance. Clinton’s warning about the dangers of political polarization is hard to miss when confronted with the rubble of the Murrah building.\n\nAnd yes, in case you’re wondering, Clinton is in fact younger than Trump. Despite public perception skewing the other way, Trump was born on June 14, 1946, while Clinton was born on August 19 of the same year, making the current president his senior by about two months.","summary":"Nick Oxford / REUTERSAt a solemn memorial for the 30th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Bill Clinton decided to lighten the mood with a crack at Donald Trump—before delivering a pointed critique of modern political division.\n\n“I’m old and I can’t run for anything anymore,” the 78-year-old former president told the crowd in downtown Oklahoma City on Saturday. “I’m almost as old as President Trump!”\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/clinton-cracks-trump-joke-at-oklahoma-city-bombing-memorial/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/3WKOD7UTMZCJLMLLIWVD67HZEQ.JPG?smart=true&auth=8e06de1640c56f99b5acd8952250cad51790b53259657c12367919f641cc6516&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-19 22:34:20","author":"Jack Revell","authors":["Jack Revell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.037}]}
