We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence? 5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again? 6. Will you accept the results of the election? 7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing? 8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called “red” states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states’ economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you’ll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules? 10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it.

The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors.

Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events? 7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court?

Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue? 10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected? And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond. The moderators have their hands full.

Sure, he was erratic and outspoken, but his global influence was contained and seemingly under control. But add the ownership of just one media platform, in the form of Twitter — now X — and the maverick has become a mogul, and the baton of the world’s biggest media bully has passed to a new player. What we can gauge from watching Musk’s stewardship of X is that he’s unlike former media moguls, making him potentially even more dangerous. He operates under his own rules, often beyond the reach of regulators. He has demonstrated he has no regard for those who try to rein him in. Under the old regime, press barons, from William Randolph Hearst to Rupert Murdoch, at least pretended they were committed to truth-telling journalism. Never mind that they were simultaneously deploying intimidation and bullying to achieve their commercial and political ends. Musk has no need, or desire, for such pretence because he’s not required to cloak anything he says in even a wafer-thin veil of journalism. Instead, his driving rationale is free speech, which is often code for don’t dare get in my way. This means we are in new territory, but it doesn’t mean what went before it is irrelevant. A big bucket of the proverbial If you want a comprehensive, up-to-date primer on the behaviour of media moguls over the past century-plus, Eric Beecher has just provided it in his book The Men Who Killed the News. Alongside accounts of people like Hearst in the United States and Lord Northcliffe in the United Kingdom, Beecher quotes the notorious example of what happened to John Major, the UK prime minister between 1990 and 1997, who baulked at following Murdoch’s resistance to strengthening ties with the European Union. In a conversation between Major and Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of Murdoch’s best-selling English tabloid newspaper, The Sun, the prime minister was bluntly told: “Well, John, let me put it this way. I’ve got a large bucket of shit lying on my desk and tomorrow morning I’m going to pour it all over your head.” MacKenzie might have thought he was speaking truth to power, but in reality he was doing Murdoch’s bidding, and actually using his master’s voice, as Beecher confirms by recounting an anecdote from early in Murdoch’s career in Australia. In the 1960s, when Murdoch owned The Sunday Times in Perth, he met Lang Hancock (father of Gina Rinehart) to discuss potentially buying some mineral prospects together in Western Australia. The state government was opposed to the planned deal. Beecher cites Hancock’s biographer, Robert Duffield, who claimed Murdoch asked the mining magnate, “If I can get a certain politician to negotiate, will you sell me a piece of the cake?” Hancock said yes. Later that night, Murdoch called again to say the deal had been done. How, asked an incredulous Hancock. Murdoch replied: “Simple […] I told him: look you can have a headline a day or a bucket of shit every day. What’s it to be?” Between Murdoch in the 1960s and MacKenzie in the 1990s came Mario Puzo’s The Godfather with Don Corleone, aided by Luca Brasi holding a gun to a rival’s head, saying “either his brains or his signature would be on the contract”. Changing the rules of the game Media moguls use metaphorical bullets. Those relatively few people who do resist them, like Major, get the proverbial poured over their government. Headlines in The Sun following the Conservatives’ win in the 1992 election included: “Pigmy PM”, “Not up to the job” and “1,001 reasons why you are such a plonker John”. If media moguls since Hearst and Northcliffe have tap-danced between producing journalism and pursuing their commercial and political aims, they have at least done the former, and some of it has been very good. The leaders of the social media behemoths, by contrast, don’t claim any fourth estate role. If anything, they seem to hold journalism with tongs as far from their face as possible. They do possess enormous wealth though. Apple, Microsoft, Google and Meta, formerly known as Facebook, are in the top 10 companies globally by market capitalisation. By comparison, News Corporation’s market capitalisation now ranks at 1,173 in the world. Regulating the online environment may be difficult, as Australia discovered this year when it tried, and failed, to stop X from hosting footage of the Wakeley Church stabbing attacks. But limiting transnational media platforms can be done, according to Robert Reich, a former secretary of Labor in Bill Clinton’s government. Despite some early wins through Australia’s news media bargaining code, big tech companies habitually resist regulation. They have used their substantial influence to stymie it wherever and whenever nation-states have sought to introduce it. Meta’s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has been known to go rogue, as he demonstrated in February 2021 when he protested against the bargaining code by unilaterally closing Facebook sites that carried news. Generally, though, his strategy has been to deploy standard public relations and lobbying methods. But his rival Musk uses his social media platform, X, like a wrecking ball. Musk is just about the first thing the average X user sees in their feed, whether they want to or not. He gives everyone the benefit of his thoughts, not to mention his thought bubbles. He proclaims himself a free-speech absolutist, but most of his pronouncements lean hard to the right, providing little space for alternative views. Some of his tweets have been inflammatory, such as him linking to an article promoting a conspiracy theory about the savage attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of the former US speaker Nancy Pelosi, or his tweet that “Civil war is inevitable” following riots that erupted recently in the UK. As the BBC reported, the riots occurred after the fatal stabbing of three girls in Southport. “The subsequent unrest in towns and cities across England and in parts of Northern Ireland has been fuelled by misinformation online, the far-right and anti-immigration sentiment.” Nor does Musk bother with niceties when people disagree with him. Late last year, advertisers considered boycotting X because they believed some of Musk’s posts were antisemitic. He told them during a live interview to “Go fuck yourself”. He has welcomed Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, back onto X after Trump’s account was frozen over his comments surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the capitol. Since then both men have floated the idea of governing together if Trump wins a second term. Is the world better off with tech bros like Musk who demand unlimited freedom and assert their influence brazenly, or old-style media moguls who spin fine-sounding rhetoric about freedom of the press and exert influence under the cover of journalism? That’s a question for our times that we should probably begin grappling with.

The 81-year-old president talked to reporters outside the White House briefly. He then boarded Marine One to head to New York City for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. However, Biden bumbled his words when laying out his plans for the next 24 hours. “I’m going up to my granddaughter’s birthday in New York. Then we’re going to watch the debate,” the president said before bluntly adding, “And tomorrow I’m doing 9/11.” Biden’s words left several X users confused, with one commenting, “What?” A second person on X responded, “That sounds like some dangerous rhetoric.” Another simply wrote, “Dammit joe,” with the face palm emoji. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are expected to deliver remarks at the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City. The president and vice president are expected to visit the site where the World Trade Center once stood, the Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and then the Pentagon. Biden, seemingly unaware of his blunder, continued his remarks to the press, saying he spoke with Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate. “I spoke with the vice president. She’s calm, cool, and collected,” the president said. “I think she’s going to do great, and I’m not going to tell you what advice I gave her.” DEBATE NIGHT Harris and Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, are set to face off in the first presidential debate since Biden ended his reelection bid in July. The high-stakes debate comes as Trump and Harris are locked in a neck-and-neck race less than two months before the November 5 Election Day. The candidates will take the stage in Pennsylvania, one of the seven crucial battleground states that could determine the presidential race. Trump is ahead of Harris in the national polls by 1%, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll. ABC moderators are expected to hone in on both candidates on issues affecting millions of Americans, including immigration, the state of the economy, and foreign policy.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJOE Biden&#8217;s latest gaffe has left Americans perplexed as he botched his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden makes controversial statement about 9/11 before Kamala Harris-Donald Trump debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-makes-controversial-statement-about-9-11-before-kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Moment-Joe-Biden-bluntly-says-hes-‘doing-911-in-latest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-11 00:08:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":256117116,"title":"How to Know Who Won and Who Lost Trump-Harris Debate","text":"Everyone who watches Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate on Tuesday night will want to know the answer to a very simple question: Who won? And while everyone might think they know themselves, in a sea of spin, soundbites, and political posturing there are ways to know who really won. Here's the Daily Beast’s guide to six key indicators—grounded in history, data, and political performance—which will provide a clearer guide. Who Dominates the Narrative? The most obvious way to determine a winner is to see who controlled the narrative (and perhaps talked the most in terms of minutes). Debates are not just about what the candidates say on stage but how their points resonate with the public afterward. Did one candidate introduce a memorable zinger or a policy proposal that set the tone for post-debate coverage? One of the most famous examples of narrative control was Ronald Reagan’s 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter, when Reagan’s simple question to voters—“Are you better off than you were four years ago?”—became the defining takeaway. It encapsulated voter frustration with Carter’s presidency and was followed by Reagan’s landslide victory. In the case of Trump and Harris, whoever manages to turn the conversation their way—whether it's through a punchy one-liner or a clear vision for the future—will likely claim the debate crown. If Trump, known for his inflammatory rhetoric, successfully redirects attention away from his felony conviction and legal battles and toward economic or cultural issues that play well with his base, he could steer the post-debate narrative. Harris, on the other hand, would need to harness her skills as a prosecutor to trap Trump in contradictions or force him into unflattering positions on key issues, particularly abortion. to take control of the narrative. Polling and Data Historically, snap polls taken after debates have offered immediate data points to assess public reaction. These polls may not tell the whole story but provide a snapshot of who performed better in the eyes of undecided or independent voters. The first time snap polls became crucial was after the first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, radio listeners thought Nixon won, but TV viewers overwhelmingly felt Kennedy’s calm, confident demeanor made him the victor. The lesson? Perception matters, and polling reflects that perception. In 2020, after the first debate between Trump and Joe Biden, CNN’s snap poll found that 60% of viewers thought Biden won the first debate. Both campaigns will be conducting their own snap polls on Tuesday night—not to predict the election outcome, but to work out what undecided voters think. But snap polls are not the only ballgame: Expect snap polls to be followed by more detailed polling from major outlets like CNN and pollsters like YouGov to provide a first indication of who emerged stronger. Harris and Trump go into the debate neck and neck in the polls nationally and with some suggestions that she is slightly ahead in the swing states, but with Democratic nerves rattled by a Siena College/New York Times poll putting her behind by one point. Post-Debate Fundraising and Media Coverage Winning a debate isn’t just about the immediate reactions—it’s about the long game. In modern campaigns, fundraising spikes after debates can signal a strong performance. For example, after her breakout moment in the first 2019 Democratic debate, Harris herself raised $2 million in just 24 hours, The New York Times reported, largely thanks to her sharp exchange with Joe Biden on busing and racial issues. If a candidate sees a dip in donations or struggles to galvanize their base, that can indicate a loss. Harris just reported a massive fundraising edge over Trump so the next set of official fundraising returns will be a clear barometer of success. Media coverage also plays a critical role. Did mainstream outlets declare a clear winner? Are social media platforms buzzing more about one candidate’s performance? In the 2012 debate between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, Romney’s aggressive first-debate performance gave him a significant media boost, even though Obama handily won re-election. Post-debate headlines, social media metrics, and the volume of fact-checks for each candidate can all indicate who captured more attention—and perhaps, more voters. Body Language and Composure A candidate’s body language often speaks louder than their words. Nonverbal cues like maintaining eye contact, looking confident, or appearing rattled under pressure can drastically influence how a candidate is perceived. In the infamous 1992 town hall debate, George H.W. Bush’s glance at his watch as a voter asked him a question became a symbol of disengagement and hurt his image. Likewise, Al Gore’s frequent sighs during his debate with George W. Bush in 2000 became a focal point for criticism, overshadowing his policy points. When assessing the Trump-Harris debate, pay attention to who appeared calm and composed versus agitated or defensive. If Trump, who often relies on aggressive posturing, manages to stay composed while Harris rattles him with sharp critiques, that dynamic could shift perceptions. Conversely, if Harris shows frustration or appears overwhelmed, that might signal a loss of control. Fact-Checking and Accuracy In the era of misinformation, post-debate fact-checking has become more important than ever. Candidates frequently make exaggerated or false claims during debates, and these inaccuracies can undermine their performance if exposed. For instance, during the 2016 presidential debates, Trump’s frequent misstatements were fact-checked rigorously, which damaged his credibility with voters and contributed to the view he had lost the debates. Conversely, Hillary Clinton’s focus on policy details and sticking to facts often bolstered her perceived winner status, even if it didn’t lead to an electoral victory. In the Trump-Harris debate, both candidates are likely to face intense scrutiny. Fact-checkers from outlets like The Washington Post, FactCheck.org, and PolitiFact will be on standby to verify their claims. The candidate who emerges with fewer fact-checking hits may be perceived as more trustworthy and competent—especially among undecided voters who value honesty and integrity in their leaders. Blunders and Mistakes Perhaps the most glaring indicator of a debate winner—or loser—is who shot themselves in the foot. A high-profile gaffe can overshadow any strong moments a candidate may have had, often sticking in voters’ minds long after the debate ends. In 1976, Gerald Ford made a major blunder when he claimed that “there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe,” a statement so factually inaccurate that it became a defining moment of his campaign and eroded his credibility. Similarly, Rick Perry’s infamous “Oops” moment during a 2011 GOP primary debate, when he forgot the third government agency he would eliminate, was a fatal error that torpedoed his presidential aspirations. And that’s not to mention Biden’s June performance which cost him his shot at a second term. If either Trump or Harris makes a significant mistake—whether it’s a glaring factual inaccuracy, an unforced error, or a gaffe that resonates negatively—it could become the defining moment of the night. Trump, known for his off-the-cuff style, runs the risk of delivering a controversial or inflammatory remark that could alienate undecided voters. Harris, while typically more measured, can blunder as a result: an overly scripted phrase could be amplified by Trump’s aggressive tactics.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty/ReutersEveryone who watches Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate on Tuesday night will want to know the answer to a very simple question: Who won?\n\nAnd while everyone might think they know themselves, in a sea of  spin, soundbites, and political posturing there are ways to know who really won.

The firebrand congresswoman pointed her finger at Cuomo, claiming that his decision to force nursing homes to take in patients who were recovering from Covid in March 2020 “led to the murdering” of older New Yorkers. “The Comfort ship was sent to New York on March 30th of 2020. That was just a few days after you signed the directive to put Covid-19 patients into nursing homes on March 25th which led to the murdering [of] people’s parents, grandparents and great-grandparents,” Greene said. “Yes, murdering them,” she repeated. The former governor tried to dispute Greene’s accusations but she fiercely demanded he stop speaking and went on to accuse Cuomo of purposefully not allowing the Covid patients in the Javitt’s Center medical center or on the Comfort hospital ship. “You didn’t send them there you put them in nursing homes which is murder,” Greene said. “That’s murdering people.” Tuesday’s hearing was a much-anticipated testimony from Cuomo who was caught in a scandal after his office underreported the number of Covid-19 patients who died in nursing homes. On March 25, 2020, Cuomo signed a directive requiring nursing homes to accept Covid patients from hospitals regardless of their current infection status. Some criticized the directive, believing it would hurt the already at-risk population. The New York governor defended his actions, saying he was acting in accordance with federal law. The directive was later rescinded but when it came time to report the number of nursing home deaths, his office underreported by 50 percent. It’s been more than four years since the controversy, but Cuomo and his administration have faced state and federal investigations. During Tuesday’s hearing, Cuomo defended his administration’s actions and accused Donald Trump of “malpractice” by downplaying the effect of the virus. The former governor told those who lost family members to the virus that he was “sorry” for their loss. “I am sorry for your loss and I believe you are owed an apology because this country should have done better,” Cuomo said. Greene and other members of the committee accused Cuomo of failing to take responsibility and acting without empathy.","summary":"Former governor defended his decision and criticized then-president Trump for Covid-19 protocol failures","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-andrew-cuomo-nursing-home-b2610547.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/10/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-11 00:01:44","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":256117142,"title":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump set to face off in US presidential debate ahead of 2024 election","text":"This live blog has been made freely available as a public service to our readers.

Many polls show Harris with a slight lead against Trump in the key battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania – a reversal from Trump’s lead against Biden in these states before US President Joe Biden dropped out, but these numbers fall within margins of error and the contest still appears to be a dead heat overall. They are expected to spar over hot button domestic issues like abortion, immigration and crime. However, the economy – an important subject for US voters – will likely trigger arguments about import tariff rates and rules around investment restrictions and manufacturing subsidies, which involve China and foreign policy generally.

In a democracy, this is unacceptable. On Monday, Nigerians woke to a gale of repression. The self-styled Department of State Services arrested the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Joe Ajaero, on his way out of Nigeria. Ajaero was released just before midnight after the NLC’s ultimatum to the agency. As if this was not bad enough, the DSS invaded the office of the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, a notable NGO advocating rectitude in government almost simultaneously. These raids and arrests return Nigeria to the dark days of military dictatorship. In those brutal days, the military acted with blatant disregard for the rule of law by harassing, arresting, and detaining innocent citizens. Activists like the late Gani Fawehinmi, Beko Ransome-Kuti, student union leaders, and other lawyers were summarily detained on flimsy grounds and without trial. Democracy is supposed to eradicate these brutal acts of government. It is a shame it has not after more than 25 years. According to media reports, Ajaero was arrested at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, on his way to the United Kingdom. The embattled NLC president was billed to attend the Trade Union Congress conference in London. The raid on SERAP’s office in Abuja occurred barely 24 hours after the organisation urged Tinubu to leverage his leadership and authority to instruct the NNPC Ltd. to reverse the pump price of petrol at its retail outlets. The national oil company unilaterally increased the pump price of petrol from N617 per litre to N855/l in Lagos and N897/l upcountry last week. SERAP has been loud and consistent in advocating transparency in government. Journalists are not spared from the sledgehammer of Tinubu and his high-handed DSS. Recently, a journalist, Adejuwon Soyinka of The Conversation was detained by the DSS and had his passport seized. A whistleblower, Isaac Bristol popularly known as PIDOM Nigeria, is languishing in confinement following his abduction by security operatives. Tinubu should break away decisively from the impunity of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, whose main battle axe against civil rights and court orders was the DSS. It is ironic that Tinubu, who was at the front of the struggle for democracy during the NADECO days, and his party, the All Progressives Congress, which spearheaded multiple protests under President Goodluck Jonathan, would in turn, kick vehemently against protests and opposition voices. The President, who was active in the struggle for Nigeria’s democracy, frequently describes himself as a committed democrat. But democracy is built on and sustained in practice by submission to the supremacy of the rule of law. The UN declares, “The rule of law, defended by an independent judiciary, ensures that civil and political rights and civil liberties are safe and that the equality and dignity of all citizens are not at risk.” Adeola Ajayi, the new Director-General of the DSS, should be careful of his legacy. The DSS is supposed to serve as Nigeria’s domestic intelligence agency. The agency’s roles and functions revolve around preventing and investigating crimes against internal security. In doing this, the DSS is steeped in excesses. If the DSS were to be the FBI, many Americans would have been languishing in detention by now after the shooting of Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, by Thomas Crooks at a campaign rally in July. Nigeria’s abysmal freedom rating is underscored in the harassment, extrajudicial killings, and illegal detention and rights violations perpetrated by state agents. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index 2022 described Nigeria as a “hybrid democracy” that retains its “autocratic and subversive tendencies despite its democratic outlook.” Tinubu and his agents must depart from that odious legacy.","summary":"THE fresh gale of arrests of activists, unionists, government critics, and journalists under President Bola Tinubu hints at creeping totalitarianism.

For the debate prep, Philippe Reines, a former aide to Hillary Clinton, played Trump, with a source saying he even dressed like the former president. After the Harris campaign made an unsuccessful push to have both candidates' microphones unmuted during the debate, the vice president and her team also used the time in Pittsburgh to go back to the drawing board on their debate strategy, a senior campaign official said. Harris had planned to pepper Trump with questions, but her campaign has had to seek out a new approach due to the microphone restrictions. Surrogates for Harris have appeared to downplay expectations for the debate, like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who told CNN's that \"it will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate.\" Buttigieg was involved in Harris' debate preparations against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020. \"It's no ordinary proposition,\" Buttigieg said. \"Not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they're going to make people better off. It's because he's a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.\" Read more here.","summary":"The debate, hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia, is the first meeting between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/trump-harris-first-debate-2024/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/10/dff90132-b709-470d-bca8-7933cc03c29e/thumbnail/1200x630g7/c3e9bed501daccfaa5ddd53c5d21294b/gettyimages-2171028741.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://www.cbsnews.com/live/","publish_date":"2024-09-11 00:00:21","author":"Kaia Hubbard,Kathryn Watson","authors":["Kaia Hubbard","Kathryn Watson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.314},{"id":256117006,"title":"Trump cookies outsell Harris' by the thousands in Pennsylvania bakery: 'The margin is astonishing'","text":"As Americans across the country get ready for Tuesday night’s debate in Pennsylvania, a family-owned bakery in the town of Hatboro is once again using cookies to gauge support for the presidential candidates. These cookies have been a hot seller for the bakery, with 4228 sold expressing support for former President Trump, whereas only 369 have been sold expressing support for Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS News Philadelphia’s Ross DiMattei spoke to the owner of Lochel’s Bakery, Kathleen Lochel, about how she has been selling cookies themed around presidential elections for years. \"Every sale gets marked off.

Her case focused on Trump's call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump asked him to find enough votes to tilt the 2020 election in his favor, as well as an alleged plot to submit a false slate of pro-Trump electors to the Electoral College. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.However, the case was upended after a defense attorney representing one of Trump's co-defendants accused her of having a relationship with Wade, who she hired to lead the prosecution.Defense attorneys alleged the pair benefited from taxpayers' money, arguing she should be disqualified from the case. Willis has admitted to having the relationship with Wade but said their relationship began only after he was already hired, denying allegations of wrongdoing. McAfee in March ruled that Willis only needed to remove Wade from the case, allowing her to stay on.On Tuesday, McAfee declined to rule on Willis' efforts to block the subpoenas requested by a Georgia state senate committee investigating her relationship with Wade, according to legal documents first reported by Atlanta-based news station 11Alive.He raised concerns about whether his ruling on her efforts would be a conflict of interest, as he is also overseeing the election interference case.\"The court concludes that its impartiality might be reasonably questioned in this matter as the underlying petition may require the undersigned to consider factual legal conclusions already issued in Indictment Number 23SC188947,\" he wrote.The effort will now be \"randomly\" assigned to another judge, according to order.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell joined family members of the 13 slain service members to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal for each who died during the Kabul suicide attack. \"Their names are etched into our hearts and now into the history of our nation,\" Johnson said during the ceremony. \"Our nation owes a profound debt of gratitude to those service members.\" Jeffries agreed and said: \"Risking their own safety for that of our fellow Americans, our allies and our Afghan partners, they defended freedom and democracy until their last breath.\" The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest award Congress bestows to individuals, groups or institutions for their respective contributions and achievements. Many of those who died in the suicide bombing that occurred at Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26, 2021, \"were even younger than the war itself,\" Schumer said. \"It now falls on us, on all of us gathered here under the dome of Lady Liberty, to ensure the sacrifices of all our service members were not in vain,\" Shumer added. \"We must care for them and their families and defend the values of freedom and democracy they so nobly fought for.\" The ISIS-K group that formed from Afghanistan's Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide attack. The slain service members are Sgt. Nicole L. Gee, Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo, Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover, Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss, Cpl. Daegan W. Page, Cpl. Hunter Lopez, Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez, Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz, Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza, Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola, Lance Cpl. Rylee J. McCollum, Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui and Navy Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak. The suicide bombing also killed 170 Afghan civilians. \"A big part of us died with our children,\" Coral Doolittle, who is Sanchez's mother, said while thanking the Congressional members in attendance for making the event possible. The 13 Congressional Gold Medal awards were given after the House Foreign Affairs Committee recently blamed President Joe Biden for a poorly planned military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The committee members' report said Biden chose to withdraw all U.S. troops without considering security needs, the Doha Agreement or the advice of senior national security advisers or the nation's allies. The Biden administration said the committee report omitted important details and did not consider the effect of former President Donald Trump's administration, which negotiated the Doha Agreement with Taliban officials to enable the military withdrawal. Biden on Aug. 26 honored the sacrifices of the 13 service members three years earlier.","summary":"Congressional leaders posthumously honored 13 U.S. service members who were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul during the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 in the Capitol Tuesday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/10/congressional-gold-medal-ceremony-afghanistan-deaths/2311726009042/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2311726009042/2024/upi/87932f34b257a5cc88812359efbef1b6/v1.2/13-service-members-killed-during-Afghanistan-withdrawal-honored-at-Capitol.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:57:39","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.071},{"id":256117720,"title":"Undecided voters say what they're looking for from Trump and Harris' debate","text":"IE 11 is not supported.

Will today’s debate with Trump change that?","text":"With just two months to go until the US elections, Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris has failed to seal the deal. Everyone knows it, and no-one on the progressive side of things wants to admit it. Late this morning, Australian time, she will go up against Donald Trump in their first and possibly only presidential debate. Will this change the momentum, or create some? It is going to need to. Harris is a distinguished politician, a compelling speaker at times, a woman of colour with a hero story that connects to many millions. Her opponent is a shambling incoherent convicted felon who has already lost one election. They are running neck and neck, and the shambling felon is winning in the electoral college. The failure of Harris and the Democrats to crush Trump is just beginning to dawn on people. It is all the more bewildering to them, since there was such a rush of enthusiasm and energy when Joe Biden was finally detached from the nomination. But that was merely great relief, masquerading as a movement. With Biden in place, the polls made clear that the Democrats would be eviscerated in a Trumpslide. There would be collateral damage in the House and Senate; all would be lost. Harris’ elevation immediately corrected those polls, bringing half a dozen states back into play. Then, nothing. Everything locked. The polls are as they were as soon as the changeover occurred. The Democrats had a mixed strategy with Biden: a bit of incumbency, a bit of record, and a bit of being the old white guy who wasn’t mad. Then it was clear Biden was going lollygaga, and Trump looked like the least worse option to a bunch of people. These people have now gone back to Harris, or have simply decided they won’t have to vote now. But their shift has not been sufficient to give Harris a solid majority. She will have also lost a tranche of voters Biden knew he was holding on to. This was one reason, aside from drive, desperation, that he wanted to stay in the race: to keep those voters, Democrats and independents, who want an old white guy in power, especially one with a labour heritage. It appears Harris hasn’t gained that final tranche of “independent independents”, those genuinely swinging voters who are persuaded by programs, etc. Since Harris doesn’t really have one, but has no real incumbency factor either, she is caught between two sides. This is showing up in the polls. The trouble for the Democrats is these days the election runs on a knife edge. Biden won the 2020 election with 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232. But that’s a zero-sum game, which is only 36 points above the 270 needed to win. Facing a candidate like Trump, the Democrats getting to 270 is made difficult because of the swing of two big states to Republicans in the past decade or so. Ohio and Florida have 47 electoral college points between them. They used to be up for grabs; now Trump is running 5-8 points ahead in both. Ohio has been hit hardest of any state by deindustrialisation. It’s a state of mid-size and small cities, many of which were dependent on one large subsector — Buttfuzz, OH, with two factories making steering wheel covers for every US-made car — which are now gone beyond gone, hollowing out the entire community. The anger, despair and disconnection from anything like politics or power is palpable. Florida is a southern state that looked like a northern one for a while. Its south was its north, with a liberal culture shaped by northern retirees, Brooklyn on Key West, freebooters on the forgotten coast, and Jimmy Buffett fans who think Margaritaville is a member of the UN. That coalition is now yielding to deep South Republicans in the state’s north, Christians and a vast Cuban-American community. In 2020, the Democrats took Arizona and Georgia for the first time. That was 27 of their 36-vote margin. These are now running at evens, more or less. The election will be around Trump trying to win those back, and get one of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and maybe Nevada. Or Pennsylvania and Georgia. Or Pennsylvania and Michigan for a draw. And a couple of other combos. The trouble is, there are almost no swing states left. Iowa, Colorado, and New Hampshire were up for grabs regularly, recently. One can’t see any of those being battlegrounds. Nor one-offs like North Carolina and Indiana. Ohio and Florida, gone. The republic was founded on the electoral college system to give small and distant states equal sway. Instead, it has, in the presidential race, de facto disenfranchised tens of millions of voters. Who cares if you’re a California Republican or an Oklahoma Democrat? This new division is based on what is the rock-solid division in Western societies now, between the college-educated — and those who live in cities dominated by them, and their economic production — and those outside of it. In interests, ideologies and attitudes, it now supersedes old industrial class division and struggle and is a new form of class struggle. Were class, in the old sense, to be the dominant factor, Harris would be killing it, cruising to 400 electoral college votes. But the white and Black working- and middle-class want to stop the flood of immigration, and the Democrats do not. These voters want a trade war with China and a revival of a national economic plan. They are not particularly concerned if that involves lower business taxes, smaller government — which barely serves them in any case — and privatisation boondoggles. Should Kamala Harris lose in November, with an overall majority but an electoral college loss, maybe, maybe, finally, progressives, the political class, the media class, the whatever, will get it through their thick skulls that the old progressive-working/middle-class alliance is dead, gone, over. These classes have to be listened to, a conscious alliance has to be made, progressive interests have to be ceded to the groups that still have the numbers. But it will be an expensive lesson to learn, for America and the world. Okay! Let’s see if Harris can turn this round in two hours!","summary":"Harris and Trump are running neck and neck.

Pressure has been building on the Harris campaign to put up a policy platform on its website, similar to how former President Donald Trump and others have done in the past. Upon its release this week, however, the platform was met with even more criticism over a lack of specifics. In particular, one conservative immigration hawk took issue with the policy platform's failure to clarify Harris' stance on border wall funding, and whether she still views illegal border crossings as a civil enforcement issue — or rather, a criminal one. HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR LEFT-WING BENEFIT FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: ‘SMART SOLUTIONS’ \"The Harris campaign finally has an ‘Issues’ page, but — on immigration, at least — there's no there, there,\" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital. \"She doesn't say if she'd build more border barriers. She doesn't say whether she still wants to decriminalize border-jumping. The statement just repeats the vacuous nonsense about the ‘bipartisan’ Senate border bill, which was drafted by the Biden-Harris DHS to codify its unlawful schemes to import more illegal aliens.\" Despite indicating a potential Harris-Walz administration would \"bring back the bipartisan border security bill,\" the new online policy platform did not indicate where Harris stands on funding additional border wall construction. Republicans have pointed to Harris' public support for the failed bipartisan border bill as evidence she now backs a border wall after once calling it a \"medieval vanity project.\" But Harris campaign officials have said the border bill did not include any new money for border wall construction — it just extended the timeline to spend funds appropriated during Trump's last year as president. The bill, however, has limits to ensure the money is spent on border barriers. \"Americans should believe Harris' prior statements and current policies as Vice President,\" Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, told Fox News Digital in a statement Tuesday. \"She has previously stated numerous times that she opposes a border wall. And on day one of the Biden-Harris Administration, they halted construction of the border wall system.\" BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES ‘IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION’ Meanwhile, while running for president in 2019, Harris indicated during a nationally televised debate that she would not go after illegal border crossings. In a segment on ABC's \"The View,\" she reiterated her stance in a riff with the late-Sen. John McCain's daughter, Meghan. \"I would not make it a crime punishable by jail,\" Harris said. \"It should be a civil enforcement issue but not a criminal enforcement issue.\" \"Harris repeatedly said during her CNN interview that her values have not changed,\" Ries highlighted in her statement to Fox News Digital. Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the criticism from Krikorian and others about a lack of specifics in its new online policy platform, but did not receive a response. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the new policy platform \"a late-night, half-ass, wish list of policies.\" \"If Kamala really wanted to lower costs and secure the border — why did she cast the tie-breaking vote to cause inflation and support the war on our energy industry, and why is she allowing an invasion of illegal immigrants through our southern border as we speak?\" Not long after the Harris campaign's \"Issues\" page was added to its website, social media users pointed out that the new web page contained metadata with language urging voters to reelect President Joe Biden, according to The New Republic. The Biden language was quickly removed, but not before leaving the impression that the Harris campaign copied and pasted from Biden's documents, the outlet reported.","summary":"The Harris campaign released policy platform on its website after criticism over its absence, but the new platform left much to be desired for critics of Harris&apos; border policy positions.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-camps-new-policy-page-criticized-lacking-specifics-border-security-theres-no-there-there","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/harriscamppage.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:49:58","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":256116466,"title":"Report: Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump by 28% in TV Ad Exposure Before First Presidential Debate","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off Tuesday night in their first Presidential Debate, but the two candidates have already been jockeying for America’s attention for weeks now, and it appears that Harris is in the lead. Despite entering the presidential race more than seven months into the year, just over 100 days before Election Day, Harris has seen her TV ad campaign skyrocket, outpacing Trump by a significant amount, according to data from Samba TV. Since beginning her ad campaign in July, Harris ads have reached 44.4M U.S. households at an average frequency of 15.7, Samba says. That’s 41% higher than the 31.4M U.S. households that Trump’s ads have graced with a frequency of 13.9 during that time. (Frequency indicates the number of times that a user or household will interact with an ad over a specific period of time and, in this case, Samba is measuring the entire stretch of time since Harris launched her campaign in July. So, on average, each of those 44.4M households have interacted with a Harris ad 15.7 times in that time frame.) Throughout the entire year, Trump ads have reached 34.8M U.S. households, Samba says, meaning that Harris has still surpassed her opponent by 28% in ad reach despite the fact that she didn’t launch a TV ad campaign until about seven weeks ago. Interestingly, Samba also points out that 90% of Trump’s ad reach has occurred in the weeks since Harris joined the race. However, neither candidate is doing particularly well with minority groups, as both are overindexing among white audiences and underindexing among Hispanic and Asian households. According to Samba, Harris is underindexing in Hispanic households by 23%, Trump by 32%. Naturally, both candidates have turned their attention to the swing states — which Samba considers to be AZ, GA, MI, NC, NV, PA, WI — with Harris’ ads reaching 65% of households in those seven states and Trump ads reaching 62%. Harris’ lowest ad reach among the swing states is North Carolina and Georgia, where her ads have permeated 57% and 61% of households, respectively. Trump is also struggling a tad in the same states, reaching 59% of households in Georgia and 62% in North Carolina. By comparison, Harris ads reached an average of 32% of households across the other 43 states, and Trump ads reached 19% of households. Samba TV doesn’t measure mobile, however, their sample includes a panel of 3M terrestrial TVs, weighted to the U.S. Census. By contrast, Samba TV’s panel is nearly 100x larger than Nielsen’s household footprint of 45K homes. The entire nation will get the opportunity to see both candidates take a position in Tuesday night’s debate on ABC. Despite the ongoing carriage dispute between Disney and DirecTV that makes ABC unavailable to the latter’s customers, the event is being simulcast on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, the BBC, and C-Span. The debate will also be live streamed on Hulu.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are facing off&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Report: Kamala Harris Leads Donald Trump by 28% in TV Ad Exposure Before First Presidential Debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/report-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-by-28-in-tv-ad-exposure-before-first-presidential-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-Outpacing-Donald-Trump-28-In.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:48:20","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":256116468,"title":"Joe Biden surprises everyone with his ‘9/11’ remark before the debate","text":"President Joe Biden bluntly said he’s ‘doing 9/11’ tomorrow in a head-scratching comment to reporters who asked his plans ahead of the debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The gaffe-prone 81-year-old was heading to Marine One on the White House lawn when he made the comments just one day before the 23rd anniversary of the terror attacks. ‘I’m going up to my granddaughter’s birthday in New York,’ Biden began. ‘Then we’re gonna watch the debate, then tomorrow I’m doing 9/11.’ The president’s remark concerning the September 11, 2001 attacks on America caused social media users to express shock and amusement at his poor choice of wording. On social media platform X, one person commented: ‘Biden’s slip-ups are endless. You’d think someone would double-check his scripts by now.’ Another posted: ‘Yup… He done’, while someone added: ‘Gotta be honest until I saw that ‘tomorrow I’m doing 9/11′ clip just now I kind of forget Joe Biden was even alive.’ A Trump campaign associated X account shared the clip, saying: ‘This is the humiliating cognitive decline Kamala Harris COVERED UP.’ It is the latest in a long line of blunders for the commander in chief who stepped down from his reelection race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Just days before his shock announcement, he had even referred to Vice President Harris as Donald Trump. Other mishaps have included him bumping into flagpoles, falling off bicycles, and calling people by the wrong name. Biden is set to mark the anniversary of the attacks in New York City before also visiting the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorials. Conspirators from al-Qaida seized control of airplanes and hit New York’s World Trade Center and the Pentagon near Washington. A fourth plane was headed for Washington but crashed in Shanksville after crew members and passengers tried to storm the cockpit. Officially, the casualty count associated with the attacks is numbered at 2,996 – including 2,977 victims and 19 hijackers. Thousands more were injured, and New York bore the brunt of the death toll – with an estimated 1,600 victims in the North Tower and another thousand in the South. Harris and Trump will meet for the first time face-to-face for perhaps their only debate in the US presidential election. The event will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that has dramatically changed since the last debate in June. Following the last debate, Biden has bowed out of the race while Trump survived an assassination attempt. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. The 78-year-old has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The former president has resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden bluntly said he&#8217;s &#8216;doing 9/11&#8217; tomorrow in a head-scratching&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden surprises everyone with his &#8216;9/11&#8217; remark before the debate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/joe-biden-surprises-everyone-with-his-9-11-remark-before-the-debate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Joe-Biden-raises-eyebrows-with-doing-911.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:45:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":256117744,"title":"Strictly professional tour 'axed' amid misconduct investigation as it is revealed 'BBC staff had to hand over phones' in bullying probe","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Wednesday, Sep 11th 2024 1AM 10°C 4AM 10°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Dave Grohl's daughters delete social media accounts as he admits to cheating on their mother and fathering a love child with mystery mistress Runner, 29, dies during the Great North Run as his mental health fundraiser in memory of his sister and friend hits £10,000 Trump shooting task force obtains 'gruesome autopsy' for Thomas Crooks - as details emerge of would-be assassin's bizarre behavior in days before Trump and Harris presidential debate: Follow all the updates of the high-stakes ABC showdown as Donald lands in Philadelphia LIZ JONES: Kate's video was so moving, but to me something feels off... and I fear others will see through it Give yourself the best chance of securing pension credit worth £3,900: Applicants face call centre chaos, eight-month delays and unanswered letters - read our essential guide Carol Vorderman slams Keir Starmer and urges him to apologise for winter fuel allowance cut The 'Harvard University' brainteaser that 90% of people fail - can YOU solve it?

The results of the the £250,000 investigation are set to be released just days before the 20th anniversary series is due to start. And now a source who worked on the live stage productions has revealed to The Sun that the tour was cancelled after the allegations, which include workplace bullying. They told the publication: 'Strictly is -trying to rebuild as a brand and The Professionals tour was known as a hotbed of drinking and fun. 'The pro dancers work hard and play hard but with everything that's happened recently, it seems axing it eliminates the chance of any further issues.

Read More Strictly's star sparks concern they may QUIT BBC show as they land huge movie deal MailOnline have contacted BBC representatives for comment. The Professionals show took part over spring and summer after the Strictly Live! tour earlier in the year which features both the pros and their celebrity partners. Put on by BBC Studios, the tour is -choreographed by Strictly's creative director Jason Gilkison and features pros from the show including Nadiya Bychkova, Vitto Coppola, Katya Jones, Neil Jones and Luba Mushtuck. Giovanni has also previously taken part in the tour before he was suspended while a BBC probe is conducted over claims of off-camera misconduct made by his partner Amanda Abbington, 50, and two other former celebrity dance partners. Giovanni has vehemently denied the allegations. The investigation is due to be published in the coming days, and BBC staff have reportedly had their emails, texts and WhatsApps examined as part of the bullying probe. Members of the crew have had their phones searched for references to Giovanni or Amanda in a bid to gather evidence. Amanda previously said she would 'cry and vomit' after returning home from rehearsals with Giovanni Members of the crew have had their phones searched for references to Giovanni or Amanda in a bid to gather evidence The Mirror has revealed the subject access request is understood to have been made to the BBC by Amanda's team, to provide any personal data or information that might shed light on her and Giovanni's relationship. A source told the publication: 'People complied with it in the hope that it shoots down any claims of a cover-up.' Amanda previously said she would 'cry and vomit' after returning home from rehearsals with Giovanni. Read More BBC probe into Strictly's Giovanni Pernice will release its findings today Speaking to The Times, Abbington claims she has since received death threats from fans of the Italian dancer, whose long-term future on Strictly remains uncertain. She said: 'I've had the worst experience. The show was tough and horrible, but the aftermath of it I was not expecting. It's been really brutal and it just hasn't stopped. 'It's been awful, just relentless. Death threats and rape threats for just standing up for something that I thought was wrong.' The actress also admitted she would become nauseous after completing rehearsals with Pernice, a fan favourite who had appeared on Strictly for eight years prior to his suspension. Amanda's husband Jonathan Goodwin, a former escapologist who was left paralysed in 2021 after a TV stunt went horribly wrong, also corroborated her claim of physical sickness. She added: 'He'd go, 'Yes, you would come home and you'd vomit, you'd cry, and you'd think you were not good enough. You were a shadow, a shell.'' The investigation that began with accusations against Giovanni has since widened after more complaints surrounding the hit show. It has heaped further turmoil on Strictly, which is deemed to be the jewel in the Corporation's crown and is still watched by more than ten million people. Fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima has since been sacked by the show following similar claims of inappropriate behaviour towards TV personality Zara McDermott, with whom he was paired in 2023 Sources have told the Mail that the accusations have prompted bosses to extend the inquiry to look at other matters, and individuals, involved with the dance series as they prepare for its 20th anniversary. It means that Giovanni, who has already let his frustrations at the investigation be known, has faced an even longer wait for an outcome after three former dance partners, including Amanda, instructed lawyers to make 'serious complaints' about his conduct. It also threatens to damage Strictly, the BBC's biggest Saturday night success story since The Generation Game. A television source has previously told the Mail: 'This investigation is no longer just solely about Giovanni but other, more wider issues. The show has been going for 20 years and the whole veneer of Strictly is so sparkly and lovely, of course there will always be people who feel hard done by. 'Amanda's complaints have started something massive, it has opened the door for others to come forward about things they haven't been happy with. 'It is all a big headache for the BBC, it is about to celebrate a massive milestone with its 20th anniversary. 'Having the Giovanni complaint has been a big enough issue, but now it looks like there is more to be scrutinised and looked into.' Sources close to Giovanni say that he fully expects to be exonerated. Insiders say also that the widened inquiry will now present the Sicilian star as possibly being a 'small fish' in Strictly's potential downfall. He quit the show following claims by Amanda, star of Sherlock and Mr Selfridge, that he bullied her in training, claims which he denies. In May it was revealed that she had instructed London law firm Carter Ruck to represent her against the BBC. A source told the publication: 'The BBC is under huge pressure to get this probe done and dusted before September 14 when the new series kicks off' Fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima has since been sacked by the show following similar claims of inappropriate behaviour towards TV personality Zara McDermott, with whom he was paired in 2023. Confirming his departure on Instagram, Graziano wrote: 'I deeply regret the events that led to my departure from Strictly. My intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime. 'While respecting the BBC HR process, I acknowledge it's only right for the sake of the show that I step away. I am saddened that I wasn't allowed to offer a quote to the online news stories, and I take on board the sensitivity of the situation. 'There's more to this story that I am unable to discuss at this time, but I am committed to being strong for my family and friends. I wish the Strictly family nothing but success in the future.'

Four of them — one Democrat and three Republicans — spoke with CBS News about the stress and anxiety of their jobs, and also their conviction that elections are conducted freely and fairly.Asked what emotion this year's election fills him with, Republican Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for Georgia's office of secretary of state, said, \"I feel like it should be joy, but there's some angst.\"\"The biggest thing I worry about is the possibility of violence by people who lose,\" he said.Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said, \"We're daily receiving threats, whether it's through voicemails, emails, social media or in person.\" Benson said she personally is receiving threats, \"and it's escalating.\"\"They're all rooted in lies and misinformation, which is always disappointing and sad, but at the same time, it's real,\" she said.Republican Bill Gates, a member of the Board of Supervisors for Arizona's Maricopa County, has spoken openly about his need for therapy in the face of hostility driven by election denialism.\"This has unfortunately become a way of life, and we've invested as a board in metal detectors, in fencing, in cameras,\" he said. \"I wish we didn't have to do this, but we do.\"Gates said that despite the threats, he's \"gone and gotten the support that I need and I'm feeling great.\"In Georgia, poll supervisors are given a direct line to report trouble. It's a text tool that will \"notify the state election's office, the county election's office and the local sheriff's office if there's an issue,\" Sterling said, noting the system is in place for a range of problems that could crop up.\"Is it somebody yelling at people in the parking lot or is it somebody with a gun?\" he said.When asked about the concern some voters have about the possibility of undocumented immigrants voting, Benson said, \"I understand the fear, but it's an unfounded fear.\"Gates agreed, calling the specter of widespread voting from undocumented immigrants \"a bogeyman.\"\"It's not happening,\" he said. \"This is not something that people should be concerned about.\"Philadelphia City Commissioner Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said, \"We're just not seeing it in any real numbers.\"Bluestein said that if he could dispel one piece of election misinformation it would be, \"that there are magical ballot drops in the middle of the night.\" \"That window of time from when the polls close until the networks are able to call the race is where that window of misinformation can spread,\" he said.Gates said he wishes he could do away with \"the conspiracy theory that our tabulation machines are connected to the internet. They're not.\"After the 2020 election, Sterling chastised fellow Republicans for inciting unrest with election denying rhetoric.\"For 200 years, the loser accepting the outcome and coming back to fight again in two to four years was the way the system worked, and we all accepted it,\" Sterling said. \"We have to get back to that being the normal way of dealing with elections.\"Benson lamented, \"We've now endured four years of that same rhetoric. And that's why I think all of us do feel a little bit of a heightened state of anxiety going to this cycle that it's even more possible than it was in those darkest days of 2020 that we could see that rhetoric transform into violent acts in the weeks ahead. And we all have to brace ourselves for that.\"Gates said that he continues to be \"disappointed by many people in the Republican Party — elected officials who continue to be silent in the face of these threats. We cannot normalize threats of violence against anyone, but particularly those people who are literally running our democracy.\"","summary":"Election officials from four battleground states spoke with CBS News about the threats they're facing as Election Day approaches.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2024-election-worker-threats/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/10/6254e4ce-dd80-455a-a42d-5ef9c55b29b0/thumbnail/1200x630/854409a6f313429a78dea9309bc7e824/election-officials.png?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3184332_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:43:19","author":"Major Garrett","authors":["Major Garrett"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.586},{"id":256116804,"title":"Could the Harris-Trump debate shift the 2024 race?","text":"Could the Harris-Trump debate shift the 2024 race?

'I've spoken to the vice president. She seems calm, cool and collected. I think she's going to do great,' the president said ahead of boarding Marine One early Tuesday evening. 'And I'm not going to tell you what advice I gave her,' he told the hoard of reporters. The 81-year-old has faced off against former President Donald Trump three times on the debate stage - with the final one prompting his decision to drop out of the 2024 race. Biden also explained why he was traveling up to New York City early. 'I'm going up to my granddaughter's birthday in New York, then we're going to watch the debate and tomorrow I'm doing 9/11,' the president said. He's likely celebrating the birthday of Finnegan Biden, who turned 24 on Monday. She's one of Hunter Biden's three daughters with his first wife Kathleen Buhle. Harris will join Biden in New York to mark the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.

Walker Wright admits she represented Kruse in a separate legal matter before she represented Presley at the July 2023 document-signing meeting at the center of the case, where Kruse was an adverse party in the negotiations. But Walker Wright is adamant there was no conflict of interest. The lawyer also defends her decision to videotape Presley – her own client – at the meeting. “I videotaped Ms. Presley’s meeting with me and her execution of all Florida documents prepared by me with her consent. I explained each document during the meeting and answered all questions she asked,” Walker Wright states in her new sworn declaration. “I had videotaped other clients executing estate planning and other documents in the past if I had any concern that a document would possibly later be contested.” In her declaration, Walker Wright says Presley, 79, consented to the taping and that the documents in dispute were reviewed by another law firm in California that worked for Presley. Walker Wright further states that she rescheduled the signing appointment twice to accommodate Presley’s schedule. She says the meeting finally took place the day after Presley purportedly had dinner with former President Donald Trump and his wife Melania at Mar-a-Lago and just hours before Presley flew back to California to attend the 2023 Golden Globes, the awards ceremony where Austin Butler would win a best acting award for his lead role in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic and Presley would see her daughter, Lisa Marie, for the last time before her unexpected death days later. Walker Wright filed her declaration as part of a new motion asking a Los Angeles County judge to reject the claims lodged against her in Presley’s blockbuster elder abuse lawsuit filed against her and Kruse, as well as Kruse’s husband and another business associate, in July. Walker Wright argues she has never lived or worked in California, so Presley shouldn’t be allowed to sue her in the Golden State. In her underlying lawsuit, Presley claims Kruse is a “con-artist and pathological liar” who fraudulently induced her to form several closely held companies with Kruse at the helm. The company contracts gave Presley only minority shares in the ventures — just 20 percent in at least one case — even though Kruse received the exclusive license to profit off of Presley’s name, image, and likeness. Presley has not commented on the legal war outside of her filings. A source close to the Dallas star tells Rolling Stone she’s “been through hell” in the last year as she’s been fighting to extricate herself from the disputed deals. “Priscilla is one of the nicest people,” the source says. “She’s just a very sweet and trusting woman.” Presley filed her elder abuse lawsuit two months ago after Kruse separately sued her for breach of contract in Florida last year. Kruse alleged in her dueling lawsuit that Presley illegally walked out on their agreements when her financial circumstances changed in the wake of Lisa Marie’s death. As Rolling Stone previously reported, Presley initially challenged a 2016 amendment to her daughter’s Promenade Trust that removed her as a co-trustee, but she quickly reached a generous settlement with granddaughter Riley Keough that granted her a $1 million lump-sum payment, $100,000 annual salary, and burial rights near Elvis at Graceland. Kruse did not personally respond to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment sent Tuesday afternoon. Her Florida lawsuit hit a possible speed bump Tuesday when a judge agreed to let her lawyer, Jeffery Gilbert, withdraw from the case due to alleged “irreconcilable” differences. Kruse’s new lawyer, Kevin A. Reck, tells Rolling Stone he and his clients “look forward to vindicating our rights in these court proceedings.” He says Gilbert was “replaced” in the Orland case “in an effort to better align with the plaintiffs’ overall litigation strategy.” A hearing on Presley’s motion to dismiss the Florida lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction is set for November. Meanwhile, Walker Wright’s motion to be cut loose from the Los Angeles lawsuit is set for a hearing on Nov. 21. The judge on that case recently gave Presley an extension on her deadline to serve Kruse with the California complaint. Presley’s lawyers had alleged in a filing that Kruse and her husband were “evading service for no legitimate purpose other than to avoid facing liability in this action.” In his emailed response, Kruse’s lawyer denied his client was ducking service. “With regard to the scandalous allegations of the intentional evasion of service, these unfounded allegations are categorically denied,” Reck says.","summary":"Lawyer Lynn Walker Wright is asking a California judge to dismiss her from Presley's lawsuit alleging \"unconscionable\" financial abuse that duped her out of at least $1 million","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/priscilla-presley-elder-abuse-lawsuit-california-florida-auctioneer-1235099203/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/priscilla-presley-elder-abuse.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:38:44","author":"Nancy Dillon","authors":["Nancy Dillon"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.027},{"id":256116490,"title":"House hearing witnesses raise alarm over noncitizen voting","text":"Republicans invited three witnesses to testify during a hearing on the matter, and all of them validated worries from the Right that noncitizens will find ways to vote illegally in the 2024 election. Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd appeared before the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government and said his state has purged about a million people from its voter rolls since 2022. Byrd said a portion of those people were noncitizens. “This isn’t a fake or contrived issue,” Byrd said. Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting, but another witness during the hearing, the Immigration Accountability Project’s Rosemary Jenks, identified holes in the federal legal system that she said could be exploited by noncitizens or those hoping to register them. Jenks pointed to two pieces of legislation, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, also known as the “Motor Voter Act,” and the 2002 Help America Vote Act. Passage of these two bills made it “virtually impossible to prevent noncitizens from registering to vote, either accidentally or intentionally,” Jenks said. All 50 states have mechanisms for issuing driver’s licenses to noncitizens who are living in the United States legally, and noncitizens who live in the U.S. with some form of government-issued work authorization can, at times, eventually obtain Social Security numbers. “The Biden-Harris administration has been handing out work authorization documents like candy to inadmissible aliens with SSN issuances following close behind,” Jenks said. “So, we have federal voter laws that do not require proof of citizenship to register to vote combined with a massive population of noncitizens with valid driver’s licenses and SSNs.” Ranking member Mary Scanlon (D-PA) was the lone Democrat of the six on the subcommittee to participate in the hearing. She repeatedly bashed the topic of noncitizens voting as a “propaganda campaign” and a “lie” and noted that known instances of noncitizens actually voting are “extremely rare.” Former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are raising alarm over noncitizen participation in elections “to set the stage to challenge the 2024 election results” if Trump loses, Scanlon said. There are several well-documented instances of states, including not just Florida but also Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, and others, purging thousands of noncitizens from their voter rolls in recent years. Studies indicate that these noncitizens’ registrations materializing into votes is rare. Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) questioned why a lack of proof of a widespread occurrence of noncitizens voting should be a “reason not to guard against it.” Bishop’s question comes as a majority of House Republicans push to address the looming government funding deadline by attaching to a short-term spending bill the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act to require documented proof of citizenship to register to vote. Such documentation is currently not required to register to participate in federal elections using a federal form. Cleta Mitchell, a veteran conservative lawyer and senior legal fellow at the Conservative Partnership Institute, presented a counterpoint to Democrats who frequently point to noncitizen voting being illegal and the rare nature of it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “Yes it is [illegal], and it is also illegal for millions of people to swarm across our borders without documentation,” Mitchell said, blasting the Biden administration for failing to prevent millions of migrants from entering the country illegally. She also speculated that some Democrats could lack an appetite for preventing noncitizens from voting because, “for Democrats, noncitizens are their future political base.”","summary":"A Republican-led House panel elevated growing concerns on Tuesday about noncitizens registering to vote in battleground states and advocated stricter laws to prevent that from happening.

I was in Atlanta, I'm still traumatized.

In recent weeks, he and running mate JD Vance have been spreading unfounded, often racist claims about Haitian and Venezuelan migrants, part of a larger false narrative about an unprecedented “migrant crime” wave in the U.S. which is not actually occurring, which they allege is a consequence of Kamala Harris’s time in a “border czar” role she never actually had. Trump and Vance may not be telling the whole truth, or much of it at all, but the comments are revealing nonetheless. They’re a signal of what a Trump-Vance presidency might look like, where the candidates have promised an unprecedented and “bloody” crackdown on migrants inside the U.S. Most recently, Vance has joined in on an unfounded, racist rumor that migrants from Haiti are abducting and eating pets in his home state of Ohio. “Months ago, I raised the issue of Haitian illegal immigrants draining social services and generally causing chaos all over Springfield, Ohio,” Vance wrote on X on Monday. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” The claim appears to have its roots in a post from a Springfield-based Facebook group, later parroted by far-right activists and neo-Nazis online before it reached Vance and other prominent Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz. The Springfield police said on Monday they’d received no reports of pets being stolen or eaten, though Vance’s office insisted to The Independent that the senator has been receiving a “high volume of calls and emails” from “concerned citizens” about such claims. “I think it’s sad that some people are using this as an opportunity to spread hate or spread fear,” Jason Via, Springfield’s deputy director of public safety and operations, said of the situation earlier this year. “We get these reports ‘the Haitians are killing ducks in a lot of our parks’ or ‘the Haitians are eating vegetables right out of the aisle at the grocery store.’ And we haven’t really seen any of that. It’s really frustrating. As a community, it’s not helpful as we try to move forward.” Moreover, many of the up to 20,000 Haitians who’ve arrived in Springfield since the pandemic began are there legally under Temporary Protected Status, a program designed to protect migrants from countries undergoing crises like coups or national disasters. They have been credited with helping revive local manufacturing jobs. The Trump ticket followed a similar playbook earlier this month, repeating highly contested claims that a Venezuelan street gang had taken over an apartment complex in the Denver suburb of Aurora. “Take a look at Aurora in Colorado, where Venezuelans are taking over the whole town, they’re taking over buildings, the whole town,” Trump said at a recent Fox News town hall. “You saw it the other day they’re knocking down doors and occupying apartments of people.” Here, the factual situation is a bit murkier, though there’s certainly not a citywide Venezuelan gang invasion underway. Surveillance video of the apartment complex in question shows a group of armed men strolling the halls and entering an apartment, and a city council member and the mayor of Aurora have described buildings being taken over. The Aurora police department and governor of Colorado, meanwhile, say this is untrue, and that violent crime has actually been declining in the city at the same time it received an influx of Venezuelan migrants. In both cases, the claims from the Trump campaign may ignore key parts of the factual record but appear to have caused real damage on the ground. Denise Williams, a former NAACP chapter president in Springfield, who has spoken out against the torrent of hate directed at Haitians in the area, told NPR she’s been bombarded with angry messages since Vance’s claims went public. “I’m taking that as a pure threat,” she said. Residents of the apartment complexes in Aurora under the microscope have also described a wave of violent, angry threats coming their way after their lives became the focus of the Republican conspiracy industrial complex. Jefferson Medina, a Venezuelan immigrant who lives at one of the complexes, told Westworld last week that a group of men in a car with a “large gun” yelled “ugly things” as they drove through the area. “I go to work at five in the morning, and I’m already afraid for my life that someone is going to do something — because I’m Venezuelan, they’re going to do something,” Moises Didenot, another Venezuelan migrant, told the outlet. “We’ve all already been threatened with a flier saying we’re all criminals. I’m afraid someone is going to do something out of hate.” The anti-immigrant hysteria is part of the Trump campaign’s larger narrative that the U.S. is beset with a wave of “Biden migrant crime,” part of an “invasion” taking place at U.S. borders. This is also not true. Border-crossings did hit unprecedented levels at the U.S.-Mexico border in December, part of a record-breaking few years, but that hasn’t corresponded with a massive crime wave in the largely liberal-leaning cities where many have settled. Quite the opposite. As a meta-analysis of criminal justice studies from the Brennan Center notes, the data does not support the claim that immigrants commit more crimes or are incarcerated at higher levels than U.S.-born people, nor does the data suggest undocumented migration and sanctuary city policies drive violent crime. Those trends hold true even in cities to which Republican states like Texas have explicitly rerouted border-crossers, like Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York, and Los Angeles, according to an NBC News review of crime data available through 2024. But if Donald Trump’s political rise has proven anything, it’s that the hard facts aren’t particularly important to his brand of power. His numerous false claims about the 2020 election, none of which have secured meaningful victory in the courts, haven’t stopped the former president from retaining the support of nearly half of voters. And it seems more Americans are coming around to Trump’s point of view on immigrants. According to Gallup polling, between 2021 and July of 2024, the percentage of Americans who think immigration should be decreased shot up from 31 to 55 percent, mirrored by a sharp drop during that same period in those who think immigration should increase. His first term in office coincided with a string of chaotic and highly controversial comments and initiatives — a travel ban from largely Muslim countries; family separation that divided, in some cases permanently, children from their parents, including U.S. citizens; reported comments calling Haiti and other African nations “sh**hole countries”; and a pandemic-era border shutdown. As the last few weeks indicate, he was only just getting started.","summary":"Trump has vowed to carry out ‘largest domestic deportation operation’ in U.S. history if re-elected","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-vance-haitians-venezuela-migrants-b2610535.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/11/02/ELECCIONES-TRUMP-HACKEO_40019.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/k70oHggG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:35:22","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":256116206,"title":"What’s riding on Kamala Harris’ answer to a simple question: What is a woman?","text":"What is a woman? It’s a question Kamala Harris will ghost unless asked at Tuesday’s presidential debate. And if queried, will she dodge it as Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson did in her 2022 Senate confirmation hearing, saying, “I’m not a biologist”? There’s much more at stake than semantics. Harris has a commanding lead over Donald Trump among female voters everywhere, including the critical swing states. Her answer would indicate if her administration would gut Title IX protections for women’s sports and green-light gender ideologues who want children and adolescents to have easier access to medical interventions while erecting legal barriers between parents and children. Harris, as with many major issues, has not expressly addressed gender identification. She’s never been put on the spot to say if she considers biology outdated and a person’s gender is whatever he or she declares it to be. That doesn’t mean her position is a secret to her supporters. In her failed 2020 presidential run, she backed a radical program: taxpayer funding for transgender surgeries for prison inmates and illegal immigrants. Advocates for Trans Equality enthusiastically endorsed her in July. A Slate article concluded that “on trans issues, her record is surprisingly consistent, especially compared to other politicians” — “she’s been very progressive on this issue for 20 years.” The country’s oldest and largest LGBT publication, The Advocate, declared last month that Harris has “a long and strong record of support for LGBTQ+ equality” and would “most likely be the most pro-LGBTQ+ president.” The Biden-Harris administration has shown its support for LGBT+ issues by policies allowing gender to trump biological sex. On its first day, it issued a landmark executive order mandating all federal agencies enforce antidiscrimination policies based on “gender identity or sexual orientation.” The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission followed up by issuing expanded guidelines for sexual-harassment complaints that included intentionally calling an employee by the wrong name or pronoun or denying access to bathrooms or other single-sex facilities to an employee who identifies as a different gender. The Biden administration also injected gender identification into the landmark 1972 Title IX rules banning sex discrimination in education. Title IX opened up opportunities for girls and women in athletic competition. Allowing boys and men who identify as female to participate would be the effective end of women’s sports. And the White House, aware of the potential political fallout, has delayed final determination on how it will treat transgender athletes until after the election. But it’s not hard to read the tea leaves for a Harris administration. House Republicans narrowly advanced a measure to block the Biden gender modifications to Title IX in July, 210-205, with every Democrat voting against. In Harris’ native California, where she served as San Francisco district attorney and state attorney general, legal protections for gender self-identification have effectively ended the rights of women to have protected single-sex spaces. Since 2021, male convicts, including sex offenders who identify as women, can transfer to women’s prisons. Would Harris support the right of men who identify as women to get housing at shelters for battered women? The vice president’s response to “What is a woman?” would answer other questions too. Might a President Harris promote Rachel Levine, America’s first transgender admiral, from assistant health secretary to Health and Human Services chief — making history and burnishing her progressive credentials with the first transgender cabinet officer. Levine, a member in good standing of the partisan World Professional Association for Transgender Health, advocates “gender-affirming care” for minors. WPATH emails made public in litigation in June revealed it was Levine who successfully lobbied the organization to drop its minimum age limits for treating children with hormones and surgeries. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in July making the Golden State the first in the nation to bar schools from notifying parents if their children want to change their pronouns or express interest in a different gender. Blocking parents from knowing if their children are enamored with the transgender contagion and simultaneously removing age limits for medicalizing that interest seems a particularly dangerous combination. “What is a woman?” is a simple enough question. Getting an answer from Harris will provide the best clue as to whether she intends to be a president who protects women’s rights and those of children and parents or instead further dilute the hard-won rights of biological women and encourage gender-affirming care for minors by embracing a left-wing ideology that someone’s gender is a matter of ever-changing personal preference.","summary":"What is a woman?

Those without DirecTV will still be able to watch a simulcast of the debate on other major networks. The debate will also be streamed on Disney+, keeping the debate accessible to most American households—albeit with extra steps.

The hearing focused on a March 2020 directive that mandated nursing homes to accept recovering COVID-19 patients, a policy that some believe may have contributed to the spread of the virus among vulnerable populations.Ahead of Cuomo's testimony, the subcommittee released a report that accused the Democrat of staging a \"cover up\" to hide mistakes that endangered nursing home residents.Cuomo fiercely denied the subcommittee's claims during the hearing, including allegations that his administration concealed data on nursing home deaths to shield him from political fallout, adding that the subcommittee was seeking to divert attention from former President Donald Trump's pandemic leadership failures.The report \"provides no evidence to support Trump's main allegation, repeated for three years, that New York's guidance killed thousands in nursing homes. In fact, the report finds no causality whatsoever. Not one death,\" Cuomo said.The former governor's comments come after he and his administration released an incomplete accounting of the number of deaths at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Critics have focused on the March 2020 directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients just because they had COVID-19.Under Cuomo's directive, which was subsequently rescinded, over 9,000 recovering COVID-19 patients were released into nursing homes, a move intended to free up hospital beds, but has been widely criticized.According to the Associated Press, there were about 15,000 COVID-19 deaths among long-term care residents in New York, far more than the initial number previously disclosed.Republicans on the committee, including Ohio Representative Brad Wenstrup, continued to criticize Cuomo, accusing him of evading responsibility, telling the former governor, \"You own this. It's your directive, and the buck stops with you.\"The congressional committee had said it determined that Cuomo and his top aides approved the directive and later tried to deflect blame by ordering up an unscientific report concluding that the rescinded March directive likely had little impact on fatalities.Tensions at the hearing further escalated when New York Representative Elise Stefanik challenged Cuomo to apologize directly to the families of those who died in nursing homes during the pandemic.\"There are families sitting here. I want you to look them in the eye and apologize, which you have failed to do,\" she said.Cuomo refused, accusing the committee of turning the hearing into political theater. Despite resigning in August 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations, Cuomo continues to fight criticism over his handling of the pandemic. The hearing marked Cuomo's first public defense of his pandemic-era decisions in front of a congressional panel, though he previously testified behind closed doors in June.The subcommittee continues to investigate the full impact of New York's nursing home policies during one of the deadliest phases of the pandemic.Tuesday's hearing arrived after a separate state report released this summer and commissioned by Cuomo's successor, Governor Kathy Hochul, concluded that while the policies for nursing homes were \"rushed and uncoordinated,\" they were based on the best scientific knowledge available at the time.This article includes reporting from the Associated Press.","summary":"Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo defended his administration's handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/andrew-cuomo-defends-covid-19-nursing-home-decisions-house-hearing-1951775","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2468448/andrew-cuomo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:27:39","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":256116010,"title":"Asian Stocks Eye Declines; Oil Rises After Rout: Markets Wrap","text":"West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.8% in early trading after the global Brent benchmark dropped below $70 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time in more than two years, a fresh leg lower in a slump spurred by robust supplies, demand concerns and rampant speculative selling.

[+] U.S. military personnel. getty America's potential adversaries have been actively meddling in the 2024 presidential election, and that includes efforts directed from Beijing. Known as \"Spamouflage,\" it reportedly utilizes fake social media accounts claiming to be American voters and even U.S. military personnel. It is a largely bipartisan effort—with some attacks directed at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, while others criticized former President Donald Trump. The goal seems to be sowing division, and further dividing America politically. \"Spamouflage is not the most sophisticated influence operation targeting the United States, but it is quite interesting from a strategic perspective. Until the last couple of years, the Chinese Communist Party was mostly focused on 'positive' in its propaganda. In other words, rather than trying to denigrate adversaries, their primary—though not sole—strategy was to make China look better both for domestic and international audiences,\" explained Dr. Craig Albert, graduate director of the Master of Arts in Intelligence and Security Studies at Augusta University. A Spamalot Of Effort As with other misinformation and disinformation campaigns, it is about confusing issues, raising the volume in the process, and drowning out civil discussions. It is hardly original, but China has a long history of copying from the best—and in this case it is Russia that created the template. \"Spamouflage is interesting because it illustrates the Chinese Communist Party's shift from positive messaging to a narrative mirroring Russia and Iran: traditional information warfare targeting decision-making processes and influencing opinions of U.S. citizens to sow discord and spark potential riots, unrest, and violent protests if not more serious events,\" warned Albert.

Much like those efforts directed from the Kremlin, China's ultimate goal in this campaign, and its overall influence operations, is to make the U.S. lose faith in democracy and, as a result, citizens distrust the regime and government overall. \"Their grand idea, akin to Russia's strategy, is to spark a civil war within the United States by pitting ideological extremes against one another,\" said Albert. Even as Americans do remain as politically divided as any time since the Civil War, the fact remains that we're not really quite as close to armed confrontation. The discourse seems to be more of an uncivil war conducted on the anti-social networks. However, Albert further cautioned that Beijing may be testing the waters by interfering in the election, even if it won't lead to actual confrontation. \"Spamouflage is not there yet, but it is noteworthy in that it shows China is probing the possibilities they could exploit for election interference or for setting the battleground conditions in the case of a pending conflict in Taiwan,\" Albert noted. \"It also demonstrates that China, in line with the academic research in this manner, is increasing its use of artificial intelligence for rapid messaging through fake accounts and botnets, as well as in creating deep fakes that seek to create division in the US. China has spent a significant amount of money on the use of AI for information warfare, and Spamouflage is likely to be an initial glimpse of what the future holds for information warfare and influence operations.\" Although it has not been substantially effective, much like Russian influence operations since the 2016 election, it could suggest that the Chinese Communist Party are now contending in this contest of election interference. \"It's only a matter of time before what I call, the information adversarial axis—Iran, China, and Russia—are successful in influencing how U.S. citizens see the political system, and consequently, how the citizen may vote,\" said Albert. \"For these reasons, U.S. policymakers and intelligence analysts should pay close attention to Spamouflage as a probing operation and prepare for more sophisticated, Generative AI-based informational attacks, perhaps closer to the election.\" AI Efforts Will Continue China, along with Russia and Iran—and likely other states—will continue to use the latest technology against Americans. The irony is that the same technology that was developed to bring us closer together is now dividing us politically. The good news is that the same technology would be used to prevent similar disinformation campaigns. \"Technology platforms have made significant strides in detecting and preventing disinformation campaigns. One area of improvement may be the enhancement of artificial intelligence to better identify subtle patterns in language, imagery, or behavior in relation to emerging forms of disinformation such as deepfakes,\" said Dr. Masahiro Yamamoto, associate professor and department chair of the Department of Communication at the University at Albany. \"Continuously training and updating algorithms on diverse datasets would be crucial. These platforms can also invest in media literacy education to help users develop critical thinking skills and discern misleading content.\" Yet, the situation is likely to get worse, especially in the weeks leading up to the election as Americans remain so addicted to social media. \"Research has shown that well-coordinated disinformation efforts can reach large audiences by infiltrating online communities predisposed to certain beliefs and exploiting algorithms that prioritize content likely to provoke strong reactions and generate high engagement,\" added Yamamoto. \"Research suggests that disinformation campaigns target swing states where people may be more susceptible to false information that algins with their views. These efforts can deepen existing divides, sow seeds of distrust, and undermine confidence in democratic institutions.\" Follow me on Twitter.

The event, at 8 p.m. Chicago Time in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign that’s dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and both sides chose their running mates. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris. The vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administration’s accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past. The debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning. “If she performs great, it’s going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and they’ll rejoice,” said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. “If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So there’s more riding on it.” Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a “prosecutor’s instincts to the debate stage.” “That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,” Hogan said. The first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama. Trump plans to hit Harris as too liberal Trump and his campaign have spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. He’s been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates. Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs — and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned — as pragmatism, insisting that her “values remain the same.” Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues. The former president has argued a Harris presidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of Biden’s still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months. Trump’s team insist his tone won’t be any different facing a female opponent. “President Trump is going to be himself,” senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday. Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump “respects women and doesn’t feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.” His advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a “word salad” of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to “let her talk.” The former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently “happened to turn Black.” Harris wants to argue Trump is unstable and unfit The vice president, who has been the Biden administration’s most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out Trump’s inconsistencies around women’s reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect Florida’s six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall. Harris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after Russia’s invasion and Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight. She is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail “those involved in unscrupulous behavior,” including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials. Harris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies. “There’s no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,” she said. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speaking Tuesday to donors in Las Vegas, highlighted Trump’s experience debating after three White House runs. “No one in modern times has done more of these,” he said. “The good news is that this is his seventh debate, and we know exactly what to expect.” AP Polling Editor Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux in Washington and Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Las Vegas, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Josh Boak in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/09/10/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate-2024-elections-philadephia","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e6965e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3425+0+287/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F3b%2F846176d747f08a45541529e948b0%2F2170","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-10 23:26:44","author":"Michelle L.

The proportion of Americans living in poverty also fell slightly last year, to 11.1%, from 11.5% in 2022. But the ratio of women’s median earnings to men’s widened for the first time in more than two decades as men’s income rose more than women’s in 2023. The latest data came Tuesday in an annual report from the Census Bureau, which said the median household income, adjusted for inflation, rose 4% to $80,610 in 2023, up from $77,450 in 2022. It was the first increase since 2019, and is essentially unchanged from that year’s figure of $81,210, officials said. (The median income figure is the point at which half the population is above and half below and is less distorted by extreme incomes than the average.) “We are back to that pre-COVID peak that we experienced,” said Liana Fox, assistant division chief in the Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division at the Census Bureau. The figures could become a talking point in the presidential campaign if Vice President Kamala Harris were to point to them as evidence that Americans’ financial health has largely recovered after inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022. On Wednesday, economists predict that the government will report that inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% in August. The Federal Reserve, whose target level for inflation is 2%, is poised to start cutting interest rates next week. Former President Donald Trump might counter that household income grew much faster in his first three years in office than in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, though income fell during his administration after the pandemic struck in 2020. The data showed that while the typical American household regained its 2019 purchasing power in 2023, it essentially experienced no rise in living standards over that time. That is a sharp difference from the preceding four years, when inflation-adjusted median incomes rose 14% from 2015 through 2019. The data is based on pre-tax incomes, including Social Security and other benefit programs, though it excludes noncash benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid. The jump in incomes reflects solid job creation last year, which helped reduce the unemployment rate to a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023. The proportion of Americans in the so-called prime age group of 25-to-54-year-olds with jobs averaged 80.7% last year, the highest level in 23 years. Economists often focus on prime-age workers because they exclude younger people, who are often still in school, and older workers, who are more likely to retire or reduce their hours. By racial groups, median household income rose 5.4% for whites to $84,630, increased 2.8% for Black Americans to $56,490 and was unchanged for Hispanics at $65,540. Asian incomes were also largely unchanged at $112,800. While the overall poverty rate declined from 2022 to 2023, under an alternative measure of income the proportion of children in poverty rose from 12.4% to 13.7%. The bump in child poverty comes two years after it had plunged to just 5.2%, when the pandemic-era expansion of the child tax credit provided enhanced benefits to families. But the credit expired in 2022. “If you want to reduce poverty in the short run, you transfer income to poor families,” said Steven Durlauf, an economist at the University of Chicago. Census also calculated that 92% of Americans had health care in 2023, largely unchanged from the previous year, though the proportion of uninsured children ticked up a half-point to 5.8%.

Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Enough Republicans were also coming out against the bill, though for different reasons, that its prospects of passing the House appeared dim. Even if it does pass the House on Wednesday, the bill would go nowhere in the Senate. Johnson said the issue of election security is too critical to ignore, though research has shown that voting by non-citizens is extremely rare. It’s also clear that Republicans see value in making House Democrats take another vote on the issue. The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July “If you have a few thousand illegals participate in the election in the wrong place, you can change the makeup of Congress and you can affect the presidential election,” Johnson said. “The American people understand that.” The first test for the stopgap spending bill came Tuesday with a 209-206 vote that kept it moving ahead. But some Republicans who have said they will oppose the bill on final passage allowed it to proceed. The measure includes a six-month extension of federal funding to keep agencies and programs operating through March 28. But Democrats want a shorter-term extension so that the current Congress will set full-year spending levels for fiscal year 2025 rather than the next president and Congress. They also want the proof of citizenship mandate stripped out of the bill, saying it’s unnecessary because states already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters’ eligibility and maintain accurate voter rolls. “Is it any surprise that the speaker’s purely partisan CR seems to be running into trouble?” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, using Washington parlance for the short-term continuing resolution needed to prevent a shutdown. “The answer is very simple. The House should stop wasting time on a CR proposal that cannot become law.” Schumer called on Johnson to consult with Democratic leaders and the White House on a bipartisan package that can pass both chambers. A few House Republicans have also come out against the bill. Some won’t vote for any continuing resolution. They want Congress to return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills individually. Others say the continuing resolution funds programs at levels they consider inappropriate at a time of nearly $2 trillion annual deficits. “I’m a firm no on bankrupting the nation and a yes on election integrity,” said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., in announcing his opposition. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said Republican leadership was asking him to vote for what he called “a Nancy Pelosi-Schumer budget.” “I just think that’s a bad idea,” Burchett said. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said on X that the continuing resolution was “an insult to Americans’ intelligence.” “The CR doesn’t cut spending, and the shiny object attached to it will be dropped like a hot potato before passage,” Massie said. Republicans can afford to lose only four votes from their ranks if every Democrat votes against the bill. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday seemingly encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans in the House and Senate “don’t get assurances on Election Security.” He said on the social media platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a continuing resolution without such assurances. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell disagreed when asked about Trump’s post. “Shutting down the government is always a bad idea, no matter what time of the year it is,” McConnell said. House Republicans met behind closed doors Tuesday morning to discuss the path forward. Rep. Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told colleagues “this is the best fight we’ve ever had,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. By holding another vote on the proof of citizenship requirement for voter registration, House Republicans are making Democrats in competitive swing districts take another vote on the issue ahead of the election. Last time, five Democrats sided with Republicans in support of the requirement. And their votes this time will be highly scrutinized. Lawmakers said no plan B was discussed for government funding and that Johnson was determined to hold a vote regardless of the likely outcome. “This is important to him,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. “This is the hill to die on.” As lawmakers debated the short-term spending measure on the House floor, the focus was almost entirely on the proof of citizenship mandate, also referred to as the SAVE Act. Republicans linked a surge in migrants during the Biden administration with the prospect that some could vote in future elections. “What are you afraid of to require someone to prove who they say that they are?” said Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y. Democrats countered that the proof of citizenship requirement would disenfranchise many Americans who don’t have the required documents readily available when they get an opportunity to register to vote. “Let me be clear, the SAVE Act is not about targeting undocumented immigrants, it’s about suppressing the vote of millions of American citizens,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.

Alito has traditionally led the court in stock ownership, and his 2023 disclosures reflect that trend. Other than a gift of $900 concert tickets from a German princess, which had no additional explanation, Alito reported no other benefits. (The gift reporting threshold for justices is $480). The justices’ financial disclosures have come under increased scrutiny since recent investigative reports revealed luxury trips gifted to Justice Clarence Thomas by billionaire Republican megadonor Harlan Crowe that were not reported on his disclosures. ProPublica also reported on a private jet trip taken by Alito in 2008 that wasn’t included in Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito attend a private ceremony for the late Sandra Day O'Connor, Dec. 18, 2023 Jacquelyn Martin-Pool/Getty Images his financial disclosures. Critics of the court have argued for more recusals from justices holding stock in companies doing business before the court, or when they have received gifts from interested parties. Among those pushing for congress to pass Supreme Court ethics reform is Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who argues a binding code of conduct and term limits are the next needed steps. Alito, who’s been in the news for other controversies, opposes ethics standards. Trump Case Reassignment Request In the event that the criminal complaint in former president Donald Trump’s classified documents case is revived by the 11th Circuit, ethics experts and a retired judge have asked the appellate court to reassign it away from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, based on what they describe as controversial rulings that call into question Cannon’s impartiality. Judge Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case in July, after holding that special counsel Jack Smith did not have constitutional authority to investigate and prosecute. Former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, ethics scholars Stephen Gillers and James Sample, and the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington joined the amicus brief, arguing, among other things, that Cannon’s unusually long delays in the case evidenced a lack of neutrality. The Eleventh Circuit has already reversed Cannon twice in the case - on one occasion after she appointed a special master to review documents taken by the FBI from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort and blocked the government’s use of the materials.
