We work closely with those entities too,” Tufton said.\n\nHe further noted that the government maintains strict oversight of tourism-related establishments, supported by established public-health protocols.\n\n“There is a certification process that is required and that is given in conjunction with [the] health [ministry] and so we are not giving an advisory to discourage tourism or visitors. We are just placing all on alert and are particularly focused on the vulnerable communities,” Tufton added.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Ministry, Regional Health Authorities and parish health departments will continue close collaboration with tourism stakeholders to ensure that visitors remain safe and have access to medical services throughout their stay.\n\nThe public is reminded that leptospirosis is preventable, treatable and survivable when detected early. Jamaicans are urged to wear protective gear during clean-up efforts, avoid floodwater, secure food and water supplies and maintain clean surroundings.\n\nTufton also confirmed that no other communicable diseases are currently of concern, adding, “It is to be noted that there are no other communicable diseases that are of concern at this time, with dengue and influenza remaining below the threshold and below the normal numbers for this time of year.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Christopher Tufton Health leptospirosis \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trump ramps up Venezuela threats, warns airspace ‘closed’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 29, 2025 \n\n\n PALM BEACH, United States (AFP) -- US President Donald Trump sharply escalated his threats against Venezuela on Saturday, ominously warning that the c... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball, Latest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reggae Girlz thrash Dominica 18-0 in Concacaf Qualifiers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 29, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jamaica’s Reggae Girlz opened their Concacaf Women's Qualifiers with a record 18-0 thrashing of Dominica at the Darren Sammy Crick... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\", \"breaking-news\":\"Push Notifications\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Andrew Mystic drops powerful new album \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 29, 2025 \n\n\n Jamaican artist, Andrew Mystic has released a fiery groundbreaking album that fuses reggae, dancehall, and gospel into a compelling narrative of life’... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Thesaurus blows up with hope message in ‘Konqueror’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 29, 2025 \n\n\n Dancehall artiste Thesarus has been gaining traction in the streets with his latest release, Konqueror , produced by McDonz Records.

US President Donald Trump warned on November 29, 2025 that the airspace above and near Venezuela should be considered closed, the latest escalation in a standoff with leftist leader Nicolas Maduro. (Photos: AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nNovember 29, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Trump ramps up Venezuela threats, warns airspace ‘closed’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPALM BEACH, United States (AFP) — US President Donald Trump sharply escalated his threats against Venezuela on Saturday, ominously warning that the country’s airspace should be considered “closed.”\n\nCaracas, which views a large US military buildup in the Caribbean as a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro, slammed Trump’s warning as a “colonialist threat.”\n\n“To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social network, “please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”\n\nThe US president did not elaborate.\n\nHis warning comes days after US aviation regulators told airlines to use increased caution near Venezuela over the mounting tensions, prompting multiple major carriers to suspend flights.\n\nA statement by the Venezuelan foreign ministry called the latest remarks from Trump a “new extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.”\n\nIt warned that the airspace disruptions would also mean a halt to repatriation flights of Venezuelan migrants from the United States.\n\nAt mid-afternoon, aviation tracking site FlightRadar24 showed only a few airplanes operating over Venezuela.\n\nTrump’s administration is piling pressure on Venezuela, with a major military deployment in the Caribbean that includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier.\n\nWashington says the aim is to curb drug trafficking, but Caracas insists regime change is the ultimate goal.\n\nUS forces have carried out strikes against more than 20 alleged drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since early September, killing at least 83 people.\n\nWashington has yet to release evidence that the vessels it targeted were used to smuggle drugs or posed a threat to the United States and experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.\n\nRaising the stakes further, Trump warned earlier this week that efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking “by land” would begin “very soon.”\n\nIn recent days, repeated activity by US military aircraft has been recorded just a few dozen kilometers off the Venezuelan coast, according to aircraft tracking websites.\n\n– Airline ban –\n\nThe Dominican Republic also granted the United States permission this week to use airport facilities as part of its deployment, while the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, located only a few kilometers from Venezuela, recently hosted US Marine Corps exercises.\n\nThe tensions have now led to major disruptions in air travel to and from Venezuela.\n\nUS aviation authorities last week urged civilian aircraft operating in Venezuelan airspace to “exercise caution” due to the “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around Venezuela.”\n\nThat warning prompted six airlines that account for much of the travel in South America to suspend flights to Venezuela.\n\nThe move infuriated Caracas and led it to ban the companies — Spain’s Iberia, Portugal’s TAP, Colombia’s Avianca, Chile and Brazil’s LATAM, Brazil’s GOL and Turkish Airlines — for “joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government.”\n\nLeftist Maduro, whose re-election last year was widely rejected by the international community as fraudulent, believes the operation is secretly aimed at overthrowing him.\n\nHe has reacted defiantly, staging military exercises and mass rallies aimed at projecting strength and popular support.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Friday that Trump and Maduro had spoken by phone last week and discussed a possible meeting in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: airspace Donald Trump Nicolas Maduro United States Venezuela \n\n\n\n\n\n\n

But Trump has the law on his side.\n\nTrump’s White House fired back at critics not with a lengthy diatribe, but by simply quoting from the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 212(f). This explicitly allows the president of the United States to suspend entrance of a group of aliens deemed dangerous to national security and national interests.\n\nThe section above-mentioned, and posted on X by the White House, says:\n\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nRelated: Meet the Bestial Criminals ICE Arrested on Thanksgiving\n\nIt is striking that many leftists are raising a greater furor over the restrictions on immigration than they did over an Afghan migrant illegally present in America murdering a National Guardsman in a targeted attack. Yet one more proof of the fact that Democrats hate American citizens, and enthusiastically side with terrorists and murderers.\n\nTrump shared an article from Just the News about the massive vetting failures of Operation Allies Welcome, though which the Afghan murderers entered America. Just the News explained:\n\nThe program was widely criticized by members of Congress for allowing as many as 85,000 Afghans to come into the country quickly without complete vetting, and officials said Lakanwal was among those to enter during that timeframe.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated, “The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome on September 8, 2021, under the Biden Administration.”\n\nRelated: Pirro: First Degree Murder Charges Against Guardsman’s Killer\n\nAfghan migrant Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s targeted attack Wednesday murdered Sarah Beckstrom and left Andrew Wolfe fighting for his life. It also ignited a firestorm of controversy about our immigration processes and how they have been corrupted, since the Biden administration allowed Lakanwal in through a post-Afghanistan withdrawal program. Lakanwal has CIA ties, according to Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nGod knows how many criminals and terrorists came in through Operation Allies Welcome. During the catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal, the Biden administration stranded thousands of Americans and Afghan allies in Taliban territory, while allowing in huge waves of barely vetted Afghans.\n\nPresident Trump is right to take drastic action. Sarah Beckstrom should have been alive to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family, instead of dying over the holiday. Andrew Wolfe shouldn’t be in critical condition while his family wonders if he’ll ever leave the hospital.

The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.\n\n\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.\n\n\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"\n\nAudu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"\n\nRural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.\n\nAccess to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.\n\nThey live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult.

Posting on Truth Social, Trump cited section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to justify his actions of barring migration. Section 212(f) of INA authorises the US president to \"suspend entry\" of \"any applicants or any class of applicants\". It also allows the President to \"impose on the entry of applicants any restrictions he/she may deem appropriate\" for such period as he/she deems necessary upon determining that their entry \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\". \"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" Trump quoted the section 212(f) of INA. The official handle of the White House also posted the same on X. The Trump administration on Friday intensified immigration restrictions, rolling out a series of heightened security measures following a State Department directive that temporarily halts visa issuance for all travellers holding Afghan passports. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the decision in a post on the social media platform X, stating, \"President Trump's State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals travelling on Afghan passports.\" He added, \"The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.\" Officials described the decision as part of a broader response to Wednesday's shooting near the White House that left two National Guard soldiers critically injured. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow confirmed that asylum officers have been directed to stop issuing decisions until enhanced vetting can be completed for every applicant. \"This pause will stay in place until we can ensure that every alien is properly vetted. The safety of the American people always comes first,\" he said in a statement posted on X. After the Wednesday shooting near the White House that killed one of the two National Guard members in Washington, DC, one of them (Spec. Sarah Beckstrom) has died, while the other remains wounded. Lakanwal, the Afghan national accused of carrying out the shooting, will be charged with first-degree murder, the Washington Post reported earlier. Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington, DC, said that more counts are likely to follow against suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal. The Washington Post reported that the upgraded charges of first-degree murder, instead of the initial charges of assault, raise the possibility for the suspected attacker to face the death penalty in the case. Although capital punishment has been abolished in the District of Columbia, Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday said she will seek the death penalty against the man accused of shooting two West Virginia National Guard members in Washington, the Hill reported. In August, US President Donald Trump had asserted that his government would seek capital punishment in every murder case that occurred in Washington, DC. Trump on Friday said that he would permanently pause migration from all \"third-world countries\" to allow the US system to terminate illegal admissions into the United States.","summary":"The Trump administration on Friday intensified immigration restrictions, rolling out a series of heightened security measures","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/trump-stands-firm-on-freezing-migration-after-dc-shooting-1920605","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/30/1984366-aa-6015425.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-30 01:10:46","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":383497708,"title":"Trump declares Venezuelan airspace closed","text":"US President Donald Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned airlines and pilots on Saturday that the airspace near Venezuela was closed, ratcheting up what his administration has characterized as a war against drug cartels.In a post on social media to \"all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,\" the president wrote that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela should be considered \"CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"Trump did not go into further detail in his post, but it came after he warned Thursday night that the United States could \"very soon\" expand its attacks on boats thought to be carrying drugs in the waters off Venezuela to targets inside the country.

However, Kaul—and other Democrat prosecutors—vowed to continue the state prosecutions. \n\nThe two assertions from Kaul’s office undermine the forgery and fraud case brought by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, according to defense filings by Jim Troupis, a former state judge and veteran Republican election lawyer who was charged last year with forgery for advising the alternate electors. Troupis settled the case in 2024 with no admission of wrongdoing. \n\nThe change, of course, from the state came after U.S. Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith secured a grand jury indictment against Trump in the federal election case in August 2023 and additional charges a year later. The indictment alleged in part that Trump was engaged in a conspiracy to assemble “fraudulent slates of electors.”\n\nFirst, on Dec. 1, 2020, Kaul said alternate Republican electors could meet and vote. The point of his argument was that the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not have to rush a decision on the election challenge before Dec. 14 when the state electors met to count votes. \n\nSo, the attorney general argued in a filing that also included the names of three assistant attorneys general, a ruling after Dec. 14 meant there was “zero risk” a separate slate of pro-Trump electors wouldn’t be counted if a recount or court rulings reversed the election outcome.\n\n“There is no reason to invalidate the existing certificate of ascertainment or to enjoin the commissioner or the governor from certifying electors, because the issuance of a certificate of ascertainment does not impair the petitioners’ ability to obtain a meaningful recount appeal,” the memo from Kaul and assistants said.\n\nThe attorney general added, “There is also no necessity for their recount appeal to bypass the procedural requirements … because, contrary to their suggestion, neither federal nor state law requires their recount appeal to be completed before December 14, 2020.”\n\n“As long as the Court does not interfere in the way requested by the petitioners, there is zero risk that Wisconsin will have no electoral votes on December 14,” the attorney general memo added. “The procedure prescribed by Congress accommodates petitioners’ right to a meaningful recount appeal.”\n\nMore than a year later, Feb. 9, 2022, the attorney general’s office advised the Wisconsin Election Commission that the alternate slate of electors meeting and voting didn’t violate the law.\n\nLaw Forward, a liberal legal group, alleged to the Wisconsin Election Commission, that the alternate electors violated the law. The commission solicited an opinion from the Wisconsin Department of Justice on the matter. In response, the attorney general’s office issued a memo rejecting those complaints.\n\n“Nothing in either statute prohibits or otherwise limits a party from meeting or otherwise casting electoral votes during a challenge to an election tabulation,” the February 2022 memo to the commission said. \n\nThe complaint alleged the Wisconsin pro-Trump alternate electors “met in a concerted effort to ensure that they would be mistaken, as a result of their deliberate forgery and fraud, for Wisconsin’s legitimate presidential electors.”\n\nOn that point, the attorney general’s office asserted: “The record does not support this allegation. Before and after the December 14 meeting, the respondents publicly stated, including in court pleadings, that they were meeting to preserve legal options while litigation was pending.” \n\nKaul’s office did not respond to requests for comment. \n\nAlthough legal experts have argued the Trump pardon on state charges were symbolic, Troupis argued the Justice Department should intervene in the case. \n\n“The United States Department of Justice must take action—civil rights investigation and intervention—to stop these ongoing prosecutions of those who worked with President Trump,” Troupis wrote in an op-ed published on ConservativeHQ. \n\nBecause of his pending legal case, he referred questions to the opinion piece. \n\n“On December 1, 2020 the Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, in writing, explicitly advised us and the Wisconsin Supreme Court that Trump should use them,” Troupis wrote. \n\nTroupis added: “It gets worse. Kaul’s own office wrote an official letter in 2022 noting that use of Alternate Electors has a long history and it was certainly not “fraud or forgery” (the charges he now makes).”\n\nIn May 2022, Law Forward led a lawsuit against Troupis claiming that the meeting of Republican electors in 2020 was a public nuisance and a conspiracy. In March 2024, to avoid more legal costs, Troupis and legal adviser Kenneth Chesebro settled the civil case with no admission of wrongdoing, but an agreement from both not to participate in alternate elections in future presidential elections. \n\nSeparately, in December 2023, the Wisconsin alternate Trump electors settled a case, admitting their vote was “part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results” and agreed they would not be presidential electors in future elections with Trump.\n\nIn June 2024, in the lead up to the presidential election, Kaul held a press conference to announce he filed a criminal complaint for forgery against Troupis and other Trump supporters in Dane County Circuit Court. \n\n“The criminal complaint in this case alleges that the defendants were part of a conspiracy to present a certificate of purported electoral votes from individuals who were not Wisconsin’s duly appointed electors,” Kaul said when announcing the criminal complaint. “The Wisconsin Department of Justice is committed to protecting the integrity of our electoral process.”\n\nLaw Forward defended the charges. The defendants’ assertion that the Wisconsin attorney general blessed the use of alternate electors “distorts the facts,” argued Jeff Mandell, president and general counsel at Law Forward.\n\n“The [Wisconin] DOJ opinion letter referenced here expressed a line-attorney’s opinion that the scheme did not clearly violate either of two specific statutes administered by the Wisconsin Elections Commission,” Mendell told The Daily Signal in a statement. \n\n“But the letter also expressly allows that the scheme might violate other Wisconsin laws, including other Wisconsin election laws.”\n\nLaw Forward specifically referenced a paragraph from the February 2022 attorney general letter that says the attorney general was not addressing every aspect of Wisconsin law.\n\n“This memorandum does not address other potential violations of law, such as election fraud under Wis. Stat. § 12.13 or matters that the Complainants have raised to other authorities or discussed in the media, such as forgery under Wis. Stat. § 943.38, false swearing under Wis. Stat. § 946.32, falsely assuming to act as a public officer under Wis. Stat. § 946.69, simulating legal process under Wis. Stat. § 946.68, misconduct in public office under Wis. Stat. § 946.12, conspiracy, aiding, or attempt to commit such acts, or any other matter outside the scope of the complaint,” the portion of the attorney general’s 2022 memo highlighted by Law Forward says.\n\nThe the first paragraph of the attorney general’s letter says, “this memorandum concludes that thecomplaint does not raise a reasonable suspicion that respondents violated Wisconsin election law.”\n\nAlso in December 2020, alternate slates of Republicans electors voted in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. Democrat prosecutors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada also brought charges. \n\nPresidential pardons typically can only come for federal offenses. Nevertheless, in the pardon statement, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin argues presidential election functions are federal even if the charges came under state law.\n\n“Notwithstanding that fact, these prosecutions are attempts by partisan state actors to shoehorn fanciful and concocted state law violations onto what are clearly federal constitutional obligations of the 2020 Trump campaign: the establishment of the contingent electors, the actions attendant to their roles as presidential electors, and their duties under established historical and legal precedent to exercise their responsibilities as electors—all of which are functions of federal—not state—law,” Martin argued.","summary":"Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul’s office twice asserted that a slate of alternate electors contesting the 2020 election was legal before bringing criminal charges on...

It is dangerous for sitting Members of Congress to incite insubordination in the United States' military, and President Trump called for them to be held accountable.'\n\nThe site goes further, asserting that Democrats released the video urging disobedience, then 'implied President Trump had issued illegal orders,' and that despite allegedly knowing those claims were false, 'the Fake News decided to run the story anyway.'\n\nBeyond the weekly offenders, the White House has constructed a sweeping 'Offender Hall of Shame', which features a scrolling database of reporters, publications and disputed articles.\n\nEach entry is categorized under blunt labels including 'Bias,' 'Lie,' 'Malpractice,' and 'Left-wing Lunacy.'\n\nThe Hall of Shame currently includes The Washington Post, CNN, and the cable network now branded as MS NOW.\n\nA leaderboard ranks the Washington Post as the administration's top repeat offender.\n\nAmong the articles singled out: a report stating that the US Coast Guard would stop categorizing swastikas and nooses as hate symbols - a policy that was later reversed.\n\nThe paper acknowledged that reversal in a follow-up.\n\nIn response to its inclusion on the list, a spokesperson for the Post issued a blunt defense: 'The Washington Post is proud of its accurate, rigorous journalism.' \n\nThe White House has also compiled a wider roster of what it calls serial offenders - including The New York Times, Axios, Politico, ABC News, The Hill, and the Associated Press.\n\nFox News briefly appeared on the list as well, but its inclusion was later removed after the outlet objected to what it said was a misattribution of one of its reporters.\n\nThe new page also features a sign-up link for a weekly newsletter promising subscribers recurring updates on what the White House calls 'the truth.'\n\nThe new media tracker marks the latest escalation in Trump's years-long campaign against major news organizations.\n\nTrump is currently locked in legal battles with the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, has already reached high-profile settlements with ABC and CBS, and has repeatedly referred to mainstream outlets as 'the enemy of the people.'\n\nAccording to recent reporting, the president has also said he intends to sue the BBC for libel and has claimed potential damages ranging from $1 billion to $5 billion over an edited speech from 2021.\n\nTrump's personal attacks on individual journalists, particularly women, have intensified in recent weeks.\n\nOn November 14, he snapped 'Quiet, piggy' at a Bloomberg reporter aboard Air Force One after she questioned him about Jeffrey Epstein, a remark later defended by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nDays later, during another exchange, he labeled an ABC reporter 'a terrible person and a terrible reporter' and dismissed the network as 'fake news.'\n\nEarlier this week, he targeted a journalist from the Times in a Truth Social post, describing her as 'a third rate reporter who is ugly, both inside and out.'\n\nAnd just one day later, after being questioned about vetting Afghan refugees, Trump lashed out at a CBS News reporter calling her 'a stupid person'.\n\nFreedom of the Press Foundation Director of Advocacy Seth Stern warned that Trump's issue is not objectivity, but obedience. \n\n'People understand the obvious conflict inherent in a presidential administration appointing itself the arbiter of media bias,' Stern said. 'I expect that after the initial wave of publicity, few Americans will be paying attention to this latest stunt. The gimmick is wearing thin.","summary":"The White House has launched a new online 'media bias tracker' branding CBS News, The Independent and The Boston Globe as its first 'Offenders of the Week' over Trump coverage.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15338251/Trump-launches-media-bias-tracker-names-offenders.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/29/23/104303013-0-image-a-8_1764458394277.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/18/3738037986932179094/1024x576_MP4_3738037986932179094.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-30 00:40:20","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":383492964,"title":"Unveiling Nikki Haley’s Son: The Surprising Insights from His Mother","text":"On September 15, 2018, Nalin Haley, a teenager at the time, shared his inaugural Instagram photos.\n\nThe images captured a moment with him standing between then-President Donald Trump and his mother, just behind the scenes at the United Nations.\n\nIn the photos, Nalin is seen engaging in conversation with a cheerful President Trump, while his mother looks on with pride. She later expressed her approval by liking the images on social media.\n\nFast forward six years, and the relationship among the trio has shifted in unexpected ways.\n\nIn 2024, a dramatic fallout occurred between Trump and Nikki Haley when she decided to challenge him for the Republican nomination. This clash highlighted their differing visions—Trump’s America First approach and Haley’s globalist neoconservative stance.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Nalin showed unwavering support for his mother, accompanying her to various events and standing by her side.\n\nHowever, since Trump’s triumph he has broken family ranks, espousing his own views which tilt heavily toward, and even go beyond, those of Trump’s MAGA base.\n\nThe younger Haley set out his evolving political agenda – which includes ending legal immigration – in a bombshell interview with Tucker Carlson last week. \n\nHis America First, anti-globalist positions appeared to be born partly out of the financial desperation facing Gen Z.\n\nThe clarion call he issued hit its mark and he is now being declared the rising face of MAGA.\n\n‘Nalin Haley is going to quickly rise to become the face of the male Gen Z Right-Wing,’ the self-described American nationalist Evan Kilgore wrote on X, a post viewed nearly half a million times.\n\n‘He is extremely well spoken and has based views on immigration and foreign policy. This kid is going places.’\n\nIndeed, but what must his anti-Trump mother think? \n\nIf Nikki Haley has any secret concerns she is not showing them, and has expressed a fierce pride in her son.\n\nIn her only comment on the matter so far she said in an email to the Wall Street Journal that she and her husband, military officer Michael Haley, had instilled independence in Nalin and his older sister Rena.\n\n‘Our goal was to teach our children to have a deep faith, a strong work ethic and to think for themselves,’ she wrote. ‘We are proud of the strong, intelligent people Rena and Nalin have become.’\n\nHaley continues to like many of her son’s pictures on Instagram, although seemingly not ones where he is posing shirtless.\n\nThe generational diverging of family views is unusual, according to polls, which suggest the vast majority of young people follow their parents’ ideologies.\n\nA study carried out by the Pew Research Center in 2019 found 81 percent of teenagers with Republican parents, were Republican, and for Democrats the corresponding result was 89 percent.\n\nHowever, it is noticeable that for families in public life, the same rules often seem not to apply, with children of famous politicians often growing up and crossing the aisle.\n\nNalin is the latest in a long line of political scions who have branched out.\n\nIn recent years, the Democratic Kennedy clan condemned Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he joined Trump’s Cabinet as health secretary.\n\nRelatives variously called him a ‘loser,’ ‘underqualified’ and ‘addicted to attention and power.’\n\nAfter endorsing Trump, Kennedy responded: ‘My family is… I understand that they’re troubled by my decisions. I love my family.\n\n‘I feel like we were raised in a milieu where we were encouraged to debate each other and debate ferociously and passionately about things, and still love each other.’\n\nMeanwhile, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic Governor of California, and potential 2028 presidential candidate, recently revealed that his 13-year-old son followed Charlie Kirk, the late conservative influencer.\n\nNewsom said his son had been determined to be on set when the governor interviewed Kirk on his podcast in March, six months before Kirk’s murder. \n\nThe governor said he had refused his son’s requests and made him go to school.\n\nLast month, Stefany Shaheen, 51, who is running for Congress in New Hampshire, publicly disagreed with her own mother, Jeanne Shaheen, 78, a sitting US Senator from the state.\n\nWhen the elder Shaheen voted to end the government shutdown, her daughter said: ‘Clearly we had different approaches here. I can’t speak for her.’\n\nJeanne Shaheen said: ‘My daughter’s independent, she’s always been independent. That’s why she’s going to be a great congresswoman.’\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, his White House counselor Kellyanne Conway’s relationship with her daughter Claudia became a point of public fascination after the Gen-Z influencer exploded on to the political scene by criticizing the president.\n\nMother and daughter later publicly cleared the air and revealed they agree on far more than the naysayers would care to admit.\n\nAs he launched himself into public life, Nalin indicated a liking for JD Vance as a 2028 presidential candidate because he agreed with ‘many of his policy positions.’\n\nHowever, he suggested Vance should ‘work on his charisma, aura and likability.’ \n\nHe added to the Wall Street Journal that he supported his mother because she was ‘in it for the right reasons.’\n\nHaley studied political science and graduated from Villanova University, the Catholic institution in Pennsylvania where Pope Leo is also an alumnus.\n\nEarlier this year, having been brought up Protestant, he converted to Catholicism. Vance also famously converted to Catholicism.\n\nHaley did not respond to Daily Mail requests for comment. But the foundation of his platform appears to be the economic struggles of Gen Z and how to counteract them.\n\n‘My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,’ he told the UnHerd website. ‘It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job – not one.’\n\nIn the interview with Carlson, Nalin said he did not ‘feel represented by anybody.’\n\nHe went on to suggest an America First agenda that would include naturalized citizens not being allowed to hold public office.\n\nDual citizenship should be abolished, as should the ability for Americans to serve in foreign militaries, he said.\n\nHe said that legal migration should be stopped, along with H-1B visas, and foreign aid should end.\n\n‘Naturalized citizens should not be able to hold public office,’ he said. ‘Growing up here is a big part of understanding the country.\n\n‘We need to stop and limit the amount of foreign students who are coming to universities.\n\n‘Some of them are spies for foreign governments. But it is just that we should put our kids first.’\n\nIn a marked contrast to his mother’s aggressively pro-Israel stance, he argued that America should slash aid to the country.\n\n‘And if they want a better relationship with the United States, they need to stop interfering in our politics,’ he told Carlson.\n\n‘And it’s not just Israel. I mean, we need to ban foreign aid. We should not have a single dime going to another country when we have people in poverty with bad schools, medical debt, all that stuff. It makes no sense. That’s part of America first.’\n\nIn the days since, Haley has received a lot of applause from young MAGA conservatives, and a lot of vitriol, on social media.\n\nHis response was to post a meme on Instagram of an alligator slamming a basketball with the caption: ‘Whoever prayed on my downfall pray harder.’\n\nSo far, his mother appeared not to have ‘liked’ that one.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn September 15, 2018, Nalin Haley, a teenager at the time, shared&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling Nikki Haley&#8217;s Son: The Surprising Insights from His Mother first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/unveiling-nikki-haleys-son-the-surprising-insights-from-his-mother/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mystery-of-Nikki-Haleys-son-EXPOSED-Heres-what-his-mom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-30 00:39:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.663},{"id":383492960,"title":"Trump Calls for Closure of Venezuelan Airspace Amid Tensions: Maduro Decries ‘Colonial Threat","text":"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be regarded as entirely “closed,” a statement that intensified scrutiny of U.S. actions against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In response, Maduro’s administration accused Trump of issuing a “colonial threat” aimed at compromising the nation’s sovereignty.\n\nThe White House did not clarify Trump’s post on his Truth Social platform, leaving it ambiguous whether he was introducing a new directive or simply reiterating his stance against Maduro. This stance has included various operations in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, targeting small vessels suspected of drug trafficking and escalating naval presence in those waters. These operations have resulted in over 80 fatalities since early September.\n\nIn his address, Trump directed his call for an aerial blockade to “Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,” rather than directly confronting Maduro.\n\nVenezuelan authorities strongly dismissed Trump’s airspace closure claim, labeling it as a “colonial threat” aimed at violating Venezuela’s “territorial integrity, aeronautical security, and complete sovereignty.”\n\nThe Venezuelan Foreign Ministry described Trump’s remarks as a “hostile, unilateral, and arbitrary act.”\n\nAdditionally, the statement highlighted that U.S. immigration officials had independently halted biweekly deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants. Following dialogues between the two nations, over 13,000 Venezuelans have been sent back to Venezuela this year on numerous chartered flights, the latest of which landed in Caracas on Friday, as per flight-tracking information.\n\nInternational airlines last week began to cancel flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity.\n\nThe FAA’s jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories. The agency does routinely warn pilots about the dangers of flying over areas with ongoing conflicts or military activity around the globe, as it did earlier this month with Venezuela. The FAA works with other countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization on international issues. The FAA and ICAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.\n\nTrump’s administration has sought to ratchet up pressure on Maduro. The U.S. government does not view Maduro as the legitimate leader of the oil-rich but increasingly impoverished South American nation and he faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nU.S. forces have conducted bomber flights near Venezuela and the USS Gerald R. Ford, America’s most advanced aircraft carrier, was sent to the area. The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear” mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines.\n\nThere are bipartisan calls for greater oversight of the U.S. military strikes against vessels in the region after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of the Sept. 2 attack on suspected drug smugglers.\n\nRepublican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”\n\nTrump’s team has weighed both military and nonmilitary options with Venezuela, including covert action by the CIA. \n\nTrump has publicly floated the idea of talking to Maduro. The New York Times reported Friday that Trump and Maduro had spoken. The White House declined to answer questions about the conversation.\n\nMolina reported from Quito, Ecuador.

As our exclusive pictures reveal, Ms Valance is increasingly spending time with hard-Right thug Tommy Robinson.\n\nLast month, the mother-of-two joined Robinson on a luxury steam train trip, along with former actor and politician Laurence Fox and Mr Fox's wife Elizabeth, who has frequently appeared on a podcast that peddles conspiracy theories.\n\nA picture posted online by Mr Fox, the leader of the Reclaim Party, showed Ms Valance and Mrs Fox sprawled on a sofa in one of the train's carriages. A laughing Robinson lounged nearby. A caption written by Mr Fox read: 'It's a bit early for that…'\n\nA video on social media also showed the group enjoying breakfast as the train – named The Chairman's Set and owned by City financier and major Reclaim donor Jeremy Hosking – left London.\n\nWhile Ms Valance sipped a cup of tea, a grinning Mr Robinson said: 'Good morning everybody. How are we?'\n\nMs Valance also took a selfie on the trip, with Robinson and the Foxes posing in the background.\n\nFriends of Ms Valance last night told The Mail on Sunday that they are concerned that she and Robinson have grown close. They are said to be particularly troubled at the prospect of her two daughters, aged 12 and eight, spending any time in Robinson's orbit.\n\nRobinson, 43, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has convictions for assault, mortgage fraud, using a false passport and multiple counts of contempt of court.\n\n'There is concern about Holly and her two girls,' one friend of the former singer said. 'Plenty of her friends are worried. The question is whether they [Ms Valance and Robinson] are romantically involved. Even if they are not having a romantic relationship, there is the fact that he has all of these convictions against him.'\n\nMs Valance, an Australian-British star who played Felicity 'Flick' Scully in Neighbours, was first pictured with Robinson in September during his 'Unite the Kingdom' rally in London.\n\nShe was pictured wearing a 'MEGA' (Make England Great Again) hat and later praised the march, adding: 'I'm very proud and pleased for Tommy – this is his redemption. Finally. How the man screaming from the rooftops about the rape of white British girls was framed as 'the bad guy' is going to be a case study.\n\n'How weak and immoral we have become. Our silence is immoral. [At the march] the lions came out.'\n\nFor years Ms Valance, whose £3 million wedding to Mr Candy in September 2012 in California featured a performance by Katy Perry, did not talk publicly about her political views.\n\nBut friends claim she has recently 'gone down a [political] rabbit hole'.\n\n'She has gone too far down it,' one source said. 'It was the Covid stuff and the Republican stuff in America – the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement. It was a range of stuff. She is quite conspiracy theory-led.'\n\nMr Fox, who first rose to fame with his role in ITV drama Lewis, has since rebranded himself as a Right-wing commentator and politician who has run three unsuccessful election campaigns.\n\nHis wife Elizabeth described herself on Instagram as a model, body double and stuntwoman who was born in America but now lives in the UK. She has made many appearances on Elite Thinking Club, a podcast that touts itself as a 'show dedicated to critical thinking' but airs conspiracy theories including the idea that Princess Diana was murdered on the orders of the Queen.\n\nAsked in an episode on the theory of evolution whether humans are descended from apes, she replied: 'I think that's what we're made to believe and that is what we should be believing but… I think we come from another race.'\n\nResponding to claims that she is a conspiracy theorist in June, she wrote on X: 'Holding my own views is not a flaw, it's a right. Not everyone thinks the same, nor are we meant to.'\n\nRobinson was once a member of the far-Right British National Party (BNP) and co-founded the English Defence League (EDL). \n\nIn 2018, Sir Mark Rowley, who is now the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said Robinson had contributed to the radicalisation of Darren Osborne, who killed one man and injured several others near a mosque in Finsbury Park.\n\nMs Valance was contacted for comment.","summary":"A picture posted online by Laurence Fox, the leader of the Reclaim Party, showed Ms Valance and Mrs Fox sprawled on a sofa in one of the train's carriages next to Tommy Robinson","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15338293/Neighbours-Holly-Valance-Tommy-Robinson.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/29/21/104301487-0-image-m-145_1764451612820.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-30 00:27:18","author":"Daily,Editor","authors":["Daily","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.467},{"id":383491230,"title":"Wall Street Predicts Rebound in Indian Markets After Tough Year","text":"(Bloomberg) -- After one of India’s worst years of market underperformance in decades, some of Wall Street’s biggest names are calling for a rebound.Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among those who expect the country’s markets to claw back lost ground next year as earnings stabilize and policy support kicks in.India’s markets have trailed across assets. Stocks have lagged peers by the widest margin in more than three decades. The rupee is Asia’s worst performer. Bonds remain under pressure from heavy government debt supply. US tariffs — the harshest in the region — have hit exporters’ earnings and slowed dollar inflows, amplifying the strain.Even so, early signs of a turn are emerging. Growth-supportive measures, combined with a pause in the long stretch of earnings downgrades are improving sentiment. Investors are also positioning for a possible rotation out of the artificial intelligence trade, a move that could redirect foreign flows toward markets like India.“A rebound appears increasingly likely in 2026,” said Angela Lan, senior strategist at State Street Investment Management, which has a neutral to slight overweight stance on India in its emerging market funds. “The earnings downgrade cycle is largely behind us, with recent policy measures — rate cuts and GST rationalization — filtering through consumption and credit.”MSCI Inc’s India gauge is up 8.2% this year, trailing the broader EM benchmark by the widest gap since 1993. If some of those AI gains start to look frothy, flows could shift back toward less tech-dependent markets like India, helping narrow the gap. “The conversation around India remains as a potential refuge for money rotated out of North Asia,” Alexander Redman, chief global equity strategist at CLSA Ltd. said in an interview. The AI-trade will likely unwind in the first half of next year, which could make the South Asian market more attractive to investors, he added.The rupee, which hit a record low in November and is down 4.3% this year, may be approaching a near-term floor. ING Bank NV views it as the regional currency with the most rebound potential. PineBridge Investments portfolio manager Anders Faergemann said local bonds and the currency stand to benefit from a steadier global backdrop and high carry. That assessment broadly aligns with remarks from Reserve Bank of India Governor Sanjay Malhotra, who said recently that the rupee typically weakens about 3%–3.5% a year — a range that some investors view as a rough guide for when losses might start to level off.Despite the shocks of 2025, India’s economy has held up better than expected. Gross domestic product expanded 8.2% in the September quarter from a year earlier, official data showed Friday. Still, the International Monetary Fund has cut its projection for the nation’s growth next financial year to 6.2% from its earlier forecast of 6.4% due to US tariffs. Corporate earnings also show tentative signs of recovery. Profits for the top 100 firms rose 12% in the September quarter, slightly above expectations and the first in many quarters without an estimate cut, Citi analysts said. The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index briefly hit a record on Nov. 20, surpassing its September 2024 peak.Still, it’s been a sharp reversal for a market once seen as the standout. While peers roared back in 2025, India faltered as the economy slowed and President Donald Trump’s tariffs crushed the rupee and cooled a multi-year equity rally. Headwinds beyond tariffs persist: a stronger dollar and prolonged trade tensions may sap momentum. Data released this month showed India’s total exports plunged almost 12% in October from a year earlier, pushing the trade deficit to a record high. Meanwhile, the recovery in domestic demand, and stock valuations, though off their extremes, are still rich. The Nifty 50 trades above 20 times forward earnings — well above its long-term average. Record local inflows of $80 billion this year have kept the market cushioned, even as foreign selling and a rush of initial public offerings soaked up much of that money.That mix may keep the market in a tight range, according to Gautam Chhaochharia, head of global markets India at UBS Group AG. “Indian equity markets are boxed in a triangle” he said. “This may continue for a while.” RBI SupportThe Reserve Bank of India has done much of the heavy lifting this year — cutting policy rates by 100 basis points, defending the rupee, and buying record amounts of government debt to ease liquidity pressures.Yet sovereign bonds have lagged. They’ve returned just 2.1% versus a 8% gain for the broader EM debt, weighed down by a weaker rupee and expectations that the rate-cut cycle may be nearing an end. With RBI’s Malhotra hinting at another rate cut on Dec 5, traders are looking for the central bank to revive large-scale bond purchases. Yields could drop about 25 basis points from current levels if the authority were to buy 3 trillion rupees ($33.5 billion) of securities, according to Sandeep Yadav, head of fixed income at DSP Asset Managers Pvt.That support and steadier local data is helping restore some investor calm.Global funds are tiptoeing back after pulling more than $16 billion from equities earlier this year. The past two months have brought inflows of $1.7 billion, and with EM investors still heavily underweight, some see scope for a larger reversal if conditions improve further.“With better prospects for Indian equities in 2026, we believe there is a fair chance of a reversal of the outflows,” said Prashant Kothari, senior investment manager at Pictet Asset Management. “Tariff impact is manageable — and hopefully temporary.”--With assistance from Anup Roy.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/wall-street-predicts-rebound-in-indian-markets-after-tough-year-11764462397131.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/30/1600x900/logo/Market_-_stocks_1545996587096_1764462399986.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-30 00:26:36","author":"List.metadata.agency","authors":["List.metadata.agency"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.049},{"id":383496630,"title":"Ruang udara Venezuela perlu dianggap ditutup sepenuhnya - Trump","text":"WASHINGTON: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump semalam berkata, ruang udara di atas dan sekitar Venezuela perlu dianggap ditutup sepenuhnya, lapor Xinhua.\n\n\"Kepada semua syarikat penerbangan, juruterbang, pengedar dadah dan penyeludup manusia, sila anggap RUANG UDARA DI ATAS DAN SEKITAR VENEZUELA TELAH DITUTUP SEPENUHNYA,\" tulis Trump dalam satu hantaran di Truth Social tanpa memberikan butiran lanjut.\n\nKenyataan itu dibuat ketika ketegangan dalam hubungan antara AS dan Venezuela semakin meningkat.\n\nSejak awal September, Pentagon telah melancarkan lebih 20 serangan ke atas bot yang didakwa terlibat dalam penyeludupan dadah di Caribbean dan Pasifik Timur, mengorbankan lebih 80 orang. \n\nKehadiran ketenteraan AS di Caribbean turut dipertingkatkan pada pertengahan November dengan pengerahan kapal pengangkut pesawat utama, USS Gerald R.

For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.\n\nE-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme. Since early last year, Unicef says it has been able to make cash transfers to about a million people - half of them children. It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\n\n\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"\n\nMr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.\n\nHanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef.

Miller (@redsteeze) November 29, 2025\n\nEd: Indeed they did ... more than a few days late and tens of millions of dollars late. And even then, the Gray Lady reveals what the paper sees as the real problem at the end of the sixth paragraph.\n\nNY Times: Over the last five years, law enforcement officials say, fraud took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora as scores of individuals made small fortunes by setting up companies that billed state agencies for millions of dollars’ worth of social services that were never provided.\n\nFederal prosecutors say that 59 people have been convicted in those schemes so far, and that more than $1 billion in taxpayers’ money has been stolen in three plots they are investigating. That is more than Minnesota spends annually to run its Department of Corrections. Minnesota’s fraud scandal stood out even in the context of rampant theft during the pandemic, when Americans stole tens of billions through unemployment benefits, business loans and other forms of aid, according to federal auditors.\n\nOutrage has swelled among Minnesotans, and fraud has turned into a potent political issue in a competitive campaign season. Gov. Tim Walz and fellow Democrats are being asked to explain how so much money was stolen on their watch, providing Republicans, who hope to take back the governor’s office in 2026, with a powerful line of attack.\n\nEd: I'll give the NYT this much credit: it took them six whole paragraphs before they got to the \"Republicans pounce!™\" narrative. It takes a few more paragraphs before the Times gets to the real issue. “We’re losing our way of life in Minnesota in a very real way,\" warns the federal prosecutor who is unwinding the massive fraud and incompetence that enabled it. I'd argue that was pretty [expletive] obvious from the moment the Walz administration replaced the state flag with one modeled on the Somalian flag. \n\nAre you kidding me, @nytimes? pic.twitter.com/TCQpFCicPA— Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) November 29, 2025\n\nEd: Well, the truth-telling era at the NYT didn't last long, eh? Back to our normally programmed Progressive-Elite Narratives!\n\nPower Line: They first drew President Trump’s attention in a big way. Now comes the New York Times in Ernest Londoño’s long story “How Fraud Swamped Minnesota’s Social Services System on Tim Walz’s Watch” (“Prosecutors say members of the Somali diaspora, a group with growing political power, were largely responsible. President Trump has drawn national attention to the scandal amid his crackdown on immigration”). The story has clearly been in the works for a while, but Trump’s attention has intensified its newsworthiness.\n\nI don’t think any of this will come as news to Power Line readers. ...\n\nJOHN adds: I confess to a certain bemusement over the Minnesota fraud scandal suddenly becoming national news. It’s not as though it has ever been a secret. We have written about the multiple fraud scandals many times here at Power Line. Bill Glahn has been driving coverage of the Feeding Our Future story for years at AmericanExperiment.org. Long ago, Bill created a Scandal Tracker that includes but is not limited to Feeding Our Future. Using conservative estimates ($300 million for FoF), it now stands at over $661 million, all during the Tim Walz administration. And over the last two years, Bill and I have done four webinars on the Feeding Our Future scandal. \n\nEd: We've covered it at Hot Air as developments emerged, but those developments largely emerged because of the hard work by Bill, John, and Scott at Power Line. Read it all and make sure to follow all of the links. \n\nEd: Trump clearly wants Maduro out, and is now increasing financial and strategic pressure to push Maduro into fleeing Venezuela. Both Maduro and Trump suggested that talks could take place, but it doesn't sound like Trump is in much of a chatty mood. Whether Trump can make this stick is another question, but just the announcement will likely convince most commercial airlines to avoid Venezuelan airspace. And that will make drug flights a lot easier to track, too. \n\nWSJ: President Trump said Friday he was revoking all executive orders former President Joe Biden signed with an autopen, escalating his battle with his predecessor over the use of the signature proxy device.\n\nFIFY Ames. pic.twitter.com/Ah3xOdpMTT— Matt Whitlock (@mattdizwhitlock) November 26, 2025\n\nEd: This is a couple of days old, but still worth highlighting. Apparently, Democrats are too stupid to understand their own graphs. \n\nJonathan Turley: In academia, one of the greatest concerns with statistical studies is the danger of “confirmation bias” or “myside bias.” A desire to prove a point can lead to a blindness to opposing data or information. This week, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) repeatedly demonstrated the scourge of statistical studies with spectacular and embarrassing success.\n\nKlobuchar released a chart before Thanksgiving to blame President Donald Trump for rising consumer costs. The only problem is that the chart showed that the skyrocketing costs occurred under former President Joe Biden. Klobuchar focused on the short period on the chart representing Trump’s second presidency, while ignoring the soaring costs under his predecessor.\n\nWhat is most notable is that just the week before, Klobuchar committed the same error, associating rising energy costs with Trump, who saw energy costs soar under Biden.\n\nEd: She did it TWICE. In the same week. Absolutely insane, idiotic, or both. \n\nI agree with other conservative legal commentators that the video by Dem. Lawmakers is not an act of \"sedition\" as that term has been used at common law, or as it is used in the \"seditious conspiracy\" statute -- 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2384. As someone who has defended against that…— Shipwreckedcrew (@shipwreckedcrew) November 29, 2025\n\nAs someone who has defended against that charge, and litigated it's meaning, it requires the use or planned use of force.But, Section 2387 does not require the use of force. It is in the same sequence of statutes, it applies in peacetime -- passed in 1948 -- and it has never been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Just the opposite in fact.\n\nEd: Read this all the way through. I hope Ship extends these thoughts on his Substack at some point. He's not sure that the DoJ would get a conviction on this basis, but he's pretty clear that they can try – and that the Supreme Court has precedent supporting it. \n\nAssociated Press: Northwestern University has agreed to pay $75 million to the U.S. government in a deal with the Trump administration to end a series of investigations and restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration had cut off $790 million in grants in a standoff that contributed to university layoffs and the resignation in September of Northwestern president Michael Schill. The administration argued the school had not done enough to fight antisemitism.\n\nUnder the agreement announced Friday night, Northwestern will make the payment to the U.S. Treasury over the next three years. Among other commitments it also requires the university to revoke the so-called Deering Meadow agreement, which it signed in April 2024 in exchange for pro-Palestinian protesters ending their tent encampment on campus.\n\nEd: They got off cheaply. One key agreement: NU will have to abide by the Trump administration's interpretation of Title IX. No more males in the women's locker rooms, bathrooms, or sports teams. \n\n“Terminate the 2024 Deering Meadow agreement.” Good. What a disaster the previous, ousted NU regime was. https://t.co/1iJTADgZ79— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) November 29, 2025\n\nBret Weinstein just said something that won’t leave my head:For the first time in 300,000 years of human evolution, we removed the cost from the single biggest reward nature ever invented — sex and pair-bonding.Reliable birth control + abortion = you can now cash the… pic.twitter.com/sS729STZdK— Camus (@newstart_2024) November 27, 2025\n\nReliable birth control + abortion = you can now cash the evolutionary lottery ticket without paying the 20-year mortgage of pregnancy, diapers, sleepless nights, and college funds.\n\nResult? An entire generation of 18–35-year-olds walking around with the energy, libido, hormones, and protective instincts that evolution spent millions of years calibrating for child-rearing… but with zero actual children. That energy didn’t disappear. It got redirected.\n\nHeather Heying’s observation is brutal: young women especially began treating ideologies the exact way evolution wired them to treat babies. Climate change, social justice, whatever the cause of the month is — it gets defended with literal mama-bear ferocity, the same neurochemistry that once guarded a toddler from predators now guards an abstract idea from wrong think.\n\nAnd now Elon is promising the second shoe is about to drop ...\n\nEd: This is almost as depressing as reading the real Camus. (I got traumatized by it in high school.) Click through and read it all. I'm not sure I buy all of the pessimism in the prediction for the future, but Weinstein certainly nailed the present well enough. \n\nEd: Maybe these two guys were onto something here ... \n\nMy favorite genre of liberal punditry is “Every one of my friends is an unnamed Trump voter and boy are they mad!” https://t.co/mEofBM5vR4— Scott Jennings (@ScottJenningsKY) November 29, 2025\n\nEd: My favorite is the \"Republicans Pounce!™\" genre, and it is bountiful indeed.

And yet as the nation travels for Thanksgiving this week, Americans generally prefer blue states to red ones.\n\nOn average, 55% of Americans have a favorable view of blue states, while 24% have an unfavorable view, according to a Daily Kos analysis of YouGov data. That makes for a net favorability of +31 percentage points. \n\nBut red states have a net favorability of just +24 points. On average, less than half of Americans have a favorable view of red states (48%), and 24% have an unfavorable view.\n\nAmericans also have a sunnier view of swing states, which have an average net favorability of +30 points—basically the same as blue states. Fifty-three percent of Americans have a favorable view of them on average, and 23% have an unfavorable view.\n\nDaily Kos determined the partisanship of a state by averaging the results of its past three presidential elections (2016, 2020, and 2024) and its most recent Senate race and gubernatorial race. States that a party won by 15 percentage points or more on average are considered “blue” or “red” states. States won by smaller margins on average are considered “swing” states.\n\nThe most polarizing states are also the nation’s most populous: Texas, New York, Florida, and California. The Golden State is far and away the most polarizing, with 26% having a very favorable view of it and 25% having a very unfavorable view.\n\nNotably, Texas and Florida, despite their reputations, are not solidly red. In fact, neither is considered a “red state” according to the methodology outlined above. Across the past three presidential elections, as well as the state’s most recent Senate race and governor’s race, the Republican candidate won, on average, by only 10.0 points in Florida and 9.5 points in Texas.\n\nCompare that with California and New York, where the Democratic candidate won, on average, by 23.1 points and 16.6 points, respectively.\n\nMississippi, a red state, is among the more polarizing states as well, but it shares the dubious honor of having the lowest net approval rating of any state, at just +2 points. Thirty-seven percent have a favorable view of the state, while 35% have a negative view.\n\nDemocrats’ favorite red state is Alaska (R+15.3), home of grizzly bears and moose, with all its panoramic natural beauty. Sixty-five percent have a very or somewhat favorable view of the Last Frontier.\n\nAnd Republicans’ favorite blue state is Hawaii (D+28.8), because obviously. Fifty-five percent have a very or somewhat favorable view of the Aloha State.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Washington, D.C., is excluded from the data above. It has arguably the worst favorability of any location YouGov included in this survey (+1 net favorability), but it was excluded from Daily Kos’ “blue state” group because, for one thing, it’s tainted by the stink of the swamp. Only 15% of Americans approve of Congress, according to Gallup—and that’s a burden that no other state shares.\n\nAnd for another thing, it’s not a state.

But it wasn’t just Democrats who were mischief-plotters and tabloid fodder. Republicans had plenty of their own drama.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: Sudden Exit Stage Left\n\nThat peach of a Georgia representative, Marjorie Taylor Greene stunned the political world Friday night by announcing she was quitting Congress, effective Jan. 5, 2026. Her decision came days after President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of the controversial congresswoman in the wake of a series of erratic moves challenging the president, including over the Epstein files. Greene’s also recently been sucking up to hostile media, including the ladies of “The View.”\n\nIn her resignation letter Greene compared herself to a “battered wife” and complained that she felt unwelcomed in Washington and disliked by both sides of the political aisle. As President Harry Truman famously said, “If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.” In the case of the Georgia representative, I suppose it would be “dawg.”\n\nAdding to the campy flavor of it all: Trump responded to the news by saying Greene “went bad” and her resignation was “good for the country.” He then spent the weekend insisting Greene is a “nice person.” \n\nNow the question remains: Does Greene become a John Bolton who turns and makes a mint as an anti-Trump commentator? (Which will now mostly go to lawyers.) Or is she an Elon Musk: an emotional, colorful, controversial figure who soon enough finds herself back in the Trump camp?\n\nIn the biz, they call this a cliffhanger. \n\nRep. Cory Mills: Ethically Challenged\n\nRep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., is facing an investigation by the House Ethics Committee. Why? Apparently to avoid a censure vote, The Daily Signal’s Jacob Adams reported. Rep. Kat Cammack, also of Florida, colorfully complained House leadership tabled a censure vote on Del. Stacey Plaskett to protect Mills from a censure vote. “This backroom deal s— is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out.”According to a statement from the Ethics Committee, their investigation into Mills will look into:\n\n“allegations that [Mills] may have: (1) failed to properly disclose required information on statements required to be filed with the House; (2) violated campaign finance laws and regulations in connection with his 2022 and 2024 election campaigns; (3) improperly solicited and/or received gifts, including in connection with privately sponsored officially-connected travel; (4) received special favors by virtue of his position; (5) engaged in misconduct with respect to allegations of sexual misconduct and/or dating violence; and/or (6) misused congressional resources or status.” \n\nWait. “Sexual misconduct and/or dating violence”? How’s that get ranked #5? Jimmy Hoffa wasn’t buried like that little tidbit.\n\nMills denies any wrongdoing.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw: What Happened in Mexico Didn’t Stay in Mexico\n\nAlso denying wrongdoing: Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw. Crenshaw is denying a report by Punchbowl News that House Republicans revoked his traveling privileges for three-months after an “alcohol-related incident” during an official trip to Mexico. No, he did not trash a hotel room or run naked through the streets. Or even butcher “Yellow Rose of Texas” at a Tijuana karaoke bar. Crenshaw says the incident was “literally me doing a toast with the Mexican generals.” According to the story, a Mexican official made a “crude joke” that made a woman present uncomfortable. Crenshaw then toasted the comment.\n\nCrenshaw insists he wasn’t banned from travel, saying a planned trip was nixed by the government shutdown.\n\nWhy We Can’t Mock\n\nFrom booze to bye-byes, criminal busts to buddying up with Jeffrey Epstein, it was a week for the books on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt’s tempting to mock, but millions of us are about to head off to see family for Thanksgiving. Though it is a good bet our families won’t be stealing $5 million bucks or texting pedophiles, can we honestly say we won’t have our own dramas, downfalls, and delicious gossip? Overindulgence? A family mutiny? Battles over relationships with the wrong people? I didn’t think so.\n\nMay your Thanksgiving be as blessed as Nancy Pelosi’s bank account.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

No clashes with Syrian government forces were reported, and the purpose of the deployment was unclear.\n\nThe observatory described the activity as part of \"recurring Israeli operations\" in southern Syria, including monitoring, reconnaissance, and the positioning of armored vehicles near the border.\n\nSeparately, Syria TV reported that several families began leaving Beit Jinn after hearing Israeli vehicles and spotting helicopters overhead, raising fears of a possible incursion.\n\nThere is no immediate response from the Israeli side.\n\nUN chief reiterates call for irreversible progress toward two-state solution\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday reiterated his call for irreversible progress toward a two-state solution, in a message on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.\n\nThis year's International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which is observed annually on Nov. 29, comes after two years of horrific suffering in Gaza, and the start of a much-needed ceasefire, Guterres said.\n\nNoting that survivors are mourning the deaths of tens of thousands of friends and family; hunger, disease and trauma run rampant; injustice also continues in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem; and hundreds of humanitarians have been killed, the UN chief said: \"In so many ways, this tragedy has tested the norms and laws that have guided the international community for generations.\"\n\nChina's top financial regulator pledges strengthened support for Hong Kong fire relief efforts\n\nChina's top financial regulator on Saturday pledged to guide the banking and insurance sectors to fast-track financial services and support to aid relief efforts following a residential building fire in Hong Kong.\n\nIn a notice on its website, the National Financial Regulatory Administration called on relevant insurance institutions to thoroughly conduct business assessments and utilize proactive services so that claim settlements for the affected clients can be handled in a timely manner.\n\nChinese-funded banks in Hong Kong should intensify financial services to assist the affected clients in overcoming difficulties, the administration said.\n\nTrump to roll back most Biden executive orders due to autopen use\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Friday he will roll back the majority of executive orders \"not directly signed\" by former U.S. President Joe Biden, escalating his dispute over the use of autopens.\n\nWithout providing evidence, Trump wrote Friday on social media that 92 percent of these orders were signed with a so-called autopen, a mechanical signature aid. It remained unclear which documents are involved.\n\nTrump noted he will cancel \"all executive orders\" and \"anything else not directly signed\" by Biden, adding that the people who \"operated the autopen did so illegally.\" He further claimed that Biden \"was not involved in the autopen process\" and warned that if Biden said otherwise, he would face perjury charges.","url":"https://www.haitinews.net/news/278730365/daily-world-briefing-nov-30","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/2a1f064/33eed698-b74c-405a-bdb0-3f430f9047e3/0/XxjidwE000001-20251130-CBMFN0A001-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-30 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ht","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":383489946,"title":"Trump stands firm on freezing migration amid appeals to allow asylum","text":"Washington, DC [US], November 30 (ANI): Even as multiple United Nations (UN) agencies, including its human rights office, appeal to the US administration to continue allowing asylum seekers into the country, President Donald Trump remains adamant about his stand of 'permanently pausing migration from all third-world countries'.\n\nPosting on Truth Social, Trump cited section 212 (f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to justify his actions of barring migration. Section 212 (f) of INA authorises the US president to 'suspend entry' of 'any applicants or any class of applicants'.\n\nIt also allows the President to 'impose on the entry of applicants any restrictions he/she may deem appropriate' for such period as he/she deems necessary upon determining that their entry 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States'.\n\n'Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,' Trump quoted the section 212 (f) of INA. \n\nThe official handle of White House also posted the same on X. \n\nThe Trump administration on Friday intensified immigration restrictions, rolling out a series of heightened security measures following a State Department directive that temporarily halts visa issuance for all travellers holding Afghan passports.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the decision in a post on the social media platform X, stating, 'President Trump's State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals travelling on Afghan passports.'\n\nHe added, 'The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.'\n\nOfficials described the decision as part of a broader response to Wednesday's shooting near the White House that left two National Guard soldiers critically injured.\n\nUS Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow confirmed that asylum officers have been directed to stop issuing decisions until enhanced vetting can be completed for every applicant.\n\n'This pause will stay in place until we can ensure that every alien is properly vetted. The safety of the American people always comes first,' he said in a statement posted on X.\n\nAfter the Wednesday shooting near White House that killed one of the two National Guard members in Washington, DC. One of them (Spec. Sarah Beckstrom) has died, while the other remains wounded.\n\nLakanwal, the Afghan national, accused of carrying out the shooting, will be charged with first-degree murder, the Washington Post reported earlier. Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington, DC, said that more counts are likely to follow against suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the upgraded charges of first-degree murder, instead of the initial charges of assault, raise the possibility for the suspected attacker to face the death penalty in the case.\n\nAlthough capital punishment has been abolished in the District of Columbia, Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday said she will seek the death penalty against the man accused of shooting two West Virginia National Guard members in Washington, the Hill reported.\n\nIn August, US president Donald Trump had asserted that his government would seek capital punishment in every murder case that occurred in Washington, DC.\n\nTrump on Friday said that he would permanently pause migration from all 'third-world countries' to allow the US system to terminate illegal admissions into the United States.
