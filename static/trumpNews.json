DOGE’s access to Treasury records, as well as its inspection of various government agencies, has ignited widespread concern among critics over the increasing power of Musk, while supporters have cheered at the idea of reining in bloated government finances.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office filed the lawsuit, said DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s data raises security problems and the possibility for an illegal freeze in federal funds.\n\n“This unelected group, led by the world’s richest man, is not authorized to have this information, and they explicitly sought this unauthorized access to illegally block payments that millions of Americans rely on, payments for health care, child care and other essential programs,” James said in a video message released by her office.\n\nJames, a Democrat who has been one of Trump’s chief antagonists, said the president does not have the power to give away American’s private information to anyone he chooses, and he cannot cut federal payments approved by Congress.\n\nAlso on the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe suit alleges that DOGE’s access to the Treasury records could interfere with funding already appropriated by Congress, which would exceed the Treasury Department’s statutory authority. The case also argues that the DOGE access violates federal administrative law and the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.\n\nIt also accuses Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of changing the department’s longstanding policy for protecting sensitive personally identifiable information and financial information to allow Musk’s DOGE team access to its payment systems.\n\n“This decision failed to account for legal obligations to protect such data and ignored the privacy expectations of federal fund recipients,” including states, veterans, retirees, and taxpayers, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe Treasury Department has said the review is about assessing the integrity of the system and that no changes are being made. According to two people familiar with the process, Musk’s team began its inquiry looking for ways to suspend payments made by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and Musk are attempting to dismantle. The two people spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nSeparately, Democratic lawmakers are seeking a Treasury Department investigation of DOGE’s access to the government’s payment system.\n\nAlso, labor unions and advocacy groups have sued to block the payments system review over concerns about its legality. A judge in Washington on Thursday temporarily restricted access to two employees with “read only” privileges.\n\nAssociated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.","summary":"DOGE's access to Treasury records has ignited widespread concern.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/07/treasury-doge-states-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25034666572542.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 01:02:42","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":288249076,"title":"Modi-Trump Talks To Focus On Trade And Security","text":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to the United States from February 12 to 13 for his first meeting with President Donald Trump during the latter's second presidential term. Trade, investment, and security cooperation are expected to top the agenda. The visit comes amid calls from Trump for India to purchase more US-made military hardware and shift towards a fairer trading relationship.\nKey Focus Areas\nThe visit is also significant against the backdrop of the deportation of 104 illegal Indian immigrants from the US, which has sparked discussions in India. The Indian government sees this visit as an opportunity to engage the new US administration on several critical matters, including defence and security cooperation.\nBefore arriving in Washington, Modi will visit France from February 10 to 12 to co-chair the AI Action Summit with President Emmanuel Macron. Upon his arrival in the US, he is expected to stay at Blair House, the US President’s official guest house. Meetings with key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, have been confirmed. Efforts are underway to arrange a meeting with Elon Musk.\nSymbolic Importance\nForeign Secretary Vikram Misri emphasized the importance of this visit, noting that it underscores the bipartisan support for the India-US partnership. Modi will be among the first world leaders to visit Washington after Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025.\n“This shows the importance of the India-US partnership and reflects the bipartisan support this relationship enjoys in the US,” said Misri.\nTrade and Investment Talks\nMisri indicated that \"intense discussions\" on trade and investment are expected during the visit, along with defence and security cooperation. Modi will participate in bilateral talks with Trump in both restricted and delegation-level formats. Business leaders and members of the Indian community will also have the opportunity to engage with Modi.\nDuring Trump’s first term, Modi visited the US in 2017 and 2019, fostering close ties between the two leaders. Modi was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his reelection in 2024.\n“There has been a close rapport between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi dating back to Trump's first term,” Misri noted, highlighting converging interests in trade, investment, technology, and counterterrorism.\nBilateral Challenges\nThe visit, however, comes amid unease over the deportation of 104 Indians from the US. Reports suggest many deportees were shackled during the 40-hour flight, prompting concerns back home.\nOn Trump's controversial comments regarding using the US military to take over the Gaza Strip and develop it as the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" Misri reiterated India’s consistent position on the matter, emphasizing the need for a two-state solution and humanitarian aid for Palestinians.\nThe visit is expected to give \"further direction and impetus to this very important partnership,\" Misri concluded. A joint statement is anticipated at the end of the visit.\nRead More : India Protests Use Of Shackles As US Plans Deportation Of 600 More Migrants","summary":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to the United States from February 12 to 13 for his first meeting with President Donald Trump during the latter&#8217;s second presidential term.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/india/modi-trump-talks-to-focus-on-trade-and-security/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PM-Modi-Donald-Trump.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:47:54","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.33},{"id":288249732,"title":"Trump fires Kennedy Center board members citing drag shows, appoints himself chairman","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Friday he decided to immediately fire multiple Kennedy Center board members, including the chairman, and fill that role himself.

What is the Mexican-American status quo now? It’s very disturbing. \n\nI’ll just give you an example of what I mean: We sent deported criminals back to Mexico and they forbid—we were going to, and they would not allow them to land in Mexico. We had people of the cartel shoot an American citizen on U.S. land and shoot at our Border Patrol. So, what is Mexico? Is it neutral? Is it an ally? Is it an enemy? Is it a frenemy?\n\nHere’s some data. Right now, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $150 billion. Remember Ross Perot? I was about in my 40s, early 40s, in 1992-96, third-party candidate. He said, “You’re going to hear a big sucking sound.” What he meant was your jobs are going to go to Mexico. They’re going to run up surpluses.\n\nWe’re going to get hurt. I thought that was, kind of, a little bit dramatic. That’s exactly what happened. When he warned that, as soon as NAFTA went in, they had a $2 [billion] to $3 billion and then $10 [billion] and then $40 [billion] and then $60 [billion]. The deficit with Mexico will be about $168 billion per year now. It was in 2024, it’ll be bigger. $167 billion. They—that does not include, that does not include the $63 billion that Mexican expatriates—the vast majority here illegally—send back to Mexico. \n\nAnd it’s worse than that. How does somebody who’s impoverished, from some of the poorest areas of Mexico, free up $400 or $500, $600 of their income to send back to the Mexican government—I don’t say Mexican government directly, but relieving the Mexican government or their responsibilities to have a social network for their own family, for people’s family. And the answer is they’re on subsidies, local, state, federal, housing, education, food, healthcare, provided by the American taxpayer.\n\nAnd, a third thing that’s very worrisome—we should all be worrisome—on average, 75,000 Americans die of fentanyl overdoses per year. And it’s been going on for several years, at least a decade. But here’s the problem, it’s not as [former president of Mexico] Mr. [Andres] Obrador says, “Our fault”; partly an addict, he has to take responsibility. \n\nBut the cartels take raw products to make fentanyl, shipped in deliberately by China who wants us to suffer, and then repackages it in special cartel industries and then disguises it for export into the United States. Sometimes by lacing it into fake pharmaceuticals that are prescription drugs and, sometimes putting it into opiates, so that the user may get a high but won’t be killed, but may be killed because they’re inexact or they’re deliberate, who knows?\n\nAnd if you total that up over a decade, that’s 750,000 deaths. That’s more than all of the wars of the 20th century and the 21st century—World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, First Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan—all the people who died by our enemies. The Mexican government or the cartels—and I say Mexican government by enabling the cartels—have killed Americans.\n\nIt’s worse than that. In addition to that, the Mexican government votes against the United States on almost every major referendum at the United Nations, especially anything to deal with the Middle East. So, this is my point. They are deliberately exporting their poor, and now we had 12 million people come in. And their way of thinking, this is wonderful.\n\nWe have a safety valve. So, if we have internal dissension because we’ve exploited indigenous people, we send them to the United States. Number two, they send back $63 billion. It’s our second largest source of foreign exchange—more than tourism and oil—right next to the trade surplus we get with the United States.\n\nAnd then the cartels, we don’t know how much they make, but that money is fungible. So, between this trade surplus of $167 billion, plus the $63 billion and remittances, plus whatever the cartels make—$20 [billion]-$30 billion from their opiate sales in the United States—we’re getting over $200 billion off of this asymmetrical relationship. And we pay the United States back by saying, if you dare deport people who have committed a felony or a crime, we’re going to block your arrival. \n\nSo, I don’t know what Mexico is, but I know what we can do about it. Twenty percent tax on anybody who sends, anywhere in the United States, money back to Mexico. That would raise about $12 billion dollars. That would send a message. And then we have a tariff. Donald Trump says he’s going to do it very quickly and that would tell Mexico, you’re not going to run up a $167 billion under the guise of the North American Free Trade [Agreement]. Not going to happen. And then we’re going to tell them, if you don’t deal with the cartels we will. And I think Mexico will come to attention.\n\nAnd we will not have Ms. [Claudia] Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, saying what Mr. Obrador did, during the Biden administration. It’s a beautiful thing that 40 million people have come to the United States illegally. Oh, by the way, I suggest all you people who can vote in the United States, vote against Republican. And he did that again, and again, and again.\n\nIt’s time for us to be very sober, careful, judicious and say to Mexico, you have to decide whether you’re a friend, an ally or an enemy. Because right now, you are an enemy of the United States. And we will take the necessary adjustments—make the necessary adjustments for that unfortunate fact. \n\nEditor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson.

However, communities denied funding could file a lawsuit arguing they endured an illegal “disparate impact.”\n\nAs for whether Trump could redirect transportation grants awarded under Biden, Roberson said it largely depends on the status of the project and whether Congress has already appropriated the funding.\n\nState transportation officials have expressed confidence that the new guidelines won’t impact the federal funds states use to set their own transportation priorities and build roads. But many other grants are awarded at the discretion of the administration in power.\n\nLess clear is the status of some already approved discretionary grants, such as an agreement signed just before former President Joe Biden left office committing $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations in South Side Chicago.\n\nBlumenthal, a former state attorney general and federal prosecutor, said Duffy’s edict created “uncertainty and confusion” and pointed out it doesn’t carry any legal weight like statutes and regulations do. He predicted courts would ultimately reject the policy.\n\n“Anybody can write a memo,” Blumenthal said.\n\nHaigh reported from Hartford, Connecticut.","summary":"Some of Duffy’s directives were received as highly unusual.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/07/transportation-grants-directive-birth-rates/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trump-Transportation_Funding-Explainer_06395.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:35:25","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":288248300,"title":"Newsom signs $50M 'Trump-proofing' legislative package","text":"Gov.

An additional $25 million is designated for legal aid groups to assist illegal immigrants facing potential deportation. Newsom lobbed hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration during Trump's first term. While Newsom is gearing up for potential showdowns with the Trump administration, he has also been working with Trump to secure federal disaster relief for the Los Angeles wildfires. Trump visited California in late January to meet with Newsom, and Newsom traveled to Washington, D.C., in early February for another round of discussions with the president. \"We’re working across the aisle, as we always have, to ensure survivors have the resources and support they need,\" Newsom said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Thank you President Trump for coming to our communities to see this first hand, and meeting with me today to continue our joint efforts to support people impacted.\" NEWSOM PROPOSES $25M FROM STATE LEGISLATURE TO 'TRUMP-PROOF' CALIFORNIA Trump hit back at Newsom after he announced the special legislative session in November, saying on his Truth Social account, \"He is using the term 'Trump-Proof' as a way of stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to 'Make California Great Again,' but I just overwhelmingly won the Election.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment.

But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.”\n\nTrudeau's comments came after the media had been ushered out of the room. They were heard by gathered journalists because the prime minister did not realize he was still speaking into a hot mic. The comment saying Trump's threat to annex the Great North being a \"real thing\" was the last thing overheard by reporters before his mic was cut.\n\nIn prior interviews, Trudeau had brushed off Trump's statements as a negotiation tactic.\n\n“President Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that, by that conversation, to take away from the conversation around 25% tariffs on oil and gas and electricity and steel and aluminum and lumber and concrete,” Trudeau told CNN.\n\nTrump has floated annexing Canada multiple times in the last year, including it in an expansionist plan that also includes wresting control of Greenland and the Panama Canal.\n\nTrump paused his planned 25% tariffs on Canadian imports for 30 days earlier this month, but the uncertainty around looming tariffs — and duties that were implemented on Chinese goods — have shaken the market. The president shared on Friday that he would seek \"reciprocal\" tariffs on as-yet-unnamed countries in the coming week.","summary":"The prime minister told business groups that Trump's designs on the Great North were a very real threat","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/07/its-a-real-thing-trudeau-doesnt-think-bluffing-about-annexing-canada/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/12/justin_trudeau_2157822397.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:29:04","author":"Alex Galbraith","authors":["Alex Galbraith"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.078},{"id":288251378,"title":"Trump ‘immediately’ revokes Biden’s security clearance and daily briefing in act of revenge against predecessor","text":"Donald Trump says he will deny former president Joe Biden any access to classified information and the courtesy briefings in an act of revenge against his predecessor.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he was “immediately revoking Joe Biden’s Security Clearances and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings.” This followed a precedent Biden had set four years earlier when he instructed U.S. intelligence officials to halt any briefings with Trump, citing the then-former president’s “erratic behavior” after his 2020 election loss. \n\nAs elected officials, presidents do not hold security clearances but have traditionally been given courtesy briefings on an as-needed basis, such as when traveling abroad or when meeting with foreign government officials. \n\nIt’s unclear whether Biden has requested or received any such briefings since he left office last month.\n\nTrump also claimed that former special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s possession of classified documents dating back to his time as a senator and vice president informed his decision.\n\nIn a misstatement of what Hur had actually written, Trump claimed that the former prosecutor “revealed that Biden suffers from ‘poor memory’ and “could not be trusted with sensitive information.”\n\nTrump was referring to a section of Hur’s report in which the then-special counsel said he would not charge Biden with willfully retaining national defense information — the same charge Trump faced after hundreds of classified documents were found at his Mar-a-Lago residents during an August 2022 search — because it was unlikely that a jury would have convicted him.\n\nHur wrote that Biden’s lawyers could have easily presented him as a “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” and in doing so would have obtained an acquittal at trial.\n\nTrump, who was actually charged with willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy and obstruction of justice but was returned to office by voters before the case could go to trial, further wrote that he would “ always protect our National Security,” before adding: “JOE, YOU’RE FIRED.

a move which Curtis did not reject - he was later forced to make a more concrete decision in another recoupling just days later.\nLooking torn, Curtis eventually made up his mind and decided to not be tempted by someone who he claimed he had 'so much in common with' and chose to stick with Ekin-Su.\nSince then, Danielle had struggled to form a connection in the villa and despite being coupled with Chuggs- a decision made by the public - she did not last more than 9 days in the villa.\nAnd Samie also entered the villa with that same fiery energy and gunned for Luca Bish who was in a secure coupling with Grace Jackson.\nSamie targetted Luca for the couple as the two had history on the outside.\n\nThe 14 islanders were soon called to gather around the firepit shorty after waking up and the boys were tasked with choosing who they wanted to couple with\n\nAs the last man standing for the recoupling, Chuggs Wallis, 26, was left to choose between Tina Stinnes, Samie, 24, and Danielle, 29, who had previously been coupled with and took on a date\n\nBut after the romance between Chuggs and Danielle did not go to plan, the islander decided to get his revenge and pick Tina instead\n\nAfter being the only two girls left without a partner, Danielle and Samie then learned they would immediately be dumped from the villa \nLuca reportedly messaged Samie on social media when she was in a relationship but she ignored his message because she was in a relationship.\n\n Love Island viewers are left divided over Grace Jackson's reaction to Luca Bish kissing Samie Elishi \nSamie claimed Luca then deleted his message and tried again soon after her latest breakup.\nThe bombshell also ignored this message because she did not feel ready.\nBut when she eventually offered Luca the chance to get to know her, he became overwhelmed over the decision because he 'already had something good with Grace'.\nDespite being coupled with Samie by the public and going on a date together alongside Chuggs and Danielle in a romantic vineyard setup, Luca stayed reserved and did not entertain Samie's advances. \nBut his stressed reaction did not settle well with Grace and she did not take his response lightly and ensured Samie was out of the picture following Luca's decision to kiss Samie in a game of Spin The Bottle.\nGrace told Luca that he was focusing his efforts on her and to close off any form of interest -

Inside, packed like sardines, are the squalid tents of 1,500 migrants, hoping to cross the English Channel as soon as they can.\n\nThe stench of urine is unbearable: the men all share just a handful of toilets.\n\nI meet pitifully thin inmates – the vast majority living here are Sudanese – who crawl out of the tents and beg me for antibiotics and other medicines. Some have tuberculosis, hepatitis B or HIV.\n\n‘The French won’t give us medicines. But we know when we get to England, we will receive them free,’ a 38-year-old Egyptian man says, showing me his medical records on his mobile phone.\n\nEvery day at 1pm, a white van turns up to hand out rice and chicken takeaways to the migrants, who queue in their hundreds outside the warehouses for free food donated by a refugee charity.\n\nBut mainly, these beleaguered and abandoned Africans survive on the hope of reaching Britain.\n\nMost of those in this hellhole have been thrown out of Italy, which they reached by boat from Libya.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is tightening her country’s borders – this week she promised anyone entering Italy illegally on boats in future would be refused sanctuary.\n\n‘We will defend our identity: God, homeland and family,’ the populist premier has said. ‘There is an ongoing process of Islamisation in Europe, which is very distant from the values of our civilisation.’\n\nAt the centre of the warehouse is a space between the crush of tents. It’s a prayer area, with a dozen or so copies of the Koran in a neat pile and an Arabic-style rug on the floor. Here, the migrants – almost all Muslim – worship each Friday.\n\nFew, even among the residents of Calais, know the men are living here.\n\nPictures have never been taken inside since the migrants took over the place last autumn.\n\nOnly after the Mail went there this week and offered the migrants a few packets of cigarettes and chocolate bars we were invited in.\n\nMeloni is not alone in wanting to stop the migrant crisis sweeping Europe, with its cultural and economic consequences. The same mood of hostility is rife in Germany and Sweden, which welcomed without question asylum seekers a decade ago.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Donald Trump’s new administration has begun rounding up illegals and deporting them back to their home nations in Latin America.\n\nIn Britain, however, Keir Starmer’s government scrapped the Tory government’s main deterrent – the risk that migrants would be sent to be processed for asylum in Rwanda – and has not replaced it.\n\nMore than 24,000 have been trafficked on boats across the Channel since Labour came to power last summer, and the Home Office has earmarked more than £500million to manage and care for newcomers for the next decade.\n\nAlong the coast in Dunkirk, a 17-year-old Afghan called Albert, tells me he lived in Sweden for three months but was ordered to leave three weeks ago.\n\n‘Stockholm refused me asylum,’ he says in good English. ‘I had nowhere else to go but here – to reach the UK on a boat. I can’t return to Afghanistan. Every migrant in Europe now thinks Britain is their best chance.’\n\nI learned of a male in his twenties from Kurdistan deported from Germany after three years, living in a refugee house in northern France, waiting for a boat to England. ‘He speaks German, considered himself settled, and is shocked at the cruelty of what happened,’ one of his friends told me.\n\nI also learnt the fate of Iraqi asylum seekers Mohammed, Nour and their four children, who were stuck in France last year after Germany deported them.\n\nIn an interview just before Britain’s General Election, they said they were homeless in Dunkirk, and that they had nowhere to go but Britain – and would get there in a trafficker’s boat.\n\nThis week, the family’s Facebook page showed a new picture of a red London bus on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament.\n\n‘They are pleased to be in England. They went across the Channel,’ explained one of their friends this week. ‘They got their UK asylum quickly.’ Today, thousands wait in the northern French port cities.\n\nIn Dunkirk on Tuesday, I watched a group of 80 Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, with full shopping bags and with a few of their children holding cuddly toys, walking along a busy street to catch a bus to the beach for a boat to the UK.\n\nBack in Calais, at the warehouses, I talk to Hamza Ibrahem, 26, from Sudan. He tells me: ‘There are 1,500 of us here, almost all from Sudan and neighbouring South Sudan. All of us came to Italy from Libya. When Italy turned its back on us, we travelled here, as Britain is our last and only hope.’\n\nHis countryman, Ismail Mohammed, 27, arrived in Italy two years ago from Libya. He was deported back there and put in jail.\n\nSomehow, he made it to Italy again for a second time last year. ‘The Italians didn’t want me or any Africans. I don’t have friends or family in Europe. I had nowhere to go. So I left,’ he says.\n\n‘I did what most Sudanese do: I came to Calais. I have tried to jump on lorries to England six times. I would buy a place on a boat if I had the money. I am lonely in France. My only hope now is to reach London, where I have a cousin.’\n\nIsmail, the son of a market trader in Sudan, is a polite young man. He is trying to learn better English and guides me carefully through the tightly packed melee of tents as we chat.\n\n‘My family do not know I am living like this in France. I daren’t tell them how bad it is. It would upset them.\n\n‘When I get to England and I am given a room in a hotel, then I will be proud. I will say to my father the truth. I will continue to study as a computer engineer in your country,’ he adds.\n\nFor now, Ismail and other inhabitants of this wretched sprawl of tents spend their days plotting how to cross the 21 miles of sea to reach the White Cliffs of Dover. Thrown out by a once welcoming – some would say naive – Europe, they are counting on Britain’s wide open doors to save them.","summary":"I meet pitifully thin inmates - the vast majority living here are Sudanese - who crawl out of the tents and beg me for antibiotics and other medicines.

Therefore, we are immediately revoking Joe Biden´s Security Clearances, and stopping his daily Intelligence Briefings,’ Trump wrote. \n\n‘He set this precedent in 2021, when he instructed the Intelligence Community (IC) to stop the 45th President of the United States (ME!) from accessing details on National Security, a courtesy provided to former Presidents.’\n\nBiden didn’t immediately comment on the move.\n\nThe former president ended Trump’s intelligence briefings after Trump helped spur efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and incited the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \n\nAt the time, Biden said Trump’s ‘erratic’ behavior should prevent him from getting the intel briefings. \n\n‘What value is giving him an intelligence briefing? What impact does he have at all, other than the fact he might slip and say something?’ Biden said at the time.\n\nIn his post, Trump cited the special counsel report last year into Biden´s handling of classified documents, saying: ‘The Hur Report revealed that Biden suffers from `poor memory´ and, even in his `prime,´ could not be trusted with sensitive information.’\n\nHe ended his post by saying, ‘I will always protect our National Security – JOE, YOU’RE FIRED. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!’\n\nThe findings released by Special Counsel Robert Hur in February revealed a tranche of new photos showing boxes of sensitive files scattered around the garage of his Delaware home and interviews saying he had ‘diminished faculties’ back in 2017. \n\nThey included folders on the troop surge in Afghanistan that were dumped next to a dog bed and dog crate.\n\nAlthough the report did not recommend bringing charges against the 81-year-old , it provides a cascade of damaging findings about files found in Biden’s garage and personal office as well as the president’s fitness for office.\n\nIn interviews with investigators, Biden became muddled about the dates he was vice president and could not even remember the year in which his son Beau died.\n\nAnd it said his cavalier attitude to classified documents, such as his habit of reading sensitive files to a ghostwriter, posed a significant national security risk.\n\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams said at the time that the report offered a misleading account of the president’s memory.\n\n‘The inappropriate criticisms of the president’s memory are inaccurate, gratuitous, and wrong,’ he said. ‘We told the Special Counsel this.’\n\nFor his part, Trump said the findings showed he had been unfairly targeted for prosecution in a two-tiered system. \n\n‘The Biden Documents Case is 100 times different and more severe than mine,’ he said in an emailed statement. I did nothing wrong, and I cooperated far more. \n\n‘What Biden did is outrageously criminal – He had 50 years of documents, 50 times more than I had, and “WILLFULLY RETAINED” them.’\n\nHur’s investigation was separate from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s probe into Trump after he left the White House. Smith alleges Trump illegally retained secret documents at his home and then obstructed efforts to recover them.\n\nTrump denies any wrongdoing. \n\nIn Biden’s case, officials contacted the National Archives to return documents when they had been found at his former office. The FBI was notified and an investigation opened.\n\nHur said Biden could not be prosecuted as a sitting president. \n\n‘We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,’ his report said.\n\nCritics of Biden pointed out how the Department of Justice homed in on the idea that jurors would give Biden leeway as a forgetful old man. \n\n‘If you’re too senile to stand trial, then you’re too senile to be president,’ said Alex Pfeiffer, of the Trump-supporting political action committee Make America Great Again. ‘Joe Biden is unfit to lead this nation.’\n\nTrump has revoked the security clearances of several Biden allies and those who have been against him since his first term. \n\nAt least 50 former Washington insiders have been stripped of their clearances since Trump returned to the White House.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is serving some payback Joe Biden&#8217;s way by revoking his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Former President Trump revokes Biden&#8217;s security clearance due to lack of trust. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/former-president-trump-revokes-bidens-security-clearance-due-to-lack-of-trust/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Trump-revokes-Bidens-security-clearance-as-senile.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:26:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":288247728,"title":"Chelsea Handler Ripped for 'Sexual Harassment' Joke in 2025 Critics Choice Awards Opener as Host Mocks Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's Legal Battle","text":"Chelsea Handler got the Critics Choice Awards off to a blistering start on Friday night – but not exactly for the best reasons.\n\nThe 49-year-old left viewers fuming after the comedian poked fun at Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's ongoing legal battle, RadarOnline.com can reveal.During Handler's opener, she discussed fans at home needing a \"distraction\" from all currently going on in the country – especially with Donald Trump at the helm.\n\nShe said: \"It's important in times like these to have a distraction. And that's why I want to personally extend my gratitude to Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively.\"\n\n\"Thank you for providing us with that distraction\" she continued.\n\nHandler added: \"I'm grateful.

And I think we're good.\"\"I think everyone in this room can agree, no matter who's side you're on we can all agree to accept that there's probably not going to be a sequel,\" Handler said, referring to Lively and Baldoni's film It Ends With Us.\n\nViewers were quick to react on X as one person raged: \"What’s so funny about a sexual harassment case?\"\n\nAnother added: \"Chelsea Handler just called Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively's case a 'distraction from life.' I'm already pissed off,\" as a user said, \"That Blake Lively joke was so unfunny, especially in the context .\"\n\n\"First joke of the night about a woman being sexually harassed on set... okay,\" one viewer reacted.The movie star and her It Ends With Us co-star and director have been exchanging blows, after Lively accused Baldoni of \"sexual harassment\" and claimed his behavior while filming caused her \"grief, fear, trauma, and extreme anxiety,\" in a shocking lawsuit.\n\nFollowing Lively's bombshell accusations, Baldoni denied Lively's claims and first filed a lawsuit against The New York Times seeking $250million in damages after they posted their article about her lawsuit.\n\nHe then requested a jury trial and a judgment of $400Million.Baldoni's lawsuit stated: \"At bottom, this is not a case about celebrities sniping at each other in the press. This is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio.\n\n\"When Plaintiffs have their day in court, the jury will recognize that even the most powerful celebrity cannot bend the truth to her will.\"\n\nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Baldoni's legal team has been slowly releasing their evidence to support their client, however, he is said to be losing money at a rapid rate due to the fight, and has been left \"financially devastated.\"Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, revealed some details about how his client is feeling amid the chaotic legal battle after Lively filed the first lawsuit back in December.\n\n\"Not to sound like a four-year-old fighting a four-year-old with 'they started it,'\" Freeman told Manhattan US District Judge Lewis J. Liman at a pre-trial conference about gag orders on Monday,\n\nHe added: \"But in these kinds of cases, once someone says something it becomes fact: There's no way to fight against it.\"According to People at the time, judge Liman issued a \"warning\" to both legal teams \"to refrain from making statements to the press that could influence a jury.\"\n\nThe judge in the case has also threatened to move the trial up in date if both parties don't stop attacking one another instead of waiting until March of next year to settle it.\n\nAccording to Freedman, after Lively filed the lawsuit with the head-turning accusations, Wayfarer Studios associates have been \"exiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nAnother insider claimed Baldoni, who is one of the co-founders of Wayfarer Studios, \"lost three jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars\" – which includes an adaptation of the video game Pac-Man.","summary":"Chelsea Handler felt the wrath of viewers when she called out Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni's ongoing legal battle during the Critics Choice Awards.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/chelsea-handler-sexual-harassment-jokecritics-choice-awards-blake-lively-and-justin-baldoni/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/dyqfrj3hF/0x0/chelsea-handler4-1738974102600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:25:19","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":288246846,"title":"CHSAA declines to say if it will follow President Trump’s executive order banning transgender athletes from female sports","text":"Two days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning transgender participation in female sports on Wednesday, the Colorado High School Activities Association declined to clarify where it stands on the issue.\n\nCHSAA’s policy on transgender participation in sports is addressed in its 2024-25 bylaws under Article 3, Bylaw 300, which allows those athletes to compete “free from unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identification.”\n\nWhen asked if it will continue to follow that policy, CHSAA released a statement on Friday that did not directly answer the question.\n\n“We are aware of the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump and we recognize its potential implications,” the statement read. “As always, we will continue to monitor both State and Federal statutes and developments on behalf of our membership. At this time, we have no further comment.”\n\nCHSAA did not immediately respond to further inquiries from The Post about whether its bylaw on transgender participation remains applicable, or if there are transgender athletes currently competing in Colorado high school sports whom the president’s order could affect.\n\nPresident Trump’s executive order “Keeping Men Out Of Women’s Sports” cited Title IX requirements and stated that transgender participation in female sports is “demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports.”\n\nU.S. Department of Education’s Deputy General Counsel Candice Jackson, a Trump appointee, added that “this Administration will protect female athletes from the danger of competing against and the indignity of sharing private spaces with someone of the opposite sex.”\n\n“The Department of Education stands proudly with President Trump’s action as we prioritize Title IX enforcement against educational institutions that refuse to give female athletes the Title IX protections they deserve,” Jackson wrote.\n\nWhile CHSAA declined to spell out its position, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ office pushed back on Trump’s executive order.\n\n“We are reviewing this order to understand its impacts here in Colorado, but this is federal government overreach on decisions local leagues and communities should be making to ensure opportunities and fairness for all student-athletes,” a spokesman for the governor said in a statement to The Post.\n\nAs part of Trump’s executive order, school districts and universities that fail to comply with the Trump administration’s new policy can have federal government funding rescinded. That means if CHSAA chooses to allow its membership to ignore Trump’s order, it could impact the finances of Colorado schools.\n\nTrump’s administration said his executive order “requires immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations comprised of schools that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.”\n\nOn Thursday, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes, with the new policy limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth. That change will apply to Colorado colleges, including the state’s largest universities in CU and CSU.\n\nIn California, the state’s interscholastic federation declared it would not comply with Trump’s executive order, according to a report from the San Francisco Chronicle. Instead, the high school athletic association will continue to follow California state law that allows athletes to participate in sports based off their gender identity.\n\nPer CHSAA’s bylaws, a transgender athlete meets with his or her school “to determine the gender assignment for the prospective student-athlete.”\n\n“The CHSAA will review athletic eligibility decisions based on gender assignment of transgender student-athletes in accordance with its approved policies and appeals procedures,” the bylaw reads.\n\nWant more sports news?

That ruling came as part of a separate lawsuit filed by labor unions. \n\nThe Democratic attorneys general are asking a federal judge in Manhattan to grant a temporary restraining order prohibiting Trump’s administration from granting DOGE or any other appointee or special government employee entry into the system outside the Treasury employees who usually have access.\n\nThe lawsuit argues the Trump administration is exceeding its statutory authority by letting government employees from outside the Treasury view the records. Among other things, the lawsuit claims Trump and the Treasury failed to conduct a “privacy impact assessment” before granting DOGE’s access. \n\nOn Friday, a reporter asked Trump about criticism of DOGE from Democrats who call it an “unlawful power grab.” The reporter asked Trump if there’s “anything you’ve told Elon Musk he cannot touch.”\n\n“Well, we haven’t discussed that much,” Trump said. “I’ll tell them to go here, go there.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\n\nThe findings released by Special Counsel Robert Hur in February revealed a tranche of new photos showing boxes of sensitive files scattered around the garage of his Delaware home and interviews saying he had 'diminished faculties' back in 2017. \n\nThey included folders on the troop surge in Afghanistan that were dumped next to a dog bed and dog crate.\n\nAlthough the report did not recommend bringing charges against the 81-year-old , it provides a cascade of damaging findings about files found in Biden's garage and personal office as well as the president's fitness for office.\n\nIn interviews with investigators, Biden became muddled about the dates he was vice president and could not even remember the year in which his son Beau died.\n\nAnd it said his cavalier attitude to classified documents, such as his habit of reading sensitive files to a ghostwriter, posed a significant national security risk.\n\nWhite House spokesman Ian Sams said at the time that the report offered a misleading account of the president's memory.\n\n'The inappropriate criticisms of the president’s memory are inaccurate, gratuitous, and wrong,' he said. 'We told the Special Counsel this.'\n\nFor his part, Trump said the findings showed he had been unfairly targeted for prosecution in a two-tiered system. \n\n'The Biden Documents Case is 100 times different and more severe than mine,' he said in an emailed statement. I did nothing wrong, and I cooperated far more. \n\n'What Biden did is outrageously criminal - He had 50 years of documents, 50 times more than I had, and \"WILLFULLY RETAINED\" them.'\n\nHur's investigation was separate from Special Counsel Jack Smith's probe into Trump after he left the White House. Smith alleges Trump illegally retained secret documents at his home and then obstructed efforts to recover them.\n\nTrump denies any wrongdoing. \n\nIn Biden's case, officials contacted the National Archives to return documents when they had been found at his former office. The FBI was notified and an investigation opened.\n\nHur said Biden could not be prosecuted as a sitting president. \n\n'We would reach the same conclusion even if Department of Justice policy did not foreclose criminal charges against a sitting president,' his report said.\n\nCritics of Biden pointed out how the Department of Justice homed in on the idea that jurors would give Biden leeway as a forgetful old man. \n\n'If you're too senile to stand trial, then you're too senile to be president,' said Alex Pfeiffer, of the Trump-supporting political action committee Make America Great Again. 'Joe Biden is unfit to lead this nation.'\n\nTrump has revoked the security clearances of several Biden allies and those who have been against him since his first term. \n\nAt least 50 former Washington insiders have been stripped of their clearances since Trump returned to the White House. \n\nDonald TrumpJoe Biden\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump revokes Biden's security clearance as senile ex-president 'cannot be trusted'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump is serving some payback Joe Biden's way by revoking his successor and predecessor's security clearance after Biden did the same to him in 2021.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14374371/trump-revokes-biden-security-clearance.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/08/00/94991557-0-image-m-45_1738973866557.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:17:53","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

The men they belong to have committed crimes evil almost beyond comprehension.\n\nMembers of two of the most savage rival gangs the world has seen, El Salvador’s Ms-13 and Barrio 18, they raped and tortured, murdered and mutilated, cut bodies to pieces and strewed them around the streets to strike terror in the neighbourhoods they controlled.\n\nOn my journey to the world-renowned prison that holds them, the Latin American country’s new Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT), my government escorts had shown me photographic evidence of their grisly handiwork.\n\nOne man had been impaled with a tree branch through his torso before being decapitated; another was anally gang-raped before being tied to a car and dragged to his death.\n\nStanding a few feet away from the cage holding 100 perpetrators of this kind of savagery – one of 32 mass cells that line Module 8 in the vast fortress prison – is a deeply unnerving experience.\n\nUnder the men’s intense gaze, cold sweat trickles down my spine, and I feel waves of revulsion and fear. And yet, counter-intuitive though it might seem, these emotions are tempered by a degree of pity.\n\nI think anyone with a modicum of compassion who witnessed the harrowing scenes that confronted me this week, when I became the first British journalist allowed inside this godforsaken place, would share that sentiment.\n\nEveryone has their own vision of hell. For George Orwell, in his dystopian classic 1984, it was a boot forever stamping on a human face. However, I can imagine no greater torment than being consigned to CECOT, with no hope of ever being released, like the inmates here whose sentences range from 60 to more than 1,000 years.\n\nDeath would be infinitely more merciful. A thought that might concentrate the minds of the violent US criminals and lawless migrants Donald Trump aims to banish here, under the terms of an unprecedented deal agreed with El Salvador’s president this week. I will come back to that.\n\nOne of the world’s biggest prisons, with a 40,000 capacity (equivalent to almost half the UK’s current prison population), CECOT was built two years ago amid a huge crackdown on the gangs destroying the fabric of Salvadoran society.\n\nIts director Belarmino Garcia declined to tell me how many prisoners are currently held there, but there are many thousands of the worst of the worst gangsters.\n\nAs the heavy gates clang behind them and they are X-rayed by sophisticated machines, they still bristle with the machismo untouchability that made El Salvador, a mountainous country the size of Wales with a population of six million, their fiefdom.\n\nWithin a few days, however, they are behaving as obediently as timorous laboratory beagles.\n\nSome of the eyes that stare at me may still carry a malevolent glint, but for the most part they are hollow voids, for every shred of defiance and ego has been stripped away.\n\nPointing to the 266 prisoners said to have died behind bars since President Nayib Bukele began his much-vaunted purge, two years ago, the human rights lobby claims that brutal means are used to bring them to their knees. Garcia, a menacingly squat, stone-faced man, denies this. The total acquiescence I witnessed is achieved, he says, by enforcing an ultra-hard regime that brooks no dissent.\n\nHaving visited the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and the Robben Island prison where Nelson Mandela was held, the system at CECOT certainly seems harsher. Terrorists held in ‘Gitmo’ are at least afforded some privileges and can undergo rehabilitation programs.\n\nThey have access to books and writing materials, can interact with one another, exercise in the fresh air, communicate with family members, and look forward to occasional visits.\n\nIn CECOT none of those things are permitted. The sole aim is subjugation.\n\nFor 23-and-a-half hours of the day, the men are obliged to squat on mattress-less metal bunks, stacked four-storeys high, like shelves in a B&Q store.\n\nThey are permitted to speak only in whispers. Conversations with outsiders such as me, and the sinister-looking Darth Vader clones who guard their cages in visored black helmets and riot gear, are also forbidden.\n\nOne might liken this to a human zoo, but zoo animals are at least given stimuli.\n\nTrapped in a permanently strip-lit, antiseptically clean netherworld, these men will never smell fresh air or see natural daylight again. They are fed three meals a day in their cells – of rice and beans, pasta and a boiled egg – their water is rationed by the guards who hand it to them and they use a communal lavatory.\n\nThey are only permitted to scuttle out of their cages, shackled hand and foot with heads bowed low, for a small number of reasons.\n\nThey are evacuated when the guards charge into the module brandishing machine guns to stage a ‘forced intervention’ and search their bunks. While this clean sweep takes place they must crouch on the floor in perfect rows, with their legs wrapped tightly around the man in front of them and their head pressed against his bare back, forming a human jigsaw puzzle. Anyone who spoils the pattern by fidgeting receives a sharp baton jab to the ribs.\n\nThey also sit cross-legged on the spotless module floor for a daily 30-minute Bible reading and calisthenics session.\n\nAnd when their turn comes, they are removed to one of the small rooms used as courts, for remotely conducted ‘trials’ which, in almost every case, end with a guilty verdict.\n\nThey are also taken out of their cells for medical examinations. For anyone foolish enough to break a rule, the windowless punishment cell also provides a terrifying change of scenery. Such is the mental torture of being isolated in the echoing darkness of this concrete dungeon, furnished only with a stone slab and toilet, that the maximum permitted detention period is 15 days.\n\nHowever, director Garcia tells me no one has been able to withstand more than ten days without being deemed ‘too ill’ to remain there, which I take to mean that they had been driven to the brink of insanity.\n\nInvited to experience how it felt, I lasted a couple of minutes before banging on the iron door.\n\nThis, then, is the life of a captured Salvadoran gang member. A life spent sitting on a tray staring vacantly into space. It will be their existence for as long as they continue to breathe.\n\nThey can’t even commit suicide by hanging themselves because spikes prevent them from threading bedsheets through gaps in the cage roof.\n\nShould they die here, as inevitably they will, years could pass before their relatives are informed, if they are told at all.\n\nDetermined to crush the cult that once surrounded El Salvador’s most notorious gangsters, President Bukele has banned tombstones glorifying their memory and had any existing ones smashed with sledgehammers.\n\nThe media are not given any information about the prisoners, and strongly discouraged from writing about them at all.\n\nShut away in this void, in a subtropical volcanic valley two hours from the capital, San Salvador, with no wifi or mobile signals, these men have effectively ceased to exist. They are the living dead.\n\nMy tour of CECOT was granted only after a lengthy negotiation with the El Salvador government, but it couldn’t have come at a timelier juncture. For the previous day, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had visited Bukele at his lakeside estate, and the pair laid the groundwork for Trump’s latest audacious deal.\n\nIn return for generous funding, the baseball-hatted Salvadoran leader – who styles himself ‘the world’s coolest dictator’ and was the first leader in the Western hemisphere to be called by Trump after his election – offered to accept and incarcerate deported American criminals.\n\nRubio’s spokesman described it as ‘an extraordinary gesture never before extended by any country’.\n\nBukele even pledged to accept members of Latin America’s most fearsome crime syndicate, Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua, which plunders tens of millions from human trafficking, drug-smuggling, and extortion rackets.\n\nDetails of this proposal are yet to be thrashed out, and it will inevitably meet strong human rights opposition.\n\nIf it does go ahead, however, many of the deportees are sure to be kept behind CECOT’s forbidding walls, topped by razor wire surging with 15,000 volts, for it is believed to have ample space to house them.\n\nSo how does this tiny country find itself in the front line of Trump’s war on undesirable migrants?\n\nThe story begins in the 1980s, when a million or more Salvadorans fled to the US to escape grinding poverty and a bloody, 13-year civil war.\n\nMany settled in gang-blighted Los Angeles ghettos where they formed their own crews, MS-13 and Barrio 18. When they returned home, in the 1990s, these mobs also took root in\n\nEl Salvador. They divided the country into territories where they extorted protection money from businesses, eliminating anyone who refused to pay or who strayed onto their turf, and often their families with them.\n\nBy 2015, El Salvador was the world’s murder capital, with 106 killings for every 100,000 of its six million population: a rate more than 100 times higher than Britain’s.\n\nBut the nadir came in March 2022, when 87 people were butchered in a single weekend. It prompted the youthful Bukele, then three years into his first presidential term, to launch his massive purge.\n\nDeclaring El Salvador to be under ‘a state of exception’ which still pertains, he sent military snatch-squads to reclaim gang strongholds and passed sweeping hardline decrees.\n\nSimply sporting a gang-related tattoo was sufficient to earn a 20-year jail sentence. Child gangsters as young as 12 were summarily hauled off the streets, phones were bugged, hotlines were set up for neighbours to shop one another.\n\nAs of last month, 84,000 alleged gang members and associates – roughly two per cent of the adult population – were in jail.\n\nBukele’s gangbusting model is now being copied by governments throughout Latin America, and its £100 million bastion is the supposedly escape-proof CECOT.\n\nFrom having the world’s worst murder rate, El Salvador now has one of the lowest, projecting a ratio of less than one per 100,000 this year.\n\nAnd as I have seen this week, the societal transformation is little short of astonishing.\n\nDriving along the Golden Highway outside San Salvador, my fixer, Claudia Galdana, told me she regularly saw dumped bin-bags stuffed with body parts when she took this route a few years ago. Today it is a pleasant thoroughfare.\n\nBefore the mass arrests, the city centre was a virtual no-go zone. Now it is the hub of a burgeoning tourism industry.\n\nOn Tuesday night, I sauntered through the central square, with its handsome cathedral and palace, and a vast new 24-hour library (one of several projects funded by China), feeling as safe as in any of the 100 or so countries I’ve visited.\n\nEarlier we went to La Campanera, a once-feared suburb whose homes were often commandeered by MS-13. Isabel Garcia, 75, told me that in the past she was permitted to stay only by paying dope-smoking mobsters who controlled her alley a ‘tax’ whenever she left the house.\n\nReturning from church one night, she saw the gangsters heaving four heavy bags along the street. The following day she learned they contained the bodies of murdered rivals.\n\nSuch sights are now a distant memory. La Campanera has been reclaimed as a vibrant residential area, with a new school and colourful murals replacing the gangs’ scrubbed-off graffiti.\n\nThe police station, which had been humiliatingly requisitioned by MS-13, is serving the community once again.\n\nAll this has made Bukele hugely popular. Slyly circumventing a constitutional rule that prevents El Salvador’s presidents serving more than one, five-year term, he was re-elected last February with 85 per cent of the vote.\n\nFor a sizeable minority, however, the nation’s deliverance from the gangs has come at a heavy price. They are the ones wrongly detained for alleged gang participation or collusion, sometimes on the flimsiest of evidence.\n\nThe mother of one such boy claims police took him to be a gangster purely because of his haircut. He has since disappeared. Whether the liberation of six million people justifies such iniquities is a matter for debate.\n\nServing us coffee in a ramshackle cafe near the summit of San Salvador volcano, waitress Yamileph Diaz, aged 20, relates a story that encapsulated the dilemma.\n\nWhen the gangs controlled this mountainside, her family defied their demands for protection money, and she feared they would carry out a threat to rape her.\n\nThen, in 2019, her brother Jonathan, 27, vanished, never to be seen again. When their tormentors were rounded up, therefore, she praised the president.\n\nBut during the first wave of arrests, in 2022, another of her brothers, Joaquin, 25, was accused – unfairly, she insists – of gang activity, and he has been held without trial ever since.\n\n‘So, you see, I have seen both sides of this, and it’s a difficult balance,’ she says. ‘But those men were so terrible, I would still say life is better now than before.’\n\nWhen those dead eyes stared out at me in CECOT, the following morning, Yamileph’s story came back to me.\n\nDirector Garcia ordered some prisoners to stand before me as he reeled off their evildoing.\n\nNumber 176834, Eric Alexander Villalobos – alias ‘Demon City’ – had belonged to a sub-clan, or clica, called the Los Angeles Locos. His long list of crimes included planning and conspiring an unspecified number of murders, possessing explosives and weapons, extortion and drug-trafficking. He was serving 867 years.\n\nIn 2015, prisoner 126150, Wilber Barahina, alias ‘The Skinny One’, took part in a massacre so ruthless that it even caused shockwaves in a country then thought to be unshockable.\n\nFive builders were kidnapped and put to death simply for working in the ‘wrong area’. For this he was doing 160 years.\n\nTwo other gangsters paraded before me had assassinated soldiers and police officers.\n\nAs the prison commandant exhibited them they stood like dehumanized statues, motionless even when he prodded their naked torsos to explain the significance of their tattoos.\n\nIt struck me, bizarrely, that these intricately inked etchings were the only works of art in the soulless, grey hangar.\n\nYet along with the symbols of allegiance, and the names of girlfriends and children they would never again see, they depicted images of devil worship and ritual slaughter.\n\nI was permitted one, three-minute interview with a prisoner, but his answers to my questions were so robotic that they seemed to have been scripted.\n\nSitting before me in a plastic chair with his hands manacled, Marvin Ernesto Medrano confessed to committing ‘many murders’, but said he had been convicted only of two ‘minor’ ones.\n\nIn a flat, emotionless voice, he said he was treated well and had his basic needs met.\n\nThere was no contrition, no emotional message to his children or show of despair.\n\nOnly the bland resignation that he was here for eternity, and a trite message to young people to ‘live a good, family life’ and not follow his example.\n\nWould he rather be dead than serve out his 100-year sentence? He shook his shaved head.\n\n‘You know the saying: if we are alive, we still hope,’ he said, though his words had an empty ring. Then he was led away.\n\nIn a ploy designed to ensure gang members don’t band together in their cages and hatch some whispered plot, MS-13 and Barrio 18 rivals have been forced to intermingle.\n\nSo far, this policy appears to have paid off, for according to Garcia there have been no attempted insurrections, nor any troublesome outbreaks since the prison opened.\n\nWhether that will change if, and when, Trump sends plane-loads of America’s worst to El Salvador remains to be seen, but the director is confident he and his Darth Vader guards can handle every eventuality.\n\n‘The authorities will decide what happens, but we are ready to receive any kind of criminals, no matter what their profile,’ he told me with a mirthless smile, adding: ‘I am ready!’\n\nPerhaps so. But as this typically Trumpian social experiment unfolds, governments with their own migration crises – among them, of course, Britain – will doubtless follow its progress with keen interest.\n\nFor my part, I will never forget those dark, fathomless eyes.","summary":"Standing a few feet away from the cage holding 100 perpetrators of savagery - one of 32 mass cells that line Module 8 in the Terrorism Confinement Centre - is a deeply unnerving experience.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14373953/Inside-prison-living-dead-visit-El-Salvadors-godforsaken-40-000-capacity-mega-prison.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/07/21/94986859-0-image-a-39_1738964138300.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:17:16","author":"David Jones,Editor","authors":["David Jones","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":288250924,"title":"One Of Elon Musk's DOGE Bros Is Currently An Employee At AI Unicorn Databricks","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 20: Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk arrives to speak during an inauguration event at Capital One Arena on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. Donald Trump takes office for his second term as the 47th president of the United States. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nGavin Kliger, one of the cadre of tech bros working with Elon Musk on DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), has taken a leave of absence from his job as a senior software engineer at Databricks, not left the company as previously reported, multiple sources confirmed to Forbes. Internal documents reviewed by Forbes show that Kliger, who has been working on Musk’s haphazard effort to slash the government’s workforce, remains a senior software engineer at Databricks.\n\nIn an internal AMA with CEO Ali Ghodsi, staff at the a16z-backed company asked about potential reputational damage based on Kliger’s work with DOGE, the sources added. Ghodsi replied that he and the company don’t get involved with the opinions of staff, unless they are acting as a Databricks representative. He noted as well that he wouldn’t comment on employment situations or his employee’s political positions, according to a current Databricks staffer.\n\n“I actually think our CEO is pretty sane but just naive about the DOGE effort being politics as usual,” said another current employee who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak openly.\n\nIn an all-company Slack, Ghodsi said Kliger’s leave of absence must have been approved by his manager, and that such an approval would only be given to high-performers. Kliger’s manager did not respond to a comment request.\n\nKliger and Databricks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKliger is a 25-year-old graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. At DOGE, he has reportedly played a role in the dismantling of $40 billion humanitarian agency USAID, emailing staff to tell them not to come into the office earlier this week. Wired reported that he was one of several DOGE staffers to enter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday.\n\nForbes previously reported on 130 of Kliger’s now-deleted X posts reconstructed via internet archives, which revealed him as a Musk and Trump superfan with a penchant for racist and ableist jokes and a disdain for government spending and illegal immigrants. In a now-deleted Substack post, Kliger claimed that he left behind a seven-figure salary to join DOGE, even though he remains an employee of Databricks. A screenshot of Databricks Slack taken today and shared with Forbes shows Kliger’s profile as active.\n\nThe chaotic and unprecedented effort by DOGE to slash the federal workforce and discontinue federal programs has so far been shrouded in secrecy. Most of the DOGE staffers whose names have been publicly reported are young, male software engineers, and many have ties to Musk’s companies. (Kliger himself interned at Twitter before Musk bought it). But Kliger’s employment status at one of Silicon Valley’s hottest AI unicorns shows that Musk’s DOGE effort includes tech workers beyond his immediate sphere, who also have little to no experience with the inner workings of government.\n\nIn the company AMA, staff also questioned Ghodsi about the company’s relationship with Andreessen Horowitz, one of its most notable backers, as it’s been reported that the firm’s founder Marc Andreessen has been actively recruiting for DOGE, the staffer told Forbes. Ghodsi said Andreessen’s political positions don’t impact Databricks or himself personally and the firm is committed to neutrality. Andreessen, who previously backed Democrats, has become one of Silicon Valley’s most outspoken backers of Trump.\n\nDatabricks, which provides data analytics software and AI tools, is one of the most valuable privately held U.S. tech startups. In December, the company raised $10 billion of funding at a $62 billion valuation. Meta invested another $5 billion in the company in January.\n\n“I like Databricks and the tech industry and I hate that the worst elements are being elevated,” said one of the current Databricks employees. “It’s too toxic and I want it nowhere near me.”\n\nAre you someone with knowledge about DOGE and its workers?

Trump on Wednesday signed the \"No Men in Women's Sports\" executive order, fulfilling one of his major campaign promises of keeping biological men out of girls and women’s sports.

The state is governed by Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris' running mate for the 2024 election; the Democrats won the state. The state was home to a Supreme Court case where a transgender powerlifter was continuing the fight to compete against biological women.

HOW TO WATCH SUPER BOWL LIX BETWEEN CHIEFS, EAGLES STREAMED ON TUBI Prior to Trump signing the order Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said part of the motivation behind Trump's executive order would be to create a \"pressure campaign\" for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and NCAA to follow and prevent transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. In response to Trump's order, the NCAA changed its policy, in place since 2010, to disallow transgender athletes from competing against women, requiring them to compete based on their birth gender. During Trump's ceremony at the White House to sign the executive order, he announced that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will prohibit any transgender athletes attempting to compete as women from entering the country for the Olympics in 2028. The United Nations released study findings saying nearly 900 biological females have fallen short of winning medals because they lost to transgender athletes.

Cox used the opportunity to slam the current administration's executive orders limiting transgender language in the federal government. \"I think in terms of the administration and all this propaganda and lies – everything he’s doing is illegal, by the way,\" Cox told the ABC panel. JK ROWLING TORCHES LEFT FOR GENDER IDEOLOGY 'CALAMITY' AFTER TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER: 'THEY DIDN'T LISTEN' Co-host Ana Navarro kicked off the political discussion, mentioning her respect for how Cox blends activism with acting, and asking the actor to weigh in on Trump’s recent executive orders. Trump last month signed an executive order, titled, \"Defending women from gender ideology extremism and restoring biological truth to the federal government.\" The EO clarifies that it is U.S. policy to recognize two sexes, male and female, and that men and women are biologically distinct, along with addressing how agencies should handle these directives. The president also signed the \"No Men in Women's Sports\" executive order on Wednesday, mandating that public institutions will determine an individual’s eligibility for women’s sports to be based according to their biological sex and not gender identity or testosterone reduction. Cox told \"The View\" about feeling anti-trans discrimination for \"the past several years\" at this point. \"It started at the state level, many years ago,\" the actor said. \"You know, what is it? 26 states banned ‘gender-affirming care’ for young people. This has been happening at the state level for many years. So, I’ve been devastated because trans families have had to relocate for many years, parents have been criminalized, so it’s been devastating. Now it’s happening on a federal level.\" WOMEN ARE LOSING THE SPORTS GENDER BATTLE. LET’S HELP THEM WIN THE WAR Cox talked about loving trans people and people in general, and added that Trump’s orders are \"horrible.\" The \"Orange is The New Black\" star hoped that the executive orders \"will be challenged in the courts\" because of their alleged illegality. \"At the end of the day, trans people are less than 1% of the population and trans people are not the reason you can’t afford eggs, that you can’t afford healthcare. We’re not the reason you can’t buy a house or your rent’s too high,\" Cox said. \"I think they’re focused on the wrong 1%.

House elections in NY-21, FL-01, and FL-06. Local elections just about every Tuesday. Fight to win in all of them. \n\nMake it clear that the GOP’s attacks aren’t just vile.

But Trump made inroads with many voters there in last year's presidential race amid concerns of immigration, the economy and public safety.Republicans now face the question of whether those gains will last through future elections, while Democrats will be spending the next few years fighting to win back those voters who shifted rightward in 2024.Adams' low approval rating may have implications for the New York City's mayoral race this year, as the poll suggests he is vulnerable to a primary challenge from other well-known Democrats.What To KnowThe Emerson College poll found that only 27 percent of New York City residents hold a positive view of Adams, who was hit with bribery and wire fraud charges last year, though he has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Fifty-eight percent said they view him unfavorably.About 40 percent of respondents said they hold a favorable view of Trump, while 53 percent said they view the president unfavorably.Trump made substantial gains in New York state last year, losing it by only about 12.6 points to Vice President Kamala Harris. Four years earlier in 2020, President Joe Biden carried the Empire State by 23.2 points.Regarding potential Democratic mayoral primary challengers, the poll found Adams could be in peril, particularly if former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo runs. If Cuomo jumps into the race, he would receive about 32.5 percent support, while only 9.8 percent would back Adams.If Cuomo doesn't run, Adams may be in a stronger position, the poll found. He received more support than other candidates, with state Senator Jessica Ramos and former New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer receiving the next highest number of votes.Cuomo hasn't said he plans to run yet—but other polls have similarly found him with an early lead.What People Are SayingAdams, to Politico: \"People who are running — they're going to have to take claim for the stuff that they did when they were holding office.

After all, it is only his “nature” that is on display.\n\nEugene Hyman\n\nChina guilty of same\ninfluence U.S. once held\n\nPay close attention. Donald Trump claims to want to control Panama because of undue Chinese influence and potential control of the canal by China.\n\nIf China has any undue influence it’s because they’ve created a huge global program ostensibly to develop infrastructure in countries like Panama. Sure it’s a program rife with propaganda and designed to spread Chinese influence over world affairs.\n\nThe United States used to do exactly the same thing throughout the second half of the 20th century. Until yesterday we still had an organization, USAID, dedicated to continuing that work countering Russian and Chinese influence. Trump and his lackey Elon Musk, in their zeal to rid government of dissenting voices, are in the process of gutting USAID of both staff and funding.\n\nThey have no clue how government or world affairs work, and they don’t care. They’re too busy waving their middle fingers at imagined enemies.\n\nIt’s up to us to resist\nblind obedience\n\nRe: “2.2 billion gallons of water flowed out of two Central California reservoirs because of Trump’s order to open dams” (Feb. 4).\n\nTwo events reported recently make clear that federal employees need to remember that their loyalty should be to the Constitution of the United States, not Donald Trump.\n\nTrump ordering the release of billions of gallons of water for no purpose is one example. If you are given orders that make no sense, such as this one, you have a responsibility to question and not follow that order if that is the right thing to do. Remember the Nuremberg Trials. Kash Patel promising to prosecute federal employees for their lack of loyalty to Trump is misguided and dangerous. Federal employees are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, not the whims of Donald Trump.\n\nWe must resist blind obedience.\n\nJeff Anderson","summary":"Also: Late whining &#124; Fiduciary duty &#124; Corrupt nature &#124; China's influence &#124; Blind obedience.

The administration has vowed to conduct the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history targeting the estimated 11.7 million people who are in the country without legal status.New York City is a majority Democrat city, but Trump made notable inroads in the 2024 presidential race. A new poll finds that voters identifying as Hispanic or Latino believe the mass deportations of immigrants, many of whom come from Central and South America, will have a positive effect on the city.What To Know The poll, which was conducted by Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill, surveyed 1,000 registered voters in New York City between February 3 and 5.The poll found that 47.4 percent of Hispanic voters believe Trump's mass deportation plan would have a positive impact on New York City, while 33.2 percent said it would have a negative effect. Hispanic voters had the highest percentage of positive responses among racial groups.White voters were evenly split, with 44 percent believing it would have a positive impact and 44 percent viewing it negatively. Black voters had the highest percentage of opposition, with 48 percent viewing the proposal negatively, while 46 percent of those identifying as \"other or multiple races\" also saw it as harmful.Overall, New Yorkers surveyed are split on the initiative, with 41.1 percent believing mass deportations would have a positive impact on the city, 41.6 percent saying it would have a negative impact, and 17.3 percent unsure.The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.The survey found that immigration ranks as the fourth-most important issue for voters, following housing affordability (23 percent), crime (22 percent), and economic issues (22 percent). Immigration was cited by 12 percent of voters.Since taking office, Trump has issued a slew of executive orders related to immigration. Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that in the first two weeks of Trump's second term, nearly 5,700 illegal immigrants had been deported. Also this week, the first flights to an expanding detention center at Guantanamo Bay took place, although the migrants held here may not count towards removal statistics, as they are still under U.S. custody.Border czar Tom Homan recently insisted that illegal immigrants who had committed or were accused of serious or violent crimes would be the focus of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations for now while the White House asks Congress for more funding, both for officers and additional detention space.Not all Americans support Trump's mass deportation policy, with opponents holding large protests in multiple cities last weekend.What People Are SayingSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on January 29: \"There's a new Sheriff in town: President Donald Trump. We are completely changing the game when it comes to removing illegal alien criminals from the United States of America.\"California Senator Alex Padilla, a member of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship and Border Safety said in a news release: \"All Americans will feel the impacts of Trump's anti-immigrant agenda, creating chaos and fear in communities across our country, while also driving up costs for businesses and consumers. We can all agree that we need a secure and orderly border; however, these executive actions only further complicate that effort—and many of them violate the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. So make no mistake: it won't be long before a policy of chaos costs the American people.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told her followers on social media, \"The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway. Promises made. Promises kept.\"What Happens Next ICE raids and deportations are expected to continue under the Trump administration.New York City will elect its next mayor in November, with primaries scheduled for June.","summary":"A higher percentage of Hispanic voters than any other racial group—over 47 percent—support Trump's mass deportation plans, believing it will benefit the city.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-deportations-backed-hispanic-new-york-city-voters-2028187","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2584091/trump-executive-order.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:00:31","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":288248508,"title":"‘Chindia’ returns as India and China prepare for a Trump earthquake","text":"A US military plane carrying Indian illegal immigrants landed in the northern Indian city of Amritsar on Wednesday, handcuffed and legs chained throughout the journey. Unlike Colombia, which last month initially refused to accept deportees dispatched in military planes like criminals, India chose discretion as the better part of valour.\nIt was not a particularly proud moment for a major US ally and rising power whose leader is supposedly a close friend of the new US president, but India is doing all it can to withstand the aftershock of Donald Trump’s second coming.\nLast week, the tremors were felt in India’s annual budget presentation in parliament, one of the country’s most awaited government events. As Trump unleashed new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, the Narendra Modi government cut customs duties on high-end motorcycles, cars and smartphone parts.\nThe tax reduction will help American companies like Harley-Davidson, Tesla and Apple, earning the government some urgently needed brownie points with Washington. Indian tariffs on Harley-Davidson, in particular, had been an old Trump peeve. The last time he was president, he forced Modi to slash tariffs on Harleys from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. This time Delhi isn’t taking any chances.\n\nThe fear is palpable. Not just pre-emptive tariff cuts, Modi’s government has been bending over backwards to get on the right side of the new US administration in every other way – from assuring it of India’s commitment to the primacy of the US dollar to accepting 18,000 illegal Indian immigrants Trump plans to send back.\nAmerica’s US$35 billion trade deficit with India makes it an obvious target for Trump. He revoked India’s preferential trade treatment in 2019 and no one knows what plans he has for India this time. Ominously enough, he keeps calling India a major tariff abuser, and in a recent phone call with Modi, stressed that India needs to buy more security equipment from the US and ensure a “fair bilateral trading relationship” – diplomatese for easier market access. But Trump has also granted the Indian prime minister an audience next week, making Modi one of the first foreign leaders to meet the US president since his return to power, and raising India’s hopes for favourable treatment.\nIt is unpredictability like this, along with a host of other fundamental drivers, that has seen India inching towards a detente with China in a geopolitical realignment of tectonic proportions with the potential of overhauling the region’s geopolitics. As Trump returns, so has “Chindia” – a forgotten portmanteau capturing the promise of a synergistic rise of China and India that would supposedly repivot the locus of the global economy from the West to the East.\n\nA ‘Chindia’ revival?\n“Chindia” saw its heyday in the last decade as China-India trade took off and India began to replicate China’s double-digit growth. It didn’t last long, though. As Chinese power grew, the world moved on to another portmanteau – “Chimerica” – as the future increasingly began to look hinged on China and America and how they would manage their relationship. With China rising, the power asymmetry between China and India also widened, and their old suspicions and animosities returned. A months-long fatal confrontation on their unresolved border in 2020 pushed relations over the edge and India hit back with a series of trade curbs. These have begun to be reversed as “Chindia” reasserts itself.\nAlmost five years after Chinese fast-fashion app Shein was banned in India when relations began to sour, it was quietly relaunched this month by Reliance Retail, owned by India’s richest tycoon Mukesh Ambani. Just a few days earlier, India and China agreed to resume direct flights for the first time in five years. These are only the latest signs of the changing dynamics in the China-US-India triad.\n\nFrom anti-US rhetoric by Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Modi-friendly Indian media, to open declarations by top Indian officials of the need for Chinese investments, to a hurried agreement to de-escalate a four-year-long border stand-off between the two Asian neighbours right before the US election – and a surprise summit between the Indian and Chinese leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit – these signs became especially evident in the closing months of the Biden presidency.\nEver since a people’s revolution toppled Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina, Modi’s Hindu right-wing information ecosystem have been calling it a CIA regime-change operation, and warning of similar attempts by the “American deep state” to destabilise India. Even the BJP itself adopted this anti-American rhetoric, directly charging the US State Department with engineering investigations of a securities fraud and bribery against Indian tycoon Gautam Adani – considered close to Modi – to weaken the prime minister.\nIndian and Chinese representatives, meanwhile, went to work to further ease the border situation. So protective is Delhi of the optics of this sudden normalisation of ties with Beijing that the government refused to take any questions in parliament on the exact nature of the de-escalation deal, triggering an opposition walkout. The opposition alleges that Delhi ceded territory to buy peace.\n\nFriends with benefits\nThe distinctly friendly approach towards China and the sniping at the US in recent months are a noticeable departure from India’s recent foreign-policy template. For decades now, the US and India have been courting each other for their converging strategic interests in balancing China. A tense border stand-off with China in 2017 followed by the confrontation in 2020 pushed India even closer to the US.\nA host of factors has been driving the change – from America’s declining capacity and intent to lead the world and the assertiveness of emerging powers like India, to China and India’s own individual calculus of ending a costly stalemate at the border and diversifying their policy options. Both India and China stand to benefit from each other’s markets to mitigate looming economic and geopolitical risks.\nA general deglobalising trend means America increasingly brings less to the table for a country like India that does not wholly depend on it for security. Meanwhile, China’s unshakeable dominance in global supply chains makes it vitally important for India as it looks to ramp up its own manufacturing. “To boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China’s supply chain,” said the Indian government’s annual economic survey presented in parliament last year that recommended a strategy of focusing on foreign direct investment from China. This year’s survey notes that China’s manufacturing prowess, competitiveness and resources control have given it a level of strategic leverage that no single country has held in modern history.\n\nSuch open admiration for China is unthinkable in a country with historically adversarial relations dating back to the Sino-Indian border war of 1962. It’s also a significant course correction. In step with the US policy of containing China, India had after the 2020 border clashes turned the screws on Chinese investments and imports, restricted visas for Chinese executives, banned Chinese apps, and sent taxmen to raid Chinese telecoms companies operating in India. It didn’t work out too well. From textiles to electronics, the clampdown on Chinese imports only created losses for Indian businesses because of the dependence on Chinese supplies. Indian electronic manufacturers complained the clampdown had cost them US$15 billion in production losses and 100,000 jobs, and pleaded with the government to facilitate visas for Chinese engineers and executives.\nMeasures to punish China only ended up driving home its importance in India’s economy. The US-China decoupling was expected to squeeze Chinese exports and manufacturing, but China remains the world’s sole manufacturing superpower. Its production exceeds that of the nine next largest manufacturers combined, giving it unrivalled control over global supply chains.\nWhile supply chains are indeed moving away from China, so are Chinese manufacturers, themselves investing and setting up bases in countries that stand to benefit as friendshoring and nearshoring policies intensify in the West. As Eastern Europe benefits from firms shifting production closer to the European market, the biggest announcements of Chinese FDI in the past three years have been in Hungary and Serbia. In Asia, as Vietnam and Indonesia have emerged as the main beneficiaries of reduced US imports from China, both have seen Chinese FDI gushing in.\n\nChina’s edge in new technology, as revealed by the DeepSeek phenomenon, makes investments by Chinese companies all the more attractive to countries in the Global South. China now leads in 57 of the 64 technologies tracked by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank. Greenfield FDI by Chinese firms thus tripled last year to US$160 billion. Wrestling with jobless growth and high youth unemployment, India wants a piece of this Chinese action.\nAt about 6.5 per cent, India’s economy is growing at the slowest pace in four years and by some estimates, is in a structural slowdown, while this year’s government survey states that it needs to grow by around 8 per cent in real terms every year for at least a decade to achieve a sustained rise in living standards. The survey, considered a policy blueprint, stresses the need to “pull out all the stops” to attract more FDI.\nThe US continues to be the largest source of FDI in India, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to count on. India’s incoming FDI has slowed for a second year while outflows have picked up. America’s push to bring manufacturing home means it is itself competing with India in attracting FDI. With Trump, it will only get worse. While he was pressuring India to cut taxes on Harley-Davidson in his last term, he was also warning the luxury motorcycle manufacturer that it would be “taxed like never before” if it dared move production overseas. This time, he has already begun his new term by categorically warning businesses that they will have to accept high taxes if they do not make in America – leaving little room for Modi’s “Make in India” ambitions.\nAs the US FDI window closes, the case for Chinese FDI looks even more compelling for India. It has thus been clearing a flurry of Chinese investment proposals, making special allowances for Chinese businesses, and fast-tracking visas for Chinese executives.\nIndia’s change in attitude works to the advantage of China, which has been pursuing in earnest an Indian market that is just taking off while its own economy slows and reaches saturation. Persistently weak domestic demand and an ongoing crackdown on the key real-estate sector leaves China far less prepared for a trade war than it was the last time Trump started it.\nThe Indian economy is today the size of what the Chinese economy was in 2007 – a year before China held the Olympics as its coming out party. Chinese businesses are eager for a piece of the India action that’s coming – India is set to become the third largest economy by the end of this decade. A deeper engagement with India would be a major buffer for China against any US containment policy, not to mention the strategic implications of peace on the border with a nuclear power.\n\nIndia’s options\nTo be sure, neither is India suddenly the best of friends with China, nor does the US cease to be a critical ally. India enjoys a “strategic trade authorisation tier one” status that allows it to receive licence-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies from the US. The Indo-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology has led to collaborations on defence, space and artificial intelligence.\nThe US is also India’s largest military exercise partner, with ever-increasing interoperability between the two militaries. The 4.5 million Americans of Indian descent provide a bond that is difficult to quantify but an immensely powerful one. And, emerging transnational right-wing solidarities give Trump’s connection with India much deeper ideological roots than what his personal relationship with Modi might suggest.\nBut India, like China, is also among the emerging powers that are increasingly impatient with the West-centricity of the liberal international order and want to imbue global governing institutions with what they consider their own national values and interests. It is thus an ardent participant in groupings like Brics that seek a different set of rules of engagement and see this as their moment, as the liberal international order faces an unprecedented crisis of credibility in the aftermath of Gaza and Ukraine.\nIn India’s case, its restlessness with the status quo in the international order is exacerbated by friction with the US over its turn to illiberalism and its closeness to Russia, among many other things. They have also been bickering lately over the US Justice Department’s charges of fraud against tycoon Adani and allegations that the Indian government was involved in a murder-for-hire plot on American soil.\nThe Modi government finds America’s occasional chidings – even if performative – about its treatment of minorities intrusive and irksome. Having neutered India’s own democratic institutions like regulatory bodies and the media, it abhors being hauled up by independent US institutions, if not by the White House itself. With Trump returning to power, many of these sources of irritation will disappear. Trump is unlikely to be troubled by India’s relations with Russia, its backsliding democracy, or minority rights in the country.\nModi’s Hindu-supremacist politics dovetails neatly, in fact, with the US right-wing’s Islamophobia that Trump embodies. A right-wing reordering of the US establishment comes at an opportune time for Modi. This could well be Modi’s last term in office – he will be nearing 80 by the time of the next election – and he would want to secure his legacy by turbocharging his programme of dismantling India’s secular republic with a Hindu-first order. Modi has the best shot at this century-old Hindu-supremacist dream. None of his possible successors in the Hindu-right universe come anywhere close to his level of popularity and acceptability, despite a considerably dulled sheen after a decade in power.\n\nIn this potentially transformative moment for India, it is important for Modi that America plays along. In Trump, he has a US president who is unlikely to give him grief over domestic politics, but everything else is up in the air. In his last term, Trump had forced India to stop buying oil from Iran and singled out the country for trying to extract “billions and billions and billions” of dollars in foreign aid. Modi eventually established a rapport with Trump 1.0, even going to the extent of endorsing Trump for re-election in 2020 in breach of diplomatic convention. Trump 2.0 is a different beast. Normalising ties with China gives him a stronger hand navigating it.\nIt also protects India in the event of a highly unlikely, but not entirely impossible, scenario of a Sino-US grand bargain that would allow for a limited US retrenchment in Asia, leaving India in the lurch. Despite the obligatory tariff that Trump has imposed on China, the 10 per cent additional duty is far less than the 60 per cent he had promised in his manifesto. He has also generally been conciliatory towards China since winning the election, inviting President Xi Jinping to his inauguration and declaring his intent to visit the country soon. China has reciprocated with a calibrated retaliation that makes a point without hitting too hard, leaving the door wide open for negotiations.\nIt’s still early days in Trump 2.0 and all bets are off, but however it plays out, China and India have already started reshaping Asia by opening new pathways of deepening their relationship. And the world, if it leads to moving the epicentre of global trade to the East.","summary":"With Donald Trump back in the White House, India and China are forging a quiet detente that could have seismic implications.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297836/chindia-returns-india-and-china-prepare-trump-earthquake","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/07/1ef87816-9aa4-4578-899a-573d34518402_0fda13b5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-08 00:00:09","author":"Debasish Roy Chowdhury","authors":["Debasish Roy Chowdhury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":288247990,"title":"States ask judge to enforce order blocking Trump funding freeze","text":"Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia today asked a federal judge to enforce his order blocking U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration from freezing federal grants, loans and other funding.\n\nTheir emergency motion came the day after the states told U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island that the administration was not fully complying with the order and that billions of dollars in funding remained unavailable.\n\nMcConnell, an appointee of Democratic former president Barack Obama, ordered the administration to respond to the states’ motion by Sunday.

Earlier that afternoon, someone taped over the agency's name on a nearby sign and logos on the building's windows.Shortly before 2 p.m., a group of five construction workers were huddled outside the building. Two wore yellow harnesses. All of them had tape over a patch on their jacket. None would comment to Business Insider on who they worked for.Just after 2:30 p.m., a bucket crane hoisted one of the workers into the air and he began to pry the letters off the building before dropping them onto the crane. It eventually became a two-man job, taking around 15 minutes. Once the building was bare, the construction workers ripped open a plastic garbage bag and, fighting with the DC wind, taped it over the building's logo.This comes just days after the Trump administration moved to gut USAID — the government's foreign agency. The proposed cuts mean that the agency could be forced to drastically shrink its workforce from about 10,000 to 294 employees. The agency announced Tuesday that it will put staff on administrative leave beginning on Friday at 11:59 p.m., with exceptions to people with \"exceptional circumstances,\" per Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

They are taking legal action to prevent the proposed ban on federal support for transgender medical care from being implemented and enforced.\n\nThe legal challenge is against Executive Order 14187, which Trump designed to shield “Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation.” The order seeks to halt all federal financial assistance to facilities that offer pediatric gender transition services or any gender-affirming care for individuals below 19 years of age.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in their 36-page lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, take issue with the nomenclature employed by the 47th president in the order.\n\n“[T]hat title is false and repugnant,” the filing reads.\n\nLed by Washington Attorney General Nicholas Brown, a Democrat, the lawsuit requests both a temporary restraining order as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction over two sections of the order.\n\nThe first section targeted by the litigation is the funding provision.\n\nThe plaintiffs allege Trump’s threat to block funding for state-run medical institutions that continue to serve transgender children and teenagers is an “unconstitutional usurpation of the spending power of Congress, an unconstitutional effort to amend Congressional appropriations by attaching conditions not contemplated by Congress, and a violation of the separation of powers.”\n\nMoreover, the lawsuit argues, the practical import of clawing back already-allocated federal funds will have a substantial and negative impact on medical services entirely unrelated to transgender issues.\n\n“Absent an injunction, the Order will terminate over one billion dollars of federal funding to the Plaintiff States’ medical schools and hospitals that is used to research and treat hundreds of conditions having nothing to do with gender-affirming care, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes, substance use disorder, mental health conditions, autism, aging, cardiovascular diseases, maternal health, and so much more,” the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe second section the plaintiffs want the court to block is a law enforcement provision. This section mulls “weaponizing” a federal law against female genital mutilation — a practice largely occurring outside of the Americas — to threaten compliance with the administration’s anti-transgender medical care policy, according to the lawsuit.\n\nOn its own terms, the enforcement section anticipates using attorneys general “and other law enforcement officers to coordinate” the enforcement of the 1996 federal ban on female genital mutilation.\n\nTo hear the plaintiffs tell it, this section of the executive order “threatens baseless criminal prosecutions against providers” because “transgender minors do not receive gender-affirming genital surgery.”\n\n“The Executive Order attempts to redefine non-surgical treatments for minors as ‘mutilation,’ but this is frivolous,” the filing reads. “The statute has no possible bearing on gender-affirming care. Rather, the Order invokes it solely to sow fear among providers and bully them out of providing gender-affirming care at all.”\n\nTo be clear, genital surgery is not performed on transgender minors. But the Order threatens to weaponize this federal statute against puberty blocking medication and hormone therapy, which it defines as “chemical mutilation.” In doing so, the Order attempts to redefine these medically necessary treatments as federal crimes.\n\nIn public policy terms, the lawsuit takes issue with the executive order’s basic premise as well.\n\n“The Order purports to ‘protect’ youth, but the Order harms them,” the filing continues. “The Order has already, and will continue, to limit physicians’ ability to treat patients’ gender dysphoria, as well as the unavoidable, grave harm to the health and wellbeing of transgender youth if they are prohibited from receiving necessary medical care, including debilitating anxiety, severe depression, self-harm, and suicide that can accompany untreated dysphoria.”\n\nAnd, in a full-circle argument, the plaintiffs also criticize the Trump administration’s controversial use of new definitions — which are sourced from a previous executive order that set out the broad outlines of the GOP’s anti-transgender agenda.\n\nFrom the lawsuit at length:\n\nIt defines “sex” to mean “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female. ‘Sex’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘gender identity.’” It further defines “Gender Ideology” as a theory which asserted the “false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.” In so doing, the order attempts to define out of existence transgender and gender-diverse people, whose gender is not the sex they were assigned at birth. These definitions must “govern all Executive interpretation of and application of Federal law and administration policy.”\n\nThe complaint alleges three distinct causes of action.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the executive order violates the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law due to “mistreatment” of and “malice” toward transgender and “gender-diverse” individuals based on their status — which is a form of “unlawful” discrimination.\n\n“[The executive order] singles out for restriction and criminalization medical treatments that affirm a patient’s gender if inconsistent with that patient’s sex,” the filing reads.\n\nWashington, joined by Minnesota and Oregon — and three unnamed professors at the University of Washington School of Medicine — also allege a separation of powers violation. The lawsuit says Trump is attempting to “usurp” Congress’ “legislative powers and exclusive power of the purse” by conditioning federal funds on promises to “deny gender-affirming care to their patients under 19 years of age.”\n\n“None of the funds received by the Plaintiff States’ medical institutions have a congressionally authorized condition requiring them to refrain from the provision of gender-affirming care,” the lawsuit goes on. “In fact, federal law prohibits the Plaintiff States’ medical institutions from discriminating against individuals on the basis of their gender dysphoria for the purposes of participating in the services provided by these institutions and funded with federal financial assistance.”\n\nFinally, the plaintiffs allege a 10th Amendment violation for attempting to “seize” the states’ “historic police powers” in service of a federal regulation on the practice of medicine.\n\nThe case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Lauren King, a Joe Biden appointee. Activity on the docket has been swift and voluminous. As of this writing, the plaintiffs filed over 70 declarations from transgender patients, parents of such patients, and medical providers in support of their motion to stop the policy from taking effect; a list anticipates that nearly 120 such declarations will be filed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was held in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Legal action seeks to prevent Trump&#8217;s efforts to restrict transgender healthcare. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/legal-action-seeks-to-prevent-trumps-efforts-to-restrict-transgender-healthcare/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Lawsuit-aims-to-block-Trump-attack-on-transgender-medicine.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 23:59:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":288241764,"title":"Trump Revokes Biden’s Access To Classified Info","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday his administration is immediately revoking former President Joe Biden’s access to classified information, citing Biden’s decision to pull Trump’s access to national security details in 2021.\n\nTrump said Biden's clearance would be removed immediately.

I think I stopped the war.” He suggested that his 2016 election victory helped prevent conflict, adding, “I think if I wouldn't have won that particular election, you would have ended up in a very bad situation. But I did, and we had a good relationship.”\n\nTrump emphasized that his ability to engage with Kim was beneficial for global stability. “I think it's a very big asset for everybody that I do get along with him. I mean, I get along with him, he gets along with me, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing.”\n\nHe also noted that other countries, particularly Japan, see value in his diplomatic approach. “I can tell you that Japan likes the idea because their relationship is not very good with him [Kim Jong-un], and if I can have a relationship with not only him but other people throughout the world where there seem to be difficulties, I think it's a tremendous asset for the world, not just the United States.”\n\nTrump's diplomatic outreach to North Korea marked a significant shift in US foreign policy during his first term. After an initial period of heightened tensions in 2017, during which Trump referred to Kim as “Rocket Man” and threatened “fire and fury” if North Korea continued its nuclear ambitions, the two leaders later established an unprecedented dialogue.\n\nIn 2018, Trump and Kim met in Singapore for the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. The meeting resulted in a broad agreement on denuclearization, though specifics remained vague. A second summit in Hanoi in 2019 ended without a deal after disagreements over sanctions relief and North Korea's nuclear program. Later that year, Trump became the first US president to set foot in North Korea during a brief meeting with Kim at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).\n\nDespite the historic meetings, US-North Korea negotiations stalled, and Pyongyang continued missile testing. Trump's efforts to maintain a personal connection with Kim, including an exchange of letters, did not lead to a concrete denuclearization agreement. However, Trump has maintained that his direct diplomacy prevented a major conflict and could be revived in the future.","summary":"Diplomacy with Pyongyang is key to stability, according to US President Donald Trump \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/612363-us-north-korea-trump-kim/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67a696eb20302730f0595119.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 23:55:56","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":288242464,"title":"Donald Trump Revokes Joe Biden's Security Clearance: 'Joe, You're Fired'","text":"In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he is \"immediately\" revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance and halting his daily intelligence briefings.Trump's Friday night post stated, \"There is no need for Joe Biden to continue receiving access to classified information.

(AP) — States are absorbing substantial increases in health care costs for the poor, as they realize that the people remaining on Medicaid rolls after the COVID-19 pandemic are sicker than anticipated — and costlier to care for.\n\nThat amounts to a roughly 5% increase in overall state spending, mostly driven by the cost to care for unexpectedly sick people remaining on the state’s Medicaid rolls.\n\nCosts went up partly because some people put off medical treatment during the pandemic, Shapiro’s administration said. As a result, their conditions worsened and became costlier to treat.\n\n“The delays in health care access have had a significant impact on this population — a lack of access to general and specialty care; delayed procedures; avoidable hospital stays and emergency department visits; development of comorbidities; and a lack of preventative medicine as a whole,” Shapiro’s administration said.\n\nThe Alliance of Community Health Plans last fall asked the federal government to review Medicaid reimbursement rates in Pennsylvania and a handful of other states that it said were unrealistically low and relying on outdated claims data that showed a relatively healthier population of Medicaid enrollees.\n\nThe alliance’s members — typically nonprofit insurers that have hospital systems and state Medicaid contracts — in several states were “facing an existential threat” from low reimbursement rates, said Dan Jones, the alliance’s senior vice president for federal affairs.\n\nAnalysts say that pandemic-era protections that prevented states from disenrolling people from Medicaid had helped to cloak the relative sickness of those who would remain enrolled after states began reevaluating recipients’ eligibility.\n\nFederal pandemic aid ended just as the average cost per recipient began rising.\n\n“Over the course of last year, I heard that from states and from Medicaid directors and others that they were worried about it,” said Edwin Park, a research professor for the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nAll states are seeing higher-than-expected per-Medicaid beneficiary costs, Park said.\n\nSurveys from KFF last fall found that most responding states expected a Medicaid budget shortfall — a big change from prior surveys — and that most states reported seeking federal approval to increase reimbursement rates because enrollees were sicker than anticipated.\n\nIn Indiana, lawmakers last year imposed cutbacks after the state found that it had underestimated its Medicaid costs by nearly $1 billion.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the $2.5 billion projected Medicaid cost increase will be a big pill to swallow in a state with a slow-growing economy and a shrinking workforce that is delivering relatively meager gains in tax collections.\n\nTax collections are projected to rise by less than $800 million in the 2025-26 fiscal year, and Republican lawmakers are wary about spending down the state’s roughly $10.5 billion surplus for fear of depleting it within a few years.\n\nPennsylvania’s Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Scott Martin, R-Lancaster, said the pandemic amounted to a “pause button” on improving the efficiency of the state’s Medicaid program because billions in federal aid helped pay for it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first administration reshaped Medicaid by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients. Martin said he’ll be interested to see whether the new Trump administration will give states more flexibility to put cost-saving limits on the program.\n\n“These are big chunks of the budget that have impacts on your ability to do everything else on both sides, the federal side and the state side,” Martin said.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at: https://x.com/timelywriter","summary":"Costs went up partly because some people put off medical treatment during the pandemic.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/02/07/state-medicaid-increases/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Pennsylvania_Budget_81639_b97ecf.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-07 23:52:30","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.426}]}
