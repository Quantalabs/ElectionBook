I want us to be fighting for the most vulnerable, fighting for the unborn.\"That's what we should prioritize and that's obviously what Senator Hawley is doing as a man of faith. You have to vote for whoever is going to be the most pro-life. We have to be prayerful man to put God first and I think that's what is going to be best for our country.\"Butker was able to attend the political event during the Chiefs' bye week. Hawley is a United States senator from Missouri, but is seeking another term in Congress.Along with Trump, Hawley will also be on the Nov. 5 ballot. The incumbent is a constitutional conservative who fights for religious liberty.Butker's endorsement for Trump is because of the former president's pro-life record. The Chiefs kicker is an outspoken athlete that stands firm on his Catholic values.This isn't the first time Butker has made headlines for his political comments. The 29-year-old delivered the commencement speech at Benedictine College that sparked much controversy.Some of his most viral comments from the speech included his opinion on a woman's place in society.\"I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\" he said, and added: \"Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\"Since then, Butker has been labeled as a polarizing figure. However, the three-time Super Bowl Champion defended his controversial comments in August.\"I was really curious as to what people would be saying back to me and I respected all the viewpoints,\" Butker said. \"But in terms of what I said, I prayed about it and I thought about it and I was very intentional with what I said. I stand behind what I said. If people knew me as a person and understood that I was coming from a place of love, not a place of trying to attack of put people down, I only want the best for people. That's what I was trying to say there and I think the people that were in that gymnasium all understood what I was saying.\"Butker isn't the first athlete to endorse a presidential candidate. Kamala Harris and her campaign have created the initiative \"Athletes for Harris\", which has been supported by Magic Johnson and Emmitt Smith.For more NFL news, visit Newsweek Sports.","summary":"Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker officially endorsed Donald Trump Thursday at a Josh Hawley for Senate event.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/chiefs-star-endorses-donald-trump-president-1968003","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493928/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:18:55","author":"Valentina Martinez","authors":["Valentina Martinez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.283},{"id":259389274,"title":"Donald Trump's Colorado Crowd Size Compared to Kamala Harris' Arizona Rally","text":"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris held similarly-sized campaign rallies this week in Colorado and Arizona.Trump, this year's Republican nominee for president, appeared in front of a packed crowd at the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center in Aurora, Colorado, on Friday. Harris, the Democratic nominee, greeted supporters at the Rawhide Event Center in Chandler, Arizona, on Thursday.Both venues list capacities of up to 10,000. The Trump campaign said that free tickets for the event in the Denver suburb were sold out, according to The Denver Post, although it was unclear how many tickets were available. Organizers of the Phoenix-area event said that around 7,000 Harris supporters attended, according to The Arizona Republic.Images shared to social media of each rally showed what appeared to be similar crowd sizes. Spectrum News DC reporter Taylor Popielarz remarked that the Trump crowd was \"one of the largest I've seen in recent months\" while sharing images and video of the event on Friday to X, formerly Twitter.\"Listen to this crowd in Aurora, CO!!!\" Trump campaign staffer Margo Martin wrote on X while sharing a video of the crowd greeting the former president. \"They want TRUMP back!\"Meanwhile, Bianca Buono, a reporter for Arizona NBC affiliate KPNX, shared videos of the Harris rally on Thursday that showed what looked like an equally enthusiastic welcome for the vice president.Harris supporters attended the event despite a sweltering 105-degree heat wave. Washington Post reporter Dylan Wells noted on X that there were \"lots of calls for medics\" due to attendees passing out, while one rallygoer was spotted \"throwing up near the press pen.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email on Friday evening.If the Trump event was fully at capacity, and the Harris rally attendance figures are accurate, around 3,000 more people may have attended the former president's rally.However, Trump and his campaign frequently boast about rally crowd sizes and the ex-president has previously artificially inflated attendance numbers, sometimes even beyond the capacity of venues.Well-attended Harris campaign rallies seemingly prompted the former president to make false claims about the Democratic ticket using artificial intelligence to fake large crowd sizes in August.Harris continued campaigning on Friday in Arizona, one of at least seven battleground states that could prove critical to either candidate in November. According to an average of recent polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight, Trump had a 1.4 percent lead over Harris in Arizona at the time of publication.Colorado is not considered a battleground, with a number of recent polls showing the vice president ahead of Trump in the state by double digits. Trump is set to appear at another rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday. President Joe Biden won California by nearly 30 percentage points in 2020.","summary":"Trump held a rally in solidly blue Colorado this week, while Harris focused her attention on swing state Arizona.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-colorado-crowd-size-compared-kamala-harris-arizona-rally-1967959","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493925/arizona-colorado-trump-harris-rally-crowd-comparison.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:01:12","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":259389778,"title":"Bầu cử Mỹ 2024: Cựu Tổng thống Obama vận động cho ứng cử viên Harris tại Pennsylvania","text":"Dự báo cách EU phản ứng với kết quả bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ\n\n Cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ năm 2024 đang tạo ra nhiều thay đổi quan trọng với tác động lớn đến toàn cầu, đặc biệt là châu Âu. \n\nBất kể kết quả bầu cử ra sao, lợi ích của châu Âu không hoàn toàn đồng điệu với Washington. \n\n Cờ Liên minh châu Âu tại trụ sở Ủy ban châu Âu ở Brussels, Bỉ. Ảnh: THX/TTXVN\n\nNhận định với tờ Politico châu Âu (Politico.eu) mới đây, ông Jrg Rocholl, Hiệu trưởng của Trường Quản lý và Công nghệ châu Âu tại Berlin (Đức), cho rằng cuộc bầu cử tổng thống Mỹ năm 2024, chỉ còn chưa đầy 2 tháng nữa, đang diễn ra với nhiều thay đổi quan trọng và kết quả sẽ có tác động toàn cầu, đặc biệt là đối với EU. Tuy nhiên, bất kể kết quả là gì, lợi ích của EU không hoàn toàn phù hợp với lợi ích của Washington và đã đến lúc EU cần nhận ra để phản ứng phù hợp trước những thay đổi chiến lược từ Mỹ.\n\nDù ai thắng cử, Mỹ đang tiếp tục chuyển trọng tâm chiến lược sang khu vực Ấn Độ Dương - Thái Bình Dương. Chính sách này đã bắt đầu từ thời cựu Tổng thống Obama và tiếp tục dưới thời Donald Trump và Joe Biden.\n\nNgoài vấn đề chiến lược, Mỹ cũng đang chuyển dịch sang các chính sách kinh tế mang tính bảo hộ, như Đạo luật Giảm lạm phát (IRA) và duy trì thuế quan đối với thép và nhôm từ thời chính quyền của ông Trump. Điều này đã gây ra căng thẳng kinh tế với châu Âu, đặc biệt khi chính quyền của ông Biden không mở rộng các khoản ưu đãi với xe điện cho các nhà sản xuất châu Âu. Nếu ứng cử viên tổng thống Kamala Harris đắc cử, chính sách kinh tế của bà nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục theo hướng này, dẫn đến cạnh tranh kinh tế ngày càng gay gắt giữa hai bờ Đại Tây Dương.\n\nThay vì hy vọng vào một kết quả bầu cử có lợi, EU cần xác định và hành động theo những mục tiêu chiến lược riêng để duy trì tự chủ và bảo vệ lợi ích dài hạn. Các biện pháp quan trọng mà châu Âu cần triển khai bao gồm:\n\n Thứ nhất, tăng chi tiêu quốc phòng và hợp tác nội khối: EU cần tăng cường chi tiêu cho an ninh và quốc phòng để củng cố năng lực tự vệ và đảm bảo rằng Mỹ sẽ tiếp tục hỗ trợ khi cần thiết. Việc tăng cường hợp tác giữa các quốc gia châu Âu có nền công nghiệp quốc phòng mạnh sẽ giúp EU xây dựng một hệ thống quốc phòng tự chủ hơn, đồng thời thúc đẩy tăng trưởng kinh tế và đổi mới trong khu vực dân sự.\n\n Thứ hai, phát triển thị trường vốn và củng cố đồng euro: EU cần xây dựng các thị trường vốn mạnh hơn và củng cố vị thế của đồng euro như một loại tiề.n tệ dự trữ toàn cầu. Việc này sẽ giúp cải thiện khả năng tài trợ cho các dự án đổi mới và tăng trưởng ở châu Âu, đồng thời tăng cường tính tự chủ và độc lập chiến lược của khu vực.\n\n Thứ ba, đàm phán các thỏa thuận thương mại toàn diện: EU cần tích cực thúc đẩy các thỏa thuận thương mại với các khu vực khác để giảm phụ thuộc vào Mỹ. Sự thất bại của Hiệp định Đối tác Thương mại và Đầu tư xuyên Đại Tây Dương (TTIP) là một bài học quý giá. EU cần tránh lặp lại sai lầm này với các khu vực như Mỹ Latinh và châu Phi, đặc biệt là với thỏa thuận Mercosur.\n\nDù vậy, Mỹ vẫn là đồng minh quan trọng nhất của châu Âu, đặc biệt trong lĩnh vực an ninh và thông qua NATO. Nhưng điều này không có nghĩa là lợi ích của hai bên hoàn toàn phù hợp. Do đó, EU cần thừa nhận rằng những thay đổi chiến lược của Mỹ không chỉ là tạm thời mà là một xu hướng dài hạn, đòi hỏi khối phải xây dựng một chiến lược độc lập và phù hợp hơn để bảo vệ lợi ích của mình.\n\nCó thể nói đã đến lúc EU ngừng đặt hy vọng vào kết quả cuộc bầu cử ở Mỹ và bắt đầu hành động quyết liệt để xây dựng sức mạnh chiến lược và kinh tế độc lập. Điều đó không chỉ giúp châu Âu duy trì được sự tự chủ mà còn bảo đảm rằng EU có thể đối mặt với những thách thức quốc tế một cách tự tin và kiên định.","summary":"Thanh niên là một trong những nhóm đối tượng mà chiến dịch vận động tranh cử của bà Harris nhắm đến với hy vọng có thể góp phần đưa bà đến chiến thắng.","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/bau-cu-my-2024-cuu-tong-thong-obama-van-dong-cho-ung-cu-vien-harris-tai-pennsylvania-20241012i7290215/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2024/10/4/bau-cu-my-2024-cuu-tong-thong-obama-van-dong-cho-ung-cu-vien-harris-tai-pennsylvania-600x432-cdc-7290215.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:00:38","author":"Nguyễn Viễn","authors":["Nguyễn Viễn"],"language":"en","category":"technology","source_country":"vn","sentiment":0.243},{"id":259389280,"title":"Walz Rips Trump’s Chinese Bibles and Trump Gets Militaristic","text":"Welcome to October Surprise, the Daily Beast’s daily countdown to the biggest election of our lifetime.

The event featured Trump and his running mate JD Vance, where Patrick confirmed her alignment with their politics.Danica Patrick, who has been vocal in her support for the 45th President, explained the sense of urgency she feels this election cycle.\"I just want to say I've never voted before, but this time around, I have to vote. It's that important.\" Initially, Patrick had endorsed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but ultimately shifted her support to Trump, citing her belief in his policies. This move was significant enough for Vance to seek clarification, humorously asking, \"I just want to be clear, I want to get on record — you're voting for us, right?\" To which Patrick emphatically replied, \"1,000 percent.\"Her endorsement of Trump appears to be heavily influenced by her admiration for his experience in business.\"The person that runs this country should ultimately be running it very much like a business. I can't really think of a better businessman than Donald Trump,\" Patrick said. \"A guy like that who has been in business as long as he has, he's gonna go into that room and he's gonna get stuff done. That's what we need, a president who is actually going to make changes happen.\"Patrick also remarked on Trump's previous term's exposure of alleged \"fake news\".\"I think that Trump did a really good job of letting us know that there is such a thing as fake news,\" she said.Beyond the political sphere, Danica Patrick's life has been defined by her pioneering role in motorsports. Born in Beloit, Wisconsin, she began racing go-karts at age 10, and by her late teens, she was competing internationally. She returned to the U.S. in the early 2000s and made history in IndyCar racing. Patrick's move to NASCAR in 2010 marked another milestone, during which she became the first woman to win the pole at the Daytona 500.As a public figure, Patrick has leveraged her platform to promote active civic engagement. At the Hamilton County Republican Fall Dinner, she encouraged first-time voters to do so. \"It's a matter of doing that and helping people understand how to do it - especially getting people who have never voted before.\"Donald Trump, who served as the 45th President from 2017 to 2021, is known as a polarizing figure with a background in business. By aligning with his renewed bid for office, Patrick is endorsing a return to what she sees as effective governance through business-like management of the country's affairs.JD Vance, Trump's running mate, brings his own distinct profile to the campaign. He is the author of the bestselling memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and currently serves as a U.S. Senator from Ohio.\"First rodeo is always a little difficult. I think this second rodeo, he would be able to make an insane difference,\" Patrick predicted.","summary":"Former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick reveals she will vote for the first time in 2024, endorsing Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/racing/former-nascar-driver-danica-patricks-bombshell-admission-ive-never-voted-1967992","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493931/danica-patrick.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-12 00:00:01","author":"Alex Harrington","authors":["Alex Harrington"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.302},{"id":259389688,"title":"California rejects further SpaceX rocket launches after Musk’s ‘aggressive’ presidential race involvement","text":"State officials have rejected SpaceX’s plans to launch further rockets in California, after Elon Musk’s recent “aggressive” insertion into the US presidential race.\n\nQuestions have been raised as to whether actions by the space exploration company, owned by Musk, should be considered federal or private activity.\n\nThe plan to increase the number of SpaceX rocket launches to up to 50 a year was rejected by the California Coastal Commission on Thursday, with some officials citing Musk’s incredibly political posts on his social media platform X.\n\n“We’re dealing with a company, the head of which has aggressively injected himself into the presidential race,” commission Chair Caryl Hart said.\n\n“This company (SpaceX) is owned by the richest person in the world with direct control of what could be the most expansive communications system on the planet,” Commissioner Mike Wilson said. “Just last week that person was talking about political retribution.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Musk’s involvement in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign has become more stark. He has been overtly in favor of the former president on his “free speech” platform X, and appeared at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on October 5 where he addressed Trump supporters.\n\nHe has also jumped on Trump bandwagon of attacking the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over its response to devastation caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in Florida – peddling conspiracies that federal funds are being used on illegal immigrants instead of flood victims.\n\n“Elon Musk is hopping about the country, spewing and tweeting political falsehoods and attacking FEMA while claiming his desire to help hurricane victims with free Starlink access to the internet,” Commissioner Gretchen Newsom said.\n\nMembers of the commission also lauded military officials for their work to reach an agreement about further launches, following assurances that steps would be taken to mitigate damage to local wildlife, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nHowever they added their main concern is that it should be SpaceX representatives who appear before the commission to obtain permits for the company’s growing rocket program, not military officials.\n\n“It is essential that SpaceX apply for a [Coastal Development Permit],” Hart said. “We’re going to hit a wall here.”\n\nThe Independent has contacted SpaceX for comment on the decision by the California Coastal Commission.","summary":"Questions have been raised as to whether actions by the space exploration company, owned by Musk, should be considered federal or private activity","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/spacex-launch-elon-musk-us-election-california-b2628129.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/09/20/GettyImages-2176083179.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wCzFEj0w-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:44:43","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.056},{"id":259388684,"title":"Biden ordered Trump to be protected as a ‘sitting president’","text":"Former President Donald Trump's campaign has requested additional resources, including military aircraft, to protect the Republican candidate in the final weeks before the election. President Joe Biden promised to provide everything needed, “as long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s.”\n\nFollowing two assassination attempts against Trump in recent months, his campaign has been in contact with the White House and the Secret Service to request military assets for added protection, according to multiple US media reports on Friday.\n\nPresident Biden stated that he had ordered his administration to provide Trump “all that he needs” when asked about these reports.\n\n”As long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s,” he told reporters, before adding that he “was being facetious.”\n\n“Look, I’ve instructed the department to give him every – every single thing he needs for his... as if he were a sitting president. Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But if it doesn’t, he shouldn’t,” the US leader explained.\n\nThe request for military assets includes aircraft and vehicles to transport Trump between campaign events and expanded flight restrictions over his homes and rallies. However, reports from the New York Times, Washington Post, and CNN did not mention whether the Republican campaign sought fighter jet escorts.\n\nTrump's presidential rival, Kamala Harris, receives protection from the US Marines as Vice President and travels on a US military aircraft designated as Air Force Two.\n\nThe Secret Service, responsible for protecting presidential candidates, confirmed that it received requests for increased protection but did not disclose details. “The former president is receiving the highest levels of protection,” said a representative for the agency, noting that the Secret Service would continue to adjust its protective posture as needed to address evolving threats.\n\nThe agency faced criticism after the first assassination attempt against Trump in July, which resulted in the resignation of its director. Since then, it has increased its defensive measures for Trump, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, counter-drone technology, and other protective and surveillance systems.\n\nLast month, Trump claimed there are “big threats” to his life from Iran after he and his team met with representatives from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The agency declined to disclose details of the meeting, although the Trump campaign stated it focused on “real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the US.”\n\nTrump narrowly escaped death on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a 20-year-old man fired shots from a rooftop, grazing Trump’s ear and killing one audience member. The would-be assassin, Thomas M. Crooks, was killed by the US Secret Service, and his body was quickly cremated; his social media accounts have since been scrubbed.\n\nAnother would-be assassin, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, was arrested by the Secret Service on September 15 after being spotted near a Trump-owned golf course in Florida, apparently attempting to take a shot. Routh, a convicted felon, spent much of the past three years in Ukraine, claiming to various Western media outlets that he was fundraising and recruiting for Kiev’s war effort.\n\nThe FBI is investigating both incidents as attempted assassinations, but authorities have yet to provide any information about possible motives and have not revealed any evidence linking to an Iranian plot.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump’s campaign has requested additional resources, including military aircraft, to protect him ahead of election \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/605595-trump-us-military-aircraft-protection/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.10/article/6709b80e2030272b9062b27c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:44:37","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":259388694,"title":"How Arizona voters view the divisive issue of immigration","text":"Phoenix, Arizona — Aureliano Dominguez has run his hot dog stand along a busy Phoenix street for 33 years.

According to a CBS News poll taken in May, 52% of Arizona voters said recent immigrants from Mexico and Latin America had made life in Arizona worse, compared to 35% of voters when asked the same question in July of 2020. And how Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris answer those concerns is sharply different.Trump — who has spread false stories about immigrant-fueled crime and described immigrants in derogatory terms — has promised to use the military to expel 11 million undocumented immigrants.\"Those people have to be taken out and brought back to the country from where they came,\" Trump said in a Sept. 27 speech.A CBS News poll last month found that 53% of voters are in favor of Trump's plan, with 47% against it. Harris, who wants greater funding for border security and a legal pathway to citizenship for some undocumented migrants, has denounced Trump's plan. \"How is that going to happen?\" Harris asked while speaking at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 18. \"Massive raids? Massive detention camps? What are they talking about?\"Republican rancher and Trump supporter John Ladd echoed that. \"How are you going to round up 20 million people?\" Ladd asked.But Ladd favors a get-tough approach to immigration. He sees people illegally cross the border every day onto his 16,000-acre ranch.\"This is mine,\" Ladd said of his land. \"This is my privacy. This is America. Don't mess with me.\"Still, he believes law-abiding immigrants deserve to stay. \"If they've been here and they're productive, there should be some consideration,\" Ladd said. Dominguez, meanwhile, is still considering his vote.

Melania credits her parents for giving her a \"beautiful\" childhood and said she was too young at the time to know the darker parts of the communist society she grew up in, but added that Barron's life in America was different from hers as a kid.\"I'm sure he will be different, because his life will be different,\" Melania told Marc Beckman, host of Some Future Day podcast. \"It will be a different way of growing up than the way he does now. It's the influence of the community, the influence of the family and teachers around you. So, of course, yes, I think it's very important in what culture and which community you're growing up.\"Barron has maintained a relatively private life compared to his siblings, with his parents emphasizing their desire to shield him from the public spotlight. Former President Donald Trump has praised him for getting good grades in school and being a great kid. Barron started college at New York University in August after an appearance at his father's rally sparked speculation he might go into politics.In the 80s, when Melania was growing up, Slovenia was part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a communist state led by Josip Broz Tito until his death in 1980. Slovenia, the wealthiest and most industrialized of Yugoslavia's republics, experienced relative economic stability and greater openness compared to other Eastern Bloc countries.However, it was still under a one-party system, with limited political freedoms and heavy government control. As the decade progressed, growing nationalistic sentiments and economic struggles began to challenge the unity of Yugoslavia, setting the stage for Slovenia's eventual push for independence in 1991.\"I didn't feel it because I had a beautiful childhood, and when you're that age, you don't really know anything better,\" Melania said. \"You just have a childhood, you leave, you go to school, you go to the classes, you play sports, you spend time with the family, and that is all. You don't know what's really going on in the country.\"She shared as a teenager, she became fascinated with MTV when it launched in 1981. A fan of Pink Floyd, then and now, she recalled playing their albums on her record player.Melania moved to the United States in 1996 to pursue a career in modeling. She became a U.S. citizen on July 28, 2006. She had obtained a green card through the EB-1 visa program in 2001, often referred to as the \"Einstein visa,\" which is reserved for individuals with extraordinary ability in fields such as arts, sciences or business.In an interview with Fox News, Melania said her mother moved to the United States from Slovenia to be closer to Barron, likening her to a \"second mother\" for him.Do you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

Tons of brand new stuff is out, plus we have a lot of shows currently airing that I am trying my best to keep up with. Even with several of those now over, I’m still juggling so many series it’s a bit of a trick—not that I’m complaining. At least now that The Rings Of Power has ended, I can shift focus to all the new stuff that just dropped. Two other shows just ended as well, but I’ll talk about their season finales down below.\n\nEvery week I scour the internet for the best new movies, shows, cartoons, documentaries and whatever else I can find and post them in this weekend streaming guide. I don’t always find everything, so always feel free to share tips and recommendations with me on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. I also tend to include at least one theatrical release a week because I love going to the movies.\n\nOne last note: A lot of the streaming guides you find online don’t editorialize. But I will generally include my thoughts and opinions and often link to review scores because I think that’s more useful, even if you don’t always agree with my takes. I am a critic, after all. I also link to any reviews or pieces I’ve written about the shows and movies on my list, and you can always follow me on this blog as well to stay up-to-date on all my reviews.\n\nCheck out last weekend’s streaming guide right here:\n\nForbesWhat To Watch This Weekend: New Streaming TV Shows And Movies On Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Apple TV, Disney+ And MoreBy Erik Kain\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWhy You Missed The Northern Lights Last Night (And How To See Them Next Time)\n\nNorthern Lights Tonight? No, But A Second Once-In-A-Lifetime View Is Possible\n\nMicrosoft Warns Millions Of Windows Users—Change Your Browser As New Attacks Underway\n\nAlright, let’s dive right in!\n\nNew Shows And Movies\n\nDisclaimer (Apple TV)\n\nCate Blanchett and Kevin Kline star in this psychological thriller created by Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón, who has written some great scripts for movies like Gravity, Pan’s Labyrinth and Children of Men. The show is based on the novel by Renée Knight and follows journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) as a mysterious novel threatens to upend her entire life. Sacha Baron Cohen also stars. It looks dark and pretty wild. The seven-part limited series streams Fridays on Apple TV beginning today.\n\nOuter Banks Season 4 (Netflix)\n\nI admit, I’ve never watched a single episode of Outer Banks but it’s popular enough to have a fourth season on Netflix, which is no small thing. I read a summary of what this season was about and I was too confused to really dig deeper, but it’s out now!\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend Of Lara Croft (Netflix)\n\nThe new animated Tomb Raider series stars Hailey Atwell as Lara Croft and certainly looks great, but my colleague Paul Tassi isn’t blown away, calling it “fine.” That sounds like a fitting word, given its 67%/59% Rotten Tomatoes critic/audience split. Still, if you’re a fan of the games and movies this might be a fun enough escape into the world of Lara Croft and her adventures.\n\nTwilight Of The Gods (Netflix)\n\nI was shocked at how much I enjoyed the first couple episodes of Twilight Of The Gods, the new animated Norse-mythology based Zack Snyder series. As a rule, I generally dislike Snyder’s films and I was expecting to dislike this show also. It’s . . . actually really good, and very violent and there’s a bunch of sex and nudity, so please don’t watch this with your kids. I haven’t finished the show yet, but I like where it’s headed.\n\nSweetpea (Starz)\n\nI’m a huge Ella Purnell fan, but most of the stuff I’ve seen her in has been American. She was so good in Yellowjackets (which is now on Netflix, and I think you need to watch it) and in Fallout that I honestly forgot she was British. Now, her actual accent comes out in this very dark new series about a “normal” young woman who suddenly finds herself a killer—and likes it. The first episode is out now on Starz, with new episodes landing every Friday.\n\nTeacup (Peacock)\n\nA reader turned me onto this before I even started writing this guide, and after watching the very creepy, very scary trailer I can see why they might send me the tip. This looks right up my alley. Like Sweetpea, the show’s name might throw some people off. They both sound so . . . gentle and nice. Teacups and sweetpeas, like we’re having a little break out on the patio on a warm summer day. Well, watch the trailer and you’ll see this show looks freaky as hell—and might pair nicely with something like FROM (see below). I’ll give both of these a watch soon and report back. It looks like the entire season is out now on Peacock.\n\nCitadel: Diana (Prime Video)\n\nI can’t say that I’m really looking forward to Citadel: Diana, both because the flagship Citadel on Amazon was pretty bad (I only watched two episodes before calling it) and because it’s Italian and I just can’t stand Italian TV shows. That’s a joke! That last part is a joke. This is actually faring well with critics—83% on RT compared to Citadel’s 51%. Maybe a new hero and a new setting is just what this franchise needs.\n\nThe Apprentice (In Theaters)\n\nThe Home Alone 2 prequel we’ve all been waiting for is here at last! I have wanted Sebastian Stan to play an older Luke Skywalker for ages now. He’d be perfect. Instead, Stan is now a young Donald Trump and I’m honestly not sure how to feel about it. The Apprentice has a 77% Rotten Tomatoes score, and frankly it looks pretty good. I’m just not sure I can take any more politics at this point!\n\nTerrifier 3 (In Theaters)\n\nThe freaky-as-hell looking Terrifier 3 also has a 77% on Rotten Tomatoes, though audiences are giving it a whopping 94% which is crazy high for a horror flick. I am . . . not a huge horror movie guy despite liking scary stuff (mostly) so I’ve never seen the first two films. But this is exactly what people ought to be watching in the lead-up to Halloween.\n\nThat’s the new stuff, now let’s check out the many series currently streaming, many of which I’m writing about here on this blog.\n\nOngoing Shows\n\nThe Legend Of Vox Machina Season 3 (Prime Video)\n\nWe’re six episodes deep into The Legend Of Vox Machina’s third season. So far, it’s exactly what I hoped for—hilarious, exciting fantasy that’s way, way better than Amazon’s other big genre show, The Rings Of Power. It’s a lot of fun, and the fantastic cast and wonderful animation makes it a must-watch in my book. You can check out my interviews with the cast right here. Three new episodes are available every Thursday on Prime Video.\n\nThe Franchise (HBO)\n\nI’ve only watched the first episode of HBO’s new comedy series The Franchise but I enjoyed what I saw, and the cast is superb. It’s basically a show about the cast and crew of a big superhero movie, spoofing Hollywood and the MCU—in a decidedly different way than The Boys. New episodes are out Sundays.\n\nDaryl Dixon Season 2 — The Book Of Carol (AMC)\n\nI’ve had middling hopes for the Norman Reedus / Melissa McBride-led second season of Daryl Dixon, but so far it’s just dragging out every annoying The Walking Dead trope imaginable, and I’m having a hard time enjoying it because of all the ridiculous writing choices. You can read my review of the second episode right here. New episodes drop Sundays on AMC.\n\nAgatha All Along (Disney+)\n\nI’ve been unsure about Agatha All Along since it was announced, and even last week I was wondering if it would be a worthy successor to WandaVision, my favorite (along with Loki) of the Disney+ MCU shows. Well, Episode 5 was quite good with a really cool character reveal, and I’m feeling pretty optimistic (and pleasantly surprised) about this witchy tale. Kathryn Hahn and Aubrey Plaza are both terrific fun, so that helps. Read my review of Episode 5 here. New episodes come to Disney+ every Wednesday.\n\nThe Penguin (HBO / Max)\n\nI haven’t written about this show in a bit, and I’m actually one episode behind, but so far it’s been a really solid mobster series that’s really more Sopranos than Batman (though comparisons to the HBO classic are often greatly exaggerated—Sopranos is one of the greatest shows ever made, and even a strong performance from Colin Farrell can’t make this show live up to that greatness). You can read my review of the season premiere here. New episodes stream every Sunday.\n\nFROM Season 3 (MGM+)\n\nI’m enjoying FROM so much that I did something I haven’t done with any show in a long time: I watched ahead with my screeners. I finished Episode 3 (my review) and couldn’t stop. So I’ve watched the next few and I’ll have to watch each of them again, but I can safely say that this season is the best one yet. Still not perfect, but so good. The show follows a group of lost travelers stuck in a nightmarish town trying to figure out its mysteries and survive the many horrors thrown at them. It’s very much like LOST but with horror elements. I sure hope it ends better. New episodes stream Sundays on MGM+ (but Season 1 is available on Prime Video).\n\nSlow Horses Season 4 (Apple TV+)\n\nSlow Horses has finally wrapped up its fourth season, and I think I’m not alone when I say that the British spy show has never been better. Gary Oldman and Jack Lowden and the rest of the cast really brought their A-game this season, but so did the writers and producers and directors. This was a terrific season and I’m just sad we have to wait however long for Season 5. Six episodes just fly by! If you haven’t watched Slow Horses yet, please do yourself a favor and get on it! You can read my review of the truly phenomenal season finale here.\n\nOnly Murders In The Building Season 4 (Hulu)\n\nI love Only Murders In The Building and I’m sad that I’m a bit behind in writing about just how great it is in its fourth season, which really does a great job at recapturing the magic of the first. It’s a huge step up from Seasons 2 and 3, that’s for sure. This time around Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez are joined by the most star-studded cast yet, but what really makes it work is the great mystery(ies). We’re almost at the end, and I’m both excited to get answers and sad that there are only three episodes left. Read my latest review of the season here. New episodes land on Hulu on Tuesdays.\n\nBad Monkey (Apple TV)\n\nBad Monkey wrapped up its first season the same night that Slow Horses ended its fourth. Both shows had such terrific finales, it was a bit of an emotional viewing experience watching them back-to-back. I genuinely fell in love with this show and maybe a little bit with Natalie Martinez who plays Rosa. Vince Vaughn also surprised the hell out of me, turning in what has become my favorite of his performances, even over Dodgeball. You can read my season finale review here.\n\nI know I don’t always review everything I watch or say that I’ll review, but I’m doing a pretty decent job keeping up with everything these days. I’m patting myself, who cares?\n\nThat’s a wrap, folks. Let me know if I missed anything!\n\nFurther Reading From Yours Truly\n\nThe latest defense of The Rings Of Power would make Sauron proud.\n\nThe final scene from The Rings Of Power Season 2 is hilarious without music.\n\nRead my review of the new Arthurian novel The Bright Sword here.\n\nCheck out last weekend’s streaming guide for more great shows and movies!\n\nWhat are you watching these days?

JD Vance, R-Ohio, will still not say whether his running mate won or lost the last race for the White House.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times that will be published Saturday, Vance repeatedly refused to acknowledge former President Donald Trump’s defeat and went to even greater lengths to avoid doing so than he did during the vice presidential debate this month.\n\nWhen asked about the previous election during an interview with Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a host of “The Interview,” a Times podcast, the Republican vice presidential nominee responded that he was “focused on the future.” It was the same phrase he used to evade the same question during his debate with his Democratic rival, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\n“There’s an obsession here with focusing on 2020,” Vance said. “I’m much more worried about what happened after 2020, which is a wide-open border, groceries that are unaffordable.”\n\nWhen pressed a second time, Vance pivoted to a complicated counterargument: He suggested Trump would have won more votes in 2020 had social media companies not limited posts about a New York Post story about the contents of a laptop that belonged to Hunter Biden. Trump allies had maintained that documents on the laptop linked President Joe Biden to corrupt business dealings, but those claims were unfounded.\n\n“Sen. Vance, I’m going to ask you again,” Garcia-Navarro said. “Did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?”\n\n“Did big technology companies censor a story that independent studies have suggested would have cost Trump millions of votes?” Vance replied.\n\n“Sen. Vance,” Garcia-Navarro continued. “I’m going to ask you again, did Donald Trump lose the 2020 election?”\n\n“And I’ve answered your question with another question,” Vance said. “You answer my question and I’ll answer yours.”\n\nOn her fifth request for a yes-or-no answer, Garcia-Navarro pointed out that there was “no proof, legal or otherwise,” of election fraud.\n\nVance dismissed that as “a slogan.”\n\n“I’m not worried about this slogan that people throw, ‘Well, every court case went this way,’” Vance said. “I’m talking about something very discrete — a problem of censorship in this country that I do think affected things in 2020.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"Heading into the final three weeks of the 2024 election, Sen.

But Trump and his allies and right-wing legal groups want to interpret the law more broadly — by expanding the definition of “invasion” and “predatory incursion” to mean border crossings, and for drug cartels or criminal gangs to be considered a “foreign nation or government.”\n\nTrump has frequently mentioned the law when discussing his immigration agenda as far back as 2016. He first mentioned his plans to invoke the law for his mass deportation plans during a campaign event last month, following months of violent anti-immigrant rhetoric and behind-the-scenes planning for large-scale immigration enforcement in the 2024 race.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment of the Constitution grants Americans the right to due process, and courts routinely strike down discriminatory laws that target one’s race or ancestry.\n\nLegal scholars, civil rights groups and Democratic elected officials have pushed for repealing the law, but legislation has stalled in a largely deadlocked Congress. The Brennan Center at NYU School of Law has warned that the law is dangerously outdated and “ripe for abuse.”\n\n“Although the law was enacted to prevent foreign espionage and sabotage in wartime, it can be — and has been — wielded against immigrants who have done nothing wrong, have evinced no signs of disloyalty, and are lawfully present in the United States,” the organization explained. “It is an overbroad authority that may violate constitutional rights in wartime and is subject to abuse in peacetime.”","summary":"‘Operation Aurora’ turns to a wartime law granting the president uniltateral authority to target foreigners for removal without due process","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-operation-aurora-alien-enemies-act-b2628134.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/11/23/2177229150.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/01pbjopY-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:29:07","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":259388084,"title":"‘Operation Aurora’: Trump pushes deportation plan in city wracked by immigration tensions","text":"Donald Trump detoured from the battleground states Friday to visit a Colorado suburb that has been in the news over illegal immigration as he drives a message, often using false or misleading claims and dehumanising language, that migrants are causing chaos in smaller American cities and towns.\nTrump’s rally in Aurora marked the first time ahead of the November election that either presidential campaign has visited Colorado, which reliably votes Democratic statewide.\nThe Republican nominee has long promised to stage the largest deportation operation in US history and has made immigration core to his political persona since the day he launched his first campaign in 2015.\nOver the last few months, Trump has pinpointed specific smaller communities that have seen large arrivals of migrants, with tensions flaring locally over resources and some long-time residents expressing distrust about sudden demographic changes.\nAurora entered the spotlight in August when a video circulated showing armed men walking through an apartment building housing Venezuelan migrants. Trump has claimed extensively that Venezuelan gangs are taking over buildings, even though authorities say that was a single block of the suburb near Denver, and the area is again safe.\nIgnoring those denials from local authorities, Trump painted a picture of apartment complexes overrun by “barbaric thugs” and streets unsafe to travel, blaming US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival.\n\n“They’re ruining your state,” Trump said of the Democrats in the White House.\n“No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that Kamala Harris has inflicted on this community can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States,” Trump added.\nTrump often used dehumanising language, referring to his political rivals as “scum” who are destroying “the fabric of your culture” and to migrants as “animals: who have “invaded and conquered” Aurora. The town is “infected by Venezuela”, he said.\n“We have to clean out our country,” Trump said. And he reprised the first controversy of his career in politics, when he launched his 2016 campaign by saying migrants are rapists and bring drugs and crime.\n“I took a lot of heat for saying it, but I was right,” Trump said Friday, repeating the false claim that other countries are emptying their prisons and mental institutions and dumping their worst criminals in the United States.\nTo thunderous applause, he called for the death penalty “for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer”,\nTrump announced that as president he would launch “Operation Aurora” to focus on deporting members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, or TDA. The violent gang traces its origins more than a decade to an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals.\nTrump also repeated his pledge to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that allows the president to deport any non-citizen who is from a country that the US is at war with.\n\nIn July, the Biden administration issued a sanction against the gang and offered US$12 million in rewards for the arrest of three leaders.\nAurora resident Jodie Powell, a 54-year-old Republican, rejected Trump’s claims that Venezuelan gangs had taken over the city.\n“That’s not the case,” Powell said, her fringe poking out below a white cap stamped with “Make America Great Again”. Still, Powell said, she has seen an increase in crime she associates with newcomers, citing a police chase that ended at a store where she was shopping.\n“It takes a small amount of people to make a big difference in the community,” said Powell, who ranks immigration as her top concern alongside the economy. “It’s scary, it’s a scary thing.”\nAt the venue where he appeared on Friday, posters displayed mug shots of people in prison-orange with descriptions including “Illegal immigrant gang members from Venezuela”.\n“Look at all these photos around me,” Stephen Miller, a former top aide who is expected to take a senior role in the White House if Trump wins, told the crowd before Trump spoke.\n“Are these the kids you grew up with? Are these the neighbours you were raised with? Are these the neighbours that you want in your city?” The crowd roared “no” in reply.\n\nSome of Colorado’s Democratic leaders accused Trump and other Republicans of overstating problems in Aurora.\n“What is occurring is minimal and isolated. And to be clear, it’s never acceptable, right? We never say any level is acceptable,” congressman Jason Crow said. “But it’s not a surge. It’s not a change. There is no takeover of any part of this city, of any apartment complex. It has not happened. It is a lie.”\nTrump and his running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, also have spread falsehoods about a community in Springfield, Ohio, where they said Haitian immigrants were accused of stealing and eating pets.\nWhile Ohio and Colorado are not competitive in the presidential race, the Republican message on immigration is intended for states that are. Vance campaigned recently in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a city of 70,000 that has resettled refugees from Africa and Asia, and touted Trump’s plan to ramp up deportations. He argues smaller communities have been “overrun” by immigrants taxing local resources.\nTrump has vowed to deport not only “criminals”, a promise he shares with Harris, but also Haitians living legally in Springfield and even people he has denigrated as “pro-Hamas radicals” protesting on college campuses. Trump has said he would revoke the temporary protected status that allows Haitians to stay in the US because of widespread poverty and violence in their home nation.\nHarris has tacked to the right on immigration, presenting herself as a candidate who can be tough on policing the border, which is perceived as one of her biggest vulnerabilities.\nShe wrapped up a three-day western swing with a campaign event on Friday in Scottsdale, Arizona, where she said she would create a bipartisan council of advisers to provide feedback on her policy initiatives if she makes it to the White House.\n“I love good ideas wherever they come from,” said Harris, who is making a push to get Republicans with doubts about Trump to support her.\n\nShe also accused Trump of letting Iran “off the hook” while he was in office and made her case that she would be a greater champion for Israel’s security than the Republican nominee.\n“Make no mistake, as president, I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend American forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorists,” Harris said in a call with Jewish supporters ahead of Yom Kippur.\n“And I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Diplomacy is my preferred path to that end. But all options are on the table.”\nHarris charged that Trump “did nothing” after Iran “attacked US bases and American troops.”\nThe criticism by Harris was a knock on Trump for downplaying a January 2020 missile attack by Iran on a US base in Iraq that left several American troops with concussion-like symptoms, including some who had to be evacuated for treatment. Trump earlier this month in an exchange with a reporter referred to the injuries as a “headache”.\nThe Iranian missile attack came days after Trump ordered a strike that that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, and raised tensions between the US and Iran.\nHarris took part virtually in a White House briefing with President Biden on the recovery effort from hurricanes Milton and Helene. She sought to reassure those who endured losses from the hurricane that they would get help from the government.","summary":"Often turning to false claims and dehumanising language, the Republican US presidential candidate says migrants are ‘ruining’ US towns.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3282088/operation-aurora-trump-pushes-deportation-plan-city-wracked-immigration-tensions","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/12/903a0005-fd11-49eb-9c02-81aced3bcc60_9ad9a869.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:26:50","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":259387948,"title":"North Carolina Governor Blasts Trump Over Unfounded Claim About Blocked Hurricane Aid","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper called out former President Donald Trump on Friday for claiming Cooper’s office withheld aid from the state’s residents in the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Helene, marking the latest disputed and unfounded claim from the former president about federal and state government responses to the hurricane that has killed nearly 100 people in North Carolina.\n\nCooper responded to Trump on Friday afternoon. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nTrump claimed in a Friday morning post on Truth Social that “it has just come out” that Cooper and Democrats in Washington D.C. blocked “people and money from coming into North Carolina to help people in desperate need,” though the former president did not provide backing for his claim.\n\nCooper called Trump’s claim a “flat out lie,” blasting the Republican presidential candidate for endangering rescue workers and harming the morale of first responders and those affected by the hurricane with “lies and conspiracy theories.”\n\nA “Fact vs. Rumor” webpage published by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety says local, state, federal and military agencies are collaborating on relief efforts alongside volunteer organizations and private businesses.\n\nTrump’s claim on Friday comes after the former president falsely alleged the Federal Emergency Management Agency is struggling financially because of funds allocated toward migrants.\n\nThough Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this month FEMA is experiencing a cash crunch, the more than $1 billion provided to regions welcoming migrants since 2023 was sourced from FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program—a different resource pool than the Disaster Relief Fund, which is used for natural disaster aid.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories around recent hurricane relief efforts have not only provoked North Carolina to create webpages debunking rumors, but also triggered FEMA to create a rumor response webpage of its own. The federal agency said last week it had enough money for “immediate response and recovery needs,” likely publishing the post in response to allegations claiming otherwise from Trump.\n\nSwing-state counties in Georgia and North Carolina affected by Hurricane Helene mostly voted for Trump in 2020, according to an NPR analysis. Trump won 51.6% of the affected counties in North Carolina, NPR reported, underscoring how important the hurricane response and the discourse around it may become in the upcoming election.\n\nWhat We Don’t Know\n\nHow much money in disaster aid FEMA has left. The agency has not disclosed exactly how much is left for disaster aid, according to The Washington Post, which noted experts believe the agency seemingly has enough money for its individual assistance program. The Post reported inaction from Congress could deplete funding for FEMA’s public assistance program, which provides reimbursements for debris cleanup costs and first responders.\n\nKey Background\n\nPresident Joe Biden, like Gov. Cooper, called out Trump over his spreading of misinformation in the wake of the hurricane, saying in a White House briefing this week the former president “led the onslaught of lies.” Biden also criticized Trump allies such as Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who last week promoted a conspiracy theory that government agencies are controlling the weather. Trump has also falsely suggested FEMA aid payouts to those affected by Hurricane Helene are capped at $750, though the figure is what people can be approved for shortly after they apply as part of a program known as Serious Needs Assistance, which provides an initial payment while eligibility for more aid is assessed, according to FEMA.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBiden Calls Out Trump And Marjorie Taylor Greene For Hurricane Misinformation: ‘Beyond Ridiculous’ (Forbes)\n\nFEMA Blasts Misinformation: Trump’s Campaign To Politicize Hurricane Helene, Explained (Forbes)\n\nTrump FEMA Claim Debunked: Agency Not Running Out Of Money Because Of Migrants (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The request also included expanded flight restrictions over Trump’s residences and campaign rallies, as well as the use of ballistic glass — a security measure the former president is already receiving.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the requests Friday. \n\nThe development follows two assassination attempts against Trump since July. He was also the target of an alleged murder-for-hire plot involving a Pakistani national with ties to Iran. The country holds the former president and his administration officials responsible for a drone strike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in 2020.\n\nPresident Biden seemed receptive to the enhanced campaign security measures on Friday, telling reporters he “told the department to give him every, every single thing he needs.” \n\n“As long as he doesn’t ask for F-15s,” Mr. Biden said at the White House. \n\nHe said the Republican presidential nominee should be treated as if “he were a sitting president.” \n\n“If it fits within that category, that’s fine,” he added. “But if it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.” \n\nThe enhanced security is a break from precedent. No presidential nominee or former president in recent history has been transported by military plane before an election. \n\nAfter the second assassination attempt against Trump, Mr. Biden signed a bipartisan bill that bolsters the Secret Service protection for major presidential and vice presidential candidates. The bill requires Secret Service to apply the same standards in determining the number of agents needed to protect the president, vice president and the major candidates for those offices. \n\nIn a statement to CBS News, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said Trump “is receiving the highest levels of protection.”\n\n“Assistance from the Department of Defense is regularly provided for the former President’s protection, to include explosive ordnance disposal, canine units, and airlift transportation,” he said. “Other enhancements the Secret Service has is providing includes Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) over the former President’s residence and when he travels. Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems.”\n\nGuglielmi said the Secret Service will “continue to adjust and enhance its protective posture as needed to mitigate evolving threats.” \n\n contributed to this report.","summary":"Washington — Former President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign requested military assets to enhance his security in the final weeks of the campaign in the wake of threats to his life, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.

Pearson, who heads the RNC’s Youth Advisory Council, said in a video posted to X. \n\nMy name is CJ Pearson. I’m 22 years old. And in 25 days, I’ll be joining millions of other young black men and voting for Donald J. Trump! And we don’t give a damn about what Barack Obama has to say about it. pic.twitter.com/tKzupKL0N1— CJ Pearson (@thecjpearson) October 11, 2024\n\nHis comments came after Obama urged young black men to vote for Harris because she is “somebody who grew up like you, knows you, went to college with you, understands the struggles and pain and joy that comes from those experiences.” \n\nObama told black men that considering a vote for former President Donald Trump was “not acceptable” as he said part of their hesitancy was because they “just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nFormer Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, who was a Democratic delegate for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and served as the national co-chair of Sanders’s 2020 presidential campaign, also criticized the Democratic elder’s statements during a CNN interview. \n\n“Why are black men being belittled in ways that no other voting group [is]?” Turner questioned. “Now, a lot of love for former President Obama, but for him to single out black men is wrong.”\n\nHer comments responded to Obama’s “lecture” to black male voters.\n\n“You’re thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody [in former President Donald Trump] who has a history of denigrating you because you think that’s a sign of strength because that’s what being a man is? Putting women down?” Obama said. \n\nBlack men and Black women do not vote much differently, it’s wrong to single out Black men when Black men are the most loyal male voting block for Democrats.It’s patronizing and wrong. pic.twitter.com/2OXmq9q1TW— Nina Turner (@ninaturner) October 11, 2024\n\nTurner questioned the legitimacy of Obama’s argument, saying: “Some of the black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way. And even if some of us may not like that, we have to respect it.”\n\n“So unless President Barack Obama is going to go out and lecture every other group of men from other identity groups, my message for Democrats is, don’t bring it here to black men who, by and large, don’t vote much differently from black women,” she added. \n\nFormer Republican Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones also chimed in, arguing that Obama’s comments treated black men as if “we are too stupid, that we can’t vote our self-interest — what’s best for us, our pocketbook, our families. As if we’ve been immune to the past three-and-a-half years, as if we don’t know that gas prices have been higher under Kamala Harris, food prices higher under Kamala Harris, interest rates or home mortgages higher under Kamala Harris, and runaway borders under Kamala Harris.” \n\nIn a video posted to X, Vernon said that while Obama “meant a lot to black people,” he didn’t “do anything for black people.” \n\n.@BarackObama should be ashamed for berating, rebuking and scolding Black men, because they won’t vote for Madam Lock Up A Brother…@KamalaHarris. As if we are too stupid to vote our interest and what best for ourselves and our families. BO, you owe every Black man in America… pic.twitter.com/2WXvqpPcTp— Vernon Jones (@VernonForGA) October 11, 2024\n\n“And for him to want to come down from his mansion in Martha’s Vineyard and tell black men how we should vote, really? You don’t even live in Chicago anymore. You left your black community, Barack Obama, and you want to tell us how to vote?

And we’d better hurry before Elon Musk shows up on our doorstep with Donald Trump buttons.\n\nSo how about a bit of baseball banter in the wake of last season’s disastrous White Sox run, a record losing streak of 121 games in one season?\n\nAnd who better to bring a sense of suspense than mega baseball Sports memorabilia collector/showman Grant DePorter, the guy who detonated the notorious Chicago Cubs “Bartman ball” in 2004 to end an old “Cubs curse.”\n\nDePorter, a publicity pooh-bah who is CEO of Harry Caray’s Restaurants and founder of the Chicago Sports Museum at Water Tower Place, which displays the detonated carcass of the legendary “Bartman Ball,” is heading to the mound again. This time he’s pitching a plan to end the “miserable” 2023-24 White Sox slump, which made fans frantic and bleacher bums bananas.\n\nOnly this time DePorter has found a new game ball to target — and a less destructive fate.\n\nNow in his cross-hairs is the ball used in Game 5 of the 1919 World Series, which saw six White Sox batters struck out in a row. That sorry series has gone down in history as the “Black Sox Scandal” over accusations that eight White Sox players were bribed to throw the series.\n\nSay it ain’t so\n\nLong forgotten, the rotting, chewing-tobacco stained, paraffin waxed “shine/spit” World Series baseball was found in 2022, hidden in an old copper time capsule during conversion of the old Tribune Tower into luxury condos.\n\nDeveloper Lee Golub asked sports memorabilia buff DePorter to verify its history. DePorter subsequently placed the “bad luck ball” near the battered remains of the exploded “Bartman Ball” at his Michigan Avenue sports museum.\n\nDePorter claims he has the figures to prove that the White Sox slump began shortly after the Black Sox ball’s relocation to the museum in 2022.\n\n“After the ball was removed from its hiding spot in 2022, the White Sox team’s winning percentage fell to .321,” he said. “They lost 101 games in 2023, and in 2024, and the Sox set MLB’s all time loss record with 121 losses.\n\n“It’s a bad luck ball,” said DePorter. “Eight Sox players banned from baseball forever, including “Shoeless Joe” Jackson.\n\nBlown off rather than blown up?\n\nDePorter’s plan to lift the White Sox curse? And hopefully stop fans from cursing?\n\nPut the 1919 World Series ball back in its time capsule where it was found at 435 N. Michigan Avenue.\n\nHere’s the scooplet: DePorter now tells Sneed he has found the perfect venue for the “Black Sox cursed” ball’s removal ceremony before it is trucked back to the Tribune Tower.\n\n“The ceremony will be held on March 18tj as part of the 27th Annual Worldwide Toast to Harry Caray at Navy Pier,” chirped DePorter.\n\nWell, foxy moxy you.\n\n“The original copper time capsule will be on stage. White Sox legend Ron Kittle will be in attendance. The ceremony will all take place on Major League Baseball’s opening day — and worldwide fans at the toast will embrace Harry Caray’s days when he was the White Sox announcer [1971-1981],” said DePorter.\n\nLater that night, the time capsule will be returned to a secure location in the Tribune building.\n\nAh, a showman in a city besotted with baseball!\n\n Turn it off!\n\nWatching CNN’s Anderson Cooper getting whip slapped, hosed, and battered by 16 inches of Hurricane Milton rain for hours Wednesday night as it moved across the Tampa area in Florida was painful, heroic and comedic to watch all at the same time. And ditto for CNN’s Randy Kay, barely able to stand up against Milton’s pummeling wind force. Argh!

On Friday, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed Harris with a mere 2.5-point lead over Trump nationally, with the core battleground states even closer.Of the 25 states Trump won in 2020, only North Carolina is viewed as a toss-up this year. The other battlegrounds—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were all narrowly won by Biden four years ago. But Democrats are investing in a handful of other states Trump won twice, particularly those home to potentially competitive Senate races, such as Florida, Ohio and Texas.Although Trump is expected to easily win them in November, the latest polls in Arkansas and Oklahoma showed his support has dropped in half since 2020. He won Arkansas by 28 points and Oklahoma by 33 points four years ago.A Hendrix College poll of 696 likely Arkansas voters, conducted from September 5 to 6, showed Trump leading Harris by 15 points (55 percent to 40 percent). Meanwhile, a SoonerPoll of 323 likely Oklahoma voters, conducted from August 24 to 31, showed Trump winning the state by 16 points (56 percent to 40 percent).Harris losing these states by 15 or 16 points would mark a significant shift in two of the most conservative states in the country. Notably, no other polls have been conducted in Arkansas and Oklahoma since Harris became the Democratic nominee, so it's unclear if these polls are outliers.Harris has improved on Biden's polling since the summer, when concerns about his age caused his numbers to dip. But surveys still suggest the race mirrors that of 2020, for the most part. While some polls show Harris gaining ground in Republican states, others show Trump winning over voters in traditionally Democratic states like New York.Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly told Newsweek in a statement, \"President Trump is winning this race because everyone was better off when he was in office. Kamala Harris has wrecked our economy, driven up prices, opened the southern border, and unleashed a wave of violent crime in communities across the country.\"She went on: \"Alongside the broadest coalition in history that includes leaders like RFK Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, and everywhere from traditional battlegrounds to longtime 'blue states' like Virginia and Minnesota, voters are tired of weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris, and they are ready to Make America Great Again on November 5.\"Newsweek also reached out by email to the Harris campaign for comment.Here is an overview of polling in states Trump won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.North Carolina: Harris' Most Competitive Trump-Won StateFiveThirtyEight's average gave Trump a very narrow advantage in the Tar Heel State on Friday, showing him with a 0.9-point lead in the state, the most competitive of those Trump won in his past presidential runs.The latest independent polls in North Carolina show Trump with a narrow lead. An Emerson College poll, which surveyed 1,000 likely voters from October 5 to 8, showed Trump up 1 point in the state (50 percent to 49 percent).A Wall Street Journal poll, conducted by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates/GBAO, showed the race tied, with each candidate receiving 47 percent of the vote. It surveyed 600 registered voters from September 28 to October 8.Democrats are hoping Harris benefits from Democrat Josh Stein's more comfortable lead in North Carolina's gubernatorial race, which was shaken up after CNN reported on posts allegedly made by Republican Mark Robinson, including references to watching pornography featuring transgender individuals and calling himself a \"black NAZI.\" Robinson has said those posts were not made by him.Trump, who has praised Robinson as \"Martin Luther King on steroids,\" has not distanced himself from the candidate. Experts have said it is uncertain whether the scandal will have an impact on the presidential race.Five Other States Show Trump With Single-Digit LeadsFive other states show Trump leading in the single digits, but he remains favored to win each of them in November.Florida and Texas are viewed as the next two most competitive Trump-won states. The Cook Political report classifies them both as \"Likely Republican,\" meaning they aren't viewed as especially close but have the potential to become more competitive.In Florida, a state that has trended increasingly Republican in recent years, a Marist College poll, conducted among 1,410 registered voters from October 3 to 7, showed Trump leading Harris by 4 points (51 percent to 47 percent).But a separate survey from The New York Times and Siena College gave Trump a larger lead. It showed him up 13 points against Harris (53 percent to 40 percent). It polled 622 likely voters from September 29 to October 7.Democrats are also hoping to make Texas, where leftward shifts in cities and suburban areas have narrowed Republican margins, competitive. But polls still give Trump an advantage in November.Marist College polled 1,186 likely voters in the state from October 3 to 7, finding Trump with a 7-point lead over Harris (53 percent to 46 percent).Meanwhile, a Times/Siena College poll, conducted among 617 likely voters from September 29 to October 4, showed Trump up 6 points (50 percent to 44 percent) in the Lone Star State.Trump won Florida by 3 points and Texas by nearly 6 points in 2020.Three other states have also produced polls showing the race in the single digits, though forecasters view these states as more difficult for Harris. The Cook Political Report still rates them all as \"Safe Republican.\"An Alaska Survey Research poll, conducted among 1,182 likely voters from September 27 to 29, showed Trump up 9 points in Alaska (52 percent to 43 percent). He won the state by 10 points in 2020.A Selzer & Co. poll, sponsored by The Des Moines Register and Mediacom, showed Trump up 4 points in Iowa (47 percent to 43 percent). It polled 656 likely voters from September 8 to 11. In Ohio, a Washington Post poll, conducted among 1,002 registered voters from October 3 to 7, showed Trump up 7 points (51 percent to 44 percent).Trump won both Iowa and Ohio by 8 points in 2020.Trump's Lead Holds in Ruby-Red StatesPolling in the most conservative-leaning states is generally scant, as pollsters invest their resources in the more competitive states. But some surveys have shed light on how these states might vote in November.Harris isn't expected to be particularly competitive in any state Trump won by a large margin in both elections. Polls of a Harris-Trump matchup from some states, such as Alabama or Louisiana, are not available, so it's yet to be seen if his lead is holding there or if Harris may be making inroads with voters.No other states have changes quite as drastic as Arkansas and Oklahoma, but polls suggest Utah may be the state where Trump is most building upon his 2020 vote share. A HarrisX poll, sponsored by Deseret News and the University of Utah Hinckley Institute of Politics, showed Trump up 32 points in the state (60 percent to 28 percent). Trump won Utah by 21 points in 2020.An ActiVote poll of Tennessee, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 27 to August 29, also showed Trump improving on his past performance. The poll had Trump up 26 points in the state (63 percent to 37 percent), a slightly larger margin than the 23 points he won it by in 2024.Other red states have changed less from four years ago.A Winthrop University Center for Public Opinion & Policy Research poll of 1,078 likely South Carolina voters from September 21 to 29 showed Trump up 10 points (52 percent to 42 percent). He won the Palmetto State by about 11 points in 2020.In Missouri, FiveThirtyEight's polling aggregate showed Trump up 12.5 points on Friday, closer than his 15-point lead in 2020. FiveThirtyEight showed him up 18 points in Nebraska, which he won by 19 points in 2020.","summary":"Trump is favored in most states he won in his past presidential runs, but he may be held to a single-digit lead in several states.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-lead-republican-states-1967956","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493884/donald-trump-polling-states-he-won-twice.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 23:00:10","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":259387414,"title":"Andrew Schulz: The Comedy Podcaster Who Roasted Trump to His Face","text":"The hustler never thinks they’ll be hustled.

Hispanic voters are more supportive of the Democrats overall: According to the poll, nearly half identify as Democrats, about one-third as Republicans, and around 2 in 10 as independents. But the poll signals that Hispanic men, while not overwhelmingly in favor of Trump, are more open to his candidacy than Hispanic women – and less open to Harris’.\n\nThe margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nAntonio Melcon, 65, a Republican from Florida, said Trump has his vote because he is the best option for the country. In Melcon’s view, the Biden administration has taken the nation down a bad path, and Harris has done nothing to stop it.\n\n“She wasn’t the one that implemented the route this country has taken, but she’s been there and done nothing that merits I vote for her,” Melcon said. “I would definitely never vote for her.”\n\nOverall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Harris. But there is a gender divide among Hispanic voters on Harris: About 6 in 10 Hispanic women have a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Harris, compared to 45% of Hispanic men.\n\nSimilarly, about half of Hispanic women voters think Harris would make a good president, compared to only about one-third of Hispanic men.\n\nFor some voters, one candidate may appear in a better light simply because they dislike the alternative. Sonia Montoya, a 68-year-old Democrat from Chicago, said while she disagrees with many of Harris’ policies, she still sees Harris as the lesser of two evils. Montoya said Harris is more human and has a better understanding of society, while she views Trump as “arrogant, a liar, a cheater.”\n\nIn addition to having warmer feelings toward Harris, about 6 in 10 Hispanic female voters say Trump would not make a good president, compared to about half of Hispanic male voters.\n\nAnd Hispanic men are likelier than Hispanic women to think Trump has the toughness the presidency requires. About half of Hispanic men say “tough enough to be president” describes Trump extremely or very well, compared to about one-third of Hispanic women. Hispanic men are also more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on important policies.\n\nPlenty of Hispanic men, though, remain supportive of Harris and skeptical about Trump. Sebastian Diaz, 51 and an independent from Massachusetts, views Harris “somewhat favorably” because he agrees with her ideology. He said he has a “very unfavorable” view of Trump because he is “a racist bigot.”\n\nDespite some divisions in views of the candidates, though, Hispanic voters are largely in agreement that the economy is a major factor as they consider their options for president. Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is “one of the most important issues” during this election season.\n\nDaysi Garcia, 44, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said groceries have gotten so expensive that the candidates’ economic plans are guiding her vote. A self-proclaimed Democrat until last year, Garcia said while she does not agree with all of Trump’s policies, she is unhappy with the Democrats and thinks Trump would be a better choice to run the country.\n\n“It is so bad right now,” Garcia said. “It is so hard to do grocery shopping because everything is through the roof. I don’t remember ever seeing everything skyrocket the way it is now.”\n\nMelcon agrees that the cost of living is too high. “The economy is the main thing for me,” he said. “The environment, immigration – which is also a problem – that’s second fiddle.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Hispanic voters also say that health care or crime are among the most important issues for their vote, while about half say that about gun policy. Slightly less than half say abortion or immigration are among the most important. Hispanic voters are more likely than voters nationwide to see health care as a top voting priority.\n\nDiaz said health care, like food and water, is a basic need for humans.\n\n“I think universal access to health care is incredibly important for the social development of a country,” Diaz said.\n\nMore Hispanic voters think Harris represents their culture\n\nHarris has one potential advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters: About 4 in 10 say she is the candidate who better represents their background and culture, while about one-quarter say this about Trump. A sizable share are unconvinced that either candidate fits into this role, though: About 3 in 10 say neither candidate represents their background and culture.\n\nThe fact that Harris is the daughter of immigrants may give some Hispanic voters a sense of representation, civic engagement advocates say, even though she’s not Hispanic herself.\n\nMontoya said as someone who is biracial, Harris represents her identity best. “She knows what it feels like to be insulted or put to the side or feel worthless because of prejudice in this world,” Montoya said. “I think she’ll fight harder for us than (Trump) ever would.”","summary":"A solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris and a negative view of former President Donald Trump, but Hispanic men are divided on both candidates, according to a recent AP-NORC poll","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/11/harris-viewed-more-positively-by-hispanic-women-than-by-hispanic-men-ap-norc-poll/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Election_2024_AP_Poll_Hispanic_Voters_62136_a72242-1728687556.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:55:44","author":"Fernanda Figueroa And Linley Sanders,FERNANDA FIGUEROA and LINLEY SANDERS - Associated Press","authors":["Fernanda Figueroa And Linley Sanders","FERNANDA FIGUEROA and LINLEY SANDERS - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":259389418,"title":"\"They're animals\": Trump vows mass deportation under law used to justify Japanese internment camps","text":"During a rally in Aurora, Colorado on Friday, Donald Trump vowed to invoke a 1798 law that grants the president the ability to enact a mass deportation scheme.\n\n“We will have an Operation Aurora at the federal level to expedite the removal of these savage gangs. And I will invoke the Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, think of that,” Trump told the crowd, during a night centered around the specter of \"migrant crime.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1844842554455621633\n\n The Alien and Sedition Acts grant widespread powers to the president during wartime and were famously used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War 2.\n\nThe theme of migrants and mass deportation ran throughout Trump's speech. He said that immigrants to the United States are \"the worst criminals in the world\" and \"the most violent people on Earth.\" Later in his speech, he said that Haitian-American immigrants in Springfield would have to be deported to Haiti in spite of their legal status.\n\n\"They have to go back to where they came from,\" he said.\n\nTrump added that he’d send in ICE and Border Patrol squads, and promise local police officers blanket immunity to enact the plan to remove 20 million people which he previously warned would be a “bloody story.”\n\n“They’ve [local cops] been restricted from operating,” Trump said. “We’re going to indemnify them against any prosecutions.”\n\nTrump previously claimed that the city of Aurora was home to dangerous gangs who had taken over an apartment complex.Local officials spoke out against Trump’s rhetoric that Aurora was a “war zone.”\n\n“Aurora is a considerably safe city — not a city overrun by Venezuelan gangs,” Republican mayor Mike Coffman told the New York Times. \n\nTrump was not swayed.\n\n“We have to live with these animals, but we’re not gonna live with them for long, you watch,” Trump said at the rally, adding that he was confident he could win the historically blue state. “I am going to make Colorado safe again.”","summary":"Trump said he'd use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to remove \"animals\"","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/10/11/theyre-animals-vows-mass-deportation-under-law-used-to-justify-japanese-internment-camps/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/08/donald_trump_2167198473.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:52:45","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":259390408,"title":"Welsh police force quits Elon Musk’s X over clash in ‘values’","text":"A Welsh police force has completely quit X, claiming the social media site is “no longer consistent” with its values.\n\nPolice forces across the country have been reducing their usage of the platform under Elon Musk’s tenure after it was used to spread misinformation sparking the far-right riots this summer.\n\nFormerly known as Twitter, the site has long been used as a key communications channel for emergency services, the British government, and even the royal family.\n\nHowever, six forces have now told Reuters they were cutting their presence to just one or two X accounts. North Wales Police, serving nearly 700,000 residents, stopped using X completely in August.\n\n“We ... felt that the platform was no longer consistent with our values and therefore we have withdrawn our use of it,” Chief constable Amanda Blakeman said, adding the force would continue to monitor and review alternative platforms.\n\nAll Gwent Police’s individual officer accounts have been removed.\n\nWest Yorkshire Police said it was seeking to understand whether X would still help the force reach its target audience and build trust in the community.\n\nThe role of X and other social media platforms came under the spotlight this year when far-right and racist violence broke out after online posts falsely claimed the Southport knife attack was perpetrated by an illegal migrant.\n\nMr Musk used his platform to attack prime minister Keir Starmer during the unrest, calling the Labour leader “#twotierkeir” and claiming “civil war is inevitable”.\n\nCritics claim Mr Musk has allowed disinformation to spread on X since his takeover and renaming of the platform in 2022. Mr Musk has said he is defending freedom of speech.\n\nDuring his tenure, he has let go of around 6,000 staff, or 80 per cent of the workforce, including the entire moderation team. He has also allowed previously banned users like Donald Trump, Andrew Tate, and Tommy Robinson back onto the platform.\n\nThe government has since committed to looking into the role social media misinformation played in the riots, and the home secretary said it would “strengthen the requirements for social media companies to take responsibility for the poison proliferated on their platforms with the rollout of the measures in the Online Safety Act”.\n\nThe Independent has contacted X and North Wales Police for comment.","summary":"Critics claim Elon Musk has allowed disinformation to spread on X since his takeover of the platform in 2022","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/x-twitter-elon-musk-southport-riots-north-wales-police-b2628083.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/12/19/08/x%20app%20eu%20musk.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:49:55","author":"Athena Stavrou","authors":["Athena Stavrou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":259387648,"title":"Kanye West DENIES he 'hired fixer to follow' Bianca Censori and 'investigate' the Kardashians","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Oct 11th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish beautician, 28, facing 60 years behind bars in the US after 'trying to smuggle £3.5million of cocaine in suitcases from Mexico'\n\nChristopher Columbus' remains are finally identified - ending a 500-year-old mystery\n\nMystery as Earl Spencer's new love, podcast star Cat Jarman, takes his wife Karen to court over 'misuse of private information'\n\nR.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy Terry Zeller and Eve Buckland For Dailymail.Com \n Published:23:36 BST, 11 October 2024 |Updated:23:47 BST, 11 October 2024 \n\nKanye West's representative has denied allegations made in a lawsuit that the rapper hired a 'fixer' to follow his wife Bianca Censori and investigate the Kardashian family.\nIn the lawsuit filed on Thursday, a former employee of the 47-year-old rapper — who recently refuted he had split from Censori, 29 - claims West instructed him to hire private investigators to 'tail' Censori while she was abroad, along with making other allegedly illegal requests.\n'Many of the details in his complaint are simply fantastical and false,' Kanye's representative told Page Six on Friday. \nThe rep further stated that the lawsuit—which also accuses West of abusing nitrous oxide—is 'designed to cause embarrassment and/or capitalize on perceived problems in Ye’s marriage.'\nAccording to the lawsuit obtained by Rolling Stone, John Doe's duties allegedly included mitigating West's risks and preventing bad press, involving investigations and managing nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). \n\nKanye West 's representative has denied allegations made in a lawsuit that the rapper hired a 'fixer' to follow his wife Bianca Censori and investigate the Kardashian familyl (West, Censori in February)\n\n'Many of the details in his complaint are simply fantastical and false,' Kanye's representative told Page Six on Friday; (Kim Kardashian, West pictured in 2019)\n\nEXCLUSIVE Kanye West and Bianca Censori 'divorce' takes another twist as friends say couple is 'pathetic' \nHe also claims that his investigations targeted Censori and the Kardashian family, including West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, with private investigators allegedly following Censori on West’s orders. \nThe 22 page lawsuit filed in LA reads: 'A particularly notable task by Ye was to have Doe hire private investigators to follow and ‘tail’ his wife, Bianca Censori, when she was traveling alone to visit family in Australia, without Ms. Censori’s knowledge.'\nIn May Doe cites West began exhibiting 'erratic behavior' including spending $850,000 on a set of titanium teeth and sacking a 'large majority of the Yeezy leadership - including former chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos - who has also accused West of being hooked on nitrous oxide.\nThe alleged behavior came at a time when West was claimed to be consuming nitrous oxide - which Doe believes 'played a role in West’s decision-making at the time.'\nDoe's attorney Ronald Zambrano told the publication: 'My client believes there is a direct correlation between the nitrous oxide and the increase in paranoia and siege mentality that ended up happening in that timeframe that Doe worked for West.\n'There were internal concerns about the amount of nitrous oxide that was being delivered to his house.'\nThe lawsuit claims Doe's employment ended in mid-May when he got a call from a Donda Academy teacher 'regarding safety concerns they had about some of the students.' \nDoe says he informed Yeezy leadership about the call and 'almost immediately' West allegedly 'called Doe to yell, curse and threaten Doe with great bodily injury, including death, if Doe repeated what Doe learned from the Donda employee.'\n\nThe rep further stated that the lawsuit—which also accuses West of abusing nitrous oxide—is 'designed to cause embarrassment and/or capitalize on perceived problems in Ye’s marriage.'\n\nHe also claims that his investigations targeted Censori and the Kardashian family, including West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian , with private investigators allegedly following Censori on West’s orders; (pictured 2019)\nWest allegedly told Doe he was 'f*****g dead to [him]' and played a recording of 'scary voices that were threatening to harm' Doe - per the suit.\nDoe claims in the following days West's 'enforcers' began to threaten him, triggering his PTSD from past military experience.\nThe lawsuit claims: '[Doe] experienced panic attacks, anxiety, and severe emotional distress, which caused him to seek medical treatment and was placed in a facility to address his declining mental health.'\nDoe is suing West for emotional distress, retaliation and several violations of California labor codes. \nThe plaintiff is seeking restitution of unpaid wages, attorneys’ fees, and general and punitive damages to be determined at trial. \nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Kanye West and the Kardashians for comment. \nIn August Yiannopoulo made a slew of bombshell allegations aimed at the rapper and his dentist, Thomas P. Connelly, in a legal affidavit.\nYiannopoulos, 39, who quit working for West in May after two years, claimed that West is addicted to nitrous oxide or 'laughing gas' and alleged Connelly was 'aware' of West's 'psychological vulnerabilities' and believed he 'sought to exploit them' by supplying the gas.\nFurther shock claims in the document are that Connelly continued 'to supply the gas after the emergence of distressing symptoms that led to widespread comment and concern' and charged 'more than $50,000 a month' to do so.\n(West was seen in a Reddit post three months ago with a mask on with the caption, 'Ye on nitrous.')\nIt was alleged West's 'growing dependency on the gas' - also known as 'hippy crack' which can induce feelings of euphoria - concerned Yeezy staff members and that the rapper 'seemed to be in and out of the inhaler mask on a near-constant basis' and his communications 'were becoming incomprehensible and contradictory.'\n\nIn August West's former chief of staff Yiannopoulos, 39, claimed that West is addicted to nitrous oxide or 'laughing gas' - Pictured in 2017 in NYC\n\nWest allegedly told Doe he was 'f*****g dead to [him]' and played a recording of 'scary voices that were threatening to harm' Doe - per the suit - pictured in 2024 \nWest has notably seen his career implode amid anti-Semitic comments - beginning with a vile post in 2022 that he was going 'death con 3 on Jewish people' - which got him promptly dropped by his agency CAA, production company MRC, Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga.\nThe symptoms of West's 'widely-reported bipolar diagnosis and the side effects of prolonged nitrous gas abuse are strikingly similar' claims the affidavit, with symptoms including 'erratic behavior, mood swings, paranoia and violence.'\nYiannopoulos claims a Yeezy employee told him that they had witnessed West 'self-administering the nitrous gas provided by Connelly.'\nYiannopoulos - who detailed his job duties as 'solving mysteries and fixing problems where others have failed.' said the affidavit was in tandem with a complaint he filed with the California Dental Board accusing Connelly of 'reckless, unethical, dishonest, explorative and, upon information and belief, illegal conduct. '\nHe says he was 'motivated by urgent concern' for West's health and safety' in both his own capacity of himself and 'on behalf of several individuals close to him.'\nA rep for Connelly told TMZ that claims made by Yiannopoulos were 'not only factually incorrect but also intentionally misleading.'\nYiannopoulos was 'making up these claims for attention,' Connelly's rep told the outlet, and was 'attempting to maliciously damage' Connelly while doing so.\nConnelly's rep told TMZ that the dentist follows legal and ethical standards and will continue doing so.\nThis comes after it was claimed West and Censori orchestrated speculation they are heading for divorce to create a buzz around his new album. \nOn Monday, multiple reports emerged the couple had secretly called it quits 'weeks ago', with the rapper reportedly 'ready to divorce' his wife.\nHowever, the duo were then pictured together in Japan just hours after split claims went public.\nNow, sources close to the pair believe the speculation surrounding their nearly two-year marriage was a deliberate ploy to help build publicity around Kanye's new album. \nLate last month, Ye announced his new album Bully and debuted the song Beauty and the Beast during an event in China. He has also released his album Vultures 2 in August. \n\nHis 10th studio album, Vultures 1, was released on February 10\n\nHe has two Diamond certified songs — 2007's Stronger and 2011's N***as in Paris featuring Jay-Z — and all 10 of his albums have been at least certified Gold\nSince bursting onto the rap scene over 20 years ago, West has sold an incredible 160million records worldwide and is a 24-time Grammy Award winner. \nHe has two Diamond certified songs — 2007's Stronger and 2011's N***** in Paris featuring Jay-Z — and all 10 of his albums have been at least certified Gold.\nHis 10th studio album, Vultures 1, went straight to No.1 when it was released in February 2024. It was done in collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign as their hip hop duo ¥$.\nWest previously teased that a follow-up album, Vultures 2, is in the works. The chatter around West's alleged musical retirement comes amid a slew of legal woes for the rapper - mostly relating to his crumbling Yeezy empire.\nKanye WestBianca Censori\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West DENIES he 'hired fixer to follow' Bianca Censori and 'investigate' the Kardashians\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nCeline Dion's showstopping Olympics performance is slammed as 'FAKE' and pre-recorded in extraordinary row in France\n\nR.

Trump narrowly survived one assassination attempt and U.S. Secret Service agents foiled a second, though neither case has been publicly linked to Iranian actors.\n\nBeyond a military plane, the campaign has asked for special armored vehicles typically reserved for sitting presidents, expanded temporary flight restrictions over his rallies and his residences, reimbursements for decoy aircraft, and more money for the U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement agencies that assist in Trump’s protection.\n\nBoth Trump and his staff have complained that he is being restricted from campaigning the way he wants to because the agency lacks the resources to keep him safe.\n\nThe Secret Service insisted Friday that Trump is already “receiving the highest levels of protection.” And President Joe Biden told reporters that he would be happy to approve Trump’s request to use military aircraft in the final stages of the campaign, as long as “he doesn’t ask for F-15s.”\n\n“Look, what I’ve told the department is to give him every single thing he needs for his — as if he were a sitting president,” he said. “Give him all that he needs. If it fits within that category, that’s fine. But it doesn’t, he shouldn’t.”\n\nThe new security requests were first reported by the New York Times.\n\nThe campaign and Secret Service have gone back and forth \n\nThe Trump campaign’s requests were outlined in a letter to acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe Jr. from senior Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles and obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nShe asked the Secret Service to pre-position the ballistic glass that Trump now uses for protection at his outdoor rallies in the seven battleground states where he is expected to spend the majority of time in the race’s final stretch.\n\nCurrently, it takes more than a week’s notice to position the barriers in the right place, according to a person familiar with the requests who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters. Trump aides see that advance notice as unrealistic given the frenetic nature of the final days of a campaign, when schedules are adjusted based on incoming polls and campaign strategy, the person said. \n\nIn a statement, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said that since the attempted assassination on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency “has made comprehensive enhancements to its communications capabilities, resourcing and protective operations” and that Trump “is receiving the highest levels of protection.”\n\nHe said the Department of Defense regularly provides assistance for Trump’s protection, including canine units, and that the Secret Service has been restricting air traffic over the former president’s residence and when he travels.\n\n“Additionally, the former President is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems,” he said.\n\nFormer American presidents are able to use military airlift only if requested by the current president. In April, for instance, former President Bill Clinton used one as he led a U.S. delegation to Rwanda. On Sept. 11, 2021, Biden, Clinton, and former President Barack Obama flew to a remembrance in New York.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of denying him resources\n\nThe Trump campaign for weeks now has accused the U.S. Secret Service of forcing it to cancel or scale back events due to a lack of resources.\n\nThat includes a speech in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, held the same week as the U.N. General Assembly in New York, that was scaled back because the Secret Service couldn’t secure a larger rally. \n\nTrump has accused Biden of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.\n\n“They couldn’t give me any help. And I’m so angry about it because what they’re doing is interfering in the election,” he said in a recent Fox News interview.\n\nTrump, however, has repeatedly praised his own security detail, commending them for their bravery.\n\nWhile the Secret Service says Trump already has presidential-level protection, there are differences. Both Biden and Harris, for instance, have military assets, including planes.\n\nBeyond her Sept. 30 letter, Wiles has also spoken with White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and others about her concerns about Trump’s security and how his ability to campaign has been curtailed by threats.\n\nZients, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose details of their conversation, connected Wiles to Homeland Security Department and Secret Service leadership after she reached out and made clear that Biden had directed the Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection for Trump.\n\nIn a separate letter, Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, who is close to Trump, urged the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, White House and Department of Defense to deploy additional military assets to protect Trump in the face of Iranian threats. He requested that Trump be provided with a military passenger aircraft like those used by cabinet secretaries.\n\nTrump aides call for action against Iran \n\nTrump has been targeted by Iran, which is believed to want retaliation for his administration’s killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\n\nIn August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.\n\nIranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to “weaponize” the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.\n\nTrump’s campaign has complained that the Biden White House has downplayed the death threats.\n\n“This administration spends more time focused on a hack of emails than they do the Iranians who are trying to kill Donald Trump,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told reporters in Pennsylvania last weekend. He noted that former President Clinton deployed cruise missiles in retaliation for an Iraqi plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n“You know he did? He sent a bunch of cruise missiles to send a message,” LaCivita complained. “All they do is put out a press release.”\n\nIn a statement, National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said the Biden administration has been “closely tracking Iranian threats against former President Trump and former Trump administration officials for years, dating back to the last administration.”\n\n“We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority, and we strongly condemn Iran for these brazen threats,” Savett added, warning that: “Should Iran attack any of our citizens, including those who continue to serve the United States or those who formerly served, Iran will face severe consequences.”\n\n___ Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani, Zeke Miller, Rebecca Santana, Lolita C.

He did call President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton but made no mention of his predecessor.Trump did seem to make a dig at Harris' campaign for calling in Obama to stump for her, writing on Truth Social Friday morning, \"Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men. I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn't like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!\"Obama's appearance in Pittsburgh has been largely viewed as a sign that Democrats are concerned about Black male voters turning out for Harris. During the rally, the former Democratic president aimed a message at the voting bloc, telling them, \"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses. I've got a problem with that.\"\"Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,\" Obama said.\"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting,\" he added.Although he kept mum at his rally in Colorado, Trump has criticized Obama in the past for making jabs at him.When Obama poked fun at Trump's \"weird obsession with crowd sizes\" during his speech at the Democratic National Convention, Trump slammed Obama for \"getting personal\" in his remarks.\"Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night taking little shots? He was taking shots at your president and so was Michelle,\" Trump told a crowd in Asheboro, North Carolina the day after Obama's DNC speech. \"You know, they always say, 'Sir, please stick to policy, don't get personal,' but they're getting personal all night, these people.\"Trump discussed his notorious use of nicknames for his political rivals during a podcast appearance released Thursday.\"I'm good with names you know,\" Trump joked with \"flagrant\" hosts Andrew Schultz and Akaash Singh.\"The problem with 'Tampon Tim' is it's hard to say,\" the former president said about his nickname for Democratic vice presidential candidate and Governor Tim Walz. Trump added that there are others that can be difficult for him to say, like his nickname for Harris, \"Comrade Kamala.\"In the final weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump has made a detour from the battleground states, stopping in places like Colorado to campaign. He is scheduled to hold rallies at Madison Square Garden in New York City and in Coachella, California, later this month.","summary":"The former president bit his tongue, making no mention of the criticisms lobbied against him by a Democratic heavyweight.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-colorado-rally-unexpected-1967960","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493901/donald-trump-colorado-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:44:41","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":259389854,"title":"Trump promises to ‘renegotiate’ USMCA treaty if elected","text":"Donald Trump appears determined to not just review but also renegotiate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2026 if he returns to the White House next year.\n\nIn an address at the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday, the former U.S. president and Republican Party presidential candidate said that “upon taking office,” he will “formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provisions of the USMCA that I put in.”\n\nThe USMCA, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 2020, has a clause that stipulates that a joint review of the free trade pact will take place on the sixth anniversary of its entry into force. Thus the review will commence on July 1, 2026.\n\nAccording to an article published earlier this year by Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, “the conversations” between Mexican, U.S. and Canadian officials “could involve anything from minor tweaks to threats of withdrawal unless major changes are made” to the USMCA.\n\n“… If all three parties do not confirm their desire to extend the agreement as part of the six-​year review,” Baker Institute nonresident fellow Simon Lester wrote, “they will meet again in the seventh year, and each year thereafter until the 16th year.”\n\n“If they cannot agree by the 16th year, the agreement terminates,” Lester said.\n\nTrump: ‘I’m going to have a lot of fun’ with the USMCA renegotiation \n\nIn the largest city of the swing state of Michigan, Trump looked back to his 2017-21 presidency — during which the USMCA was negotiated and took effect — as well as forward to what he hopes will be a second term in the White House starting next January.\n\nThe 78-year-old former president said that the review clause in the three-way trade pact “was the hardest thing I had to get” because Mexico and Canada “didn’t want that.”\n\n“I said, ‘Nope, I want to be able to renegotiate in six years, otherwise we’re not making the deal.’ And I got it, and it’s coming due very soon. Oh, I’m going to have a lot of fun,” he said.\n\nTrump said he wanted to protect and grow the automotive industry in the United States, which is particularly important to the economy of Detroit.\n\n“I’ll also seek strong new protections against transshipment, so that China and other countries cannot smuggle their products and auto parts into the United States tax free through Mexico to the detriment of our workers and our supply chains,” he said.\n\n“They smuggle this stuff in. They don’t pay anything. We’re going to have very strong language on that,” Trump said.\n\nLess than four weeks before the U.S. presidential election, the ex-president also repeated his threat to impose tariffs on vehicles made by Chinese automakers in Mexico, a move that would require major changes to the USMCA.\n\n“I will impose whatever tariffs are required — 100%, 200%, 1,000% — they’re not going to sell any cars into the United States with those plants,” Trump said.\n\nThe Republican Party nominee has previously expressed particular concern about Chinese automakers’ plans to open plants in Mexico, but he has also said that he will “put a 100% tariff on every single car coming across the Mexican border.”\n\nSuch a tariff would hit vehicles made in Mexico by U.S. automakers such as General Motors and Ford.\n\nDespite his stated intention to renegotiate the USMCA, Trump said that the agreement was a “great deal” already.\n\n“I terminated NAFTA. That’s a pretty big thing. A lot of people said it would be impossible to do. I got it done, and we have a great deal now,” he said.\n\n“What we have to do is make it much better even, and we’ll be able to do that very shortly,” Trump said.\n\nHarris would also like to make changes to the USMCA \n\nThe Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, pointed out on social media last month that she was “one of only 10 senators to vote against USMCA.”\n\n“I knew it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers. Many who voted for this deal conditioned their support on a review process, which, as president, I will use,” she wrote in a post to X on Sept. 26.\n\nHarris, who as a senator contended that the USMCA’s environmental provisions were “insufficient,” also said on X on Sept. 26 that “American workers deserve a leader who keeps their promises and stands with workers when it matters.”\n\n“I will bring autoworker jobs back to this country, and create an opportunity economy that strengthens manufacturing, unions, and builds prosperity and security for America’s future,” she wrote.\n\n“… Trusting Donald Trump again is a risk America’s autoworkers cannot afford.”\n\nSheinbaum: The USMCA is ‘indispensable’ \n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum was asked at her Friday morning press conference about the impact a renegotiation of the USMCA with Trump as U.S. president will have on Mexico.\n\nWithout directly responding to that question, Sheinbaum noted that Trump referred “in particular” to products from China “that aren’t reported,” and agreed with the former U.S. president that “there are limitations in the current USMCA.”\n\nThe new president appeared to indicate that her government is prepared to review and renegotiate the trade pact with the U.S. government no matter who wins the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“Whoever wins, whether it’s President Trump or Vice President Kamala, we’re going to come to an agreement,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… They’re campaigning now obviously so there is greater stridency in one sense or another, but they know and we know that the agreement is indispensable,” she said.\n\nKimberly Clausing, an economist and senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Canadian media outlet Global News that while Trump and Harris are talking tough about the USMCA during the campaign period, they might think twice about their proposals if they actually become the next U.S. president.\n\nShe questioned why they would want to make changes to “an agreement that’s basically working.”\n\nSheinbaum noted that the economies of Mexico, the United States and Canada are highly integrated, and asserted that the three countries don’t compete with each other but rather complement each other.\n\nShe pointed out that data recently showed that the value of Mexico’s exports to the United States reached a record high in the first eight months of 2024.\n\n“So the United States depends a lot on Mexico, we’re the main exporter [to the U.S.],” Sheinbaum said.\n\nEarlier this week, the head of the president’s business advisory council, Altagracia Gómez Sierra, said that Mexico is “prepared” for the 2026 USMCA review.\n\nTrudeau: ‘We’ve been here before’\n\nAt a press conference in Laos, where he attended the ASEAN Summit, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked about Trump’s USMCA remarks in Detroit as well as Harris’s plan to “renegotiate the agreement.”\n\n“We’ve been here before. We know that there is a certain amount of protectionist sentiment in the United States right now and indeed in the world,” Trudeau said.\n\nHe said that in previous trade negotiations his government had stood up for Canadian jobs and demonstrated “how integrated” the Canadian and U.S. economies are.\n\n“And we are ready to do it again if necessary,” Trudeau said.\n\nWith reports from CTV News, Washington Examiner, Global News, El Financiero and Milenio","summary":"As the U.S. presidential election nears, both Harris and Trump have criticized the treaty that governs trade between Mexico, the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\nThe post Trump promises to &#8216;renegotiate&#8217; USMCA treaty if elected appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/trump-renegotiate-usmca-treaty-if-elected/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:42:05","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":259385706,"title":"Church That Worships With AR-15 Is Giving Away Trump Rifle","text":"There have been two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump this election cycle, but that is not stopping the Rod of Iron Ministries from holding a raffle for a Trump-themed AR-15 at its annual Freedom Festival this weekend.People are encouraged to register early for the Freedom Festival to receive free tickets and the chance to win a \"Trump AR-15.\"The festival is put on by the Rod of Iron Ministries, a group headquartered outside of Scranton, Pennsylvania, that allows its congregants to bring their weapons to church. The group offers courses for pistol and rifle marksmanship, home defense shotgun and the \"art of the draw.\"Newsweek reached out to a representative of the Freedom Festival for comment.Sunday services, which the group calls \"Sanctuary Church,\" focus on scripture while also supporting \"the right to bear arms and focuses on where God's word, politics, morality and culture intersect,\" according to the website.Pastor Sean Moon, founder of the Rod of Iron Ministries, believes the AR-15 is an instrument of God's justice, the \"rod of iron\" from Revelation 2:27. Moon is the son of the late global religious leader Sun Myung Moon, founder and leader of the Unification Church.\"The citizens of the Kingdom of God, who will share in Christ's sovereignty, bear the responsibility to defend their family, neighbors, and nation with their own rod of iron,\" Moon wrote in his book, Rod of Iron Kingdom, according to Rolling Stone.The ministries' rallies are meant for \"Christian patriots.\" The website says that they stand for issues of law and order, traditional families, medical freedoms, life and the U.S. Constitution.\"We are Constitutional Christians who are serious about electoral integrity and also believe in Making America Godly Again,\" the website says.Moon's prayers to his community for \"a kingdom of peace police and peace militia where the citizens, through the right given to them by almighty God to keep and bear arms, will be able to protect one another and protect human flourishing,\" Business Insider reported in 2018. The ceremony blessed the group's marriages as well as their weapons.Moon has given other sermons, like one from 2023, in which he said \"all human beings should have the right to self-defense\" and that \"God sent good men with guns.\"This year's Rod of Iron Freedom Festival, which starts on Friday, will feature the premier of Retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn's movie Deliver the Truth. Whatever the Cost. at the Tommy Gun Warehouse Grounds in Greeley, Pennsylvania.Flynn was the White House national security adviser under Trump for less than a month before he resigned and was charged with lying to the FBI about conservations he had with Russians on Trump's behalf. He pleaded guilty twice but was eventually pardoned by Trump. Flynn, with Oklahoma entrepreneur Clay Clark, launched the ReAwaken America Tour, a far-right and Christian nationalist movement, and has been a leader in peddling claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.The rest of the Freedom Festival weekend features an art show, a session with Tom Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a talk by the author of STEALTH: Kamala Harris' Communist Roots, as well as a gun auction with proceeds benefiting the Friends of the NRA.A shooting range will also be an \"ongoing activity\" throughout Saturday and Sunday by the Kahr Firearms Group.Gun control does not rank as a top issue in an election mostly focused on the economy, despite several high-profile instances of gun violence this year that have come amid the presidential contest.The most shocking was on July 13, when Trump was grazed by a would-be assassin's bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. An AR-15 was used by Thomas Matthew Crooks to shoot the former president, striking his ear and killing one crowd member.On September 4, two students and two teachers were fatally shot by a student at Apalachee High School near Winder, Georgia.Two weeks ago, another would-be assassin hid in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, as the former president played. A Secret Service agent noticed the suspect before he was able to take a shot, possibly saving Trump's life again.As of March 2023, one in 20 Americans owned an AR-15, which was about 16 million people nationwide, according to research from The Washington Post and Ipsos.The Pew Research Center's June election polling showed voters \"have starkly different opinions\" about gun ownership, with 80 percent of President Joe Biden supporters saying it is important to control gun ownership. As almost identical inversion, 85 percent of Trump supporters had said it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns.On Wednesday, the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online surveys taken on September 26 and between September 29 and 30 found that 51 percent of likely voters believe the country needs stricter gun control laws.Earlier this week, Trump during a rally in Wisconsin called on gun owners to vote for him, saying that despite his endorsement from the National Rifle Association in May, gun owners don't \"vote much.\"A website lists a weapon, titled \"The MAGA Patriot AR 15,\" as an \"extremely limited, custom-designed, commemorative AR-15 designed to 'Trump' every other rifle available.\"The website states that behind the initiative is Caleb Lee, the founder of a shooting training center and \"boutique gun manufacturing firm\" in Alabama. The first 20 MAGA Patriot guns cost $2,997 each, and, according to the website, they come with six bonus gifts, including 30-round Magpul magazines, a \"covert\" rifle carrying soft case, a rifle training course at Lee's firing school and more.","summary":"Rod of Iron Ministries is hosting its annual Freedom Festival this weekend in Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-ar-15-rifles-freedom-festival-rod-iron-1967946","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493861/ar-15.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:37:34","author":"Monica Sager","authors":["Monica Sager"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.164},{"id":259385702,"title":"Donald Trump, Kamala Harris Odds of Winning in Every Major Poll This Week","text":"As the 2024 presidential race enters its final stretch, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain locked in a tight contest, with recent polling reflecting a highly competitive landscape.With the election just weeks away, each campaign has adopted different strategies to sway voters in these critical regions. Harris' team has significantly ramped up its media presence, investing heavily in digital and TV ads across key battleground states while conducting solo interviews on mainstream media.Meanwhile, Trump has scheduled rallies in solidly Democratic states where he has virtually no chance of winning. It's an unorthodox strategy that campaign advisers say is designed to focus on areas where Democratic policies have failed, with the purpose of attracting media coverage.Here's how they performed in major polls this week.Ipsos/Reuters Poll (October 4-7)An Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted from October 4 to 7 among 969 likely voters shows Harris with a 3-point lead over Trump, holding 46 percent support compared to Trump's 43 percent.Trump trailed 6 points in a similar Ipsos poll from September 20 to 23. The improvement suggests the race is tightening as he seeks to make inroads with key voter groups.YouGov/Economist Poll (October 6-7)A YouGov/Economist poll conducted between October 6 and 7 with 1,230 likely voters places Harris 4 points ahead, with 49 percent support compared to Trump's 45 percent. Harris's support has increased slightly by one percentage point from the previous YouGov survey. Trump's numbers remained steady at 45 percent, reflecting consistent backing from his base but struggles in reaching beyond it.The New York Times/Siena College Poll (September 29 - October 6)A survey by The New York Times/Siena College, conducted from September 29 to October 6 among 3,385 likely voters, shows Harris leading by 3 points, with 49 percent support against Trump's 46 percent. This is a positive shift for Harris compared to a mid-September poll that had the two candidates tied at 47 percent. This survey is often considered one of the more reliable indicators of national sentiment, highlighting evolving voter dynamics.Pew Research Center Poll (September 30 - October 6)The Pew Research Center poll, conducted from September 30 to October 6 with 4,025 registered voters, shows a closer race, with Harris at 48 percent and Trump at 47 percent. This represents a shift from an earlier Pew poll in late August and early September, where both candidates were tied at 49 percent. The change suggests that Harris has made gains among some undecided voters as the campaign enters its final phase.Despite trailing in every poll, this week brought encouraging signs for Trump. He received a boost from pollster Nate Silver, who suggested that the former president should feel more optimistic about the race.Silver's analysis showed that Trump was gaining slight ground against Harris. His Silver Bulletin presidential model, which tracks polling data and electoral trends, shifted 0.3 percentage points in favor of Trump over the past week, signaling a more competitive race as the campaigns head into the final stretch.The updated forecast reflects small but significant gains for Trump in key swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. These states, pivotal to Trump's 2016 win and his loss in 2020, are once again likely to determine the outcome of the presidential election.","summary":"As the 2024 race enters the final stretch, polls show a tight contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-odds-winning-every-major-poll-this-week-1967968","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2493907/kamala-harris-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:35:37","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":259386436,"title":"Harris was asked to name three of Trump’s ‘virtues’. She couldn’t","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris could not come up with three virtues about former president Donald Trump when she was asked to do so on Thursday evening at a Univision town hall event.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee laughed upon hearing the question, posed by an audience member, and immediately shared a negative trait about Trump that she does not like.\n\n“Let me start with this, based on a life experience I know that a vast majority of us have much more in common than what separates us and part of what paints me is the approach that, frankly, Donald Trump and some others have taken – which is to suggest that it’s us vs. them, whoever that may be,” Harris said.\n\nThe vice president condemned Trump for promoting a fearful mindset in Americans and encouraging people to “point fingers at each other.”\n\n“Using language that’s about belittling people and calling them names and meant to make them afraid and live in fear. I don’t think that’s healthy for our nation and I don’t admire that,” Harris said.\n\nTrump has been subject to criticisms lately about using degrading language to describe his opponents. He recently called Harris “a dumb person” and “mentally disabled” at rallies and has mocked her appearance to supporters.\n\nHe uses aggressive anti-immigration language while speaking about migrants and immigrants, calling them “illegals” and falsely claiming most of them are committing violent crimes.\n\nThe vice president then re-directed her attention to answering the question about Trump’s virtues, stumbling over words while trying to find an answer.\n\n“I think Donald Trump loves his family,” Harris said. “I think that’s very important. I think family is one of the most important things we can prioritize.”\n\nBut the vice president admitted she couldn’t offer a better answer because she doesn’t “really know” Trump – the first time the two met in person was on the debate stage back in September.\n\nIt has been a fraught election cycle, with Trump using incendiary language against fellow Republicans before he secured the nomination, before using equally inflammatory language to describe Joe Biden and Harris.\n\nRepublicans have urged Trump to stay on message and keep his attacks focused on Democrats’ policies rather than individual’s personality or appearance but the former president has so far struggled to do so.\n\nHarris has used Trump’s own words against himself when trying to appeal to voters. On Thursday evening she told audience members at the Univision town hall that Trump would be a dictator on day one – a reference to one of the former president’s quotes.\n\nThe town hall was part of Harris’s last-ditch efforts to woo Latino voters – who have historically voted Democrat but more recently flipped to support Trump.","summary":"Approaching the end of a contentious election year, Harris struggled to find positive qualities in here political opponent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-univision-trump-virtues-b2628086.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/11/21/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FTgOHb39-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:35:02","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":259387806,"title":"Aurora police chief says the city is still 'very safe' despite Trump's claims","text":"AURORA, Colo. — Former President Donald Trump painted a dark picture of Colorado’s third-largest city at a rally here Friday as he once again claimed it had been overtaken by a Venezuelan prison gang. But the city’s police chief told NBC News that Aurora is still “very safe.” “It's not overrun. Without question, Aurora is still a very safe city. It is still a wonderful community that is incredibly diverse,” Todd Chamberlain said. While there is some gang activity, he added, “what we hope to do is make sure that that gang doesn’t grow.” On the trail, Trump has highlighted a specific Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, known as TDA, after a social media clip went viral last month claiming that the gang had taken over an apartment complex in Aurora. Police at the time said there was no evidence the gang had taken over the complex, and Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman, a Republican, called Trump’s descriptions “not accurate.” At his rally Friday, Trump said immigrants coming from “the dungeons of the Third World, from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions” have preyed on “innocent Americans” across the country. “And no place is it more evident than right here,” he continued, “because in Aurora, multiple apartment complexes have been taken over by the savage Venezuela prison gang.” The narrative that immigrants have taken over the U.S. is central to Trump’s re-election campaign. Using increasingly inflammatory rhetoric, Trump has seized on other suburban areas with immigrant populations. Last month, he and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, were rebuked by local leaders after they repeatedly claimed that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were kidnapping and eating pets. At his rally Friday, Trump said he would “rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded.” He announced a plan, dubbed Operation Aurora, to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport members of TDA and other gangs. Chamberlain emphasized in his interview with NBC News that he did not want to be involved in a mass deportation effort and that regardless of immigration status, the job of law enforcement is to bring justice for crimes committed. “We are not in the business of deciding if you’re documented or undocumented. We’re in the business of making sure that if you commit crimes, we hold you accountable, or if you are victimized, we hold you near and we give you that support and those things that you need,” he said. Asked to respond to Chamberlain’s comments, Trump’s campaign spokesperson pointed to a series of news articles about gang violence she posted on X.","summary":"AURORA, Colo. — Former President Donald Trump painted a dark picture of Colorado’s third-largest city at a rally here Friday as he once again claimed it had been overtaken by a Venezuelan prison gang.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/odds-trump-aurora-police-chief-says-city-still-safe-rcna175094","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241011-donald-trump-ew-530p-a14148.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:32:20","author":"Annemarie Bonner,Garrett Haake,Olympia Sonnier","authors":["Annemarie Bonner","Garrett Haake","Olympia Sonnier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":259385544,"title":"Vice President Kamala Harris Explores New Ground in Media Visits, Potentially Leading to a Major Revelation in October","text":"Kamala Harris’ media whirlwind of the past few days may not move the needle much in the tight race against Donald Trump.\n\nStill, in all of the VP’s sit-downs this past week, a very Bill Clinton moment from last’s night Univision town hall might prove the most memorable in capturing voters’ attention.\n\n“She connected, she humanized herself with the way she listen more and spoke less with that poor woman,” a top Hollywood publicist says of Harris’ interaction as a sobbing Ivett Castillo, told the Harris and viewers of the Enrique Acevedo-moderated primetime event of the death of her undocumented mother six weeks ago and the shadows that “subgroup of immigrants” live in.\n\n“The viral moment when the vice president went over to her after the town hall was over, that’s more important that anything else, anything that was said last night,” the publicist said.\n\nHarris in the past week has greatly upped her media presence, after some criticism that Trump was too dominant in the conversation.\n\nA number of Hollywood backers were pleased with her recent media moves, but still wonder about the impact in a media environment that is a perpetual battle for attention. With Trump declining to do another debate, there are no more major events that can capture a mass audience.\n\n“She has to break through the news silos in these final weeks, that’s how to get to the undecideds,” notes a veteran Democratic political operative of the estimated less than 10% of voters who haven’t locked in a candidate yet. “The network interviews, podcasts, all that stuff is good, but it’s the unexpected situations, like calling into The Weather Channel, drinking a beer with Colbert, that’s the takeaway.”\n\nHarris’ schedule was a weave between mainstream media and more apolitical avenues.\n\nMathew Littman, a former Biden speechwriter who leads a group of creative professionals engaged in Democratic politics called The Working Group, said Harris’ visit to the Call Her Daddy podcast and her sit-down with Howard Stern are what the campaign should be doing. \n\n“There is a strategy to this stuff,” he said. “These complaints from old media [that Harris is not engaging with them] are absolutely ridiculous.” It reflects where the voters she needs to reach are now, he said.\n\n“Not only do I think it is a good idea, we should have been doing it a long time ago,” he said. \n\nHe noted that Trump has done few challenging traditional media interviews. His appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists is one of the few. “Has he done anything where no one asks him a difficult question? The truth is you don’t have to anymore,” he said. The point is to reach voters who may not be paying attention or are still persuadable.\n\nThe Call Her Daddy podcast, for instance, is the second biggest podcast on Spotify and, according to Edison Research, has an audience where 76% are under 35. Host Alex Cooper also has said that her listeners are politically diverse. What’s more, Cooper has a social media presence that amplified Harris’ appearance, including a behind-the-scenes post on TikTok.\n\n“The Stern interview was the highlight, it felt very natural,” stated a regular deep-pocket Democratic donor of the VP’s media tour and the hour-plus chat with Stern, who is openly anti-Trump. “But it’s still a process,” he added of Harris’ effort to reach the pockets of undecideds she needs in early voting and on Election Day.\n\n“Maybe a Taylor Swift rally with [Bruce] Springsteen there could cross over, some social media event, whatever it is, she needs an October surprise that grabs persuadable voters,” a media executive tells Deadline, noting two of the VP’s biggest celebrity endorsements.\n\nAdditionally, in the Harris campaign’s pursuit of non-legacy media, it has become evident in tone, language and outcome that this is a different type of election in terms of standards of conduct and association. “She had guts to do Stern, who the very next day did a Cocktober gay-themed bit, and Call Her Daddy, which is so raunchy,” said a longtime media and political consultant. “We are past the days of backlash on that stuff.”\n\nAdditionally, as Deadline exclusively reported, Harris’ VP nominee Gov. Tim Walz taped a session on Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett’s bromance Smartless podcast that is scheduled to post in the next week or so. He’s also scheduled to appear on Fox News Sunday this weekend, for a second week in a row.\n\nTo that end, a Hollywood insider believes that Trump “failed this week” as a guest on the comedy podcast Flagrant and by insulting Motor City at the Detroit Economic Club. Still, despite the media action, the VP’s poll numbers haven’t moved nationally, and some battleground states are seeing Trump’s numbers go up.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to request for comment from Deadline on the media stops of the former president and Harris.\n\nTrump has tried to mute the impact of Harris’ appearances. He declined to sit down with 60 Minutes, but after Harris’ interview ran Monday night, he went on a tear over an edit that the newsmagazine made to one of her answers. Newsmagazines routinely edit interviews, but Trump has claimed they were trying to help Harris and, mirroring his past attacks on the press, he has called for CBS to lose its broadcast license over it.\n\nRELATED: FCC Chairwoman Condemns Donald Trump’s Calls For CBS To Lose Licenses Over ‘60 Minutes’ Kamala Harris Interview\n\nLater in the week, after Harris’ Univision town hall, Trump’s allies quickly spread the false claim that she had the aid of a Teleprompter. Univision’s Acevedo debunked the claim shortly after the town hall aired, but it continued to be repeated by figures like Vivek Ramaswamy and news outlets like Newsmax.\n\nHighlighted by a scheduled appearance in Detroit next week with the perpetually blunt radio host Charlamagne tha God, Harris will continue her schedule of media hits. An October 23 town hall on CNN with Anderson Cooper in Pennsylvania — in lieu of a now-dead debate with Trump — is also on the calendar.\n\nAs Harris has ramped up her media after taking criticism for a paucity of interviews, her campaign has pointed out that Trump has been largely choosing friendly outlets. “After backing out of 60 Minutes and doing 27 straight interviews with conservative media, unfortunately it is clear Trump would rather cocoon himself in safe spaces and avoid real questions about his harmful plans and failed divisive leadership,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement Thursday.\n\nTrump has yet to agree to his own CNN town hall, but will do a pre-taped Fox News town hall in Georgia on October 15 with Harris Faulkner and an all-female audience.\n\nStill, some political veterans say no matter how well funded and strong the Harris campaign is, the VP needs to go into the lion’s den in the final days of the race to snag the voters she needs, energize male voters on the fence, and slap down Trump in front of his MAGA base.\n\n“If she really wanted to show she’s fearless and ready to go, she’d go on Fox with Bret Baier one on one and maybe even Megyn Kelly,” says a Democratic insider, adding that HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher could be another good raid into more conservative and male-centric territory.\n\n“In an election this close, that’s how you win, surprise attack and direct interactions with voters, like on that Univision town hall,” a media executive exclaims. “Harris has to upset the table to win the game.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris’ media whirlwind of the past few days may not move&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vice President Kamala Harris Explores New Ground in Media Visits, Potentially Leading to a Major Revelation in October first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/vice-president-kamala-harris-explores-new-ground-in-media-visits-potentially-leading-to-a-major-revelation-in-october/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Charlamagne-Tha-God-Harris-Faulkner-Donald-Trump-1.jpg?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:31:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":259390044,"title":"Jake Tapper Wrote ‘Holy Smokes’ to Control Room During Biden’s Awful Debate: ‘Something to Behold’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Jake Tapper revealed his response to President Joe Biden’s first and only debate against GOP presidential contender Donald Trump: “Holy smokes.”\n\n“It was something to behold,” Tapper, who moderated the June 27 debate, told Seth Meyers. The CNN anchor explained his visceral reaction that night during an appearance on “Late Night with Seth Meyers.”\n\n“We had these little iPads in front, so we could communicate with the control room. And yeah, within the first few moments I wrote, ‘Holy smokes,’” Tapper shared. As Meyers threw him a wry look following Tapper’s clean language, the journalist replied, “I didn’t know who was going to be back in the control room. I had to keep it clean.”\n\nBut as far as his shock, Tapper didn’t think he was alone in feeling that way: “That was kind of the national reaction.”\n\nAs Tapper said, many Americans — including Biden’s own political party — were taken aback by his performance. After a series of attacks against Biden’s age, some public flubs and concerns from Americans about Biden’s mental capability, the president ended up stepping down from the 2024 presidential race, passing the baton to Kamala Harris to cross the finish line.\n\nMeyers and Tapper moved on to discuss how Trump and Harris are currently doing in the polls, saying it’s a tight race that may remain within the margin of error up through Election Day.\n\n“They’re both running campaigns as if they are 10 points ahead. They’re both kind of running cautious-ish campaigns. I mean, there’s still the ‘cats and dogs eating’ thing,” Tapper said, referring to the debunked claims that Haitian migrants are eating Ohioans’ domesticated pets.\n\n“I guest I’m distinguishing between the campaign and the candidate. The campaign is relatively cautious. The candidate is, you know… he’s doing his thing,” the cable news journalist added of Trump.\n\nHarris battled it out with Trump on Sept. 10, reinvigorating Democrats’ hopes to keep the party in the White House. Since then, Harris has challenged Trump to a second debate. However, so far, Trump has refused to step back up to the podium for another round — which Harris recently called “a pretty weak move.”\n\n“I think it’s a disservice to the voters. I also think, it’s a pretty weak move,” Harris said at a rally in Chandler, Ariz. on Thursday. “But even if he will not debate, the contrast in this election is already clear.

It’s no secret that some polls have shown that Donald Trump, in the last year or so, has gained marginal support among Black people, mostly Black men, which is why Obama took the time to “speak some truths” on the matter. Before we get into Pierce’s response, here’s a quick recap of what all Obama said, via NPR: “My understanding, based on reports I’m getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,” he said. “That lack of enthusiasm for Harris,” he said, “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.” He chided voters who were voting for Trump or not casting a vote at all. “And you are thinking about sitting out?” he said. “Part of it makes me think — and I’m speaking to men directly — part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” Obama said, “women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time.” “When we get in trouble and the system isn’t working for us, they’re the ones out there marching and protesting,” he said. Now, here’s how Pierce responded: “Awful message,” The Wire actor tweeted. “The party has to stop scapegoating Black men. Black men aren’t the problem. White men and White women are. No other group votes at 87-90% for Dems but Black folk. Men and women. That is a false flag. Black men voting for Trump is insignificant. This accusatorial tone will make some Black men stay home-which is worse. Black men are questioning our party to find out what their loyalty for decades earns them. That’s good. That’s healthy. Democrats have the record to stand on and should embrace the challenge. But after touring this country specifically engaging Black men, I will not let my party leaders speak [condescendingly] towards them.” So, for the most part, Pierce is right. The thing Obama appears to be missing is that when it comes to Black voter turnout, his elections, especially in 2012, have been the outliers. Ninety-three percent of Black voters voted for Obama in 2008 and that number rose to 95% in 2012. In fact, 2012 represents the only year when Black voter turnout was higher than white voter turnout per capita. In 2008 and 2012, Black voter turnout was the highest it had been since 1964, and it hasn’t been that high in the two elections since. Furthermore, in 2020, only 87% of Black voters voted for Joe Biden. In 2000, 90% of Black voters voted for Al Gore over George W. Bush, and that number dropped to 88% in 2004, when Bush beat John Kerry. In all cases, Black women voted Democrat at higher percentages than Black men. For example, 96% of Black women vs. 87% of Black men voted for Obama in 2012, and that bridge between Black women and men was similar in 2016 and 2020. But, really, none of this matters, because, when it comes down to it, what Pierce pointed out leads to the more relevant question: Why are we even talking about how Black men vote when the overwhelming majority of them still vote Democrat, and will still vote that way in November? Let’s say, for the sake of argument, 20% of Black men vote for Trump in November. That would still mean 80% voted for Harris, which means, just like in every election for the past few decades at least, more Black men will vote Democrat than men in any other racial group — by a lot. Notably, that’s an extremely generous hypothetical. Regardless of the slight uptick in Black Trump support, Black men are still an overwhelmingly Democratic base, and that is not likely to change any time soon. From the Philadelphia Inquirer: But despite his campaign’s outreach, any narrative that suggests Harris might lose out on support from young Black men ignores the data. Black people under 50 are virtually no more likely to vote Republican in 2024 than they were 30 years ago, said Kiana Cox, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. In 1994, 16% of Black voters younger than 50 leaned Republican. Today, said Cox, that number is 17%. An AP-NORC poll conducted in mid-September found most Black voters of all ages and genders viewed Trump negatively, with only 15% reporting a somewhat or very favorable view of him — a slim percentage in line with the Republican preference seen among Black voters over the last 30 years. Political experts and organizers — who are also Black men under 50 — said the hysteria about their demographic defecting to the Republican Party is at best overblown and, at worst, an attempt to cast blame on Black men in the event Harris loses to Trump. No poll has shown such a significant increase in Black support for Trump that it would even come close to being the reason the election swings his way. As Pierce noted, if that’s the way it shakes out next month, we will largely have white voters to thank as they will be what they have been for decades — the only majority racial demographic that votes Republican. White people have voted overwhelmingly for Trump two elections in a row, and they will for a third time in November. There’s so much media scrutiny when it comes to minority voters, while the GOP’s most loyal voter base largely goes un-examined. Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean Obama should have focused his attention on white people. I’m not even sure what the point would have been for him to try appealing to the same demographic that pressured him to show two forms of his birth certificate to prove he was eligible to be president after he was elected. Obama appeared to be going for a “Black man to Black man” approach, which is arguably understandable. But when Black people — men and women — are the most loyal voting bloc for a party that never really has to work very hard to earn our votes apart from being demonstrably less racist than the other side, it just seems kind of arbitrary.

Biden earned 306 Electoral College votes, out of a total of 538, earning him the presidency. Trump only nabbed 232.\n\nIn the aftermath of the results, Trump blasted the election as “stolen”. On January 6, 2021, he held a rally in Washington, DC, to encourage his followers to “stop the steal” and demonstrate in front of the US Capitol.\n\nThousands did, and violence erupted in and around the Capitol building, where the Electoral College votes were being certified by Congress.\n\nTrump has also been accused of pressuring his then-vice president, Mike Pence, not to certify the votes, as mandated by the Constitution. Pence held a ceremonial role on January 6, overseeing the result count.\n\nWhen Pence refused to heed Trump’s call to circumvent the vote, Trump slammed his second-in-command as lacking “courage”.\n\n]After leaving the White House, Trump’s campaign and allies lost dozens of lawsuits alleging fraud in the 2020 election. Trump himself faces criminal charges for allegedly interfering in the election, with the events of January 6 included as evidence.","summary":"The US vice presidential candidate and senator brushed aside scrutiny of Trump&#039;s record of election denialism.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/11/in-new-interview-jd-vance-dodges-questions-about-trumps-2020-defeat?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-15T191440Z_1063180486_RC2V3L9RTIIA_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-VANCE-1721264308.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-11 22:30:53","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.077},{"id":259386588,"title":"Walz wallops Trump’s trade hypocrisy: ‘He outsourced God to China’","text":"Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz had some fun at Donald Trump’s expense in Michigan on Friday. \n\nDuring a campaign event, where Walz also detailed how destructive Trump’s White House stay had been for American workers, Walz went on a run about Trump's big talk about China—and his “God Bless the USA” Bible.\n\n\"Trump's all talk when it comes to being tough on China.
