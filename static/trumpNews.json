The 10 detainees in the lawsuit are all men from Pakistan and three other countries with final deportation orders, including some who have been threatened with transfer to Guantanamo, ACLU said.\n\nUS Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday called the ACLU legal challenge “baseless” and said the agency would work with the Justice Department to fight the lawsuit.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to deport record numbers of immigrants who are in the US illegally. As part of efforts to expand deportations, the administration in early February began sending migrants to a detention camp on the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, best known for holding foreign terrorism suspects.\n\nCuban and Haitian migrants intercepted at sea have been held at a migrant facility on the base for decades. However, the Trump administration’s effort was the first to transfer migrants there from the America, according to ACLU.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed they were sending only “the worst of the worst” to Guantanamo, but about a third of the initial group of 177 Venezuelans had no criminal record, according to the department.\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit apprised the court that migrants detained at Guantanamo had been “held in windowless rooms for at least 23 hours per day, subjected to invasive strip searches, and unable to contact family members”.\n\nThe suit said that guards “engage in verbal and physical abuse”, including strapping detainees to a chair, withholding water, threatening to shoot detainees, and fracturing one person’s hand. “These degrading conditions and extreme isolation have led to several suicide attempts,” the complaint said. \n\nA federal judge blocked the possible transfer of several Venezuelan migrants to Guantanamo in mid-February, but the men — also represented by ACLU — were then deported to Venezuela.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025","summary":"• Migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh among those threatened with transfer to the US naval base\n\n• Court apprised of harsh conditions compelling inmates to attempt suicide\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON: A US civil rights group has sued to block the Trump administration from potentially transferring 10 migrants from Pakistan, Bang­ladesh, Afghanistan and Venezuela to a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detailing harsh conditions and suicide attempts among migrants held there. \n\n\n\nThe men, currently held in Texas, Arizona and Virginia, are not gang members or high-risk criminals, said the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the lawsuit it filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. on Saturday. \n\n\n\nThe civil rights group argued that the transfers violate US immigration law by moving the detainees out of the country and aim to stoke fear without a legitimate rationale.

One signed in January put a halt to refugee admissions, calling them “detrimental to the interests of the United States”.\n\nThe administration then froze funding for organisations in the refugee programme. A US court has since blocked the order.\n\nTrump also signed an order seeking to reinterpret the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which decrees anyone born on US soil is a citizen.

Everyone around this table,” he told the Ukrainian leader.\n\nZelensky was embraced by some of the 18 other top leaders, including Starmer, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Nato chief Mark Rutte, while protesters rallied outside the UK leader’s home in support of Ukraine.\n\nIt was a stark contrast to Zelensky’s unusually heated Friday meeting with Trump in Washington, where he was berated by the American leader and accused of not being “ready” for peace with Russia.\n\n‘Avoid dividing West’\n\nSpeaking ahead of the summit in London, Starmer said “nobody wants to see” scenes like Oval Office clash.\n\n“We have to find a way that we can all work together. Because, in the end, we’ve had three years of bloody conflict. Now we need to get to that lasting peace,” Starmer told the BBC.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni echoed the sentiment, saying as she met Starmer in his Downing Street home that it was “very, very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides”.\n\nWhile Ukraine’s allies have been underscoring their steadfast commitment to counter growing concerns that Trump is about to sell Kyiv short in negotiations with Russia, top Washington officials suggested on Sunday that Zelensky might have to step down if a peace deal is to be reached. \n\n“We need a leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war,” National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told CNN.\n\n“And if it becomes apparent that President Zelensky’s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.” \n\nWhile European leaders have rallied around Ukraine, Republican officials appeared on news programmes questioning whether any deal could be reached with Russia so long as Zelensky remains.\n\n“Either he needs to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude, or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,” said Republican Mike Johnson, speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n“I mean, it’s up to the Ukrainians to figure that out, but... we need President Zelensky to do what is necessary.” \n\nSenior Democrats say Trump has come dangerously close to an all-out embrace of Russia. “The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin,” said Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who has emerged as one of Trump’s most outspoken critics. “It appears America is trying to align itself with dictators,” he said on CNN.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio insisted, however, that the White House was clear-eyed about Putin’s Russia. “No one here is claiming Vladimir Putin is going to get the Nobel Peace prize this year,” he said on ABC.\n\nRubio added, however, that the first step in securing peace is to get the parties to talk together. “You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table,” he said.\n\n“I’m not promising you it’s possible,” he added. “I’m not telling you it’s 90 per cent likely. I’m saying it’s zero per cent likely if we don’t get them to a negotiating table.” \n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025","summary":"• Starmer warns European security facing ‘once-in-a-generation moment’\n\n• Republican officials question if peace is possible as long as Ukrainian leader remains in power\n\n\n\nLONDON: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sunday warned that European security faced a once-in-a-generation moment, as he hosted crisis talks in London on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, just days after a Kyiv-Washington clash.\n\n\n\nEighteen allies were gathered on the key question of security guarantees for Ukraine, all the more pressing after US President Donald Trump berated his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in an unprecedented White House blow-up.\n\n\n\nSitting next to Zelensky in front of the flags of Ukraine and European nations, summit host Starmer said it was “a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe and we all need to step up”.\n\n\n\n“I hope you know that we are all with you and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes.

The president of Ukraine will have to be chosen not in Lindsay Graham’s home but in Ukraine,’ he told Sky News.\n\nWhen the Ukrainian president was asked if he could stand down in the event his country becomes a Nato member, he replied in Ukrainian via a translator: ‘I am exchangeable for NATO.’\n\nZelensky added: ‘I have said that I am exchanging for Nato membership, then it means I have fulfilled my mission. NATO means I have fulfilled my mission.’\n\nDespite his extraordinary White House bust-up with US President Trump, Zelensky also said Ukraine was ‘grateful to the people of the US’. ‘We are grateful to all the societies in the countries that support us. We are very thankful,’ he continued. \n\nThis comes after European leaders from 18 countries scrambled to forge a Ukraine strategy at a crisis summit yesterday following the disastrous meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nEuropean powers must realise it is ‘time to act’ as they stand at a ‘crossroads in history’, Sir Keir Starmer said following the summit after telling leaders: ‘This is a once-in-a-generation moment for the security of Europe and we all need to step up.’\n\nAfter embracing Zelensky on the steps of Lancaster House in London, the PM told him ‘we are all with you’ and urged the gathering to step up to a ‘once in a generation moment’.\n\nEmmanuel Macron and Giorgia Meloni were present as Britain, France and Italy look set to take key roles in a ‘coalition of the willing’ to enforce any peace deal with Russia.\n\nThe leaders – also including Germany, Canada, Poland, Denmark and Sweden – are expected to signal a ramping up of defence spending. \n\nBefore arriving in London, French president Emmanuel Macron suggested in an interview with a French newspaper that he and Starmer are proposing a ‘truce in the air, on the seas and energy infrastructures’ that would last a month.\n\nThere would be no European troops in the coming weeks and troops would only be deployed on the ground at a later stage, he said.\n\nThe question, Macron said, is ‘how we use this time to try and get an accessible truce, with negotiations that will take several weeks and then, once peace is signed, a deployment.’\n\nMacron also suggested that European countries should increase their defence spending to about 3 to 3.5 per cent of their GDP. France’s defence spending is at roughly 2.1 per cent, according to data from 2023. \n\nSpeaking to broadcasters outside Lancaster House, EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Ukraine must have the ‘means to fortify and protect itself’ in economic and military terms. \n\nThe EU commission president added that ‘therefore the focus is not only on the military supply but also for example securing their energy system’. Von der Leyen also revealed she will present ‘a comprehensive plan to rearm Europe’ on Thursday.\n\nShe called for an increase in defence spending among European countries and said that Ukraine should be turned into a ‘steel porcupine’ that would be ‘indigestible’ to invaders.\n\nGiorgia Meloni said that in a ‘precious moment’ it is ‘very important to talk to each other, to co-ordinate’.\n\nShe said: ‘We are all very committed about a goal that we all want to achieve, which is a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.\n\n‘I think it is very, very important that we avoid the risk that the West divides. I think on this the UK and Italy can play an important role in bridge-building.’\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that a focus for allies will be to ensure that Ukraine has a strong army when the war there is over so that it can defend itself against any future aggression. ‘The basis of everything will be a strong army,’ he said.\n\nThe Chancellor added that a halt in fighting could be a starting point for potential peace talks for Ukraine.\n\n‘It would be very helpful if the bombing were to stop…That would also be the starting point for talks that can then continue,’ Scholz told journalists after a meeting of European leaders in London.\n\nPoland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that no one in the West has any intention of capitulating to Putin’s ‘blackmail and aggression’, adding that Europe had ‘woken up’.\n\n‘The best way to discourage Putin and other aggressors is to build our own strength, and the best way to convince President Trump to want to strengthen cooperation with Europe, and not weaken it, is our European strength. Everyone will want to work with a strong partner,’ Tusk told Polish reporters.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country had ‘an important role to play’ after attending the summit with other leaders. \n\n‘Canada has been one of the strongest countries in support of Ukraine from the very beginning, for over 10 years now we’ve been training Ukrainian defence forces,’ Mr Trudeau said. \n\nNATO chief Mark Rutte pointed to promises from more European countries to ‘ramp up defence spending’, while insisting that Washington remained committed to the transatlantic alliance. \n\nRutte did not name which countries promised to ramp up their defence budgets.\n\nThe defence spending of European allies has long been talked about by Trump, who said many were missing their NATO spending target of two per cent of their GDP.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky last night said that the peace summit in London ‘was dedicated to Ukraine and our shared European future’.\n\n‘We feel strong support for Ukraine, for our people – both soldiers and civilians, and our independence,’ he said in a tweet on X. \n\nThe Ukrainian President added: ‘Together, we are working in Europe to establish a solid foundation for cooperation with the United States in pursuit of true peace and guaranteed security. Europe’s unity is at an exceptionally high level, one that has not been seen in a long time. \n\n‘We are discussing with our partners security guarantees and the conditions for a just peace for Ukraine. A series of important meetings and decisions are being prepared for the near future. \n\n‘I am grateful to all our friends and partners for their efforts in bringing about a stable and guaranteed peace in Ukraine. Joint strength can protect our future.’ \n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir unveiled a four-step plan discussed by leaders at the meeting, including a pledge to ‘develop a coalition of the willing’ to defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee a peace settlement.\n\nThe Prime Minister announced a £1.6 billion finance deal which will allow Ukraine to buy more than 5,000 missiles, following the gathering at Lancaster House.\n\nSir Keir told the press conference that ‘every nation must contribute’ in the best way it can and a number of ‘important steps’ were agreed.\n\nHe said: ‘First, we will keep the military aid flowing and keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia to strengthen Ukraine now.\n\n‘Second, we agreed that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security, and Ukraine must be at the table.\n\n‘Third, in the event of a peace deal, we will keep boosting Ukraine’s own defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion.\n\n‘Fourth, we will go further to develop a coalition of the willing to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee the peace.\n\n‘Not every nation will feel able to contribute but that can’t mean that we sit back. Instead, those willing will intensify planning now with real urgency. \n\n‘The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.’\n\nSir Keir also stressed that ‘if you want to preserve the peace, you have to be prepared to defend the peace’. He added: ‘I want to avoid conflict. I do not want conflict in Ukraine, in Europe and certainly not in the United Kingdom. \n\n‘I want stability in the United Kingdom. The way to ensure that stability is to ensure we are able to defend a deal in Ukraine. Because the one thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe it will wash up on our shores.’ \n\nZelensky also met with King Charles after the summit, with his helicopter touching down at Sandringham at around 5.25pm on Sunday.\n\nBoth were pictured smiling side-by-side as they shook hands. Charles was even seen patting Zelensky’s arm as they posed for pictures outside the estate. \n\n‘The president was warmly received, and the meeting lasted just under an hour’, the Palace said after the meeting. \n\nA helicopter could be seen departing the Sandringham estate in Norfolk at 6.35pm, following the meeting between the King and Zelensky.\n\nBut Sir Keir played down the prospect of Trump’s state visit invite being withdrawn in the wake of his spat with Zelensky.\n\nJohn Swinney, Scotland’s First Minister, was among those urging for a withdrawal of the invitation. He said the offer should be rescinded unless Trump’s administration gives ‘full scale backing’ to Ukraine, the Daily Mirror reports. \n\nThe PM stressed that the invitation was a ‘matter for the King’ but swiped at people ‘trying to ramp up the rhetoric’ over the White House chaos.\n\nNo10 sources were adamant that there is no chance of the visit being axed, despite a furious backlash at the ‘humiliation’ of the Ukraine president in the Oval Office.\n\nDuring his trip to the White House earlier this week, Sir Keir presented the US President leader with a letter from the King inviting him for an unprecedented second state visit.\n\nPresident Trump was hosted by the late Queen in 2019. Other second-term US presidents such as George W Bush and Barack Obama are usually only invited for tea or lunch.\n\nThe US president is known to be an admirer of the Royal Family, and the state visit was seen as a major tool in Sir Keir’s diplomatic armoury.\n\nKing Charles previously praised the ‘determination and strength’ of the Ukrainian people in a message marking the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion in February 2024.\n\nCharles III said he was ‘greatly encouraged’ by the efforts of the UK and its allies in supporting Ukraine ‘at this time of such great suffering and need’.\n\nHe said: ‘The determination and strength of the Ukrainian people continues to inspire, as the unprovoked attack on their land, their lives and livelihoods enters a third, tragic, year.\n\n‘Despite the tremendous hardship and pain inflicted upon them, Ukrainians continue to show the heroism with which the world associates them so closely.\n\n‘Theirs is true valour, in the face of indescribable aggression. I have felt this personally in the many meetings I have had with Ukrainians since the start of the war, from President Zelensky and Mrs Zelenska, to new army recruits training here in the United Kingdom.\n\n‘I continue to be greatly encouraged that the United Kingdom and our allies remain at the forefront of international efforts to support Ukraine at this time of such great suffering and need.\n\n‘My heart goes out to all those affected, as I remember them in my thoughts and prayers.’\n\nZelensky met Charles on his first visit to the UK after Russia invaded his country in 2023, calling the audience a ‘truly special moment for me, for our country’. The two met again in July 2024 at Blenheim Palace.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has said that he is &#8216;ready to sign&#8217; the minerals&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Volodymyr Zelensky is willing to finalize minerals deal with the US and emphasizes the importance of Ukraine&#8217;s position being acknowledged during Oval Office meeting with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/volodymyr-zelensky-is-willing-to-finalize-minerals-deal-with-the-us-and-emphasizes-the-importance-of-ukraines-position-being-acknowledged-during-oval-office-meeting-with-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/02/21/95753355-0-image-a-67_1740952445599.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:59:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":296016758,"title":"Fans all saying the same thing about Conan O'Brien hosting the Oscars 2025 with wild opening monologue","text":"Fans all saying the same thing about Conan O'Brien hosting the Oscars 2025 with wild opening monologue\n\nREAD MORE: Academy Awards winners on Hollywood's biggest night \n\nREAD MORE: Oscars 2025 Best dressed! \n\nREAD MORE: Oscars 2025 LIVE BLOG \n\nBy EVE BUCKLAND FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 00:29 GMT, 3 March 2025 | Updated: 01:00 GMT, 3 March 2025\n\nOscars 2025 host Conan O'Brien had fans all saying the same thing as he kicked off his wild opening monologue on Sunday.\n\nO'Brien, 61, who was keen to impress in his debut hosting Hollywood's biggest night, made a shock dig at Emilia Perez star Karla Sofia Gascon's tweet scandal and Timothee Chalamet's outfit during his opening monologue.\n\nO'Brien personally called out the Best Actress nominee, who has been embroiled in social media controversy after her racist and anti-Muslim tweets resurfaced and went viral.\n\nHe later quipped about A Complete Unknown Best Actor nominee Chalamet, 29, who was sat next to his baffled girlfriend Kylie Jenner, 27, claiming his yellow suit would ensure 'no bikes hit him.'\n\nO'Brien said: 'Anora uses the f-word 479 times.

In moments such as this, any award show can seem self-indulgent and superfluous. \n\nKylie Jenner kisses Timothee Chalamet at Oscars 2025 in first outing since Jesus Guerrero's death\n\n'But what I want to do is have us all remember why we gather here tonight, okay? Yes, we will honor beautiful and talented a-list stars, but the Oscars also shines a light on an incredible community of people you will never see. Craftspeople. Artisans, technicians, costumers. \n\n'That's right. I can't name them all, there are too many. Hard-working men and women behind the camera who have devoted their lives to making film. Now, yes, many people we celebrate tonight are not famous, they're not wealthy. But they are devoted to a craft that can in moments bring us all a little closer together. \n\n'Now, for almost a century, we have paused every spring to elevate and celebrate an art form. It has the power at its very best, to unite us. So, yes, even in the face of terrible wildfires and divisive politics, the work, which this is about, the work continues. \n\n'And next year, and for years to come, through trauma and joy, this seemingly absurd ritual is going to be here. I will not. I'm leaving Hollywood to run a bed and breakfast in Orlando. And I'd like to see you there. But the magic, the madness, the grandeur and joy of film worldwide is going to be with u.'\n\nFans lauded O'Brien for rising to the occasion and begged for him to 'host every year.' \n\nOne fan wrote of the Gascon dig: 'dragging her in the opening monologue with her sitting right in front of you, conan i’m so fond of you! #oscars.'\n\nOthers wrote: 'conan is absolutely killing it.'\n\n'Eating dinner and watching Conan coming out of Demi moore was hard, but I gotta say, he is doing a great job!'\n\n'Conan should host the Oscars next year, he's very good!' \n\nO'Brien had earlier shocked fans with a The Substance parody as he dove out of Demi Moore's body and then jumped back in to find his shoe. \n\nThe 97th Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nO'Brien previously joked: 'I only agreed to host so that I could get invited.'\n\nThis year's ceremony has an unusually unsettled field in many of the most high-profile categories, including best picture and most of the acting categories.\n\nEmilia Pérez leads the nominations this year with 13, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña), director (for Jacques Audiard), adapted screenplay and original song.\n\nGascón stars as the title character, a former Mexican drug lord who comes out as a transgender woman and fakes her own death in order to reinvent herself as a pro-social force, while Saldaña plays an ethically challenged lawyer who helps set up her new identity.\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay.\n\nConan's hilarious opening skit saw him parody The Substance\n\nHe crawled out of Demi Moore's body in the gory scenes\n\nEmilia Pérez leads this year's Oscar nominees with 13 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña) and director\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay\n\nBrody stars as a Jewish Hungarian architect who immigrates to the US after surviving the Holocaust. The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\n\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \n\nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \n\nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\n\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \n\nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande) \n\nThis year's best lead actor race is up in the air after Timothée Chalamet's recent SAG win for A Complete Unknown\n\nBrody is also a favorite for The Brutalist, but Ralph Fiennes has gotten plenty of awards-season attention for the papal-selection drama Conclave\n\nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\n\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \n\nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \n\nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \n\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\n\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\n\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \n\nAnora's Mikey Madison is a late-breaking best actress co-frontrunner after recent wins and controversy that erupted after offensive tweets from Emilia Pérez's Karla Sofía Gascón resurfaced\n\nDemi Moore is the other major frontrunner for the satirical body-horror film The Substance. She has won multiple major awards this season\n\nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\n\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \n\nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\n\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \n\nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\n\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\n\nSaldaña appears to be the favorite in the supporting actress category after a string of wins\n\nKieran Culkin has dominated the supporting actor categories in recent weeks for Jesse Eisenberg's drama A Real Pain\n\nAfter Gascón's offensive tweets surfaced, Emilia Pérez's best picture frontrunner status seemed in question, and Anora has snatched up the top award at multiple ceremonies considered major predictors of the Oscars\n\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \n\nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\n\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\n\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live. \n\nOscar winners 2025 full list - see who received honors for this year's Academy Awards\n\n Best Picture\n\nThe Brutalist \n\nA Complete Unknown \n\nDune: Part Two \n\nEmilia Pérez \n\nI’m Still Here \n\nNickel Boys \n\nThe Substance \n\nEmilia Pérez leads this year's Oscar nominees with 13, including for best picture, actress, supporting actress and director\n\nBest Director \n\nJacques Audiard — Emilia Pérez\n\nSean Baker — Anora\n\nBrady Corbet — The Brutalist\n\nCoralie Fargeat — The Substance\n\nJames Mangold — A Complete Unknown\n\nActress in a Leading Role\n\nCynthia Erivo — Wicked \n\nKarla Sofía Gascón — Emilia Pérez\n\nMikey Madison — Anora \n\nDemi Moore — The Substance \n\nFernanda Torres — I’m Still Here \n\nThe Substance has been nominated for numerous Oscars, including Best Actress for Demi Moore \n\nActor in a Leading Role\n\nAdrien Brody — The Brutalist \n\nTimothée Chalamet — A Complete Unknown \n\nColman Domingo — Sing Sing \n\nRalph Fiennes — Conclave \n\nThe Brutalist came in second place with 10 nods, including for best picture, actor (Adrien Brody), supporting actor (Guy Peare) and supporting actress (Felicity Jones)\n\nActress in a Supporting Role\n\nMonica Barbaro — A Complete Unknown \n\nAriana Grande — Wicked \n\nFelicity Jones — The Brutalist \n\nIsabella Rossellini — Conclave \n\nZoe Saldaña — Emilia Pérez \n\nActor in a Supporting Role\n\nYura Borisov — Anora \n\nKieran Culkin — A Real Pain - WINNER\n\nEdward Norton — A Complete Unknown \n\nGuy Pearce — The Brutalist \n\nJeremy Strong — The Apprentice \n\nAnimated Feature Film\n\nFlow - WINNER\n\nInside Out 2\n\nMemoir of a Snail \n\nWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n\nThe Wild Robot\n\nCinematography\n\nThe Brutalist — Lol Crawley\n\nDune: Part Two — Greig Fraser\n\nEmilia Pérez — Paul Guilhaume \n\nMaria — Ed Lachman \n\nNosferatu — Jarin Blaschke\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nAnora — Sean Baker\n\nThe Brutalist — Brady Corbet & Mona Fastvold \n\nA Real Pain — Jesse Eisenberg\n\nSeptember 5 — Moritz Binder, Tim Fehlbaum;

No more.\n\nThe contest burst into motion Sunday as a new front-runner, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, began a comeback campaign in lower Manhattan, and Mayor Eric Adams and seven fellow Democrats fanned out across the city to try to stop him.\n\nFresh off announcing his candidacy, Cuomo, 67, reintroduced himself to fellow New Yorkers, thinner and grayer after three years in the political wilderness. He presented himself to a crowd of family and loyal supporters as a battle-tested executive ready to reassert control over a city \"in chaos\" while keeping an eye toward the national stage.\n\n\"At this time when the nation is searching for its soul, when it is divided as never before, when it's questioning our democratic values, it's questioning the very role of government, it's questioning the balance of power,\" Cuomo said, \"New York must show the way forward and remind this country who we are at our best.\"\n\nAfter collecting endorsements from the carpenters and painters unions, the former governor wasted little time sharpening lines of attack accusing his rivals of adopting stances too far left on crime, homelessness and Israel.\n\n\"These politicians now running to be mayor made a terrible, terrible mistake,\" Cuomo said. \"They uttered the three dumbest words ever uttered by a public official: Cut police funding. It created a city in chaos.\"\n\nHe vowed to rebuild the New York Police Department, to move New Yorkers suffering from mental illness off the streets and to pursue policies that would accelerate the construction of new affordable housing.\n\nIt was a selective retelling of recent political history. Cuomo skipped over parts of his own record on the issues, including enacting changes as governor to eliminate cash bail for many crimes. Adams, Republicans and some Democrats argue that the new law contributed to a spike in crime.\n\nCuomo conspicuously made no mention of Adams, a fellow law-and-order moderate, whose scandal-plagued leadership Cuomo is trying to end. He did not mention President Donald Trump.\n\nNor did he directly address the accusations of sexual harassment that ended his decade-long governorship in 2021, referring only to hitting an inevitable \"tough spot\" in his life. Cuomo has denied wrongdoing, but his opponents are determined to remind voters of the scandal.\n\nHis entrance into the race was met with immediate blowback from political forces as diverse as women's rights organizations and the New York Post. The right-leaning tabloid slammed him Saturday as \"colossus of canards, a freak of fabrication, a behemoth of balderdash,\" while the other candidates argued he had failed New York City as governor.\n\nA left-leaning super political action committee was already engaged to stop Cuomo. The group, New Yorkers for Better Leadership, held a call Saturday to highlight stains on Cuomo's record, including criticism from a woman whose mother died at a nursing home during the pandemic. Cuomo's administration faced scrutiny from state officials and House Republicans over its efforts to conceal the total number of COVID-related deaths in nursing homes.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nNear Cuomo's rally, a group of his opponents held their own \"Women Against Cuomo\" rally to highlight his sexual harassment scandal. Tensions were high; women with sound systems shouted to union members who were waiting in line: \"You are endorsing a sexual harasser!\"\n\nThe group, which included a leader from the left-leaning Working Families Party, read from a deposition from one of the 11 women who accused Cuomo of sexual harassment.\n\nSupporters of Cuomo who turned out Sunday described different priorities.\n\nSheldon Samuel, a union painter from the Brooklyn borough's East Flatbush neighborhood, said he was most concerned with restoring a sense of safety to the city -- and believed Cuomo had the track record to do so.\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" he said of the accusations against Cuomo. But Samuel, 49, said he had become alarmed by Adams' apparent closeness to Trump and the state of the city.\n\n\"I have two young daughters,\" he said. \"I don't want them to be going to school scared, going on the train scared.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nCuomo's opponents have reason to try to act quickly. Early polls have showed him well ahead of his rivals in the June primary. With the help of a friendly super PAC and a loyal network of donors, he is expected to outspend other Democrats in the race.\n\nAnd yet, new potential rivals still loom. City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams is expected to decide in the coming days whether she will run for mayor.\n\nThose already in the race took turns attacking Cuomo over the weekend.\n\nScott Stringer, a former city comptroller, released a combative video comparing Cuomo's comeback attempt to that of Eliot Spitzer, the former governor who lost to Stringer in the 2013 comptroller race.\n\n\"We shocked a lot of people when we won that race,\" Stringer said. \"You'll forgive me if I'm not shaking in my boots when people say Andrew Cuomo is the front-runner for mayor -- the same Cuomo who has always put his ego and his interests ahead of our city.\"\n\nBrad Lander, the current comptroller who is running for mayor, held an \"emergency\" news conference to criticize Cuomo's record. His spokesperson added that the former governor's launch was \"almost as underwhelming as it was pathetic.\"\n\nAnd Jessica Ramos, a state senator from the Queens borough, took the opportunity to knock both Cuomo and Eric Adams.\n\n\"If New Yorkers want a corrupt bully with a record of alleged sexual misconduct, supporting Republicans, selling out to developers and exacerbating crises, they can just stick with the current mayor,\" she said.\n\nAdams has faced growing calls to resign over concerns that he is beholden to the president after the Trump administration moved to drop federal corruption charges against Adams. And while he maintains that he has a path to reelection, his campaign has been almost nonexistent.\n\nMarching in a St. Patrick's Day parade Sunday on Staten Island, Adams declined to take a swipe at Cuomo.\n\n\"There's a famous quote: Come one, come all,\" he said, adding: \"You can't hide in the shadows. You have to come out and follow real positions, so I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nHe was not the only parade-goer who welcomed Cuomo's entrance. Curtis Sliwa, the Guardian Angels founder who is running for mayor as a Republican, said he relished the chance to take on either the mayor or the former governor in the fall.\n\n\"Anybody who grew up with Cuomo knows Cuomo,\" he said. \"He cannot reinvent himself.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"NEW YORK -- For months, the race for mayor of New York City felt stuck in suspended animation.

That’s more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist…YOU TWEETED WHAT!’\n\n‘Karla Sofia Gascon is here tonight. And… Karla, if you’re going to tweet about the Oscars, remember, my name is Jimmy Kimmel.’\n\nGascon feigned a smile as she placed her hands together in a prayer gesture while making her return to the awards circuit amid the controversy. \n\nO’Brien continued: ‘Before we go any further, I want you to know, we did not use A.I. To make this show. No A.I. Yeah. No A.I. Yeah. We would never do that, we use child labor. \n\n‘Hey. Timothee Chalamet is up for best actor tonight. You are amazing. And you look amazing. I bow to you. Love that suit. You will not get hit on your bike tonight. Amazing actor. He’s nominated for his portrayal of Bob Dylan. Yeah. Yeah. Bob Dylan wanted to be here tonight, but not that badly.’\n\nMoving on to Best Picture nominee Dune: Part Two, O’Brien mistakenly said the film had won a Best Director nomination for Denis Villeneuve,\n\nHe said: ‘Dune 2 is dominated for Best Picture and Director, and guess what? I’m told he banned smartphones on the set of Dune 2. Did you know that? Yeah. Apparently his actors kept googling, “What is this movie about? We’ll hang after, it’s going to be fun. That was a no. \n\n‘You know, one of my favorite movies didn’t get nominated this year, Baby girl. Yeah, I loved that film. Yeah. In the film Babygirl Antonio Banderas plays a man who doesn’t know how to give his wife and orgasm. \n\nHe described it as the most challenging role of his career. Should have come to me, man. Should have come to me.’\n\nFans lauded O’Brien for rising to the occasion and begged for him to ‘host every year.’ \n\nOne fan wrote of the Gascon dig: ‘dragging her in the opening monologue with her sitting right in front of you, conan i’m so fond of you! #oscars.’\n\nOthers wrote: ‘conan is absolutely killing it\n\n‘Eating dinner and watching Conan coming out of Demi more was hard, but I gotta say, he is doing a great job!’\n\nO’Brien had earlier shocked fans with a The Substance parody as he dove out of Demi Moore’s body and then jumped back in to find his shoe. \n\nThe 97th Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nO’Brien previously joked: ‘I only agreed to host so that I could get invited.’\n\nThis year’s ceremony has an unusually unsettled field in many of the most high-profile categories, including best picture and most of the acting categories.\n\nEmilia Pérez leads the nominations this year with 13, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña), director (for Jacques Audiard), adapted screenplay and original song.\n\nGascón stars as the title character, a former Mexican drug lord who comes out as a transgender woman and fakes her own death in order to reinvent herself as a pro-social force, while Saldaña plays an ethically challenged lawyer who helps set up her new identity.\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay.\n\nBrody stars as a Jewish Hungarian architect who immigrates to the US after surviving the Holocaust. The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth’s attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\n\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \n\nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I’m Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \n\nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\n\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \n\nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \n\nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\n\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics’ organizations. \n\nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics’ organizations early in the season. \n\nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \n\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\n\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón’s travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\n\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \n\nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I’m Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\n\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \n\nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\n\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin’s string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \n\nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon’s offensive posts have threatened its chances.\n\nThe Palme d’Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn’t hurt.\n\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora’s Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez’s Jacques Audiard. \n\nThis year’s original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\n\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\n\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOscars 2025 host Conan O&#8217;Brien had fans all saying the same thing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What Everyone is Saying About Conan O&#8217;Brien Hosting the 2025 Oscars and His Epic Opening Monologue first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/what-everyone-is-saying-about-conan-obrien-hosting-the-2025-oscars-and-his-epic-opening-monologue/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Fans-all-saying-the-same-thing-about.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:52:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.137},{"id":296016772,"title":"Gwyneth Paltrow wishes ex Chris Martin a happy 48th birthday as she thanks him for Apple, 20, and Moses, 18","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Mar 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscars best dressed!

I think Chris and I were meant to be together and have our kids. \n'But our relationship is much better like this: friends and coparents and family,' she said.\n'Chris is a very close friend,' she said at the time. 'I see him every day, I talk to him every day. \n'And it was very difficult, but I think you see in the children that they got through it, so I am proud of us, I really am.

The case has already gone up once to the Supreme Court, which previously temporarily allowed Dellinger to remain in his job.\n\nThe ruling comes as Dellinger is challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's massive overhaul of the government. A federal board on Tuesday halted the terminations of several probationary workers after Dellinger said their firings may have been unlawful.\n\n\"I'm glad and grateful to see the court confirm the importance and legality of the job protections Congress afforded my position,\" Dellinger said in a statement on Saturday. \"My efforts to protect federal employees generally, and whistleblowers in particular, from unlawful treatment will continue.\"\n\nThe judge said the special counsel has a \"unique status and mission,\" which requires independence from the president to ensure he can carry out his responsibilities. The office investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.\n\n\"If I don't have independence, if I can be removed for no good reason, federal employees are going to have no good reason to come to me,\" Dellinger told reporters outside Washington's federal courthouse after a recent hearing.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel is also responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which restricts the partisan political activities of government workers. Dellinger's firing came as Trump administration employees have touted their support on social media for his policies even though the Hatch Act is meant to restrict political advocacy while on duty.\n\nThe Justice Department employed sweeping language in urging the Supreme Court last month to allow the termination of the head of an obscure federal agency with limited power. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in court papers that the lower court had crossed \"a constitutional red line\" by blocking Dellinger's firing and stopping Trump \"from shaping the agenda of an executive-branch agency in the new administration's critical first days.\"\n\nDellinger was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in 2024.","summary":"he head of a federal watchdog agency must remain in his job, a judge in Washington ruled on Saturday, saying President Donald Trump's bid to remove the special counsel was unlawful.","url":"https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-district-judge-amy-berman-says-donald-trumps-bid-oust-hampton-dellinger-head-office-special-counsel-was-unlawful/15970648/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15970652_030225-wls-ap-trump-img.png?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:48:21","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer Associated Press","authors":["Alanna Durkin Richer Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.499},{"id":296016860,"title":"Hegseth Orders Pentagon to Stop Offensive Cyberoperations Against Russia","text":"WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, according to a current official and two former officials briefed on the secret instructions. The move is apparently part of a broader effort to draw President Vladimir Putin of Russia into talks on Ukraine and a new relationship with the United States.\n\nHegseth's instructions, part of a larger reevaluation of all operations against Russia, have not been publicly explained. But they were issued before President Donald Trump's public blowup in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.\n\nThe precise scope and duration of the Defense Department order is not clear, as the line between offensive and defensive cyberoperations is often a blurry one.\n\nStill, retaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is crucial to understanding Putin's intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.\n\nFormer officials said it was common for civilian leaders to order pauses in military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations, to avoid derailing them. Still, for Trump and Hegseth, the retreat from offensive cyberoperations against Russian targets represents a huge gamble.\n\nIt essentially counts on Putin to reciprocate by letting up on what many call the \"shadow war\" underway against the United States and its traditional allies in Europe.\n\nOver the past year, ransomware attacks on U.S. hospitals, infrastructure and cities have ramped up, many emanating from Russia in what intelligence officials have said are largely criminal acts that have been sanctioned, or ignored, by Russian intelligence agencies.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the urgency of getting Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine, even while acknowledging that it was unclear whether Putin was ready to make a deal.\n\nHe was not asked about the decision to stop the offensive cyberoperations, but he grew defensive when pressed on why the United States was letting up on pressure on Moscow.\n\n\"You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible,\" Rubio said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, according to a current official and two former officials briefed on the secret instructions.

I have to thank my wife Jazz. \n\n'Please don't play the music, because I want to tell a really quick story about Jazz.'\n\nThe couple share two children: a 5-year-old daughter Kinsey Sioux, and a 3-year-old son Wilder Wolf.\n\nKieran continued: 'A year ago, I said that I want a third kid, because she said if I won the award, she would give me the kid. Turns out she said that because she didn't think I was going to win. But -- and people came up to me and were like, you know, really annoying her, it got to her. \n\n'But anyway -- after the show we're walking through a parking lot, she's holding the Emmy, she goes, oh, god, I did say that. I guess I owe you a third kid. I turned to her, I said, really, I want four. And she turned to me, I swear to god this happened, she said, I will give you four when you win an Oscar. \n\n'I held my hand out, she shook it and I have not brought it up once until just now. You remember that, honey? Then I just have to say to you, jazz, love of my life, ye of little faith -- No pressure. I love you. I'm really sorry I did this again. And let's get cracking on those kids, what do you say? I love you. I love. I love you.'\n\nThe show began with an incredible medley from Wicked stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.\n\nThe Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nConan O'Brien, 61, is making his debut as Oscars host, after joking: 'I only agreed to host so that I could get invited.'\n\nThis year's ceremony has an unusually unsettled field in many of the most high-profile categories, including best picture and most of the acting categories.\n\nEmilia Pérez leads the nominations this year with 13, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña), director (for Jacques Audiard), adapted screenplay and original song.\n\nGascón stars as the title character, a former Mexican drug lord who comes out as a transgender woman and fakes her own death in order to reinvent herself as a pro-social force, while Saldaña plays an ethically challenged lawyer who helps set up her new identity.\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay.\n\nBrody stars as a Jewish Hungarian architect who immigrates to the US after surviving the Holocaust. The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\n\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \n\nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \n\nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\n\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \n\nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \n\nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\n\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \n\nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \n\nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \n\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\n\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\n\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \n\nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\n\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \n\nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\n\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \n\nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\n\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\n\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \n\nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\n\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\n\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live.","summary":"The 97th Academy Awards - which featured a star-studded red carpet - kicked off with the 42-year-old actor taking home Actor in a Supporting Role for his role in A Real Pain.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14453929/oscars-winners-2025-academy-awards.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/03/00/95759561-0-image-a-10_1740962046605.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:44:30","author":"Editor,Justin Enriquez","authors":["Editor","Justin Enriquez"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.269},{"id":296017924,"title":"Italy's Meloni says division of the West would be 'fatal for everyone'","text":"European leaders agreed on Sunday to “do the heavy lifting” to defend their continent as they convened in London to discuss ways of bringing an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says that any peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine would require a US backstop, as he repeated his commitment to sending British troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force in any future peace settlement.Starmer added that he and other leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, were working on assembling a “coalition of the willing” European nations that would also commit to deploying peacekeeping troops to secure Kyiv.He also announced that the UK will use £1.6 billion (€1.94 billion) in export financing to supply Ukraine with 5,000 air defence missiles to bolster its defences.The European support comes just days after a meeting between Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump turned sour, resulting in a shouting match in the Oval Office, leaving much of the world in shock.It also sent shockwaves through Europe, who for weeks have been questioning their security after the new Trump administration has seemingly adopted a highly critical foreign policy vision that has distanced much of its allies, including across the Atlantic.The meeting ended with Trump reportedly instructing his aides to ask Zelenskyy to leave the White House abruptly, after he accused him of being ungrateful and not serious about pursuing peace with Russia, who launched a full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022.The Trump administration has also reportedly been exploring the idea of potentially cutting of all support for Ukraine, both financial and military, after Trump hinted at a possible ultimatum, telling Kyiv to either work toward ending the war, or fight it out alone.Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stressed the importance of Western unity. The Italian premier has also proposed hosting a summit between European leaders and the US, to build bridges after the relationship between the longtime allies strained over the war in Ukraine.Meloni says she found Zelenskyy to be very “lucid, rational as always” in Sunday’s London meeting, as she expressed her sympathy for the Ukrainian leader after his spat with Trump, who together with US Vice President JD Vance, berated and belittled him.She also noted that she sees in Zelenskyy someone who wants to “look for solutions” and “continue working to seek solutions” to find a way to end the more than three-year tragedy unfolding in his country.The Italian leader stressed that Italy, Europe, NATO and the United States all share the same goal, which is arriving at a lasting and just peace in Ukraine. She also urged leaders to prioritise unity, warning that a division of the West would be “fatal for everyone”, particularly Ukraine.“The only thing that we really cannot afford is a peace that does not remain, and this cannot be afforded, Ukraine cannot afford it, Europe cannot afford it, the United States cannot afford it.”“For God’s sake, everything can explode, it’s not good news. So everything I can do to keep the West united and to strengthen it, I will do,” added Meloni.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also at the meeting. Trudeau reiterated Canada’s unequivocal commitment to Ukraine after the Trump spat, and offered his full support for the shaken Zelenskyy.Trudeau has been dealing himself with his own issues with the 47th US president, after Washington-Ottawa relations took a dive following Trump’s return to the Oval Office.Trump had threatened, even before assuming office, to implement tariffs on Canadian products as he accused his northern neighbours – and southern in Mexico – of being responsible for the flow of illegal migrants and Fentanyl into the US.He followed through on his threats shortly after his inauguration as he imposed a 25% tariff on both Canada and Mexico. Canada retaliated with its own set of tariffs on US products, as the world stood in the balance with a potential global trade war at risk of erupting.The tariffs were later postponed after Canada and Mexico agreed to strengthen policing of their borders with the US, but could be spring back up at any point.Trudeau leapt to Zelenskyy’s defence after the White House debacle, supporting the embattled president’s concerns with Putin’s reliability.“On Friday in the Oval Office, President Zelenskyy pointed out, in so many words that (Russian President) Vladimir Putin is a liar and a criminal and cannot be trusted to keep his word in any way, shape or form, because he has demonstrated time and time again that he will break any agreements. I stand with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and I stand with the people of Ukraine.”More talks are expected to be held between European leaders to further discuss the ongoing war in Ukraine and brainstorm ways to bring an end to the fighting.

The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\n\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \n\nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \n\nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\n\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \n\nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande) \n\nThis year's best lead actor race is up in the air after Timothée Chalamet's recent SAG win for A Complete Unknown\n\nBrody is also a favorite for The Brutalist, but Ralph Fiennes has gotten plenty of awards-season attention for the papal-selection drama Conclave\n\nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\n\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \n\nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \n\nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \n\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\n\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\n\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \n\nAnora's Mikey Madison is a late-breaking best actress co-frontrunner after recent wins and controversy that erupted after offensive tweets from Emilia Pérez's Karla Sofía Gascón resurfaced\n\nDemi Moore is the other major frontrunner for the satirical body-horror film The Substance. She has won multiple major awards this season\n\nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\n\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \n\nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\n\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \n\nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\n\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\n\nSaldaña appears to be the favorite in the supporting actress category after a string of wins\n\nKieran Culkin has dominated the supporting actor categories in recent weeks for Jesse Eisenberg's drama A Real Pain\n\nAfter Gascón's offensive tweets surfaced, Emilia Pérez's best picture frontrunner status seemed in question, and Anora has snatched up the top award at multiple ceremonies considered major predictors of the Oscars\n\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \n\nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\n\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\n\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live. \n\nOscar winners 2025 full list - see who received honors for this year's Academy Awards\n\n Best Picture\n\nThe Brutalist \n\nA Complete

The flashpoint threat that could still explode decades of goodwill","text":"Allies of the United States who want to enjoy good relations with the superpower in the coming four years need to better understand what motivates Donald Trump’s approach to international relations.\n\nIn short, US allies need to know their worth, or lack thereof, in Trump's world view. \n\nThat includes Australia. Our alliance with the US has been the bedrock of our approach to foreign affairs since World War II. Will that continue?\n\nTrump is no scholar of international relations nor international diplomacy. He’s not a student of history either. I’m not even certain how much historical knowledge he has beyond the basics.\n\nAnd in his second term as President - so far, at least - Trump is showing all the signs of following his own instincts on what should be done on the international stage, rather than outsourcing such matters to bureaucrats and experts who have spent their entire working lives in the field.\n\nWe also need to consider that Trump’s shift in the US approach to global affairs could be extended beyond just his Presidency. If the lurch towards isolationism is popular domestically in the months and years ahead, future Presidential candidates might follow the same mantra.\n\nDon’t forget the US embraced isolationism in the aftermath of World War I until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.\n\nSo where does all of this leave the US today, and what does it mean for allies like Australia going forward?\n\nTrump is a businessman, a deal maker. He favours US isolationism, protectionism in trade (to appeal to his working class voting base), and wants more from allies who expect American military and geo-political protection.\n\nIn Trump’s world, the US does too much on the global stage, isn’t adequately compensated and doesn’t received the recognition or applause that it should when it puts itself out there.\n\nThese sentiments help explain why he had that fiery exchange with Ukrainian President Zelensky in the Oval Office.\n\nWith his ambitious Vice President and 'wannabe Trump mini-me' JD Vance in tow, the pair scolded Zelensky for not showing enough respect.\n\nBut away from the theatre of the exchange, what it highlighted was that in Trump’s world, international relations is all about US vital interests now: If you don't matter to him, he doesn't care about you. \n\nIf allies cannot demonstrate a mutual benefit based on hard, vital interests then they need to develop an alternative plan. \n\nIt is why Trump wants NATO to spend more to protect Europe, for example. It is why he wants Ukraine to embrace realism in negotiations with Russia, to attain a peaceful end to the conflict. So the US isn’t forced to keep funding the Ukrainian resistance without an end in sight.\n\nIt all seems obvious and simple in Trump’s mind, even if scholars and foreign affairs practitioners see serious faults with the approach.\n\nFor Australia, even in Trump’s world, our alliance and by extension, our security, in an uncertain world should be fine to survive his presidency.\n\nOur geographical location coupled with the housing of US military personnel in Darwin as well as providing safe harbour elsewhere for the US Navy means that we adhere to Trump’s ‘vital interests’ mantra.\n\nRemember, the US is safely isolated geographically. Protected by oceans the US could safely withdraw from being at the centre of global disputes and remain 'secure' with strong trade links to maintain its prosperity. \n\nAs long as the rise and rise of China doesn't become a problem, that is. \n\nTrump's concerns about China mean that our alliance is one that he will want to maintain and ensure doesn’t fade to the detriment of the US.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it will all be smooth sailing for Australia. Economically, flashpoints are likely to emerge, given our economic dependence on exports to China alongside the importance of our military and economic arrangements with the US.\n\nPerhaps Australia’s biggest risk in a Trump world is becoming the ham in the proverbial sandwich if tensions escalate between the US and China, thereby putting one of the relationships under serious strain.\n\nOn the plus side, because even Trump can recognise the value strategically of Australia to US vital interests, he won’t jeopardise the alliance on insignificant grounds.\n\nThat will be cold comfort for some, no doubt, but we are no Ukraine in Trump’s eyes.","summary":"Trump is no scholar of international relations nor international diplomacy but our alliance with the US has been the bedrock of our approach to foreign affairs since World War II.

I don't even know. Mr. Downey, sir, thanks for handing this to me,” Culkin, 42, said at the start of his acceptance speech, after taking the stage at the Dolby Theatre. “This means a lot coming from you.”\n\n After thanking A Real Pain director Jesse Eisenberg and his family, he went on to give a special shoutout to his wife.\n\n “I love you Jazz,” he said. “I have to thank my wife Jazz for absolutely everything, for giving me my favorite people in the world.\"\n\n “Please don't play the music because I want to tell a really quick story about Jazz. About a year ago, I was on a stage like this, and I very stupidly publicly said that I want a third kid from her, because she said, If I won the award, she would give me the kid,” he continued, referring to his the 2023 Emmy Awards acceptance speech.\n\n “It turns out she said that because she didn't think I was gonna win,” he teased. “People came up to her and were like really annoying her. I think it got to her. But anyway, after the show, we're walking through a parking lot. She's holding the Emmy. We're trying to find our car. Emily, you were there so you're a witness, and she goes, ‘Oh, God, I did say that. I guess I owe you a third kid.’ And I turned to her, and I said, ‘Really, I want four.’\"\n\n “And she turned to me, I swear to God, this happened. It was just over a year ago. She said, 'I will give you four when you win an Oscar.'\"\n\n “I held my hand out. She took it, and I have not brought it up once, until just now,” he concluded. “You remember that, honey, you do? Okay, then I just have this to say to you, Jazz, love of my life…No pressure. I love you. I'm really sorry I did this again, and let's get cracking on those kids. What do you say?”\n\n Also nominated in the Academy’s best supporting actor category this year were Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories. \n\n In A Real Pain, Culkin and Jesse Eisenberg star as polar-opposite cousins who reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their grandmother. The dramedy was also written and directed by Eisenberg, 41.\n\n Culkin received his first-ever Oscar nomination and win for the role after also recently taking best supporting actor at the Critics Choice Awards, BAFTAs and SAG Awards, sweeping the season with a Golden Globe win, as well.\n\n Written and directed by Sean Baker, Anora follows the title character (Mikey Madison) from Brighton Beach, New York, strip clubs to a whirlwind romantic elopement with the son of a Russian oligarch, played by Mark Eydelshteyn.\n\n Borisov a classically trained Moscow-born actor, plays henchman Igor, who grows close to Anora throughout the film.

The move is apparently part of a broader effort to draw President Vladimir Putin of Russia into talks on Ukraine and a new relationship with the United States.\n\nHegseth's instructions, part of a larger reevaluation of all operations against Russia, have not been publicly explained. But they were issued before President Donald Trump's public blowup in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.\n\nThe precise scope and duration of the Defense Department order is not clear, as the line between offensive and defensive cyberoperations is often a blurry one.\n\nStill, retaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is crucial to understanding Putin's intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.\n\nFormer officials said it was common for civilian leaders to order pauses in military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations, to avoid derailing them. Still, for Trump and Hegseth, the retreat from offensive cyberoperations against Russian targets represents a huge gamble.\n\nIt essentially counts on Putin to reciprocate by letting up on what many call the \"shadow war\" underway against the United States and its traditional allies in Europe. Leading European powers continue to say their support of Ukraine is undiminished even as Trump, who has sought to portray himself as a neutral arbiter in seeking to end the war in Ukraine, has at times sided openly with Putin.\n\nU.S. officials have said Russia has continued to try to penetrate U.S. networks, including in the first weeks of the Trump administration. But that is only part of a broader Russian campaign.\n\nOver the past year, ransomware attacks on U.S. hospitals, infrastructure and cities have ramped up, many emanating from Russia in what intelligence officials have said are largely criminal acts that have been sanctioned, or ignored, by Russian intelligence agencies.\n\nSabotage efforts in Europe -- including suspected Russian attempts to cut communications cables, mysterious explosions and Russian-directed assassination plots, including against the CEO of Germany's largest arms maker -- have accelerated in the past year. The United States has, until now, been central in helping European nations fight back, often in covert cyberoperations, but that cooperation could now be in jeopardy.\n\nMany of those operations are run out of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters -- the storied intelligence agency that broke the Enigma codes in World War II -- and to some extent by Canada. It is possible they will continue that work, while the United States focuses on China, its most sophisticated adversary in cyberspace.\n\nRussia also ran an aggressive influence campaign during the last presidential campaign, according to reports by U.S. intelligence agencies during the Biden administration. In recent election cycles, U.S. Cyber Command has conducted secret operations to hamper or curtail those influence efforts.\n\nBut the Trump administration has begun to dismantle efforts by the FBI and other agencies to warn about Russian propaganda, and the order by the Pentagon would halt, at least for now, any further Cyber Command efforts to interrupt future Russian influence campaigns.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the urgency of getting Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine, even while acknowledging that it was unclear whether Putin was ready to make a deal.\n\n\"You're not going to bring them to the table if you're calling them names, if you're being antagonistic,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That's just the president's instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals as someone who's in business.\"\n\nRubio was not asked about the decision to stop the offensive cyberoperations, but he grew defensive when pressed on why the United States was letting up on pressure on Moscow, to the point of removing language from a United Nations resolution that described Russia as the aggressor in the war in Ukraine. Almost all of the United States' traditional allies voted against the resolution, leaving the Trump administration siding with Russia, North Korea, Iran and Belarus, and a handful of other authoritarian states.\n\n\"If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Rubio said. \"This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible.\"\n\nThe order from Hegseth was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity publication from Recorded Future, which tracks cyberoperations. The Pentagon and U.S. Cyber Command declined to comment on the record, but a senior defense official, declining to allow use of her name, said that Hegseth had \"no greater priority\" than the safety of military members, including in cyberoperations.\n\nAfter the publication of this article, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Trump appeared to be giving Putin \"a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyberoperations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure.\" He called the administration's move \"a critical strategic mistake.\"\n\nAs the Trump administration prepared to take office, departing Biden administration officials urged Trump's appointees to keep the pressure on Russia, including by continuing to arm Ukraine and push back on the GRU and the SVR, two Russian intelligence agencies that have been behind some of the most aggressive Russian cyberattacks and espionage operations.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nThey specifically briefed the Trump officials on suspected Russian efforts to cut communications cables undersea, and the U.S. effort last year to get a message to Putin about the consequences if an effort to put explosives on cargo planes resulted in an air disaster. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia's ultimate goal was to send those packages to the United States.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, U.S. cyberoperations against Russia were, if anything, ramped up. The National Security Agency created a \"Russia Small Group\" after the Russian interference in the 2017 election.\n\nTrump gave Cyber Command new authorities in his first term to conduct offensive cyberoperations without direct presidential approval in a classified document known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13.\n\nOne of those operations was a stepped-up effort to probe Russia's electric power grid, an effort first disclosed by The New York Times and one likely meant as a warning to Russia not to interfere with U.S. crucial infrastructure. Trump denounced that reporting as \"a virtual act of Treason,\" but his former aides later said he was concerned the revelation would affect his relationship with Putin.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, according to a current official and two former officials briefed on the secret instructions.

All told, Boatwright has estimated cost of goods would increase 0.6%, or 60 basis points, on a rolling basis from the planned tariffs. \n\n“We are fortunate to have such an extraordinary economic model at Chipotle that we can withstand those types of inflationary pressures and not have to pass those costs off to the consumer,” Boatwright told Jackson.\n\n“And that’s our intent this year. Let’s hold pricing constant, because we don’t know if the tariffs are transitory, if they’re going to be permanent, how sticky they’ll be in the new administration.\n\nHe continued: “We don’t think it’s fair to the consumer to pass those costs off to the consumer, because pricing becomes permanent. And so again, back to the idea of delivering extraordinary value to the consumer. We’re going to stay the course.”\n\nChipotle finds itself in something of a transition period: In August, Starbucks poached longtime Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol to head the coffee giant. Since then, Chipotle shares have slumped, and in February it cautioned that the rest of 2025 would prove a volatile year. with slower sales growth than analysts had hoped for.\n\nYet Boatwright told Jackson he remained bullish on the company’s fortunes, noting it planned to build out more than 300 new locations.\n\n“If we can hold price constant, regardless of what’s happening in inflationary pressures, what’s happening with global economic uncertainty, and give the consumer abundance, [and] variety with wholesome, fresh ingredients that they can’t get anywhere else, that’s how we’ll deliver value for the consumer in 2025,” he said.\n\nBoatwright also discussed the firm’s new AI tool, Ava Cado, that is designed to help screen job applicants.\n\n“Ava now takes all that work out of the hands of the manager,” he said. “The candidates respond directly to Ava and she qualifies them, gets the resume loaded or the application loaded, and schedules those interviews for the manager who simply shows up at a scheduled time slot, interviews the candidate and puts them into the workflow.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on America’s largest trading partners&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Chipotle&#8217;s CEO confirms that the company will cover any price hikes due to tariffs first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/chipotles-ceo-confirms-that-the-company-will-cover-any-price-hikes-due-to-tariffs/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-02/250228-chipotle-lm-1245-a79b4a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:37:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":296014380,"title":"Oscars 2025 Ceremony Is Underway - A List Of Winners","text":"US actor Kieran Culkin accepts the award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting ...

As a result, “PM Netanyahu decided: as of this morning, entry of all goods & supplies to the Gaza Strip be halted.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Feb. 4 proposed that the Gazans relocate out of the Gaza Strip completely and that the United States clean up and redevelop the region, in order to end deadly conflicts in the region for good.\n\nAfter Trump’s proposal, experts said the idea of ending the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution seems to be dimming.\n\n“Many foreign policy thinkers have discussed Gaza as a Hong Kong-style city-state, maybe incorporated into a Palestinian state later,” he said. “It is harder to maintain the pretext that there can ever be a two-state solution.”\n\nA majority of Palestinians and Israelis also do not want it, Sperling said.\n\nThe White House said the council was being used as “a protective body for countries committing horrific human rights violations” and accused the group of discriminating against Israel.\n\nThe order also ended U.S. funding for the U.N.

And we will continue learning as we hear more, but I don’t expect any change in how we operate or what we need to do. We are more of a software company than a physical goods company,” Zavery told ET in an exclusive interview during his maiden visit to India on February 26. “Our Hyderabad site, our largest globally by employee headcount, is a cornerstone of ServiceNow’s global operations and innovation culture. The company’s India team, which represents more than 20% of its global workforce, plays a crucial role in product development, leading about 40% of global product engineering efforts. This includes significant contributions to innovations like the Xanadu AI suite and the latest GenAI solutions, such as Now Assist for Sourcing and Procurement Operations (SPO) and the Now Assist Skill Kit.“So, the tariffs won’t necessarily have… There’s a lot of things happening globally between the Indian government and the US government. I’m sure we’ll have it worked out if there’s an issue,” he said.On January 13, former US President Joe Biden’s administration introduced an interim final rule to regulate the export of graphics processing units (GPUs), a critical component for AI development. While US President Donald Trump is yet to take decisive action on Biden’s GPU export controls, the US government has placed export restrictions on GPUs sold to India, capped at 50,000 GPUs.Asked about its impact on ServiceNow in India, Zavery said, “There’s a lot of inference. And the GPUs we have are available globally for us. We have capacity here, and we have capacity globally. I think a lot of times when you’re doing inference, it doesn't have to be in a particular location. It can happen where we need our engineers to have access to it.”“Customers can also have things available globally. You don't need to be all local. So, there's zero impact for us in that area,” he said.Zavery highlighted the company's focus on deploying its Agentic AI technology across Indian enterprises. The company's Agentic AI aims to move beyond traditional automation to enable autonomous, intelligent AI agents that can analyse, decide and act, he said.The technology, embedded within enterprise workflows, increases productivity across various sectors, including BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), manufacturing and public services, he added.“Our low-code AI platform empowers Indian enterprises to rapidly build and deploy AI-driven applications, addressing specific industry challenges, Zavery said.He said that for Indian businesses, this translates to significant advantages: AI-powered fraud detection and loan processing in the BFSI sector, predictive maintenance and supply chain optimisation in manufacturing, and hyper-automation for IT and human resources workflows across industries.ServiceNow is also strengthening its partner ecosystem in India, with major players such as Wipro and Cognizant building more than $1 billion businesses on its platform. “Indian enterprises, such as Wipro’s IT asset management transformation and LTI Mindtree's developer productivity boost, demonstrate the benefits of our solutions. Poonawalla Fincorp is also a new customer and is using the AI platform to strengthen risk management, Zavery said.","summary":"The company has partnered with ANSR to establish more than 60 ServiceNow Centres of Excellence in global capability centres within India.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/servicenow-prez-sees-no-us-tariff-threat-to-its-india-ops/articleshow/118666834.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118666833,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-35796,overlay-ettech/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:31:00","author":"Suraksha P","authors":["Suraksha P"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":296017942,"title":"Trump Not A Genuine Peacemaker","text":"The failed meeting between Volodymr Zelensky of Ukraine and the President of the United States Donald John Trump should not be a shock or a surprise to anybody.

Trump will rejoice to see the ultimate downfall of Zelensky and the concession of the country to Russia which would be good for himself and his business associates in both Russia and the United States. \n\nThe quarrel at the Oval Office is a disgrace and a total shame in diplomacy. The truth is that Trump has had no diplomacy in his lifestyle typical of a megalomaniac obsessed with personal wealth inherited from his late father Fred Trump Snr.\nThe brutal dressing down of Zelensky by Trump who is ever interjecting when his guests have contrary views to his, must be the conduct of matters pertaining to his greedy rule running the next four years. All his opponents will suffer the persecution he has designed himself to suppress the members of the Democratic Party allies of Joe Biden. Joe Biden was very supportive of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and did his very best to protect the people of Ukraine from the barbaric and brutal acts of aggression unleashed by Putin who has an ally in Trump. \n\nUkraine never invaded Russia. It was Russia at the behest of Putin which invaded Ukraine and declared war against the mineral-rich neighbour which had intentions to join the North Atlantic Organisation (NATO). Trump is up to weaken NATO and the European Union and upon weakening these two European bodies, he would augment America’s hegemony in global politics with the support of Putin who has found a best friend and hypocritical comrade in Trump. The greats who sustained the greatness of the United States in global politics such as Ronald Wilson Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Henry Kissinger, Robert Dole, John McCain and Prescott Bush as Republicans must be turning in their graves over and over at the undiplomatic and brutal public behaviour of Donald Trump who lacks a firm political base since he does not have the practical and pragmatic competence of a shrewd politician that his predecessors had in the steering of statecraft.\nWhen Trump sees cameras and journalists at the Oval Office, he gets over-excited and his natural nack for institutionalizing a personality cult in the sphere of absolute power and absolute rule takes precedence over diplomacy. Actually diplomacy is a strange bedfellow with Trump. He takes delight in shouting at fellow leaders and always disregards sound advice from genuine Republicans. He wants to anchor his strength in the control of all rich minerals across the continents of the world. \n\nTrump said Zelensky does not have the cards to negotiate peace with Russia. He was right in his own right. However, the truth of the matter is that Trump does not want anybody to succeed in bringing peace between the Russian ally and Zelensky. Trump scolded Zelensky like a little grand child. His major intention was to have Zelensky surrender his country to Russia and this was going to help him access minerals to help boost the falling and failing business prospects in his business empire. He is a tax evader and a manipulative, divisive and proud guru of the white supremacists. It is now a question for America having a gangster in power and a law breaker making the law. To the best of my recollections, no man has been embarrassed as an ally of the United States in the manner that Zelensky was “undressed” by Trump before media cameras beaming the irate Trump and the reactive Zelensky. Marc Rubio the Secretary of State, a Latino self-proclaimed hand tool diplomatic house servant of Trump is now playing double standards, fearing that the axe of Trump would fall on the nape of his neck and decapitate him. All those Trump appoints to higher positions in government and his business empires must be high profile sycophants and political psychopaths who must be ready to be used as cheap mouthpieces magnifying him as an inerant and unmistakable leader of the world. He loves power and, given the chance to rule for the rest of his life with his mental lapses which he mocked Joe Biden about, he would be delighted to be the life Absolute King of the Planet Earth. \n\nThe courage of Zelensky at the Oval Office closer to a vulgar-ranting demagogue worshiped by miscreants and white divisive characters, moved my heart. Trump became red and his pink nose got a twist of annoyance and just became unruly and disrespectful of a fellow President in blatant and despicable disregard of international diplomatic etiquette which he knows little or nothing about. \n\nUnder Trump, America will be a bull dog which will bark and bite and break to pieces any perceived enemy of Trump. No one is capable of mollifying and taming the insane tyrant Trump who has had very good relationship with bootlickers and sycophants who could even promise to surrender their profitable business to the aspiring King of America.\nThe wagon-tail Vice President James David Vance failed miserably and shamefully to aid his superior Trump come to his senseless senses and numb sensibility. Trump will never ever condemn Putin, notwithstanding the mass killings of both peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Trump did demonstrate weakness as he wanted to display to the world his own version of lies that Zelensky does not want peace but a Third World War. \n\nTrump had promised to end the three-year war in 24 hours upon being sworn in as 47th President of the United States but this was simply window-dressing politics of cheap popularity and publicity. He failed to make peace between Zelensky when he was bumped off power in 2020 and he will always fail to restore sanity to the world as long as he remains a true friend and business partner of Russian demon-crats who emulate his leadership style. The four years of prayer Putin (he could be an atheist/agnostic, only God knows him far better than us mortal beings) had embarked upon after the defeat of his admirer Trump in 2020 elections was the forceful and forcible return of his ally whose behaviour is just as childish as a five-year old child in a kindagarten. \n\nThe United Nations cannot end the war. The United States cannot end the war.Hundreds of thousands have died in Ukraine as failure of diplomacy has now taken its toll. Some of the figures pertaining to deaths have been underestimated. Rubio later said Zelensky should apologize to Trump. What a sycophantic appeal from the mouth of an over-ambitious Trumputinist disguised as a peacemaker with a cold heart unconcerned about thousands killed by Russian troops.\nIt is going to be the toughest time for Zelensky and his compatriots, but victory would not lie in the conquest of the Patriots in Ukraine led by Zelensky whom Trump wants eliminated by all means. Victory would be with the gallant warriors defending their country to the last drop of the blood. \n\nZambia could be exercising some form of neutrality in order to appease Trump and his cohorts. The Non-Aligned Movement established by the like of Josip Broz Tito of the former Yugoslavia, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Pandit Nehru of India, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and Kenneth Kaunda among some others made it clear that Non-alignment does not signify neutrality. When the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, KK of Zambia castigated the Kremlin for such an abhorrent aggression just as he condemned the United States’ troops presence in Vietnam. The Non-Aligned Movement seems to be as dead as the dodo after the departure of its aforementioned key pillars and founders but its vision must be carried on by people in the countries where such great leaders who espoused its vision ruled. Ukraine stands in the midst of Trumputinist politics of disrespect of international law and diplomacy and that of responsible, peace lovers and peacekeepers empathetic with its peoples endless agonies widely exacerbated by Russia and its cronies deeply entrenched in the minds of Trump and Putin. Zelensky may be rooted out by the overzealous Trumputinists. The truth to be handed over to posterity will be the fact that there was one young leader Zelensky who fought against Russian aggression to the last drop of his blood. Zelensky knows no Uncle Sam to simply wave a mighty wand from a standpoint of loyalty to gain cheap popularity and publicity. History is full of brave heroes who fought wars with giants as dwarfs but conquered giants and established great governments and brave leaders who had zero tolerance of foreign manipulation and domination.\nAfrica must be wary of Trump’s desire to take our minerals to his country and impoverish the continent to the level of beggars without borders.

The broader narrative remains one of strategic positioning—buying into weakness and capitalizing on technical setups that drive upward momentum.\n\n“This Friday surge suggests institutional players and algorithmic trading models saw attractive entry points, reinforcing the notion that the bull market’s foundations remain solid.”\n\nHe continues: “The resilience displayed at the end of the week will be tested against the next wave of macroeconomic catalysts.\n\n“But one thing is clear: for all the noise surrounding political theatrics, investors are keeping their focus on earnings growth, liquidity conditions, and the broader trajectory of global markets.”\n\nThis robust market performance comes amid a period of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, as the standoff between Washington and Kyiv has raised fresh concerns about international relations. \n\nHowever, “investor sentiment appears unshaken”, with Friday’s strong rally suggesting that financial markets remain focused on fundamentals rather than political turbulence.\n\nIn recent weeks, macroeconomic data has pointed to persistent underlying strength in the US economy, adding to the bullish case for equities. \n\ndeVere suggests that institutional investors are taking advantage of these conditions, rotating into equities at strategic moments to capitalize on technical levels. \n\nThe deVere CEO concludes: “The bounce back on Friday reinforces the view that buy-the-dip strategies remain in play, driven by confidence in corporate earnings and monetary policy outlooks.”","summary":"Global markets are set to open Monday with “surprisingly strong momentum,” as investors build on Friday’s late-session rally, looking over geopolitical tensions flaring in the Oval Office between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump, his voice raised, then accused Zelenskyy of \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio leaned heavily on emotive language to push back against the critics who have since berated the Trump administration for the public display of hostility toward Zelenskyy, a wartime president who frames his battle against Russia's invasion as a bulwark of Europe's security and freedom. Rubio said he was \"puzzled\" by the \"absurd\" pushback on the administration and said Trump was being unfairly criticized when he was trying to prevent further destruction by bringing peace to the region.\n\nRubio sprinkled his comments with open rebukes of Zelenskyy. He said that the Ukrainian president \"couldn't contain himself\" and had hindered Trump's peace effort.\n\nHe said Zelenskyy as well as the critics of Trump and Vance -- among whom are both Republican and Democratic lawmakers -- needed to realize that the United States was \"trying to help\" Ukraine.\n\n\"The sooner people grow up and realize that, I think the more progress we're going to be able to make,\" Rubio said. He added that Trump would be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts if he were a Democrat.\n\nRubio has also come under sharp criticism from some of his Democratic former colleagues in the Senate.\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he regretted his support for the nomination of Rubio, who was confirmed unanimously, with all Democrats voting in favor. Van Hollen said that as a senator representing Florida, Rubio acknowledged that Russia was the aggressor in the war against Ukraine and would never have accused Zelenskyy of being a dictator, as Trump has.\n\nVan Hollen said that \"as a member of the Senate, Secretary Rubio was somebody who stood up for American values, American principles,\" but that he was now \"parroting the president's position.\"\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who is one of the most outspoken critics of the second Trump administration, told CNN that Rubio had been \"a great disappointment\" to many of his peers in the Senate.\n\nRubio expressed strong support for Ukraine when the Russian invasion started in 2022. A few days after the Russian attack, he said on MSNBC that he could not understand why the United States \"can't begin to openly say\" to Ukrainians that \"we will support them as long as they are willing to fight.\"\n\nIn 2023, he criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after DeSantis answered a Fox News questionnaire by saying that the war in Ukraine was a \"territorial dispute\" and that the United States should avoid \"becoming further entangled.\" Rubio said then that Russia was trying to take out the Ukrainian government and control the entire country and that its aggression could not be settled with conventional treaties and peace agreements.\n\nBack then, Rubio also said that if Russia could expand its territory in Ukraine by outlasting the patience and support of Western nations, it would set a bad precedent for China, which could use similar military force to invade Taiwan or other territories it lays claims to.\n\n\"The message would be pretty clear,\" Rubio said. \"If you want to invade a smaller neighbor and take their land, then you can do it, and there won't be many consequences for it.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday fiercely defended President Donald Trump's sharp turn against Ukraine's leader, accusing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of trying to derail the peace process with Russia by openly challenging Trump and Vice President JD…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/rubio-attacks-zelenskyy-firmly-defending-trump-and-vance/article_3df6b697-e875-5627-87c1-bec6ee1b6f33.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:19:56","author":"Minho Kim,North Adams Pride","authors":["Minho Kim","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":296014758,"title":"World News | Volodymyr Zelenskyy Meets King Charles at Sandringham House","text":"England [UK], March 3 (ANI): After meeting UK PM Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday (local time) met Britain's King Charles III at Sandringham House.\nhttps://x.com/RoyalFamily/status/1896263573997051946\nAlso Read | Pope Francis Didn't Need Any Mechanical Ventilation After Respiratory Crisis, Says Vatican.\nIn a post on X, The Royal Family shared the picture and wrote, \"This evening, His Majesty The King received the President of Ukraine, @ZelenskyyUa, at Sandringham House.\"\nSandringham House is a private residence located in Norfolk, England, and is traditionally used by the British royal family.

Pictured, Chicago police officers work at the scene where a man was fatally shot in Chicago's Uptown neighborhood in October\n\nLast August Johnson was ranked as America's 'worst sanctuary mayor' by the Immigration Reform Law Institute, a watchdog \n\nJohnson's meteoric rise to power was largely fueled by the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), where he previously worked as an organizer. \n\nThe union poured millions into his campaign, effectively installing one of their own in the city's highest office. \n\nWhile the close relationship managed to secure him strong backing from union loyalists, it appears to have alienated the broader electorate.\n\nThe poll revealed that 57 percent of voters are now less likely to support a candidate who takes campaign cash from the CTU, a clear indication that Johnson's deep ties to the controversial labor organization have become a political liability.\n\nAnd taxpayers have good reason to be concerned. The CTU has put forward more than 700 new contract demands. If just a fraction are granted it could saddle Chicago Public Schools with a staggering $4 billion deficit by 2029. \n\nChicago's projected budget deficit is already a whopping $982.4 million, according to The Civic Federation.\n\nDespite several tactics to save the city from bankruptcy, politicians have failed to get to the root of the issue - increasing pension payments to Chicago's more than 40,000 public employees.\n\nUnder Johnson's watch, crime has continued to ravage the city, with carjackings, shootings, and rampant theft leaving residents fearful and frustrated. \n\nDonald Trump made gains with voters across Illinois during November's election, but he did not win the state\n\nJohnson's tenure as Chicago Mayor has been dominated by the migrant crisis, with it revealed last year he spent upwards of $400 million on an influx of more than 42,000 migrants \n\nHis reluctance to take a hardline stance against criminal activity has drawn fierce criticism from both citizens and law enforcement officials, further eroding public confidence.\n\nMany of Chicago's neighborhoods, once vibrant and thriving, have been hollowed out by rising violence and economic instability. \n\nVoters in Chicago, like anywhere else, want to feel safe when they walk down the street.\n\nBut Johnson fell into the progressive politician's trap of going softer on lawbreakers than the public can stomach.\n\nAs America grappled with the police killing of George Floyd, Johnson, then Cook County Commissioner, joined others in calls to 'defund the police.'\n\nHe backtracked on this during a mayoral election campaign that pitted him against centrist Democrat Paul Vallas, who vowed to hire more officers amid widespread public safety concerns.\n\nEven so, his mayorship has suffered by a lack of commitment to law and order.\n\nThe number of aggravated assaults in Chicago jumped 4 percent to 14,029 between 2023 and 2024, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA).\n\nThe numbers of homicides, rapes, and robberies fell slightly, but remains alarmingly high.\n\nSmall businesses are shuttering, longtime residents are fleeing, and an increasing number of families are questioning whether the city is still a viable place to build their future. \n\nA lawsuit from last year revealed how from August 2022 to June 2024, over 42,000 migrants entered Chicago, and Johnson spent a staggering $400 million tackling the influx - with a huge percentage going towards private companies. \n\nFury over Johnson's approach reached boiling point as residents had an opportunity to make their voices heard directly to the Democrat. \n\nOne exasperated woman told him: 'We're in a billion-dollar deficit, and you spent half of our money on illegals?' \n\nThe lawsuit revealed how the city spent over $400 million on migrants within two years. \n\nMigrants living at the Chicago Police Department's 15th District are seen outside the station last September \n\nMore than 42,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in Chicago by bus from the Texas border. Chicago, which is a sanctuary city has been housing the asylum seekers at police stations, O'Hare International Airport, and city-run shelters\n\nAccording to an investigation from NBC5, the bulk of the money went to private companies that provide services including staffing migrant shelters and creating lease agreements. \n\nA staggering $253 million went to just one company, Kansas-based Favorite Healthcare Staffing, to employ migrant shelters. \n\nAnd last spring, Johnson revealed that he was seeking $70 million of taxpayer money to help with the budget shortfall caused by the migrants. \n\nChicago is not the only liberal US city struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants and asylum seekers across the southern border.\n\nBut Johnson has struggled especially hard to accommodate the tens of thousands of newcomers who arrived looking for work and schools and without a roof over their heads.\n\nWhen his administration turned public schools into shelters and doled out apartments to foreigners, residents in the mostly-black affected neighborhoods vented their ire on social media.\n\nMayor Johnson leads a city of more than 2.6 million residents\n\nIn one viral clip, an African-American woman slammed the mayor's support for asylum seekers, with shelters and $9,000 payouts, saying it was at the expense of the blacks who helped elect him.\n\n'I don't understand how they can give these immigrants thousands of dollars in the state of Illinois, but look what they're doing to our own f******g people,' said the Chicago woman.\n\nShe described seeing 'Latinos' arriving in her neighborhood in a '12-foot box truck,' using government welfare checks to 'buy up everything' and effectively price black residents out.\n\n'The fact they are here, and our government is giving more to them than to the people who were born here, is really starting to p**s us off,' she added.\n\n'Mayor Brandon, we are coming for your a**.'\n\nUS Congress\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nProgressive mayor of crime-ridden, broke city is America's least liked with 80% of locals disapproving\n\nAdd comment","summary":"A once-thriving American city is now crumbling under the weight of skyrocketing crime, financial chaos, and a leader more unpopular than Congress.

The tariffs, tied to border security to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs such as fentanyl, were paused for 30 days, after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Trump that Canada would beef up its border security plan by appointing a “fentanyl czar” and listing drug cartels as terrorist organizations.\n\nAlthough Ottawa subsequently implemented those measures, Trump said on Feb. 27 that the tariffs would go ahead as not enough was done to curb drug smuggling. In addition to those tariffs, the Trump administration has also threatened to impose several different tariff measures on Canada on various dates.\n\nRelated StoriesTrump Says Border Tariffs on Canada, Mexico Coming Into Force on March 42/27/2025Trudeau Says Ottawa Continuing to Work ‘Day and Night’ to Stop US Tariffs2/27/2025\n\nTo make Canada stronger, Poilievre said the federal government should immediately repeal the “no-pipeline law C-69” that “has blocked mines, pipelines, power dams, [and] LNG plants” from developing. Bill C-69, now known as the Impact Assessment Act of 2019, allows Ottawa to impose environmental assessments on resource and infrastructure projects such as pipelines and mine development.\n\nOther actions needed for Canada to be less dependent on the United States, he said, include introducing tax cuts on work and investment, removing red tape and taxes that hamper home building, and convening premiers to remove provinces’ exemptions from the Canada Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) to boost internal trade. Poilievre said he was the one who called on the Liberal government to act on those recommendations a month ago.\n\nOn Feb. 21, the federal government announced it will remove more than half of federal exemptions in the CFTA, from 39 to 19. On Feb. 28, Transport and Internal Trade Minister Anita Anand said she met with provincial and territorial trade ministers to discuss eliminating “their remaining exceptions.”Carney and BrookfieldDuring the press conference, Poilievre took aim at Mark Carney, the current frontrunner in the Liberal leadership race, saying the former central banker needs to “come before Canadians” and “explain why he lied” about his role in moving the headquarters of Brookfield Asset Management from Canada to New York.\n\nCarney told reporters on Feb. 25, following a Liberal leadership debate, that the formal decision to move Brookfield’s head office from Toronto happened after he ceased to be the chair of the board.\n\nCarney had also held multiple roles before running for Liberal leader, including as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance and as co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. He had said he resigned from all of the roles in January after entering the leadership race.\n\nHis reply to reporters on Feb. 25 quickly drew fire from the Conservatives, who pointed to an October 2024 press release from Brookfield that indicated the firm had moved its head office to New York while Carney was still serving as chair.\n\nOn Feb, 26, Tory MP Michael Barrett posted on social media a letter written by Carney, dated Dec. 1, 2024, telling Brookfield shareholders of the move.\n\nAt a leadership event in Oakville, Ont., on Feb. 28, Carney told The Globe and Mail that there were several elements to the transaction and it was complicated.\n\nChandra Philip, Matthew Horwood and Noé Chartier contributed to this report","summary":"Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says Canada should focus on making the country strong and self-reliant, as threats of cumulative U.S. tariffs loom.

It is the first Oscar nod of his career.\n\n While his mom was by his side to shower him with support, she disapproved of one big choice he made before the award show. \n\n During a red carpet interview with E! News, the Romanian native said that his mother \"was very upset I didn't shave tonight.\" However, that wasn’t a decision that he made himself. \n\n \"I told her I can't because I have to do this other role,\" Stan, who stars in Marvel's upcoming Thunderbolts*, explained. \"But she was preferring I didn't have the beard.\"\n\n Elsewhere in the interview, Orlovschi opened up about being proud of her son’s accomplishments. \"He works very hard, so he deserves the best,\" she said. \"I can't be more proud.

A Different Man was nominated for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. \n\n In September 2024, the Marvel alum opened up in a chat with Colman Domingo for The A24 Podcast about the advice his mother recently gave him.\n\n \"I love [my mom]. But here's what she said to me recently when she came to visit me, and she's about to leave. I'm like, 'Oh, yeah, everything's great. Thank you so much.' And she goes, 'I have to tell you something, but don't get upset,' \" Stan recalled.\n\n Admitting he was \"already in an anxious place\" at the time, the actor continued, \"And she goes, 'I know you're an actor and everything, but maybe you can express a little less because ... I can see these lines.' \"\n\n Stan was previously nominated at the Golden Globes and BAFTA Awards for his role in The Apprentice. While he didn’t take home the prize at either award show, he won the best actor award in musical or comedy for his portrayal as a struggling actor with neurofibromatosis in A Different Man at the Golden Awards. \n\n See PEOPLE's full coverage of the 97th annual Academy Awards, hosted by Conan O’Brien and airing on ABC.","summary":"\"I told her I can't because I have to do this other role,\" the actor explained of his facial hair","url":"https://people.com/oscars-2025-sebastian-stan-says-mom-very-upset-shave-11689297","image":"https://people.com/thmb/2bIZqQPhlrjwEflLWLQz0LYUgLw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x382:736x384)/Sebastian-Stan-030225-2-321ab91a3e784f85a2608b30b015800c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:10:38","author":"Raven Brunner","authors":["Raven Brunner"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.446},{"id":296013284,"title":"Starmer announces ‘coalition of the willing’ to guarantee Ukraine peace","text":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\n\nThe UK, France and other countries will step up their efforts in a “coalition of the willing” and seek to involve the US in their support for Ukraine, he said.\n\n“We are at a crossroads in history today,” Starmer said after a summit of 18 leaders – mostly from Europe and including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Ukraine felt “strong support” and the summit showed “European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time”.\n\nIt comes two days after a fiery exchange between the Ukrainian leader and US President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n“We are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security,” Zelensky said after the summit.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference shortly after the meeting of leaders, Starmer said four points had been agreed:\n\nto keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia\n\nthat any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks\n\nin the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraine’s defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion\n\nto develop a “coalition of the willing” to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards\n\nSir Keir also announced an additional £1.6bn ($2bn) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles. This comes on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more military aid to Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\n“We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength,” he said.\n\nThe prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.\n\nThe UK, he said, would back its commitment with “boots on the ground, and planes in the air”.\n\n“Europe must do the heavy lifting,” he said, before adding that the agreement would need US backing and had to include Russia, but that Moscow could not be allowed to dictate terms.\n\n“Let me be clear, we agree with Trump on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together,” Sir Keir said.\n\nWhen asked if the US under Trump was an unreliable ally, he said: “Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally.”\n\nCountries at the summit included France, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Italy, Spain and Canada.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said there was an urgent need to “re-arm Europe”.\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who said the meeting had seen European countries “stepping up” to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to “stay in the fight as long as it has to continue”.\n\nAfter the summit, Zelensky went to Sandringham where he met King Charles III. He later spoke to reporters at a final press briefing where he said he was ready to sign a deal on minerals with the US.\n\nUkraine was expected to sign the deal – which would grant the US access to Ukraine’s rare mineral reserves – during Zelensky’s visit to Washington, but the Ukrainian delegation ultimately left early after a heated confrontation with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukraine could not be signed “without a peace deal” with Russia.\n\nBut when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed.\n\n“The agreement that’s on the table will be signed if the parties are ready,” he said.\n\nSunday’s summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir and Zelensky.\n\nHowever, Zelensky’s meeting culminated in a heated exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, in which the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of “gambling with World War Three”.\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine and has expressed trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the consternation of many of his Western allies.\n\nThe US has also begun peace talks with Russia – excluding Ukraine.\n\nAt one point, the US leader accused Ukraine of starting the war – even though it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia’s neighbour on 24 February 2022.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.

The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nShe accessorised perfectly with Lorraine Schwartz jewelry and wore her dark tresses in a perfect bouncy blow dry\n\nRaye opted for a glowing makeup look and put on an animated display as she hit the star-studded red carpet\n\nThe star missed the BRIT Awards in London on Saturday night - where she was awarded the Best R&B Act gong - in order to be at the Oscars in LA\n\nThe 97th Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\n Oscars 2025: Wicked star Cynthia Erivo shocks in bold look as Felicity Jones and Raye lead the British glamour on the red carpet \nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nRaye accepted her BRIT award via video call on Saturday night as she was already in LA for the Oscars \nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live. \n\nOscar nominations 2025 -

mostly from Europe and including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Ukraine felt \"strong support\" and the summit showed \"European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time\".\n\nIt comes two days after a fiery exchange between the Ukrainian leader and US President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n\"We are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security,\" Zelensky said after the summit.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference shortly after the meeting of leaders, Starmer said four points had been agreed:\n\nto keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia\n\nthat any lasting peace must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks\n\nin the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion\n\nto develop a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards\n\nSir Keir also announced an additional £1.6bn ($2bn) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles. This comes on top of a £2.2bn loan to provide more military aid to Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\n\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.\n\nThe UK, he said, would back its commitment with \"boots on the ground, and planes in the air\".\n\n\"Europe must do the heavy lifting,\" he said, before adding that the agreement would need US backing and had to include Russia, but that Moscow could not be allowed to dictate terms.\n\n\"Let me be clear, we agree with Trump on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together,\" Sir Keir said.\n\nWhen asked if the US under Trump was an unreliable ally, he said: \"Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally.\"\n\nCountries at the summit included France, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Italy, Spain and Canada.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said there was an urgent need to \"re-arm Europe\".\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who said the meeting had seen European countries \"stepping up\" to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to \"stay in the fight as long as it has to continue\".\n\nAfter the summit, Zelensky went to Sandringham where he met King Charles III. He later spoke to reporters at a final press briefing where he said he was ready to sign a deal on minerals with the US.\n\nUkraine was expected to sign the deal - which would grant the US access to Ukraine's rare mineral reserves - during Zelensky's visit to Washington, but the Ukrainian delegation ultimately left early after a heated confrontation with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukraine could not be signed \"without a peace deal\" with Russia.\n\nBut when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed.\n\n\"The agreement that's on the table will be signed if the parties are ready,\" he said.\n\nSunday's summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir and Zelensky.\n\nHowever, Zelensky's meeting culminated in a heated exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, in which the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of \"gambling with World War Three\".\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine and has expressed trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the consternation of many of his Western allies.\n\nThe US has also begun peace talks with Russia - excluding Ukraine.\n\nAt one point, the US leader accused Ukraine of starting the war - even though it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbour on 24 February 2022.","summary":"UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/starmer-announces-coalition-of-the-willing-to-guarantee-ukraine-peace/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-13.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-03 00:04:16","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Nato Secretary General","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Nato Secretary General"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":296011580,"title":"RFK Jr. Says Texas Measles Outbreak ‘Top Priority’ at HHS, Sending Vaccine Doses","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new U.S. health secretary, said that a measles outbreak in western Texas that has infected more than 100 people and led to one death is a “top priority” for his agency and said that vaccines will be provided.\n\nHe said that his agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), would send Texas 2,000 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine through its immunization program.\n\nAdditionally, HHS will provide “lab support to better track the virus causing the outbreak,” will communicate “with public health officials every day in all affected areas to support their response and ensure they have the resources they need,” and provide communications to local communities in Low German—the language used by Mennonites.\n\n“We will continue to fund Texas’ immunization program. Ending the measles outbreak is a top priority for me and my extraordinary team at HHS,” Kennedy wrote on the platform.\n\n“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” the Texas health department said Feb. 28, adding that it is “working with local health departments to investigate the outbreak.”\n\nThe virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, under-vaccinated” Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton said last week.\n\nFor years, Kennedy has publicly questioned the efficacy and safety of the MMR vaccine that many young children have to receive before attending schools or daycares, as well as other childhood vaccines. He has also spoken against states and localities mandating the shots for children.\n\nYears earlier, in a 2019 Washington state legislature hearing on a bill that removed personal exemptions for families to the MMR vaccine, Kennedy expressed concerns over the safety of some childhood vaccines, including the MMR shot, and alleged that they are possibly linked to autoimmune disorders, autism, ADHD, and other disorders.\n\n“Do we want to force parents to risky medical interventions without consent?” he asked. “Will mandating this vaccine cause more harm than good?”\n\nAfter he was sworn in as the HHS secretary in February, Kennedy vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule for measles, polio, and other diseases. “Nothing is going to be off limits,” he said, adding that pesticides, food additives, microplastics, antidepressants, and the electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones and microwaves also would be studied.\n\nKennedy has said that he wants to “make America healthy again”—borrowing from President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “make America great again”—by targeting chronic health issues that have plagued the United States.","summary":"The outbreak so

Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as Mr. Trump's national security adviser during his first administration. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia and provided aid to Ukraine after the war began but last month, Mr. Trump flipped U.S. policy on its head. He opened peace talks with Russia, which occupies 20% of Ukraine while bombing the rest, and did not invite Ukraine. Then on Friday, he berated Zelenskyy during an explosive Oval Office meeting.\"Vladimir Putin couldn't be happier,\" McMaster, who is a CBS News contributor, said. \"Because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelenskyy, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.\" Trump and Russia During his Friday Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump revealed something of a common cause with the Russian president. Mr. Trump complained that he and Putin had both been slandered for years by allegations that Russia helped Mr. Trump's campaigns, allegations the U.S. president ties to his Democratic opponents. \"Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia,\" Mr. Trump said.McMaster, who was ousted by Mr. Trump in 2018, said Putin has manipulated many world leaders, including the U.S. commander in chief.\"He appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? That, you know, 'Donald, you know, like me, you know, you've been treated so unfairly,'\" McMaster said. \"And he's been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world.\"The president, McMaster said, is being played. \"And he's being played like other presidents have been played, like other leaders have been played, through that same playbook of Putin's,\" McMaster said. Fact-checking President Trump's claims on UkraineMr. Trump, who's boasted that only he can end the war quickly, has repeatedly made false claims about Ukraine. Last month, he suggested that Ukraine was responsible for Russia's invasion, saying \"You should never have started it.\"Ukraine did not start the war. Fighting erupted just over three years ago with Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The president also said the U.S. gave $350 billion toward Ukraine. It's $122 billion, according to Kiel Institute data.He's also gone after Zelenskyy.\"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left,\" Mr. Trump said on Feb. 19 in a Truth Social post.Zelenskyy is not a dictator. He was elected in 2019. There hasn't been a vote since because of the war. McMaster addressed some of Mr. Trump's claims on Zelenskyy and Ukraine in recent weeks. \"Well, President Trump, as we all know, has a tendency to say outlandish things. Sometimes that's to shake the situation up,\" he said. The shifting U.S. relationship with UkraineMr. Trump also doesn't always consider how his words could hurt his agenda or how they could be received abroad, McMaster said. \"War really is a contest of wills, and I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump delivering a series of body blows to the Ukrainians in a way that could affect, you know, their will to continue to fight,\" McMaster said. Ukraine's allies were likely confused by the meeting, according to McMaster.\"They think, you know, 'How can President Trump be berating the leader of Ukraine while he says kind things about Vladimir Putin?\"Immediately after the Oval Office fight, many Republicans rallied around the president. On X, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said America was \"disrespected\" during the Oval Office meeting. He said he was proud of both the president and vice president for \"standing up for America First.\"After the meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X: \"Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you!\"But some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concerns. Republican Rep. Don Bacon, a retired Air Force brigadier general, stood by Ukraine when he spoke with 60 Minutes before the Oval Office fight. \"America's the leader of the free world. We're the indispensable power. Nobody can stand up to Russia and China if we're not a part of that. And Ukraine's the victim,\" Bacon said. \"And I think Putin has made clear that he wants to reestablish his old borders and that's not in our national security interest. So, to me, this is a national security issue, also a moral issue.\"He said it appears as though Mr. Trump is appeasing Putin.\"I don't know his motives. Some people think he's doin' this for negotiating and maybe he'll get a better deal. I don't know,\" Bacon said. \"All I know is what he says, and when he says that Russia is not the invader, that it's Ukraine's fault, that's just wrong.\"While other Republican lawmakers rushed to condemn President Zelenskyy after the Oval Office meeting, calling him disrespectful to President Trump, Bacon stood by Ukraine's president, saying on social media that this was \"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West. Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"Sen. Angus King, an Independent from Maine serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said he was ashamed when the U.S. recently sided with Russia at the United Nations, joining Russia in voting against a Europe-backed Ukrainian resolution.\"I always try to think of, you know, what's the argument on both sides? I cannot think of a rational argument for pulling our support from Ukraine,\" King told 60 Minutes.King likes to point out that Europe has given more to Ukraine than the U.S. and Ukraine has given the most. \"They've done the dying. All they've asked for us is to send them the means to defend themselves,\" he said.

In what was planned to be a brief, cordial, greeting, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy squared off in the Oval Office and left an alliance shaken. For three years, the west has stood against Russia's unprovoked invasion of an innocent country. Ukraine is a vanity war for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who covets an empire. And for that alone, more than one million people have been killed or wounded on both sides. President Trump has boasted only he can end it quickly. But, in the last two weeks, his chaotic attempt alarmed allies and encouraged enemies. By Friday, he was scolding the man who stands between Russia and the rest of Europe.President Trump: You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: We're going to feel your influence. President Trump: You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: That is from the very beginning of the war…. President Trump: You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: We're not playing cards. President Trump: You're playing cards! You're playing cards! You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III!The meeting itself was a gamble, and the public had never seen anything like it. The president, dressing down Zelenskyy, whose people had done all of the dying to stop Putin short of the border of NATO.Scott Pelley: Vladimir Putin watches the video from the Oval Office and what does he see?H.R. McMaster: Vladimir Putin couldn't be happier, Scott. Because what he sees is all of the pressure on Zelenskyy, all of the pressure on Ukraine and no pressure on him.H.R. McMaster knows, he was national security adviser in Trump's first term. He's a retired Army general, senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, and a CBS News contributor.Scott Pelley: The allies look at the video from the Oval Office and see what?H.R. McMaster: What they see is something that's just confounding, a discussion that doesn't reflect the reality of the war in Ukraine, the degree to which this war has -- is a crime against humanity. And they think, you know, \"How can President Trump be berating the leader of Ukraine while he says kind things about Vladimir Putin?\"We have seen those 'crimes against humanity' in mass graves of Ukrainian civilians and in their obliterated cities. Behind a murderous frontline, Russia occupies 20% of Ukraine and bombs all the rest. American-led sanctions isolated Putin. But, last month, President Trump flipped U.S. policy on its head. He opened peace talks with Russia and did not invite Ukraine. At the same time, he spread a deceitful history of the war.President Trump (2/18/2025): But today, I heard, \"Oh, well, we weren't invited.\" Well, you've been there for three years. You should have ended it three years, you should have never started it. You could have made a deal….Ukraine did not start the war. Next, the president said this…President Trump (2/18/2025): We gave them, I believe, $350 billion, but let's say it's something less than that. But it's a — it's a lot.It's 122 billion, not 350. The next day, Trump went after Zelenskyy...President Trump (2/19/2025): A dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast, or he is not going to have a country left. Gotta move, gotta move fast because that war is going in the wrong direction. Zelenskyy is not a dictator. He was elected in 2019. There hasn't been a vote since because of the war. On Feb. 24 Trump's tilt toward Russia reached the U.N., where America voted against its allies and sided with Russia and North Korea, opposing Ukraine. Alarmed, the leaders of France and Britain hurried to the White House. Scott Pelley: In these last two weeks we've heard him call Zelenskyy a dictator, we've heard him say it was Ukraine that started the war. What is going on?H.R. McMaster: Well, President Trump, as we all know, has a tendency to say outlandish things. Sometimes that's to shake the situation up and create some sense of change. But often times what he doesn't consider is how his words could impede his own agenda, or how his words actually can cut against U.S. interests or be received abroad in a way that's-- much different from the way his political supporters will receive those words in the United States. And so those words were damaging, damaging to the psyche of the Ukrainians. You know, war really is a contest of wills, and I think what you're seeing is Donald Trump delivering a series of body blows to the Ukrainians in a way that could affect, you know, their will to continue to fight.Zelenskyy's will to fight led him to push for the meeting Friday. Trump had demanded Ukraine sign over the rights to billions of dollars in mineral wealth to pay America back. Zelenskyy came to sign the deal. President Trump: Well, thank you very much it's an honor to have President Zelenskyy of Ukraine…President Trump began, generously.President Trump: I give tremendous credit to your generals and your soldiers and yourself in the sense that it's been very hard fighting very tough fighting, great fighters. And you have to be very proud of them from that standpoint but now we want to get it over with.These public, Oval Office meetings are planned for weeks with issues settled in advance. But this was hasty. Neither side was prepared. Trump spoke of loss in the war both the victim and the aggressor.President Trump: They're not American soldiers, but they're Russian soldiers and they're Ukrainian soldiers. And we want to be able to stop it.Zelenskyy seemed irritated when his people were equated to the invading Russians. President Trump:Whether they're in Russia or Ukraine, think of the parents of all these people being killed needlessly.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: They came to our territory.President Trump: Should have never started. Trump helped arm Zelenskyy in Trump's first term. But now, he has all but cut off aid. Trump is pushing a quick ceasefire without an international guarantee of Ukraine's security—which is Russia's position, too. President Trump: I'm not aligned with Putin. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world. I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. You see the hatred he's got for Putin, it's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate, he's got tremendous hatred. Protocol prevailed for 40 minutes until Vice President JD Vance said diplomacy could have ended the war long ago.Vice President JD Vance: The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy…President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Can I ask you?Vice President JD Vance: Sure.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Yeah?Vice President JD Vance: Yeah. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: OK.Vance had struck a nerve with a man who has buried tens of thousands of his countrymen. It got worse when Vance told Zelenskyy he'd seen Ukraine – on TV. Zelenskyy explained that Putin, a mass-murderer indicted for war crimes, could not be trusted. A ceasefire without a security guarantee would be naive.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy: What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about, what do you mean?Vice President JD Vance: I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's gonna end the destruction of your country. Mr. President. Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.It was the White House that called in the media. Ukraine's ambassador couldn't bear to watch.President Trump: The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy. And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. Your people are very brave, but you are either going to make a deal or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's gonna be pretty, but you'll fight it out. But you don't have the cards, but once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing.Immediately after the meltdown, many Republicans rallied around the president—saying Zelenskyy was at fault. But Republican Congressman Don Bacon has worried about Trump's approach to Ukraine since last month. Rep. Don Bacon: I hope it's not as bad as it sounds.Congressman Bacon represents Omaha. He's a retired Air Force general who knows what America means to NATO.Rep. Don Bacon: America's the leader of the free world. We're the indispensable power. Nobody can stand up to Russia and China if we're not a part of that. And Ukraine's the victim. And I think Putin has made clear that he wants to reestablish his old borders and that's not in our national security interest. So, to me, this is a national security issue, but also a moral issue.Scott Pelley: Would you say that Donald Trump is appeasing Vladimir Putin?Rep. Don Bacon: Appears that way, though I can't get into his motives. I don't know his motives. Some people think he's doin' this for-- negotiating and maybe-- he'll get a better deal. I don't know. All I know is what he says, and when he says that Russia is not the invader, that it's Ukraine's fault, that's just wrong.Scott Pelley: Is there danger in this?Rep. Don Bacon: Yup, there is, I fear what this means -- we've had -- we came out of World War II, you know, the dominant power, the indispensable country for freedom. We've had NATO. And I worry that this framework, is gonna collapse.Scott Pelley: When the United States sided with Russia and North Korea at the United Nations, what message did that send?Sen. Angus King: Well, the first message it sent to me was shame.Sen. Angus King is an Independent from Maine serving on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. Sen. Angus King: I always try to think of, you know, what's the argument on both sides? I cannot think of a rational argument for pulling our support from Ukraine.Sen. King likes to point out that Europe has given more than the U.S. and Ukraine has given the most. Sen. Angus King: They've done the dying. All they've asked for us is to send them the means to defend themselves.Scott Pelley: In this moment, what should Congress be doing about Ukraine?Sen. Angus King: I think they have to start speaking up. Because if we persist in walking away from Ukraine, it will be the greatest geopolitical mistake that this country's made since World War II.Back in the Oval Office, President Trump revealed something of a common cause with the Russian president. Trump complained he and Putin had been slandered for years by allegations that Russia helped Trump's campaigns—allegations Trump ties to his Democratic opponents.President Trump: Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam, Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff, who was a Democrat scam, and he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn't end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff -- he had nothing to do with. It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. It was disgusting. That rant was familiar to Trump's first term national security adviser, H.r. McMaster. McMaster left the white house after 13 months in a falling out with the president. But even back then, he was warning Trump about Vladimir Putin.H.R. McMaster: He appeals to President Trump's sense of aggrievement, right? That, you know, \"Donald, you know, like me, you know, you've been treated so unfairly.\" And he's been very successful at it because he's a master manipulator and one of the best liars in the world.Scott Pelley: You seem to be saying that President Trump is being played.H.R. McMaster: He is being played. And he's being played like other presidents have been played, like other leaders have been played, through that same playbook of Putin's. Today, the allies stood with Zelenskyy. In London, a flash summit was arranged with leaders including those of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the head of NATO, and the British prime minister—who announced new negotiations by Britain and France-- potentially taking the lead for peace out of the hands of President Trump.President Trump: Alright. I think we've seen enough. What do you think?Produced by Henry Schuster and Sarah Turcotte. Broadcast associate, Michelle Karim. Edited by Peter M. Berman and Robert Zimet.

Plus, the most polarizing country","text":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about. You’ll also find data-based updates on past Daily Kos reporting, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nMost voters can’t stomach the reality of being anti-immigration\n\nData shows that Americans are swinging to the right on immigration … doesn’t it?\n\nFifty-three percent of registered voters in December supported mass deportations of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to a poll from Civiqs. Furthermore, in July 2024, Gallup released data showing that 55% of Americans wanted to decrease immigration to their country—an abrupt change from just three years earlier, when more people wanted to increase immigration than decrease it. And that swing looks very dramatic in a chart:\n\nBut new polling from Data for Progress suggests that while Americans may want less immigration in a broad sense, they don’t have the stomach for the reality of the right’s anti-immigration platform. \n\nPresident Donald Trump rescinded guidance banning immigration arrests in places like churches and schools, but when faced with that scenario, voters recoil. A majority of likely voters does not want U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest people at funerals, weddings, public religious ceremonies, in places of worship, at schools, or anywhere children gather, like at playgrounds. Only 39% of likely voters support ICE arrests at domestic violence shelters and food pantries. Only 37% support arrests at hospitals.\n\nAnd the more specific Data for Progress got, the more voters shrank away from a hard-line anti-immigration viewpoint. Only 32% of likely voters support allowing ICE to arrest “a father … at his child’s school play.” Only 27% support arresting “a woman” waiting at a hospital for emergency care.\n\nBeyond arrests, and in another break with Trump, even fewer voters want to turn away asylum-seekers once they hear their stories. Only 25% of likely voters don’t want to allow into the country “a young woman fleeing political persecution in Belarus for participating in pro-democracy protests.” And only 20% don’t want to admit “a 13-year-old boy and his family fleeing war in Syria after their home was destroyed and they fear for their lives.” Sixty percent of likely voters would let that family in.\n\nSo what does this mean? \n\nIn June 2021, when Gallup last found Americans more supportive of increasing immigration than decreasing it, the country was coming out of the first Trump presidency. Americans had been forced to witness his vicious family-separation policy and his antagonism of DREAMers, or people who were brought to the country illegally as children and received protection from being deported. People saw this ugliness, and they rejected it.\n\nThis time around, images and personal stories of Trump’s mass deportations will no doubt lead some Americans to second-guess their hard-heartedness. The more the public has to face this ugliness, the more likely their opinion drifts back to the left.\n\nThe real question is, how many lives must be ruined before that happens?\n\nPolarization goes global\n\nOn a lighter note: Israel. \n\nThat nation is the most politically polarizing of the 22 that Gallup included in a new study. Just 33% of Democrats have a very or mostly favorable opinion of the country, while 83% of Republicans do—a 50-percentage-point partisan gap. Gallup’s study comes amid a ceasefire in the region, following a war that left more than 46,000 Palestinians dead, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\n\nAlso atop the chart are Mexico, Ukraine, Cuba, and the Palestinian territories (the Gaza Strip and West Bank), which have between 36- and 27-point partisan gaps. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to feel favorable to all four locations.\n\nMuch of this has an obvious partisan bent. Democrats have a more positive view of Mexico and Ukraine—83% and 84% favorable, respectively—while Republicans, fueled by a pro-Russian sentiment among GOP lawmakers and by general xenophobia, are much more negative on both. Among Republicans, 54% have a favorable view of Ukraine and 47% have one of Mexico. \n\nJust as notable is where party members mostly agree. There is a partisan divide of less than 10 points regarding North Korea, Great Britain, Canada, Iraq, Japan, Denmark, Afghanistan, Iran (!), China (!!), and Egypt, which is seen favorably by 61% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans—an insignificant 3-point gap.\n\nIt’s probably because of the pyramids. Everyone loves the pyramids.\n\nOld people to old politicians: Leave office\n\nCongress got slightly younger this year, with the median age dropping to 57.5 years old in the House and to 64.7 years old in the Senate—both by about half a year compared to the previous session. However, each chamber has its share of lawmakers born before World War II who might not be the best suited to, say, tackle regulating artificial intelligence. Or even the internet. \n\nSo it makes sense that older Americans are widely supportive of older lawmakers stepping down to make room for younger politicians, according to new polling from YouGov. What’s surprising, though, is that older Americans are the most supportive of passing the torch.\n\nSixty-three percent of Americans ages 65 and older want older politicians to retire so younger ones can fill their seats—five percentage points higher than the other three age groups, which each clock in at 58% support.\n\nEven more surprising? Americans ages 65 and older are also the most supportive of implementing maximum age limits on serving in office, according to YouGov. Sixty-eight percent support such an age limit. \n\nAmericans ages 45 to 64 are also at 68% support, and while younger Americans—those 44 and under—are only a point or two lower in support, that’s roughly the margin of error on the poll, meaning the difference isn’t that significant.\n\nStill, taken together, older Americans seem to know enough to know Congress needs fresh blood.\n\nSomebody tell Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. If he runs again in 2028 and wins, he will be over 100 at the end of his next term.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Trump’s absurd threats to take over Canada have provoked our famously nice northern neighbors into booing the U.S. national anthem at sporting events. Whether or not many Americans are aware of that, they very much don’t support booing national anthems, according to a new poll from YouGov: 72% find the act unacceptable, while only 14% think it’s acceptable.\n\n Trump is loudly proclaiming himself “KING,” but Americans are just as loudly saying, “NO THANKS.” In fact, 84% don’t want him to be king of the U.S., according to YouGov. That includes 80% of Trump 2024 voters. Bipartisanship!\n\n Though the membership of a Christian nationalist movement is incredibly overblown, as Daily Kos has covered, the share of U.S. adults that is Christian has hovered around 63% since 2019, according to a new study from Pew Research Center. This comes after a long period of decline. In 2007, 78% of adults identified as Christian.\n\n Despite high-profile plane crashes, the number of airplane accidents is actually down from this time last year. However, 72% of likely voters think crashes have become more frequent, according to Data for Progress. Only 5% think crashes have become less frequent.\n\nForty-six percent of registered voters support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, according to Civiqs. That ties the share that wants to deport those immigrants. Between December 2016 and December 2020, support for a pathway fluctuated between 54% and 58%. \n\nBut a lot of that decline is likely explained by the theory of thermostatic public opinion, or the idea that public opinion tends to move in the opposite direction of government action. \n\nFor example, voters back Republicans in one election, then realize they don’t like everything Republicans are doing, so they vote for Democrats in the next election, then find they don’t like everything Democrats are doing, so they vote for Republicans the next time. It’s part of why the sitting president’s party almost always loses in the midterms. It’s a loop of dissatisfaction. \n\nAfter all, support for a pathway to citizenship started declining in December 2020, right after Joe Biden won the presidency.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly column rounding up three of the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about.

Just a fact.’ \n\nIn another scathing post, Musk called Zelensky’s strategy for the ongoing conflict with Russia ‘cruel and inhumane.’\n\n‘What I said over 2 years ago was that Ukraine should seek peace or suffer severe loss of life for no gains. The latter was Zelensky’s choice,’ Musk wrote. ‘Now, he wants to do that again. This is cruel and inhumane.’\n\nIn extraordinary scenes which were broadcast across the world, a tense war of words unfolded after Zelensky asked JD Vance a question which sent him into a fit of rage.\n\nSpeaking a calm manner, Zelensky had asked: ‘What kind of diplomacy, JD, are you speaking about? What do you mean?’\n\nIn a furious tirade, Vance spat back: ‘I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.\n\n‘Mr President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.\n\n‘Right now you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the President for trying to bring an end to this conflict.’\n\nThe argument continued to escalate as the two sides talked over each other and the pitched battle intensified.\n\n‘Have you ever been to Ukraine that you see the problems we have?’ Zelensky asked Vance, who last April in the Senate voted against a package with $61 billion in aid for Ukraine.\n\n‘I have been to – I’ve actually, I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people. You bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr President,’ Vance shot back.\n\nThen Trump jumped in to defend his vice president. ‘You’ve allowed to be in a very bad position, and it happens to be right about that. You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.’\n\n‘I’m not playing cards,’ Zelensky responded, speaking over him.\n\n‘Have you said thank you once?’ Vance blasted Zelensky at one point in the conflagration.\n\n‘Just say thank you,’ Vance told him. ‘I said it a lot of times,’ Zelensky responded.\n\nZelensky’s first words had been: ‘Thank you so much, Mr President, thank you for the invitation’. Vance appeared to be seeking gratitude for the massive infusion of military aid.\n\nIt is not the first time that Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the Ukrainian President. \n\nLast month, he suggested Volodymyr Zelensky runs a ‘fraud machine feeding off the dead bodies of soldiers’.\n\nWriting on his X platform, he said: ‘In reality, he is despised by the people of Ukraine, which is why he has refused to hold an election. I challenge Zelensky to hold an election and refute this. He will not.’\n\nTrump’s ally then added: ‘President Trump is right to ignore him and solve for peace independent of the disgusting, massive graft machine feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers.’\n\nWhile Musk did not elaborate on what he meant by this, his comments appear to echo Trump’s accusation that Zelensky wanted to ‘keep the gravy train’ of foreign aid running with the war.\n\nPrior to meeting the Ukrainian President, Donald Trump launched a scathing attack on his Ukrainian counterpart, blaming him for the war on his country despite Russia being the aggressor. Zelensky in turn accused the US President of falling for Russian fake news.\n\nTrump hit back by labelling Zelensky ‘a dictator without elections’ – despite the Ukrainian leader winning more than 73 per cent of the vote in Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election and only pausing elections because of the war.\n\nThe tension then erupted in front of the world media, leaving question marks about the future of US – Ukraine relations. \n\nMr Trump is reportedly now demanding his Ukrainian counterpart makes the first move to restore relations following their fractious Oval Office dispute on Friday night that sparked demands for his promised British trip to be axed.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed Mr Zelensky to Downing Street the following day and made clear Britain’s ongoing backing for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion – as Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced £2.26billion of new funding.\n\nSir Keir last night spoke with both Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, after the PM insisted Ukraine had ‘full backing across the United Kingdom’ in a Number 10 meeting with Mr Zelensky.\n\nGreeting him later at No 10, and referring to the cheers of supporters who gathered outside Downing Street, Sir Keir said: ‘I hope you heard some of that cheering in the street, that is the people of the United Kingdom coming out to demonstrate how much they support you and Ukraine and our absolute determination to stand with you – unwavering determination.’\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly releasing more than £2billion from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s military – the first time money generated from the appreciation of such assets will be used for military purposes.\n\nShe and the Ukrainian finance minister will sign a £2.26billion UK-Ukraine bilateral loan agreement, the Sunday Times reported.\n\nShe is also poised to change the remit of the £27.8billion National Wealth Fund – previously reserved for infrastructure projects – so it can be spent on supporting the British defence sector.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk has lashed out a Volodymyr Zelensky after the Ukrainian President&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk criticizes Volodymyr Zelensky for disagreements with Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/elon-musk-criticizes-volodymyr-zelensky-for-disagreements-with-donald-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/02/17/95720021-14453003-The_Vice_President_can_be_seen_to_brutally_turn_against_the_war_-a-3_1740937668983.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 23:58:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":296009266,"title":"Canada could send troops to Ukraine – Trudeau","text":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has claimed that his country is considering all possible options and is not ruling out sending troops, after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced a new “coalition of the willing” to secure Kiev’s positions should a peace deal with Moscow be reached.\n\nStarmer hosted an emergency meeting in London on Sunday, during which he acknowledged that while some nations have little to contribute, those willing should act with urgency. Asked whether Canada would consider deploying its troops, Trudeau said that any scenario was possible.\n\n“Canada has looked at the ways it can best help, and as I said a few days ago, everything’s on the table,” Trudeau said, insisting that his country “has been one of the strongest countries in support of Ukraine from the beginning.”\n\nAs an example of Canada’s leadership in supporting Kiev, Trudeau highlighted a joint effort with the UK and Poland under which they have “provided military training to over 44,000 Ukrainian troops” since 2015 – an average of roughly 4,400 per year. He also cited “almost $20 billion” ($13.8 billion USD) in “multifaceted assistance” to Kiev. However, Germany’s Kiel Institute estimates Ottawa’s total contribution at around $8.6 billion, making it the fifth-largest individual state donor after the US, Germany, the UK, and Japan.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova responded with amusement to Trudeau’s remarks, questioning whether Canada even has enough troops to protect its own borders – apparently referencing US President Donald Trump’s running joke about absorbing Canada as the 51st state.\n\n“And who will protect Canadian soil in the event of a northward expansion of the United States? Apparently, Ukrainians who fled to Canada from mobilization,” Zakharova quipped.\n\nStarmer reiterated on Sunday that “not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can’t mean that we sit back,” emphasizing that the UK is “prepared to back this with boots on the ground and planes in the air, together with others.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron stated that European troops would only be deployed once the situation on the ground is deemed safe for them. He proposed a temporary month-long “truce in the air, on the seas, and on energy infrastructure” – an idea that Moscow has previously denounced as a Western ploy to rearm and bolster Kiev.\n\nMoscow has strongly opposed the deployment of unauthorized foreign troops to Ukraine, warning that without a UN mandate, they would be considered legitimate targets. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that the idea of deploying foreign troops to Ukraine – pushed primarily by France and Britain – is meant to “further fuel the conflict and stop any attempts to cool it down.”","summary":"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has claimed that Ottawa is considering all possible options to secure and bolster Kiev’s positions against Moscow \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/613595-trudeau-canada-troops-ukraine/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.03/article/67c4efb185f5402e9a5f8baf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 23:55:27","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.036},{"id":296018194,"title":"Elon Musk lashes out at Volodymyr Zelensky after Ukrainian President's rows with Donald Trump","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14453003/elon-musk-lashes-volodymyr-zelensky-donald-trump-row.html\" on this server.\nReference #18.6e2a3517.1740964322.137ccf9e\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.6e2a3517.1740964322.137ccf9e","summary":"Elon Musk has lashed out at Volodymyr Zelensky following an explosive row between the Ukrainian President and Donald Trump at the White House.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14453003/elon-musk-lashes-volodymyr-zelensky-donald-trump-row.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/02/18/95748311-0-image-m-25_1740938461996.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-02 23:55:20","author":"Editor","authors":["Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-1},{"id":296014998,"title":"Heartstopper actress Yasmin Finney turns heads in a quirky feathered gown as she enjoys unlikely reunion with co-stars Kit Connor and Joe Locke at the 2025 Academy Awards","text":"Heartstopper actress Yasmin Finney turns heads in a quirky feathered gown as she enjoys unlikely reunion with co-stars Kit Connor and Joe Locke at the 2025 Academy Awards\n\nREAD MORE: Full list of Oscar nominations 2025 \n\nREAD MORE: Oscars 2025 LIVE BLOG \n\nBy GERAINT LLEWELLYN FOR MAILONLINE\n\nPublished: 23:49 GMT, 2 March 2025 | Updated: 23:53 GMT, 2 March 2025\n\nHeartstopper star Yasmin Finney enjoyed an unlikely reunion with her fellow British co-stars Kit Connor and Joe Locke at the 2025 Oscars in Hollywood on Sunday.\n\nThe actress, 21, who plays Elle Argent in the smash hit Netflix series, turned heads as she hit the red carpet in a quirky black gown.\n\nYasmin's bold look hugged her jaw-dropping figure with tall feathers emerging from her bodice and partly covered her gorgeous face. \n\nThe stunner, who also appeared in Doctor Who, accessorised with sheer opera gloves and dainty gold jewellery. \n\nMeanwhile Kit, 20, who stars as Nick Nelson, was suited and booted in a classic black suit which he layered over a white short and tie.\n\nHis onscreen love interest Joe, 21, who plays Charlie Spring, opted for a less traditional suit with a sequinned blazer beneath a dark morning jacket. \n\nHeartstopper star Yasmin Finney enjoyed an unlikely reunion with her fellow British co-stars at the 2025 Oscars in Hollywood on Sunday\n\nShe hit the red carpet alongside (L-R) Kit Connor and Joe Lock\n\nThe 97th Academy Awards are honoring the best films of 2024, with the star-studded ceremony being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nConan O'Brien, 61, is making his debut as Oscars host, after joking: 'I only agreed to host so that I could get invited.'\n\nThis year's ceremony has an unusually unsettled field in many of the most high-profile categories, including best picture and most of the acting categories.\n\nEmilia Pérez leads the nominations this year with 13, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña), director (for Jacques Audiard), adapted screenplay and original song.\n\nGascón stars as the title character, a former Mexican drug lord who comes out as a transgender woman and fakes her own death in order to reinvent herself as a pro-social force, while Saldaña plays an ethically challenged lawyer who helps set up her new identity.\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay.\n\nBrody stars as a Jewish Hungarian architect who immigrates to the US after surviving the Holocaust. The epic historical drama follows his character László Tóth's attempts to realize his creative vision even as it conflicts with the petty desires of his wealthy benefactor (Pearce).\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande).\n\nThe actress, 21, who plays Elle Argent in the smash hit Netflix series, turned heads as she hit the red carpet in a quirky black gown\n\nYasmin's bold look hugged her jaw-dropping figure with tall feathers emerging from her bodice and partly covered her gorgeous face\n\nThe stunner, who also appeared in Doctor Who , accessorised with sheer opera gloves and dainty gold jewellery\n\nMeanwhile Kit, 20, who stars as Nick Nelson was suited and booted in a classic black suit which he layered over a white short and tie\n\nHis onscreen love interest Joe, 21, who plays Charlie Spring, opted for a less traditional suit with a sequinned blazer beneath a dark morning jacket\n\nPictured together in the Netflix series\n\nThe blockbuster musical is an adaptation of only the first half of the musical of the same name, a reimagined prequel to The Wizard Of Oz starring Erivo as Elphaba, future Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda Upland, who becomes Glinda the Good \n\nOther best pictures nominees include Anora, A Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part Two, I'm Still Here, Nickel Boys and The Substance. \n\nOscars best dressed! Selena Gomez, Demi Moore and Elle Fanning lead red carpet glamor at the Academy Awards\n\nThe closely watched race for best actor in a leading role got a major shakeup just a week before the Oscars at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, when Timothée Chalamet scored a shock win for his Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown. \n\nPrior to that win, Brody was seemingly the favorite after winning best actor awards at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the BAFTAs, the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Movie Awards.\n\nRalph Fiennes has also doggedly stayed in the running for his role as a British Cardinal struggling to keep a secretive papal election from dissolving into competition and intrigue. \n\nThe critically acclaimed film has scored multiple actor wins at smaller ceremonies and festivals for Fiennes, as well as multiple awards for the entire acting ensemble, which Fiennes has accepted on more than one occasion. \n\nThose three co-frontrunners are competing against Colman Domingo for Sing Sing and Sebastian Stan for his performance as a young Donald Trump in The Apprentice.\n\nThe best actress category also has no clear frontrunner. Demi Moore has been lauded for her comeback performance in the satirical body-horror film The Substance, which earned her best actress honors from the Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes, as well as several critics' organizations. \n\nBut her win a week before the Oscars at the SAG Awards suggests she may be in a prime spot to snatch the Oscar after being nominated for the first time. \n\nEmilia Pérez leads this year's Oscar nominees with 13 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Karla Sofía Gascón), supporting actress (for Zoe Saldaña) and director\n\nThe Brutalist landed in second place with 10 nominations, including for best picture, director (for Brady Corbet), actor (for Adrien Brody), supporting actor (for Guy Pearce), supporting actress (for Felicity Jones), and original screenplay\n\nConan O'Brien is hosting the ceremony, which is being held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, for the first time; pictured Wednesday in Hollywood\n\nWicked tied it for 10 nominations, including for best picture, actress (for Cynthia Erivo), and supporting actress (for Ariana Grande) \n\nAnora star Mikey Madison, who plays an adult dancer who impetuously marries the son of a Russian Oligarch, was widely acclaimed and was honored by several critics' organizations early in the season. \n\nHer chances increased significantly after she won the BAFTA for best lead actress, which she followed up with an Independent Spirit Award win in the gender-neutral lead performance category. \n\nEmilia Pérez star Karla Sofía Gascón was once a favorite for the award, but she was widely criticized after racist and Islamophobic tweets — some quite recent — that had somehow gone unremarked upon were translated into English and reported on.\n\nSince then, Gascón has sat out awards ceremonies after her posts came to light. After multiple half-hearted apologies, Netflix reportedly opted to stop paying for Gascón's travel and accommodations for awards shows, though a source told People that she still plans to attend the Oscars.\n\nBefore the controversy, her nomination was seen as historic, as she is the first openly transgender woman to be nominated in the best actress category. \n\nThis year's best lead actor race is up in the air after Timothée Chalamet's recent SAG win for A Complete Unknown\n\nBrody is also a favorite for The Brutalist, but Ralph Fiennes has gotten plenty of awards-season attention for the papal-selection drama Conclave\n\nAnora's Mikey Madison is a late-breaking best actress co-frontrunner after recent wins and controversy that erupted after offensive tweets from Emilia Pérez's Karla Sofía Gascón resurfaced\n\nDemi Moore is the other major frontrunner for the satirical body-horror film The Substance. She has won multiple major awards this season\n\nThe other nominees are Wicked star Cynthia Erivo, who has failed to capture any major awards, and the Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, who stars in the historical drama I'm Still Here. She had her own controversy after a clip of her appearing in blackface in a comedy sketch from a Brazilian TV series 17 years ago resurfaced in January.\n\nIn the supporting actress category, the nominees including Monica Barbaro for A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande for Wicked, Felicity Jones for The Brutalist, Isabella Rossellini for Conclave and Zoe Saldaña for Emilia Pérez \n\nSaldaña appears to be the current favorite after a string of wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTA Awards, SAG Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\n\nBut some of those early awards had voting periods that cut off prior to the controversy around Gascón surfacing, which could potentially harm her chances from voters who were turned off of Emilia Pérez altogether.\n\nThe supporting actor category seems the easiest to predict, Kieran Culkin's string of wins for A Real Pain making him the favorite. \n\nThe other nominees include Yura Borisov for Anora, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Guy Pearce for The Brutalist and Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. \n\nAmong the best picture nominees, Emilia Pérez once seemed like the most likely winner, but Gascon's offensive posts have threatened its chances.\n\nThe Palme d'Or–winning Anora got a late boost with wins for best picture at the Directors Guild of America Awards and the Producers Guild of America Awards, which are considered two of the best predictors of Oscars success by awards-season prognosticators, and its win at the Independent Spirit Awards didn't hurt.\n\nSaldaña appears to be the favorite in the supporting actress category after a string of wins\n\nKieran Culkin has dominated the supporting actor categories in recent weeks for Jesse Eisenberg's drama A Real Pain\n\nAfter Gascón's offensive tweets surfaced, Emilia Pérez's best picture frontrunner status seemed in question, and Anora has snatched up the top award at multiple ceremonies considered major predictors of the Oscars\n\nThe best director category seems likely to be a three-man race between Anora's Sean Baker, The Brutalist director Brady Corbet and Emilia Pérez's Jacques Audiard. \n\nThis year's original song category features two cutes from Emilia Pérez, El Mal and Mi Camino, the new Elton John song Never Too Late, from the documentary of the same name about him, Like a Bird from Sing Sing, and the latest Diane Warren effort The Journey.\n\nThe Academy Awards begin at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT and can be watched on ABC and, for the first time, on a streaming service, Hulu.\n\nSubscribers to premium services including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, AT&T TV and FuboTV can also also catch the ceremony live. \n\nOscar nominations 2025 -
