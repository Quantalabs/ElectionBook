In Part I, we explored the immediate compliance realities for existing operators — the nuts and bolts of how rescheduling could alter day-to-day operations. We set the stage by acknowledging that while rescheduling offers long-awaited recognition, it also brings heightened scrutiny and regulatory complexity.\n\nNow, in Part II, we turn our focus outward. We look beyond the initial compliance questions and consider the broader opportunities and limitations rescheduling creates. From the myth of Big Pharma dominance to the persistence of state-based markets, from the potential for DEA registration to the opening of global trade lanes, this piece examines how rescheduling could shape the cannabis industry’s future in the U.S. and abroad. If Part I was about the ground beneath our feet, Part II is about the horizon ahead — the chance to see through new eyes what this shift truly means as we wake up to find out that we are the eyes of the world.\n\nA photograph shows the Swiss pharma giant Roche headquarters in Basel on September 28, 2021. - Founded by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche in 1896, Roche employs now more than 100,000 people and generates annual sales of almost 60 billion Swiss francs, becoming one of the world's largest pharmaceutical groups.

The narrative is seductive — massive pharmaceutical companies, armed with compliance departments and bottomless capital, swoop in to erase decades of grassroots entrepreneurship.\n\nBut that’s not how this song plays. Pharma doesn’t want to sell flower in a jar or gummies at a dispensary counter. Their comfort zone is in FDA-approved products which are designed for a specific condition, standardized dosages, and clinical distribution networks. Owning retail shops on Main Street is not their game, and never has been.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThey will enter — but at the level of pharmaceutical-grade extracts, patented formulations, and clinical applications. The highly curated flowers, the artisanal edibles, the live resin carts, the wellness tinctures? Those will remain the domain of the existing cannabis sector — provided it can adapt.\n\nSo don’t expect Roche to start buying up your neighborhood dispensaries. Expect them instead to craft the next Epidiolex, the next standardized cannabinoid therapy. Pharma wants science, patents, and insurance coverage — not the headache of managing state-level retail operations.\n\nEven with rescheduling and the pharmaceutical industry entering the space, it would be nearly impossible for pharma to simply shut down state-licensed dispensaries. These retail systems are deeply entrenched, with billions in tax revenue, thousands of jobs, and strong political support at the state level. Legislators and governors have little incentive to dismantle programs that fund schools, public health, and infrastructure, especially when public opinion overwhelmingly favors access. Pharma may dominate the FDA-regulated lane, but dispensaries will continue to thrive in their own parallel lane, protected not only by economics and politics but also by the consumer demand that built them in the first place. This is especially true given that it is unlikely that States will shut down their existing systems.\n\nThis map shows the countries where recreational cannabis use is allowed as of April 2024, based on data from Wikipedia.

Governors and legislatures have tied their economic fortunes to cannabis revenue. Entire state budgets are buoyed by excise taxes. Local economies are sustained by cultivation jobs and retail employment. Politically, dismantling those systems would be suicidal.\n\nSo let’s be clear: even if DEA reschedules, states will not shut down their dispensaries; not anytime soon. They will not turn off the tax faucet. They will double down on their autonomy — just as they have done with alcohol, gaming, and other regulated industries. State sovereignty is a stubborn fact, and cannabis has been woven into that fabric.\n\nThis means we could see a bifurcated reality: DEA-registered facilities producing Schedule III cannabis for clinical and international trade, alongside state-based systems humming along under their own rules, technically still outside federal law. A dance between parallel universes, sharing the same stage.\n\nA logo reading DEA Special Agent is pictured in the Office of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on May 29, 2019 in New York City.

But not every operator will be able to — or even want to.\n\nThe easiest candidates for registration: cultivators and manufacturers. Why? Because they are already closer to the kind of GMP, security, and record keeping standards the DEA requires. Cultivation sites can be fortified and audited. Manufacturing facilities can adopt pharmaceutical-grade SOPs.\n\nThe hardest fit: dispensaries. The DEA has never licensed retail distribution of controlled substances outside the pharmacy framework. Translating dispensaries into that model would require a regulatory imagination the agency has never demonstrated. More likely, dispensaries will remain outside the DEA orbit, protected by state law but excluded from Schedule III legitimacy.\n\nFor operators looking to prepare for the potential realities of federal rescheduling, a proactive strategy is essential. That begins with investing in facility security and inventory controls that mirror pharmaceutical operations, ensuring that every gram is tracked and safeguarded. Equally important is implementing GMP-compliant manufacturing processes, which will likely serve as the baseline standard under DEA oversight. Operators should also build robust chain-of-custody documentation systems to satisfy regulators and instill confidence with partners. Finally, now is the time to begin cultivating relationships with research institutions and clinical trial networks, laying the groundwork for participation in the next phase of cannabis as a recognized medical product.\n\nThe operators who prepare now will be first in line if the DEA opens the door. Those who assume business as usual may find themselves sidelined. I strongly encourage that each licensee take steps toward Schedule III preparedness NOW. I have been preparing legal and consulting clients for the possibility of rescheduling since 2010; the tools and pathway exist. The rules already exist if this is the scheduling change that comes. There is no reason to wait under the premise that there will be a wholly new package of rules. No matter what happens the standards and rules already exist, and businesses must adapt.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 15: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building stands on April 15, 2019 in Washington, DC.

For decades, this provision of the Internal Revenue Code has hung like an albatross around the industry’s neck, forcing companies to pay effective tax rates of 60 to 70 percent. By treating cannabis operators like traffickers of illicit drugs, 280E denied them the most basic deductions for payroll, rent, marketing, and other ordinary business expenses. In a sector already operating on razor-thin margins, the policy effectively punished compliance and rewarded only those willing to cut corners.\n\nThe end of 280E under Schedule III status would be transformative. Suddenly, cannabis businesses could reinvest in staff, expand facilities, upgrade compliance systems, and engage in brand-building efforts once considered luxuries. Tax equity levels the playing field and signals to investors that cannabis companies are no longer radioactive in the eyes of the IRS. For many, this shift alone could be the difference between insolvency and sustainable growth.\n\nYet the relief comes tethered to a heavy leash. Under Schedule III, cannabis distribution must occur only between DEA registrants or their international equivalents. This means that sales cannot simply flow to any operator holding a state-issued license, as is the norm today. Instead, only those who successfully register with the DEA — and comply with its rigorous pharmaceutical-style oversight — will be legitimate trading partners. For existing operators, this could shrink their addressable market overnight, locking out many long-standing customers who are either unwilling or unable to make the leap into the DEA system. No one knows how this will shake out in a conflicting system where states and the federal government have divergent licensing systems, but it will be a major issue going forward – Who can I sell to?\n\nAnd while the 280 tax relief will likely apply to all cannabis sellers (regardless of DEA registration status), it presents an interesting paradox — newfound financial freedom but fewer eligible customers — and this defines the rescheduling era’s most immediate tension. Businesses may finally enjoy tax relief, yet find themselves in a vastly different, more competitive, more restricted commercial ecosystem. For operators accustomed to the broad reach of state-based markets, this adjustment will feel less like liberation and more like recalibration.\n\nMoreover, these restrictions will test the industry’s adaptability. Those who choose to pivot; securing DEA registration and aligning their operations with pharmaceutical standards, will gain access to a narrower, but more stable and globally integrated supply chain. Those who resist or delay may continue to operate under state systems, but without the federal protections and tax benefits now available. In this bifurcated landscape, agility, foresight, and compliance readiness will separate the survivors from the casualties.\n\nUltimately, rescheduling creates a classic push-pull dynamic. The financial shackles of 280E fall away, unlocking the potential for growth and investment. At the same time, the Schedule III market contracts into a DEA-defined ecosystem that many are unprepared to enter. The industry’s next chapter will be written in how operators navigate this contradiction — balancing relief with restriction, freedom with limitation, opportunity with reality.\n\nPrice Dynamics: Risk and Reward\n\nCannabis pricing has always been a story of risk. When risk is high, prices soar. When risk falls, so do margins. Rescheduling will reduce certain risks — tax exposure, banking exclusion, investment hesitation. As a result, prices will likely fall, particularly in wholesale markets.\n\nBut reduced risk also opens access to scale, efficiency, and institutional capital. Margins may shrink, but the pie itself gets larger. For operators who can achieve economies of scale and compliance excellence, profitability remains possible, even in a lower-price environment.\n\nThink of it as the difference between a garage band and an arena tour. The intimacy may fade, but the audience is bigger, and the business is sustainable. I will elaborate on this concept in Part III.\n\nCHICAGO, IL - AUGUST 24: A trader monitors offers in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index options pit at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on August 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois.

Banks that once feared Schedule I entanglement will find more comfort under Schedule III. Institutional investors, long hesitant, will see reduced legal risk. Capital markets could reopen to cannabis operators, enabling: Lines of credit and traditional loans; access to major exchanges for public listings’; and, M&A activity driven by consolidation and scale.\n\nBut investors will not blindly throw money again, or will they? It is more likely this time around that they will demand compliance, transparency, and credible growth strategies. The era of hype-driven valuations seems to be over. In its place: disciplined capital, cautious optimism, and a bias toward operators who can navigate both state systems and federal requirements.\n\nIAEA flag flatters in the wind in front of the International Atomic Energy Agency headquarers in UN city in Vienna, 15 November 2004.

The United States supported that change. Rescheduling at home now aligns U.S. law with that global posture. It signals consistency, credibility, and willingness to participate in international norms.\n\nThis alignment matters. International trade in controlled substances requires compliance with UN treaties. A Schedule III designation brings the U.S. into harmony with the system that governs morphine, codeine, and other widely traded medical substances. For global cannabis, this is a milestone.\n\nA Global Opportunity\n\nIf there is one arena where rescheduling unlocks profound opportunity, it is the global cannabis trade. For years, the United States — the birthplace of the modern cannabis reform movement — has been forced to sit on the sidelines, a reluctant observer while other nations build export empires. Canada, with its federally legal framework, has turned itself into the OPEC of medical cannabis, shipping product to Israel, Australia, and Europe. Colombia has leveraged climate and low-cost cultivation to position itself as a global supplier. Germany, by embracing pharmaceutical-grade imports, has become the EU’s cannabis distribution hub. Meanwhile, aside from hemp operators, U.S. cannabis operators have been locked out, shackled by Schedule I. It’s like watching your bandmates tour the world while you’re still grounded at home.\n\nRescheduling to Schedule III changes that dynamic in a heartbeat. A U.S. cultivator or manufacturer, armed with DEA registration, could finally ship cannabis across borders — provided the exports align with international treaty obligations. This is not abstract; it’s the opening riff of a song the rest of the world has been jamming on for years. The U.S. suddenly has the chance to plug into the global cannabis supply chain, to trade not just domestically but with partners in Germany, Israel, Australia, and beyond. Imagine American-grown cannabis sitting on pharmacy shelves in Frankfurt or Tel Aviv, labeled with DEA compliance, recognized as medicine. For the first time, the phrase “Made in the USA” could apply to legal cannabis on a global stage.\n\nAnd the world is legalizing — fast. Thailand has moved from prohibition to medical access. Portugal, once the face of decriminalization, is edging into regulated frameworks. South Africa and Lesotho are pairing traditional cultivation with modern compliance to create export channels. Argentina, Brazil, and others in Latin America are scaling medical programs with an eye on exports. Each country’s model reflects local politics and priorities, but the trend line is unmistakable: medical cannabis is going mainstream worldwide. The U.S., by stepping into Schedule III, gains a ticket to join the caravan.\n\nBut here’s the rub: the global trade isn’t forgiving. This isn’t the easygoing vibe of a Saturday afternoon dispensary. It’s medical, pharmaceutical-grade, highly scrutinized, and unforgiving of missteps. U.S. operators who want in will need GMP+ certification, chain-of-custody systems, and ironclad compliance — not the patchwork improvisation that has defined much of the American state market. Think Zeppelin rather than the Dead: precision, power, and structure, not free-form jamming. The opportunity is massive, but the discipline required will weed out the unserious players.\n\nFor those ready to adapt, the horizon is wide open. International exports could be the great equalizer — shifting U.S. cannabis from a fragmented, state-bound market into a global industry where scale, quality, and compliance drive success. The risk is real, the costs are high, and the learning curve is steep. But the reward is historic: finally seeing American cannabis not as a parochial state experiment but as a global commodity, traded alongside wine, coffee, and pharmaceuticals. Once in a while you get shown the light — and for U.S. cannabis operators, rescheduling might just be the moment when the light reveals the world.\n\nLessons from Abroad\n\nI recently wrote a piece outlining what the U.S. can learn from global cannabis operators -\nForbesCase Studies In International Cannabis: What The World Can Teach UsBy Robert Hoban\nLook to Canada: federal legalization created a short-term boom, followed by oversupply and market correction. Look to Germany: medical access has been cautious but steady, with reimbursement driving real demand. Look to Colombia and Morocco: cultivation-for-export models showcase the agricultural potential of cannabis.\n\nThe U.S. can learn from each of these stories. Rescheduling gives it the chance to enter the global stage not as a pioneer, but as a strategic participant, leveraging scale, innovation, and brand power.\n\nFour Policy Lanes: A Quick Reminder\n\nThe cannabis policy conversation has always run down distinct parallel Policy Lanes. These are distinct regulatory pathways that already exist and can be applied to cannabis without inventing an entirely new legal framework. Crafting comprehensive new cannabis legislation is politically difficult and time-consuming. Instead, rescheduling will push policymakers and operators to rely on these lanes, each with its own rules, regulators, and market dynamics.\n\nThese Five Policy Lanes are: (1) over-the-counter/adult-use cannabis; (2) general-use medical and pharmaceutical cannabis; (3) wellness and food products/nutraceuticals; (4) industrial hemp applications; and (5) the illicit market. Each lane has its own infrastructure, precedents, and oversight mechanisms — from FDA drug approval to USDA hemp standards — that already shape how cannabis is produced, processed, and consumed.\n\nRescheduling, in practice, lands squarely in Lane Two by validating pharmaceutical cannabis. It unlocks FDA pathways, clinical trials, and insurance coverage for cannabinoid-based medicines. But the other lanes don’t disappear. Hemp remains a federally legal crop. Adult-use cannabis still lives under state law. Nutraceuticals and wellness products continue to navigate FDA and USDA oversight. And the illicit market persists as both a competitor and a pressure valve until legal access expands broadly enough to undercut it.\n\nThe takeaway is that rescheduling reframes, rather than replaces, these existing lanes. They will intersect, overlap, and compete in new ways, and the success of the cannabis industry will depend on how well operators, regulators, and investors understand the unique opportunities and risks within each. The Five Policy Lanes are not just a framework for today — they are the map for navigating the post-rescheduling landscape.\n\nThe lanes continue to coexist — sometimes in harmony, often in tension. Rescheduling doesn’t consolidate them. It reframes their intersections.\n\nVintage illustration of a 1950s businessman with a crystal ball, telling the fortune of his company's profits, 1953. (Illustration by GraphicaArtis/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe Next Five to Ten Years\n\nHere’s what to watch as cannabis moves into a rescheduled reality. First, the pharmaceutical footprint will expand rapidly. Cannabinoid-based therapeutics, from isolated compounds to complex formulations, are poised to flood the research and development pipeline. Drug companies — both established giants and nimble biotech startups — see an open lane to pursue FDA approval for cannabis-derived medicines. The shift promises new treatments and broader patient access, but it also raises questions about whether traditional cannabis operators can compete in an arena dominated by big pharma’s scale, precision, and lobbying power.\n\nAt the same time, the uneasy coexistence of two systems will define the next decade. On one hand, the DEA-registered ecosystem will operate under federal oversight, with all the rigor of pharmaceutical supply chains. On the other hand, state-licensed markets — the familiar dispensaries and cultivators — will continue to function under local rules. This duality creates friction. Transactions permissible in one system may be prohibited in the other, leaving operators to navigate a patchwork of compliance that could rival, or even surpass, the complexity of today’s state-by-state system.\n\nThe global trade dynamic adds another layer of pressure. U.S. operators, newly empowered to participate in exports, will push to access foreign markets. Meanwhile, international buyers — from German distributors to Israeli clinics — will demand entry into the American system. The resulting push and pull will test the limits of U.S. regulators, who must balance treaty obligations, domestic interests, and the realities of a rapidly globalizing cannabis economy.\n\nAll of this will reshape the investment landscape. The “green rush” era of easy money and loose discipline is gone. Investors now demand professionalism, compliance, and predictable performance. While capital will flow into the sector, it will do so with sharper pencils, tighter diligence, and little patience for operators who can’t meet pharmaceutical or export-grade standards.\n\nFinally, pricing will evolve as cannabis edges closer to behaving like an agricultural commodity. Once risk premiums decline and production scales under GMP conditions, prices will settle into more stable ranges — not the wild swings of today’s fragmented markets. For consumers and patients, this may mean more affordable and consistent access. For operators, it signals a new competitive environment where efficiency, quality, and compliance determine survival.\n\nThe wheel is turning, and the rhythm is accelerating.\n\nClosing Reflections\n\nI have traveled the globe for almost twenty years assisting in the development of cannabis policies (for over thirty-five countries) and in the ongoing construction of the global cannabis supply chain. Travel changes perspective. It humbles, educates, and exposes contradictions. Cannabis reform is no different. Walk through a dispensary in Denver, a pharmacy in Berlin, a co-op farm in Colombia, or a clinic in Tel Aviv. Each tells a story of cannabis as medicine, as commerce, as culture.\n\nRescheduling could be that strange light: a flash of validation after decades of shadow. But it is not the end of the journey. It is a beginning. The challenge for operators, policymakers, and consumers is to see clearly — to recognize both the opportunities and the constraints, and to navigate them with honesty, discipline, and imagination.\n\nAnd perhaps, to borrow a Zeppelin whisper: “There are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there’s still time to change the road you’re on.”\n\nCannabis in America has reached that fork. The eyes of the world are watching.\n\nLooking Ahead to Part III\n\nThis is only the middle movement of the song. Part III of this series will step further into the unknown: examining the possible chaos that results from rescheduling and, more importantly, looking closely at what full de-scheduling could mean, how federal legalization might finally harmonize with state systems, and what a truly global cannabis economy could look like with the U.S. as a full participant. If Part I laid the groundwork and Part II opened the horizon, Part III will explore the next verse —whether the industry is ready to play in tune with history.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Part II of our cannabis rescheduling series explores Trump’s impact, Big Pharma myths, 280E tax relief, DEA registration, state markets, and global trade.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthoban/2025/09/21/part-ii-trump-and-cannabis-rescheduling---opportunities-and-limitations-under-rescheduling/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d09d3ad5f86ec253710218/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 01:17:58","author":"Contributor,Robert Hoban,Sean Gallup","authors":["Contributor","Robert Hoban","Sean Gallup"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":362385130,"title":"Morning Digest: GST rate cut to kick in today; Abhishek-Gill show guides India to dominant win against Pakistan, and more","text":"South Korea’s President Lee says U.S. investment demands would spark financial crisis\n\nSouth Korea’s economy could fall into crisis, rivalling its 1997 meltdown, if the government accepts current U.S. demands in stalled trade talks without safeguards, President Lee Jae Myung told Reuters.

And he is a martyr for the Christian faith.”\n\nKirk’s assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division.\n\nThe shooting has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.\n\nCharlie Kirk’s wife forgives suspect\n\nThose close to Kirk prayed and the floors at the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals shook from the bass of Christian rock bands, as the memorial started with the feel of a megachurch service before veering into something more akin to a political rally.\n\nPeople began lining up before dawn to secure a spot inside State Farm Stadium west of Phoenix, where Kirk’s Turning Point organization is based. Security was tight and speakers delivered their tributes from behind bullet-proof glass.\n\nThe 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organizers suggested.\n\nThe mood in the stadium ebbed and flowed throughout a service that stretched more than five hours. Mourners were patient and cordial, even after waiting hours to enter and then an hour or more for food in stadium concession lines.\n\nKirk’s widow, Erika, in her own address said in the midst of her grief she was finding comfort that her husband left this world without regrets. She said she forgives the man who is charged with killing him.\n\n“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” said Erika Kirk, who is taking over as Turning Point’s leader. She added, “I forgive him.”\n\nTrump, who closed out the service, remarked that Charlie Kirk “did not hate his opponents” and “wanted the best for them,” an attribute he found hard to understand.\n\n“That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,” Trump said. “I’m sorry, I am sorry Erika.”\n\nComments about Kirk have become a Trump administration target\n\nTrump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others who he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk’s death.\n\nDozens of people, from journalists to teachers to late show host Jimmy Kimmel, have faced suspensions or lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment.\n\nSome speakers at the memorial said Kirk was battling evil and referred to a vague “they” as the enemy. Others were blunt.\n\n“You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic,” said White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nKirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy of someone they see as an inspirational conservative leader.\n\nA 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk’s hatred.\n\nKirk’s legacy of conservative political influence\n\nTurning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.\n\nThe crowd was a testament to the influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.\n\nAnd the service brought together a veritable who’s who of the Republican Party, with numerous current and former lawmakers in the crowd. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and former top adviser to Trump, was spotted sitting with Trump for part of the service.\n\nKirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was shot.\n\nSpeaker after speaker, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, expressed awe at Kirk’s ability to go into what many conservatives saw as the lion’s den to make the conservative case: college campuses.\n\n“Why don’t you start somewhere easier,” Rubio recalled thinking when he first heard about Kirk years ago. “Like, for example, communist Cuba?”\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.

We have already seen capital rotate back into property investments.”\nJLL’s proprietary global bid intensity index, which gauges direct investment market competitiveness, recorded an uptick in the third quarter of the year. It was the first time the index had improved since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, indicating that bidding intensity was getting competitive again after a period of challenges due to macroeconomic uncertainty in the second quarter, which was triggered by Trump’s tariffs on America’s trading partners.\n\nThe index showed that investors were focusing on segments such as residential or multi-housing, industrial and logistics, retail and prime offices in gateway cities, which JLL did not identify.\nThe Fed cut its target rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4 to 4.25 per cent during the sixth meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee last week. The Fed’s easing was widely expected and is seen as the start of a rate-cut cycle that is likely to extend into next year.\n“Further interest-rate cuts should support investment activity in commercial property markets, by reducing the cost of financing new acquisitions and the hurdle rate for many institutions, which benchmark investments against the prevailing ‘risk-free’ rate of return such as government bond yields,” said Oliver Salmon, director for capital markets at Savills world research.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority followed the Fed, cutting the city’s base rate by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent – the lowest since December 2022.\nDespite this, the commercial property markets in Hong Kong and the mainland could see little gain.\nIn Asia-Pacific, commercial real estate volumes declined by about a fifth from a year ago to US$31.8 billion in the second quarter, according to MSCI. Hong Kong and mainland China were the weakest among the top 10 markets tracked by the US-based market data researcher.\nIn Hong Kong, volume fell 45 per cent to US$900 million in the April to June quarter, the lowest since the 2008 global financial crisis. Meanwhile, property investment on the mainland declined 46 per cent to US$4.5 billion in the same period, the MSCI data showed.\n“Lower financing costs and capitalisation rates should mildly boost commercial property transactions in Hong Kong in the coming months, but the oversupply of offices is likely to pressure asset prices,” said Jeff Zhang, an equity analyst at Morningstar. “Some investors may take the opportunity to deploy more capital to Hong Kong, but China’s interest rate policies are relatively independent, with capital flow controls remaining prohibitive.”\nThe lower interest rates “clearly alleviate” some of the concerns facing Hong Kong and mainland China’s property sectors, but they may not be a panacea for the wider structural issues in the market, and so institutional investors will remain cautious, said Savills’ Salmon.\nOn the other hand, with capital values and pricing of assets in the two markets having already adjusted to weak demand and excess supply, the latest rate cut could trigger investors to make acquisitions now.\n“That is the question they are pondering,” JLL’s Ambler said. “They are analysing comparisons of current day rents versus pre and post-global financial crisis, which suggests they are sharpening their pens.”","summary":"The resumption of a policy easing cycle following the US Federal Reserve’s quarter-point interest-rate reduction is likely to spur more investments into property globally, according to analysts.\nFor mainland China and Hong Kong, however, the impact could be less significant owing to fundamental and geopolitical strains, they added.\n“Rarely do central banks do ‘one and done’,” said Pamela Ambler, head of capital markets research for Asia-Pacific at JLL. “This [Fed] cut is likely to kick off a...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3326288/feds-rate-cut-fuel-property-investment-globally-hong-kong-faces-hurdles","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/21/0abcecc5-5881-4652-b930-552e0aa8105e_a9d12eea.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 00:30:12","author":"Cheryl Arcibal","authors":["Cheryl Arcibal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.457},{"id":362381592,"title":"Tech talent ‘wapsi’ may boost India’s AI, SaaS, deep-tech","text":"The US government’s move to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas could accelerate a reverse brain drain into India, potentially increasing the availability of skilled talent locally, particularly in the software-as-a-service, deeptech and artificial intelligence fields, startup founders and investors said.They expect a sharp rise in Indian talent, both fresh graduates and working professionals from the US, opting to build careers at home rather than seeking opportunities abroad.Manav Garg, founding partner at Together Fund, said this could be a key opportunity for India’s startup ecosystem to attract talent. While the fee hike will not impact existing H-1B holders or renewals, he pointed out that a large pipeline of students and early-career professionals in the US will start moving back to India in the medium term, as companies may be reluctant to sponsor fresh H-1B petitions at such high costs.“Right now, AI is the gold rush. Many of them may launch startups or join as early employees. That is a massive talent shift,” he said.India could replicate the US model of combining talent density with capital to build globally competitive companies, Garg said. “The US model has been to get the best talent and therefore they give a lot of capital, and the best companies come out of that. I think in the medium term, India can really turn the tide if we are able to attract the talent, provide capital to them and therefore create more companies which can be globally more competitive,” he said.Indian deeptech founders say early signs of this trend are already visible. Bhaktha Keshavachar, cofounder of Bengaluru-based Chara Technologies that builds motors without rare-earth metals, said the number of Indian engineers with American degrees applying for roles in India has risen steadily in the past two to three years.“The unintended side effects of all these actions (assuming they will be implemented fully) will be far-reaching for the ecosystem in India in my opinion. Especially in core engineering and deep tech areas,” Keshavachar said.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to hire foreign professionals in specialised fields such as technology and engineering. Indian IT professionals account for the majority of H-1B visa holders in the US. With the proposed fee making sponsorship costly, the demand in the US is likely to be limited to high-value, highly skilled talent.The shift in preferences is also evident among researchers. Laina Emmanuel, cofounder of neuroscience startup BrainSight AI, said her company has seen a steady increase in applications from post-doctoral researchers and PhD graduates in the US looking to work in India. “Now with this H-1B visa order, though this is still very early, I am hopeful that we will get more such applications from Indians looking to return. In the long term, this will be good for Indian AI and deeptech,” she said.Innovation shiftIndustry executives said the policy change could accelerate India’s shift from being an outsourcing hub that supplies talent for innovation in Silicon Valley to building more original products at home. They added that India will need to invest heavily in AI models to move beyond its services-led base, where most firms currently operate in the application layer of automation.“As a country, we need to start looking at going away from services to innovation. If not, we will be irrelevant. We need to invest in products. We are all playing in the application layers, and need to get into the deep tech, building AI models,” said Arvind Parthiban, cofounder and CEO of SuperOps.ai, a software provider for IT management services. “It is a wakeup call for us where we need to come and invest in deep tech, which can make a difference in a decade or two.”The US has clarified that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump on September 19 will be levied for new petitions and will not apply to current visa holders.","summary":"The US $100,000 H-1B visa fee could encourage Indian talent to return home, boosting India’s startup scene, especially in AI and deeptech.

Addressing mourners at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism,” before promising that details would be revealed at a press conference scheduled for Sept. 22. The president called the upcoming disclosure “one of the most important things we will do” and said it would be the “biggest announcement in the history of the country.” Trump revealed that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, would join him in the Oval Office for the announcement. “They will talk about how it happens so it won’t happen anymore,” Trump said. Tylenol Controversy Fuels Speculation The remarks come amid heightened debate over autism’s causes. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Kennedy was preparing to announce a possible link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the use of Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen or paracetamol, during pregnancy. While the drug has long been considered safe for expectant mothers, recent scrutiny has revived questions over environmental and pharmaceutical contributions to autism diagnoses. Some experimental trials have explored leucovorin, a form of folinic acid, as a therapy for children with autism, with researchers noting improved communication abilities in small studies. However, experts caution that the evidence remains preliminary. The National Institute of Mental Health defines ASD as a “neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave.” Trump acknowledged the controversial history surrounding the issue, stating he had been “bugging” officials in his administration to accelerate progress. “We won’t let it happen anymore, and we’ll find ways to get at least somewhat better when you have it,” he said. Concluding his remarks, Trump honoured Kirk, who was assassinated earlier this month, noting: “Charlie would have been front-row center at tomorrow’s announcement.

This is the first time the pair have been seen together publicly since May 30. Musk, a vocal supporter and major donor of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, led the Department of Government Efficiency where he reportedly cut jobs across departments to reduce federal waste. However, since June, the pair have been involved in a series of social media posts with targeted hostility on X and Truth Social following Musk's departure from Trump's administration. The two had a falling out over the landmark Trump legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, effectively ending their friendship. Musk also criticised the Trump administration's handling of the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's case. Kirk, a staunch Trump supporter, once said that he \"inspired millions\" and was a \"patriot who devoted his life to the cause of open debate.\" He was the founder of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organisation that advocates for conservative politics in educational institutions. He was tragically shot dead during a public debate with students at Utah Valley University on 10 September. The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, was captured after a highly publicised manhunt that spanned over 30 hours. The 22 year old Robinson reportedly stated that he had \"enough\" of the \"hatred\" Kirk was disseminating. Kirk's murder sparked widespread fury from both Republicans and Democrats. Since the killing, senior Trump officials have been threatening retaliation against anyone who \"celebrates\" Kirk's death. Numerous individuals have been sacked or faced penalties.

LIVE UPDATES: MEMORIAL SERVICES FOR CHARLIE KIRK Trump's speech, which also highlighted his administration's core priorities, followed those of Kirk's widow, Erika, and several high-ranking members of his administration. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard were among some of Trump's Cabinet that spoke at the memorial service. At the end of his speech, Trump shared the stage with Erika Kirk and hugged her as \"God Bless America\" played across the stadium, marking the conclusion of the memorial service. ERIKA KIRK FORGIVES HUSBAND'S KILLER AT MEMORIAL SERVICE: 'IT'S WHAT CHARLIE WOULD DO' Kirk was assassinated Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. The gathering was the first stop on TPUSA’s planned American Comeback Tour. The charismatic Kirk, known for his signature debates on college campuses, sat beneath a white tent emblazoned with the slogan \"Prove Me Wrong,\" taking open-mic questions from a crowd of thousands. Moments later, a single shot ended his life. In the wake of his death, many Americans are learning for the first time of the unlikely rise of the young activist who vaulted from obscurity in suburban Illinois to become a defining voice for a generation of conservatives and one of the movement’s most formidable power brokers. 'THIS IS THE TURNING POINT:' TPUSA SAYS CAMPUS CHAPTER REQUESTS SURGE AFTER KIRK'S ASSASSINATION At 18, Kirk dropped out of community college to co-found TPUSA. By his mid-20s, he became the youngest speaker at the Republican National Convention in 2016 and a household name in conservative circles. By 31, he commanded a $95 million political empire, galvanized millions of followers online and established a direct line to Trump. His widow, Erika, has vowed to carry on the energetic movement that indisputably reshaped conservative youth politics. TPUSA recently announced she would assume the roles of CEO and chair of the board. Andrew Kolvet, executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said TPUSA has received more than 62,000 requests to establish new campus chapters in the two weeks since Kirk's assassination — a surge that would add to its existing network of 900 nationwide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"For all the fans of ‘The Charlie Kirk Show,’ we will see you Monday,\" Kolvet said during his remarks at the memorial service. \"Until then, buckle up — here we go,\" he added, vowing to continue Kirk’s mission. Last week, Kolvet told Fox News Digital that he has \"personally received hundreds of offers to work\" for TPUSA.","summary":"Tens of thousands gathered at State Farm Stadium as Trump and his Cabinet members honored Charlie Kirk, describing his assassination as an attack on American democracy.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-honors-charlie-kirks-legacy-describes-him-martyr-american-freedom","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/trump-kirk-memorial_02.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379897541112","publish_date":"2025-09-22 00:22:14","author":"Amanda Macias","authors":["Amanda Macias"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.159},{"id":362382946,"title":"Trump ramps up retribution campaign with push for Bondi to pursue cases against his foes (World)","text":"Eight months into his second term, President Donald Trump's long-standing pledge to take on those he perceives as his political enemies has prompted debates over free speech, media censorship and political prosecutions.\n\nFrom late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel's suspension to Pentagon restrictions on reporters and an apparent public appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue legal cases against his adversaries, Trump has escalated moves to consolidate power in his second administration and root out those who have spoken out against him.\n\nIn a post on social media this weekend addressed to Bondi, Trump said “nothing is being done” on investigations into some of his foes.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” he said. Noting that he was impeached and criminally charged, “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”\n\nCriticizing investigations into Trump’s dealings under Democratic President Joe Biden’s Justice Department, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Sunday that “it is not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing.”\n\nDirective to Bondi to investigate political opponents\n\nTrump has ratcheted up his discussion of pursuing legal cases against some of his political opponents, part of a vow for retribution that has been a theme of his return to the White House. He publicly pressed Bondi this weekend to move forward with such investigations.\n\nTrump posted somewhat of an open letter on social media Saturday to his top prosecutor to advance such inquiries, including a mortgage fraud probe into New York Attorney General Letitia James and a possible threat case against former FBI Director James Comey.\n\nHe posted that he had “reviewed over 30 statements and posts” that he characterized as criticizing his administration for a lack of action on investigations.\n\n“We have to act fast — one way or the other,” Trump told reporters later that night at the White House. “They’re guilty, they’re not guilty — we have to act fast. If they’re not guilty, that’s fine. If they are guilty or if they should be charged, they should be charged. And we have to do it now.”\n\nTrump later wrote in a follow-up post that Bondi was “doing a GREAT job.”\n\nPaul, a frequent Trump foil from the right, was asked during an interview on NBC's “Meet the Press” about the propriety of a president directing his attorney general to investigate political opponents. The senator decried “lawfare in all forms.\"\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said it was “unconstitutional and deeply immoral for the president to jail or to silence his political enemies.” He warned it could set a worrisome precedent for both parties.\n\n“It will come back and boomerang on conservatives and Republicans at some point if this becomes the norm,” Murphy told ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nThe Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said on CNN's “State of the Union” that Trump is turning the Justice Department \"into an instrument that goes after his enemies, whether they’re guilty or not, and most of them are not guilty at all, and that helps his friends. This is the path to a dictatorship. That’s what dictatorships do.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a message seeking comment.\n\nAppointment of new prosecutor in Letitia James investigation\n\nEach new president nominates his own U.S. attorneys in jurisdictions across the country. And Trump has already worked to install people close to him in some of those jobs, including former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro in the District of Columbia and Alina Habba, his former attorney, in New Jersey.\n\nTrump has largely stocked his second administration with loyalists, continuing Saturday with the nomination of a White House aide as top federal prosecutor for the office investigating James, a longtime foe of Trump.\n\nTrump announced Lindsey Halligan to be the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia on Saturday, just a day after Erik Siebert resigned from the post and Trump said he wanted him “out.”\n\nTrump said he was bothered that Siebert had been supported by the state’s two Democratic senators.\n\n“There are just two standards of justice now in this country. If you are a friend of the president, a loyalist of the president, you can get away with nearly anything, including beating the hell out of police officers,” Murphy said, mentioning the defendants in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol pardoned by Trump as he returned to office. “But if you are an opponent of the president, you may find yourself in jail.”\n\nNew restrictions on Pentagon reporters\n\nTrump has styled himself as an opponent of censorship, pledging in his January inaugural address to “bring free speech back to America” and signing an executive order that no federal officer, employee or agent may unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.\n\nUnder a 17-page memo distributed Friday, the Pentagon stepped up restrictions on the media, saying it will require credentialed journalists to sign a pledge to refrain from reporting information that has not been authorized for release, including unclassified information. Journalists who don’t abide by the policy risk losing credentials that provide access to the Pentagon.\n\nAsked Sunday if the Pentagon should play a role in determining what journalists can report, Trump said, “No, I don’t think so.\"\n\n\"Nothing stops reporters. You know that,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House for Charlie Kirk’s memorial service.\n\nTrump has sued numerous media organizations for negative coverage, with several settling with the president for millions of dollars. A federal judge in Florida tossed out Trump’s $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times on Friday.\n\nJimmy Kimmel ouster and FCC warning\n\nPerhaps the most headline-grabbing situation involves ABC's indefinite suspension Wednesday of veteran comic Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show. What he said about Kirk’s killing had led a group of ABC-affiliated stations to say it would not air the show and provoked some ominous comments from a top federal regulator.\n\nTrump celebrated on his social media site: “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”\n\nEarlier in the day, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, who has launched investigations of outlets that have angered Trump, said Kimmel’s comments were “truly sick” and that his agency has a strong case for holding Kimmel, ABC and network parent Walt Disney Co. accountable for spreading misinformation.\n\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said. \"These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., argued that Kimmel's ouster wasn't a chilling of free speech but a corporate decision.\n\n“I really don’t believe ABC would have decided to fire Jimmy Kimmel over a threat,” he said Sunday on CNN. “ABC has been a longstanding critic of President Trump. They did it because they felt like it didn’t meet their brand anymore.”\n\nNot all Republicans have applauded the move. On his podcast Friday, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas called it “unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying we’re going to decide what speech we like and what we don’t, and we’re going to threaten to take you off air if we don’t like what you’re saying.”\n\nTrump called Carr “a great American patriot” and said Friday that he disagreed with Cruz.","summary":"Eight months into his second term, President Donald Trump's long-standing pledge to take on those he perceives as his political enemies has prompted debates over free speech, media censorship and political prosecutions.

'Nooo' the activists shouted, and Sir Big Ed beamed","text":"Autograph hunters lined the hotel foyer near the Lib Dems’ party conference. All for Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, or his sidekick Daisy Cooper?\n\nThen the penny dropped: The fans were there for Newcastle United’s footballers, staying in the hotel before taking on AFC Bournemouth.\n\nI found myself sharing a lift with four of the players. They were tall, polite and smelled so strongly of soap that it set off my dicky chest.\n\nLast week it was Donald Trump, now Davey. Which is the worse egomaniac?\n\nSir Big Ed arrived in Bournemouth at the front of a marching band, pretending to be a drummer and generally acting the goat. Soon he was dressing up in a bee-keeper’s outfit, to reflect the conference ‘buzz’.\n\nReporters were invited to watch Lib Dem MPs playing crazy golf and taking a dip in the sea.\n\nThe BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg informed Sir Ed that two-thirds of voters thought he was, basically, a pillock. But when he was asked on stage in the afternoon if it was ‘time to retire the stunts’, activists shouted ‘Nooo’ and Sir Ed beamed and patted his pot belly and went into an aw-shucks routine about how it was important to spread ‘a little bit of joy’.\n\nHe coyly suggested, then denied, that he had been asked to do TV’s Strictly. He disclosed that he was being sized up for another bungee jump and he raved about his TikTok videos. ‘I dunno how many of you have seen them...’ Few had. Soon he was talking about the children’s cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nAll this on a day that Alex Cole-Hamilton, the party’s leader in Scotland, claimed ‘the Lib Dems will always act like grown-ups’. The day began at 9am when a few oddballs began discussing their favourite topic: internal party committees.\n\nThey chewed on constitutional amendments and summations and ratification procedures. A world-weary fellow in a Trotsky beard marched to the lectern and spent his time talking to the ceiling. He seemed to find his Lib Dem colleagues thoroughly exasperating.\n\nAnother chap with a reedy voice said ‘we don’t do, well actually we DO do, dysfunctional internal divisions’. A wheelchair user rode on stage, being pulled by her guide dog. Shades of David Cameron and his huskies. Yet another delegate was so determined to finish her speech about Gaza that, when told her time was up, she continued to orate even while walking off stage and back to her seat.\n\nDeputy leader Cooper was the morning’s star turn. Teeth, gym shoes, a pitying, primary-school teacher voice. She wagged a finger and used expressions such as ‘really, really scary’. Fearing that climate change could render some species extinct, she did a sad face, mouth turning downwards.\n\nMs Cooper is the Lib Dems’ economic supremo and she called for a £7billion windfall tax on big banks.\n\nShe was all in favour of Net Zero. Thought it would make us rich.\n\nConservative MPs were denounced, repeatedly, as Right-wing nutters. Are they? Isn’t Kemi Badenoch’s current problem that she is seen as too centrist?\n\nOne activist issued the blood-curdling cry ‘Let’s be more like Switzerland!’ An old trout from Somerset intoned gravely that ‘we’re working enthusiastically cross-border with Wiltshire’, as if describing co-operation between India and Pakistan.\n\nSir Ed, for his question and answer session after lunch, wore Converse shoes and a too-tight woollie. He entered and left to the music of I’m The King Of The Swingers from Disney’s Jungle Book.\n\nThe stage kept creaking as he walked its boards. Touching his chest and laughing at his wisecracks, he marvelled at his own humility.\n\nElon Musk (whose name came out as Elon Muff) and Nigel Farage were denounced as ‘dangerous’. But when someone had a go at Sir Ed for trying to silence trans campaigners, he piously said: ‘Name-calling is never a terribly good idea.’\n\nReform UK, meanwhile, was ‘a threat to democracy’. Translation: They seem far too popular electorally.\n\nIs that not the essence of... democracy?","summary":"Sir Big Ed arrived at his party conference with a marching band, writes QUENTIN LETTS, pretending to be a drummer.

And neither now will history.”\n\nSpeakers highlighted Kirk’s profound faith and his strong belief that young conservatives need to get married, build families and pass on their values to keep building their movement. They also repeatedly told conservative activists, sometimes in confrontational tones, that the best way to honor Kirk was doubling down on his mission to move American politics further to the right.\n\n“For Charlie, we will remember that it is better to stand on our feet defending the United States of America and defending the truth than it is to die on our knees,” Vance said. “My friends, for Charlie, we must remember that he is a hero to the United States of America. And he is a martyr for the Christian faith.”\n\nKirk’s assassination at a Sept 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has become a singular moment for the modern-day conservative movement. It also has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division.\n\nThe shooting has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.\n\nHigh security and a full stadium\n\nThose close to Kirk prayed and the floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands as the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals took on the feel of a megachurch service.\n\n“Charlie looked at politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” said the Rev Rob McCoy, Kirk’s pastor.\n\nPeople began lining up before dawn to secure a spot inside State Farm Stadium west of Phoenix, where Kirk’s Turning Point organization is based. Security was tight, similar to the Super Bowl or other high-profile event. The speakers delivered their tributes from behind bullet-proof glass.\n\nThe 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organizers suggested.\n\nKirk's widow, Erika, in her own address said in the midst of her grief she was finding comfort that her husband left this world without regrets. She also said she forgives the man who is charged with killing him.\n\n“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” said Erika Kirk, who is taking over as Turning Point's leader. She added, “I forgive him.”\n\nTrump, who closed out the service, remarked that Kirk “did not hate his opponents” and “wanted the best for them,\" an attribute he found hard to understand.\n\n\"That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them,\" Trump said. \"I’m sorry, I am sorry Erika.\"\n\nComments about Kirk have become a Trump administration target\n\nTrump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others who he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.\n\nDozens of people, from journalists to teachers to late show host Jimmy Kimmel, have faced suspensions or lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk’s death.\n\nSome speakers at the memorial said Kirk was battling evil and referred often to a vague “they” as the enemy. Others were blunt.\n\n“You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic,\" said White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.\n\nKirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy of someone they see as an inspirational conservative leader.\n\nA 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred.\n\nKirk's legacy of conservative political influence\n\nTurning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.\n\n“Charlie’s having some serious heavenly FOMO right now,\" Tyler Bower, Turning Point's chief operating officer, said, likening the moment to bringing “the Holy Spirit into a Trump rally.\"\n\nThe crowd was a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.\n\nKirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.\n\n“He slayed ignorance,” said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. “He cut through lies. He woke people’s minds, inspired people’s hearts and imparted wisdom every day.”\n\nSpeaker after speaker, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, expressed their awe at Kirk's ability to go into what many conservatives saw as the lion's den to make the conservative case: college campuses.\n\n“Why don’t you start somewhere easier,” Rubio joked when he first heard about Kirk years ago. “Like, for example, communist Cuba?\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Tiffany Stanley in Washington, Silvia Stellacci in Rome; Terry Tang, Meg Kinnard and Jesse Bedayn contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

For God and country. For reason and for common sense.\"The service drew an extraordinary level of attention and security, with the top brass of Trump's administration joining tens of thousands in attendance, and some US media likening it to a state funeral.Ahead of Trump's address, the crowd heard speeches from prominent cabinet members including Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\"You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk? You have made him immortal,\" top Trump advisor Stephen Miller said, vowing \"to save this civilization, to save the West.\"Among other speakers were right-wing media personality Tucker Carlson, Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.The event was being hosted by Turning Point USA, the hugely influential youth political campaign group founded by Kirk that is now run by his widow, Erika Kirk, who also spoke at the memorial.\"That young man, I forgive him,\" Kirk said of her husband's alleged murderer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, a gesture that drew uproarious applause from the crowd.State authorities have charged Robinson with murder and are pursuing the death penalty in the case against him.At the event, Trump was seen sitting beside billionaire backer Elon Musk, whose acrimonious departure from the White House after his brief tenure overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was not apparent as the two men chatted.Thousands of people had lined up hours before the event began, hoping to get into the 63,000-seat American football stadium hosting the service and honor the young Republican star -- a close ally of the president whose voter outreach is credited with helping Trump get reelected last year.\"I look at him as a Christ martyr, definitely,\" Monica Mirelez, a 44-year-old Texan who drove 12 hours to get there, said of Kirk.Jeremy Schlotman, a 21-year-old biology student, said Kirk gave him the courage to express his beliefs on campus.\"For example, I think that biological men shouldn't be in women's sports. But I was too afraid to talk about stuff like that out loud,\" Schlotman said as Christian bands played on stage and the stadium steadily filled up. 'Hatred' Kirk, 31, was shot in the neck on September 10 while speaking at a Utah university as part of his popular public debate series. Authorities arrested a suspect after a 33-hour manhunt.The killing has inflamed often acrimonious and sometimes violent political divisions in the United States.Authorities say the suspected gunman cited the \"hatred\" he believed was stoked by Kirk -- who was a vitriolic critic of transgender people, Muslims and others.Kirk used his millions of social media followers, the massive audience of his podcast and appearances at universities to bolster Trump with young voters and fight for a nationalist, Christian-centric political ideology.Even before the alleged killer was identified or arrested, Trump called Kirk \"a martyr for truth and freedom\" and blamed the rhetoric of the \"radical left.\" Crackdown on liberal 'terrorism' In response to the killing, the White House last week declared it would crack down on what it terms \"domestic terrorism\" by the political left. Trump said he would designate \"Antifa\" -- a shorthand term for \"anti-fascist\" used to describe diffuse far-left groups -- as \"a major terrorist organization,\" a move he threatened in his first term.On Sunday, Trump said his government would go after alleged \"networks\" responsible for left-wing violence. Prominent late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was yanked off the air Wednesday, hours after the government threatened to cancel broadcasting licenses because of comments he made about Kirk's killing.The moves have sparked alarm among Trump's critics who warn of possible steps to silence dissent of his divisive right-wing White House tenure, marked by a rolling back of social justice policies and an immigration crackdown that has seen widespread complaints of rights abuses.by Romain Fonsegrives, with Asad Hashim in Washington","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/09/22/trump-praises-conservative-giant-kirk-at-mega-memorial-event","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-09-22/ae6p5iis/00076BP8QX.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 00:01:49","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.088},{"id":362382724,"title":"North Korea’s Kim Jong-un open to US talks, has ‘fond memories’ of Trump","text":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was open to future talks with the United States if Washington drops its demand that the country give up its nuclear weapons, state media said on Monday.\nKim also said he had “fond memories” of US President Donald Trump, who he met three times for high-profile summits during Trump’s first term, before talks collapsed in Hanoi in 2019 over what concessions Pyongyang was prepared to make.\n“If the United States discards its delusional obsession with denuclearisation and, based on recognising reality, truly wishes for peaceful coexistence with us, then there is no reason we cannot meet it,” Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.\nThe demand that Kim give up his nuclear arsenal has long been a sticking point between the two countries, with Pyongyang under successive rafts of United Nations sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.\nKim said sanctions had only helped the North in “growing stronger, building endurance and resistance that cannot be crushed by any pressure”.\n“I still personally hold fond memories of the current US president, Trump,” Kim said in a wide-ranging speech to the country’s rubber-stamp parliament.\nSince the failed 2019 summit, North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear weapons and declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear state.\nKim reiterated that denuclearisation was not an option.\n“The world already knows well what the United States does after it forces a country to give up its nuclear arms and disarm,” he said.\n“We will never give up our nuclear weapons.”\n\nKim also said that he had “no reason to sit down with South Korea”, even as Seoul’s new President Lee Jae-myung has sought to ease tensions with the North.\n“We make it clear that we will not deal with them in any form,” he said.\nNorth Korea has in recent years declared the South its principal enemy and blown up rail links and roads that connect the two countries.\nAnalysts say that the North Korean leader has been emboldened by the war in Ukraine, securing critical support from Russia after sending thousands of North Korean troops to fight alongside Moscow.\nNorth Korea has become one of Russia’s main allies since Moscow invaded Ukraine three-and-a-half years ago, sending thousands of soldiers and container loads of weapons to help the Kremlin push Ukrainian forces out of western Russia, following Kyiv’s shock incursion last year.\nMoscow and Pyongyang signed a mutual defence pact last year when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the reclusive state.\nSeoul has repeatedly warned that Russia is stepping up support for Pyongyang, including the potential transfer of sensitive Russian military technology.\nTrump is expected to visit South Korea next month, when the country hosts the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (Apec) in its southern city of Gyeongju.\nKim, who visited Russia’s Far East in 2023, rarely leaves North Korea.

Musk had served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency until late May, when he criticised the administration’s signature policy bill, calling it “fiscally irresponsible”.Following Musk’s departure, a series of social media posts from the Tesla CEO sharply criticising Trump prompted the former president to threaten the cancellation of federal contracts with Musk’s companies. The memorial appearance represents a notable thaw in their previously strained relationship, The Hill reported.Vice President JD Vance delivered moving remarks at the memorial service, calling on supporters to honour Charlie Kirk’s life by continuing his fight for faith, truth and country, saying to do so “for Charlie.”“I’ve seen … so many on social media talk about ‘for Charlie.’ We must do this for Charlie. For Charlie, we will speak the truth every single day. For Charlie, we will rebuild this United States of America to greatness. For Charlie, we will never shrink, we will never cower, and we will never falter, even when staring down the barrel of a gun,” Vance said. Vance described Kirk as both a patriot and a man of deep faith, saying, “You, my friends – for Charlie – we must remember that he is a hero to the United States of America, and he is a martyr for the Christian faith. May our heavenly Father give us the courage to live as Charlie lived.”Vance also called out people who celebrated Kirk’s death, “In the wake of his death, we have seen some of the very worst parts of humanity. We have watched people slander him. We have watched people justify his murder and celebrate his death,” The Vice President said. Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, in an emotional speech, forgave Tyler Robinson, who allegedly shot Kirk at Utah Valley University on September 10.“I forgive him, I forgive him because it is what Christ did, The answer to hate is not hate,” she said. Erika Kirk also quoted Jesus on the cross, saying “Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.”31-year-old right-wing commentator and founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, was fatally shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University on September 10, as reported by The New York Times.

Relax,”‘ he said in a voice mimicking the elder Trump.\n\nThe president took the impersonation well, smirking and shaking his head before embracing a wider grin.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White, who was also present in the presidential box, appeared anxious as the impersonation began but eventually couldn’t resist laughing at Don Jr.’s attempts.\n\nAfter roars of laughter from the crowd, Don Jr. went on to say that he was ‘devastated when Charlie died.’ \n\nThe friendship between 31-year-old conservative activist Kirk and Don Jr. went back years. \n\nIn the early days of the MAGA movement, they would campaign together on college campuses and face down hostile political audiences.\n\nAt 47, Don Jr. was 16 years older, but he saw in Kirk a young man of great conviction who would carry the MAGA torch in the future. \n\nDon Jr.’s grief was clear in a tribute he wrote to a man he regarded as a sibling on X. \n\n‘Love you, brother,’ wrote the president’s eldest son on X. ‘Expressing sentiments isn’t my forte, and I can’t quite find the words to describe the sense of loss I’m experiencing right now.’\n\n‘Charlie wasn’t just a friend – he was like a little brother to me – and to millions of people around the world – he was a true inspiration. He was one of the most courageous, principled men I’ve ever known.’\n\nSpeakers highlighted Kirk’s profound faith and his strong belief that young conservatives need to get married, build families and pass on their values to keep building their movement. \n\nThe speakers also repeatedly told conservative activists that the best way to honor Kirk was doubling down on his mission to move American politics further to the right. \n\n‘You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk? You have made him immortal,’ said deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. \n\n‘You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic.’ \n\nAnd Vice President JD Vance, who credits Kirk for his political rise through the ranks and the success of the Trump administration, told the gathered crowd that his friend was a ‘martyr.’\n\n‘We must remember that he is a hero to the United States of America. And he is a martyr for the Christian faith,’ he said. \n\n‘I have talked more about Jesus Christ the past two weeks than I have my entire time in public office. \n\n‘Our whole administration is here, but not just because we love Charlie as a friend, even though we did, but because we know we wouldn’t be here without him.

I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them, I’m sorry.”\n\nTrump’s speech was an awkward mix of eulogy and campaign speech, during which he frequently veered away from reading somber remarks about Kirk’s life and violent death to make offhand comments and jokes.\n\nHe mentioned his use of federal forces to police cities and took a moment to promote an announcement at the White House on Monday. “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that? Autism: tomorrow we are going to be talking in the Oval Office in the White House about autism,” the president said.\n\nTrump also claimed Kirk had urged him to dispatch federal troops to Chicago. “One of the last things he said to me was ‘Please sir, save Chicago’. And we’re going to do that, we’re going to save Chicago, from horrible crime.”\n\nAt the end of his remarks, after calling Erika Kirk back on stage, Trump acted more like he was at a rally than a memorial, mouthing the words to America the Beautiful in a comic manner and swaying side to side.\n\nEarlier, Vance eulogized Kirk in explicitly religious terms, calling him “a martyr for the Christian faith”, despite a lack of evidence that his religion played any role in the killing.\n\n“They tried to silence my friend Charlie Kirk, but today we speak with Charlie and for Charlie louder than ever,” the vice-president said. “The evil murderer who took Charlie from us expected us to have a funeral today – and instead, my friends, we have had a revival and celebration of Charlie Kirk and of his Lord Jesus Christ.”\n\nVance also argued that Kirk, known for engaging with students, combined the traditions of Socrates and Christianity. “He was Athens and Jerusalem; the city of reason and the city of God in one person”, Vance said.\n\nErika Kirk also stressed what she called the inspiration Kirk’s murder had given to his supporters to embrace Christianity. “After Charlie’s assassination, we didn’t see violence, we didn’t see rioting,” Kirk said, as applause swelled from the crowd, welcoming the implied contrast to the upheaval following the murders of George Floyd or Martin Luther King Jr. “We saw revival,” she said.\n\n“This past week, we saw people open a Bible for the first time in a decade,” Kirk said. “We saw people go to a church service for the first time in their entire lives.”\n\n“The answer to hate is not hate,” she added. “The answer we know from the Gospel is love, and always love, love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr also described Kirk as a martyr. “Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were murdered for what they believe,” he said.\n\nTrump Jr recounted traveling with Kirk on college campuses and receiving threats to their safety. “We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now, we won’t back down,” he said.\n\nStephen Miller, a top White House adviser, pledged to finish Kirk’s life’s work.\n\n“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk,” Miller said. “You have made him immortal. You have immortalized Charlie Kirk, and now millions will carry on his legacy.”\n\n“To our enemies. You have nothing to give. You have nothing to offer. You have nothing to share but bitterness. We have beauty. We have light. We have goodness. We have determination. We have vision. We have strength.”\n\nThe memorial service was being held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, a 63,000-seat home of the Arizona Cardinals football team and the venue where Taylor Swift launched her Eras tour.\n\nThe event mixed political rhetoric with Christian evangelism. Thousands of people wearing red, white and blue poured into the stadium and lines snaked several blocks before sunrise Sunday.\n\nJeffrey Barke, a physician with a large online following, went to the stadium with a group of friends from Orange county, California, on what he called a “pilgrimage of sorts” to honor Kirk’s life and legacy. He pledged to use own platform to aid in spreading “Charlie’s message”.\n\nChristina Sawick, wearing a “Trump was right about everything” hat, said she had been watching and listening to Kirk since 2016. On Sunday, she left her home in Mesa at 3am to attend his memorial service.\n\nShe said she appreciated Kirk’s willingness to debate anyone regardless of their politics or background. “He didn’t sugarcoat anything,” she said. “He just wanted to be heard and he wanted everybody to be heard.”\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio praised Kirk’s impact on young men. “He sought to engage those he disagreed with, because he understood that we were not created to isolate ourselves from one another, but to engage,” Rubio said.\n\nA massive security presence, led by the US Secret Service, was in place, with the event expected to receive security on par with the Super Bowl. A man armed with a gun and a knife, with inactive law enforcement credentials and amid claims he was providing private security, was detained on Saturday at the venue.\n\nA spokesperson for Kirk’s Turning Point USA organization said the man was doing “advance security for a known guest” but it was not properly coordinated with the Secret Service or Turning Point. The spokesperson also said it was not believed the man was “attempting anything nefarious”.\n\nAmericans are grappling with the killing and complicated legacy of the 31-year-old conservative “youth whisperer”, Trump ally and podcasting provocateur, who was shot and killed on 10 September in what prosecutors have labeled political violence – and which has deepened fears about the trajectory of a profoundly divided nation.\n\nKirk was struck by a single bullet as he spoke before a crowd of 3,000 mostly college students at Utah Valley University, the first stop on his national “American Comeback” campus tour. Utah prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, 22, with capital murder in Kirk’s killing and said they will seek the death penalty.\n\nIn the wake of Kirk’s death, Trump and his advisers have sought to cast blame on Democrats, even though elected leaders and party officials have uniformly condemned the killing. Officials have said they believe the suspect acted alone.\n\nProsecutors have said they suspect Robinson killed Kirk because he personally had become sick of what he perceived to be Kirk’s “hatred”. But, citing three sources familiar with the investigation into Kirk’s killing, NBC reported Saturday that federal authorities have not found any link between Robinson and leftwing groups, on which the Trump administration has threatened to crack down after the deadly shooting.\n\nFueled by an outpouring of grief and rage on the right, conservatives are demanding punishment for those who have mocked or disparaged Kirk – a campaign of retribution critics say mirrors the very cancel culture he railed against. Since his death, teachers, students, journalists and the late-night show host Jimmy Kimmel have been fired, suspended or disciplined over comments related to Kirk or his death, in a clampdown that free-speech advocates, democracy scholars and others say amounts to government censorship.","summary":"President delivers mix of eulogy and campaign speech while JD Vance calls Kirk ‘martyr for the Christian faith’\n\n\nErika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s widow, says she forgives man accused of murder\n\n\nVance puts Charlie Kirk’s Christian faith front and center – with an eye on 2028\n\nDonald Trump told a crowd of thousands that he “hates” his opponents at a public memorial to honor the rightwing youth organizer Charlie Kirk, even after Kirk’s widow said she forgives the man charged with fatally shooting her husband during an event at a Utah college.\n\nTens of thousands gathered at the event in Arizona on Sunday, with the president giving the last of more than two dozen speeches, after emotional remarks from Kirk’s widow, Erika, and eulogies from the vice-president, JD Vance, four cabinet members and other senior White House officials, a reflection of the murdered activist’s deep imprint on the president’s Make America Great Again (Maga) movement.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/thousands-gather-at-charlie-kirk-memorial-in-arizona-where-trump-to-pay-tribute-to-slain-organizer","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af202c51119ec208eb1057bf185f1287d30bbed/366_0_3655_2924/master/3655.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:49:07","author":"Lauren Gambino,Robert Mackey,Sam Levine","authors":["Lauren Gambino","Robert Mackey","Sam Levine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":362377896,"title":"Trump Shares Charlie Kirk’s Final Wish Before Tragic Event","text":"President Donald Trump unveiled Charlie Kirk’s last request before the conservative activist’s assassination earlier this month. \n\nIn a speech in Glendale, Arizona, commemorating his late friend, Trump shared that Kirk’s parting request was for the administration to ‘save Chicago.’ Kirk had grown up in the Chicago suburbs. \n\nRecently, Trump has committed to bypassing Illinois Governor JB Pritzker by deploying National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime with a major crackdown.\n\n‘We owe Charlie a profound and eternal debt of gratitude,’ Trump told memorial audience. \n\nThe president went on to praise Kirk for helping to promote ‘freedom and justice’ across the nation. \n\n‘Charles James Kirk was heinously murdered by a radicalized leftist for speaking the truth that was in his heart,’ Trump said. \n\n‘He was violently murdered for advocating freedom, justice, for God, and for common sense. He was assassinated for his courageous living.’\n\n‘He lived boldly and he argued brilliantly without apology. He did what was right for our nation.’\n\nAddressing Charlie’s family, Trump mentioned that no words can fill the void left by his death. However, the president emphasized that ‘America loved Charlie Kirk.’\n\nThe president credited Kirk for uniting the MAGA and MAHA movements by introducing Trump to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump then revealed Kirk introduced him to JD Vance early into Ohio Republican’s political career. \n\nKirk, who was tragically shot on September 10th in Utah Valley, is recognized for enhancing Trump’s appeal among young voters in the upcoming 2024 election. \n\nThe president described the moment he learned of Kirk’s death as a ‘surreal experience.’ \n\n‘The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at every one of us.\n\n‘Charlie is bigger than two weeks ago….think about it…he’s eternal. I just want to say we love him.’\n\n‘He’s looking down today and saying, “That’s a great crowd.”‘\n\nSince the official event entry time of 8:00 AM, a slew of Christian artists have performed a variety of worship songs.\n\nSounds of Christian worship music filled the State Farm Stadium air, with the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk set to begin shortly on September 10th. \n\nThe stadium is packed to the rafters, minus a few sections of seats right next to the stage.\n\nDespite the scorching hot temperatures outside of the venue, inside the stadium is air-conditioned and the roof of the stadium is closed.\n\nThe floor is filled with various conservative political media and VIPS, as well as Turning Point staff and alumni who are seated on white plastic folding chairs. Press is also seated on the floor, with the TV risers situated in the middle of the VIP section. Print press are behind the VIP section.\n\nBack in November, Trump won a staggering 43% of the vote among voters aged 18–29. Kirk, throughout the election, would go to college campuses to register college conservatives to vote.\n\nUpon entering the memorial, Trump was met with cheers from tens of thousands of supporter in the stadium. In a sign of unity for the fallen conservative activist, billionaire Elon Musk joined the president at his booth where the pair shook hands.\n\nFollowing Kirk’s death, Trump lowered the White House US flags to half-mast in honor of his friend. \n\nMoreover, the president claimed in multiple media interviews that he believed Kirk could have succeeded him as president.\n\nTrump’s speech ended with him inviting Kirk’s widow, Erika, to stand beside him on stage.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump unveiled Charlie Kirk&#8217;s last request before the conservative activist&#8217;s assassination&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Shares Charlie Kirk&#8217;s Final Wish Before Tragic Event first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-shares-charlie-kirks-final-wish-before-tragic-event/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump-reveals-Charlie-Kirks-last-request-before-his-assassination.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:44:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.053},{"id":362378622,"title":"Charlie Kirk’s friends praise conservative activist’s faith at memorial service","text":"US President Donald Trump and prominent members of his “Make America Great Again” movement have been paying tribute to assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe memorial service for Mr Kirk, whom Mr Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, drew tens of thousands of mourners, including vice president JD Vance, other senior administration officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.\n\n“He transformed the face of conservatism in our own time and in doing so he changed the course of American history,” said Mr Vance, who has credited Mr Kirk’s advocacy as critical to his own political successes.\n\nHe added: “Tonight we speak with Charlie and for Charlie louder than ever.”\n\n“For Charlie, we will remember that it is better to stand on our feet defending the United States of America and defending the truth than it is to die on our knees,” Mr Vance said.\n\n“My friends, for Charlie, we must remember that he is a hero to the United States of America. And he is a martyr for the Christian faith.”\n\nSpeakers highlighted Mr Kirk’s profound faith and his strong belief that young conservatives need to get married, build families and pass on their values to keep building their movement.\n\nThose close to Mr Kirk prayed and the floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands as the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals took on the feel of a megachurch service.\n\n“Charlie looked at politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” said the Rev Rob McCoy, Mr Kirk’s pastor.\n\nMr Kirk’s assassination on September 10 during an appearance at a Utah college campus has become a singular moment for the modern-day conservative movement. It also has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division.\n\nThe shooting has stirred fear among some Americans that Mr Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.\n\nPeople began lining up before dawn to secure a spot inside State Farm Stadium, west of Phoenix, where Mr Kirk’s Turning Point organisation is based. Security was tight, similar to the Super Bowl or other high-profile events.\n\nThe 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organisers suggested.\n\nMr Kirk’s widow, Erika, in her own address, said that in the midst of her grief she was finding comfort that her husband left this world without regrets. She also said she forgave the man who is charged with killing him.\n\n“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” said Mrs Kirk, who is taking over as Turning Point’s leader.\n\nShe added: “I forgive him.”\n\n“I think that this is going to change things, and I think he made such a difference,” said Crystal Herman, who travelled from Branson, Missouri. “He deserves us to be here.”\n\nPhotos of Mr Kirk at work or with his wife, Erika, were on easels throughout the concession areas of the main concourse level. Some people posed for photos next to them.\n\n“We’re going to celebrate the life of a great man today,” Mr Trump told reporters before heading to Arizona.\n\nMr Trump has blamed the “radical left” for Mr Kirk’s death and threatened to go after liberal organisations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Mr Kirk’s death.\n\nDozens of people, from journalists to teachers to late show host Jimmy Kimmel, have faced suspensions or lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Mr Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory.\n\nThe retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Mr Kirk’s death.\n\nSome speakers at the memorial framed Mr Kirk as a martyr in a battle against evil and referred often to a vague “they” as the enemy.

You have made him immortal,” said deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilisation, to save the West, to save this republic.”\n\nSpeaker after speaker, including defence secretary Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio, expressed their awe at Kirk’s ability to go into what many conservatives saw as the lion’s den to make the conservative case: college campuses.\n\n“Why don’t you start somewhere easier,” Mr Rubio joked when he first heard about Mr Kirk years ago. “Like, for example, communist Cuba?”\n\nA 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Mr Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges.

Expectedly, ahead of the resumption of his trial, Kanu has begun a new chapter of his theatrical displays. All the displays are allegedly aimed at one thing: discrediting the judiciary and, by extension, eroding public trust in that all-important arm of government. It is obvious that this didn’t escape the attention of Hon. Justice Haruna Tsammani. There is the loud silence of the IPOB to these calculated attempts to attack judges and prosecutors to achieve malevolent results. Comically, the failure of this IPOB’s strategy of intimidation forced the group to beat a retreat and resort to propaganda.\n\nALSO READ: I never told anyone I wanted third term, Obasanjo opens up\n\nTheir recent request to Justice Kolawole Omotosho that the charges against their leader be dismissed on the grounds that they stem from the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act of 2013, which has since been repealed, is, to say the least, ludicrous. Their claim falls flat in the face, especially when placed side by side the nod given by the Supreme Court that Kanu’s trial be allowed to continue. Upon realising that their strategy had run into a brick wall, IPOB appears to have changed gear, now using Kanu’s health as a tool of propaganda. They are harping on Kanu’s health believing that it might buy them some time, delay Kanu’s trial, and attract public sympathy. Fully aware that Kanu has a strong case to answer, IPOB obviously believes that feigning illness for their lord and alleging mistreatment by the DSS would serve their best interest. Some IPOB officers have discreetly expressed worry that Kanu, who is talking about health issues, has reportedly sacked two highly experienced doctors he recruited to manage his health.\n\nIn short, the purpose of all the allegations by IPOB is to prolong Kanu’s trial. It would appear that this approach isn’t about seeking justice, but placing a huge premium on undermining accountability and damaging the reputation of Nigeria’s judiciary. One should not be in a hurry to forget how the separatist leader attacked Justice Binta Nyako. Last month, Kanu’s friends under the guise of three non-profit organisations petitioned US President Donald Trump. In the petition, they singled out five judges for attacks. The judges are: Haruna Simon Tsammani, Hamma Barka, Mohammed Lawal Garba, and former CJN Olukayode Ariwoola. As October 10, 2025 nears, it is important for Nigerians to become more discerning. Kanu is expected to unleash his dramatic skills. Attacking judges is Kanu’s stock in trade.\n\nCertainly , IPOB would double down on the dissemination of reports intended to mislead the public. Of course, they would do things aimed at attacking the trial judges, in addition to spreading false disinformation. Kanu’s past acknowledgment that decisions made by the Supreme Court are legally binding is noteworthy. This acknowledgement reinforces the idea that there are no more justifications for evading accountability. The trial’s outcome will have far-reaching effects. According to a report published by Amnesty International in 2025, more than 1,800 people lost their lives in the South-East region between the years 2021 and 2023. IPOB’s Indigenous Peoples Liberation Army and ESN have been linked to these deaths. The positive resolution of Kanu’s case is crucial. It is the responsibility of the Nigerian judiciary to ensure that a fair trial is conducted in court, to uphold the rule of law, coercion, and to deliver justice to those who have passed away.\n\n•Nwokedi writes from Owerri","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nNnamdi Kanu and a drama foretold\n\n\nBy: Emeka Nwokedi WHEN, in March, the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, John Tsoho,

Palestine recognition","text":"The UK will use the UN General Assembly to push for international backing of a framework for peace in the Middle East, following its recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe question of Palestinian statehood is likely to dominate the gathering of world leaders in New York in the coming days.\n\nSir Keir Starmer confirmed the historic if largely symbolic move on Sunday, saying it was intended “to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis”.\n\nAustralia, Canada and Portugal made similar announcements, while France is expected to formally recognise Palestine on Monday at the UN.\n\nForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she will use the summit to address civilian suffering in war-ravaged Gaza and seek to strengthen “the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East”.\n\nShe will hold bilateral meetings to advance elements of the plan, including transitional governance and security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office.\n\nThe UK Government has acknowledged that recognising a Palestinian state would not ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza nor contribute to the freeing of the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7 2023.\n\nBut the UK believes the move is necessary to safeguard the prospect of a lasting two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, with Israel existing alongside a Palestinian state.\n\nSeveral countries are expected to join about 150 others in recognising Palestinian statehood at UN meetings, to revive the waning cause of a two-state solution, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia from Monday.\n\nBut this will likely prompt a fierce backlash from Israel and its key ally the United States.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu branded the UK move “absurd” and “simply a reward for terrorism”, while US President Donald Trump said it was “rewarding Hamas”.\n\nFamilies of hostages held in Gaza called it a “betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity”.\n\nSenior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly hailed the UK, Canada and Australia’s move as a victory for “the justice of our cause”.\n\nIn an effort to counter that criticism, Sir Keir said Hamas was a “brutal terror organisation” and confirmed plans to ratchet up sanctions on the group.\n\n“Our call for a genuine two-state solution is the exact opposite of their hateful vision,” he said.\n\nBut with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza escalating and Israel pushing ahead with settlements in the West Bank, Sir Keir said “the hope of a two-state solution is fading” but “we cannot let that light go out”.\n\nMs Cooper said: “At this moment of intense global instability and conflict, UK diplomacy and leadership has never been more important.\n\n“Innocent civilians are suffering in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan.\n\n“Countries worldwide are dealing with high levels of migration including displaced and trafficked people.\n\n“And climate change is not just a future threat to our survival, but a source of chaos and suffering across every continent today.\n\n“This week at the UN General Assembly we will be pursuing progress across all those challenges, in particular by strengthening the international consensus on our pathway for peace in the Middle East, and our coalition against Russian aggression in Ukraine.”\n\nShe will represent the UK alongside Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy, who said his focus would be on “ending conflict and shaping AI for the common good”.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised Sir Keir’s absence at the summit.\n\nHe said: “The Prime Minister should not be missing in action from Britain’s historic recognition of Palestinian statehood just because he’s worried about upsetting Donald Trump.”","summary":"A wave of Israel’s allies are expected to announce their recognition of a Palestinian state at

Opposition Leader Rips Starmer’s Palestinian Recognition as Catastrophic ‘Reward for Terror’","text":"Opposition Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch blasted Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s recognition of a Palestinian state as “absolutely disastrous,” charging it hands Hamas terrorists a victory while leaving Israeli hostages “languishing in Gaza.”\n\nBritain on Sunday joined Canada and Australia in extending recognition, despite Hamas still ruling Gaza, holding hostages, and boasting of the October 7 massacre. The move, announced on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, was denounced as nothing less than a political prize for jihadists.\n\n“Disastrous. Absolutely disastrous. We will all rue the day this decision was made,” Badenoch declared on X on Sunday, posting Starmer’s remarks. “Rewarding terrorism with no conditions whatsoever put in place for Hamas. It leaves hostages languishing in Gaza and does nothing to stop the suffering of innocent people caught in this war.”\n\nStarmer had previously claimed recognition would be conditional — that Hamas must disarm, release the hostages, and relinquish control of Gaza. None of those conditions were met, yet he pressed ahead anyway.\n\nOn Saturday, Badenoch said Starmer was “rewarding terrorism with his Middle Eastern policy,” accusing him of being captive to Labour’s “hard-left backbenchers.” She added: “Britain cannot afford to be weak – only the Conservatives will stand up for our national interest.”\n\nWriting in The Telegraph ahead of the announcement, the Opposition leader warned that recognition “would be a reward for terrorism,” pointing out that “the U.S. has been clear on this.”\n\nIsrael’s Foreign Ministry blasted London’s move as “nothing but a reward for jihadist Hamas – emboldened by its Muslim Brotherhood affiliates in the UK,” noting Hamas leaders themselves admit recognition is the “fruit” of the October 7 massacre.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog also condemned the decision on Sunday, declaring: “After the atrocities of October 7, while Hamas continues its campaign of terror, and while it continues to cruelly hold 48 hostages in the tunnels and dungeons of Gaza, the recognition of a Palestinian state by some nations today is, not surprisingly, cheered by Hamas.” Herzog warned it “will only embolden the forces of darkness” and called it “a sad day for those who seek true peace.”\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant message of his own, vowing: “I have a clear message to those leaders who are recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrendous October 7 massacre: You are rewarding terror with an enormous prize. There will be no Palestinian state west of the Jordan River.”\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages also condemned the recognition on Sunday, with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum stating that granting “significant political rewards without securing the return of our loved ones represents a catastrophic failure of political, moral, and diplomatic leadership.”\n\nThe recognition also put London directly at odds with Washington. President Donald Trump, during his state visit to the UK last week, said it was “one of our few disagreements actually” with Starmer. The Trump administration has repeatedly stressed its opposition, viewing Palestinian statehood as nothing but a reward for Hamas terror.\n\nThe Opposition leader said the Palestinian recognition reflected what she sees as Starmer’s broader weakness abroad. “This summer, when Hamas leaders were eliminated in strikes by our democratic ally Israel, Keir Starmer rushed to condemn not the terrorists, but Israel,” she wrote in The Telegraph. “When Israel and the U.S. coordinated strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a regime that funds terrorism on our streets and threatens our citizens, Labour’s leaders could not say whether they supported the action.”\n\nThat posture, she argued, “sends a signal to terrorists and tyrants alike that Britain no longer knows which way it is going.”\n\nPolling suggests Starmer’s recognition is widely unpopular at home. A JL Partners survey released Saturday found 87 percent of Britons oppose recognition without conditions, 51 percent oppose recognition while Hamas remains in control of Gaza, and 52 percent believe it directly rewards terrorism.\n\nConservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said Starmer is “sending a dangerous message, where violence and extremism are tolerated and rewarded,” accusing him of bowing to Labour’s “hard-left factions.” Reform UK leader Nigel Farage branded the recognition “a surrender to terrorism and a betrayal of Israel.”\n\nChief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis called it a “historic error of foreign policy” that would “impede the cause of peace” and serve as another “reward for terrorism.”\n\nBadenoch said Starmer’s recognition was consistent with other Labour decisions she argued weakened Britain’s standing — from surrendering the Chagos Islands to pushing net zero policies that hand “economic leverage” to hostile powers. “It is because Labour cannot fix the big problems in our society that they focus on discredited student union campaigns to appease the hard left,” she said.\n\nThe move came despite U.S. Republicans warning against such recognition just days earlier. On Friday, House Republican Chairwoman Elise Stefanik and Sen. Rick Scott led a congressional letter to Britain, France, Canada, and Australia, calling it “a reckless policy that undermines prospects for peace” and a “dangerous reward for terror.”\n\nThey stressed recognition “removes incentives for Palestinian groups to repudiate terrorism,” while the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas has gone nearly two decades without elections, clinging to a four-year term from 2005 — hardly the hallmarks of a state.\n\nThe Opposition leader warned Starmer “will spend the next four years delivering the hobby horses of the Labour left to stay in power – and leave a HUGE mess for us to clean up.”\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

But it is still not clear if they will have a formal bilateral meeting, or more of a \"happenstance encounter\".\n\n\"We'll see each other in New York — he's hosting a reception on Tuesday night of next week,\" Mr Albanese last week told ABC radio, referring to a function the president is hosting for leaders from around the world.\n\nOn Saturday, Mr Trump said he would meet \"probably 20\" world leaders during the UN summit, but did not name any.\n\n\"Everybody wants to meet, but I'm one person,\" Trump said. \"I'm going to meet with some of the majors.\"\n\nThe stakes of any meeting are high. \"It's probably the most consequential meeting between an American and Australian in living memory,\" former deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell said in Sydney last week.\n\nTop of the prime minister's priority list will be the AUKUS security and submarines deal, currently under Pentagon review.\n\nLittle is known about the progress of that review, though some US media reports suggest the pact is safe. King Charles talked it up at a Windsor Castle banquet with Trump last week.\n\nTrade and tariffs are also a priority, though hopes of a meaningful exemption from Mr Trump's import taxes have been fading over time.\n\nThe US has multiple grievances with Australia over trade (such as \"non-tariff barriers\" to business like biosecurity controls and social media regulation), and over defence (namely that Australia isn't spending as much on it as the US would like).\n\nSo any public event with Mr Trump, who has a tendency to publicly air his grievances with allies during such meetings, would represent some risk for the prime minister.\n\nWestern recognition of Palestine as country\n\nThis is another big grievance of the US. The Western world is breaking with the superpower on the formal recognition of Palestine.\n\nOn the eve of the UN assembly's High-level Week, Australia — along with the UK and Canada — issued a declaration formally recognising Palestine as its own sovereign country.\n\nAt least seven other western nations are set to do the same, including Andorra, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and San Marino. They are joining 147 of 193 UN states that already recognised Palestine.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority has, in turn, offered commitments such as governance reforms, demilitarisation and general elections.\n\nThe US is hostile towards the idea of recognising a Palestinian state now, even as polling suggests a majority of Americans support it.\n\nThe Trump administration argues Hamas is being \"rewarded\".\n\nBut French President Emmanuel Macron says the recognition move is actually the \"best way to isolate Hamas\". \n\nThe US has denied visas for Palestinian officials to attend the UN event. So on Saturday, 145 countries voted to allow Palestine to take part in the summit virtually.\n\nThe US and Israel voted against the resolution, but only Nauru, Palau and Paraguay joined them, and six countries abstained (Albania, Fiji, Hungary, North Macedonia, Panama and Papua New Guinea).\n\nThe West's support for a Palestinian state has been spurred by Israel's intensifying bombardment of Gaza, now deemed a genocide by a UN commission of inquiry. The commission's finding last week is in line with the assessment of the world's top human rights groups and many genocide scholars.\n\nThere is widespread acceptance that the moves to recognise Palestine will not change the situation on the ground, and there are calls for UN member states to take much stronger action.\n\nThe UN commission of inquiry has backed human rights advocates' calls for sanctions on Israel.\n\nIt is also recommended member states stop supplying arms and jet fuel to Israel, and cooperate with the International Criminal Court, which has war crimes arrest warrants out for Israeli leaders.\n\nFrance and Saudi Arabia will co-host a summit on the future of Palestine at the UN's headquarters in New York on Monday, local time.\n\nPush for a stronger response to Russian aggression\n\nThis year's UN General Assembly session will be the fourth since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLast year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brought a \"victory plan\", for which he sought support from the US's then-president Joe Biden.\n\nThis year, he is planning to meet Mr Trump, whose support has been much shakier than his predecessor's.\n\nReports out of Kyiv say Mr Zelenskyy will request more US sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Moscow's UN envoy said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to Russian state media.\n\nMr Trump has been pushing for weeks for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin --- something he said Mr Putin had agreed to during a phone call more than a month ago.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Trump said that Mr Putin had \"really let me down\". He is urging countries to penalise Russia by refusing to buy its oil.\n\nAlbanese's first UN speech and messages on social media and climate change\n\nIn past years, Foreign Minister Penny Wong has delivered Australia's statement at the UN's annual meeting of world leaders.\n\nBut this year, for the first time, the prime minister will address the general assembly.\n\nHe is likely to restate Australia's position on global conflicts and its wishes for peace, and talk about the importance of international cooperation and the rules-based world order, as Ms Wong has in past years.\n\nHe is also likely to mention Australia's new emissions reduction target and its social media ban for users under 16.\n\nAustralia is presenting to the UN an emissions target of a 62-70 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2035.\n\nAnd it will host a forum to promote its upcoming social media ban for under-16s.\n\nUnder the upcoming ban, social media platforms will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to stop Australians under the age of 16 from signing up.\n\n\"Australia is leading the world, but the world is following Australia's lead,\" Mr Albanese said of the ban.\n\nHe said the EU — which was considering a similar policy — as well as Greece and Fiji, would be represented at the forum on Wednesday morning, local time. \n\n\"We'll be out trying to round up a few more to come to what will be a really important event,\" he said.\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, as well as Ms Wong, are accompanying Albanese to help him sell the policies to the world.","summary":"World leaders are arriving in New York for the UN General Assembly — and for the first time, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is among them.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-22/united-nations-general-assembly-what-to-watch-for-in-new-york/105800440","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0188195c41d7bd40d0b025700526b2b0?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2531&cropW=4500&xPos=0&yPos=234&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:19:15","author":"Brad Ryan","authors":["Brad Ryan"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.233},{"id":362372888,"title":"Top Democratic senator warns Trump on ‘path to dictatorship’","text":"Published on: September 22, 2025 4:16 AM\n\nThe top US Democratic senator warned Sunday that President Donald Trump’s call for the Justice Department to take action against his enemies puts America on a path to dictatorship.\n\nTurning the agency “into an instrument that goes after his enemies, whether they’re guilty or not… is the path to a dictatorship,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on CNN. “That’s what dictatorships do.”\n\nTrump publicly urged his Justice Department on Saturday to take action against his perceived enemies, the latest in a series of moves that critics say have shattered the agency’s traditional independence.\n\nIn a social media post addressing “Pam” — apparently Attorney General Pam Bondi — Trump fumed over the lack of legal action against California Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats.\n\nSchiff and James are among a handful of people who have been accused by a close Trump ally, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, of falsifying documents on mortgage applications.\n\n“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump fired the federal prosecutor who was overseeing the probe into James, after the attorney reportedly insisted there was insufficient evidence to charge her with mortgage fraud.\n\nErik Siebert, US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, told staff of his resignation via an email on Friday, the New York Times and other US media outlets reported.\n\n“I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,” Trump said Saturday, apparently referencing the probe into James.\n\nSchiff and James have separately clashed with Trump in prior years, leading investigations that the Republican president alleges were political witch hunts.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term in the White House, Schiff, then a member of the US House, led the prosecution at the president’s first impeachment trial, which was based on allegations he pressured Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election.\n\nAfter Trump left the White House, James brought a major civil fraud case against him, alleging he and his company had unlawfully inflated his wealth and manipulated the value of properties to obtain favorable bank loans or insurance terms.\n\nA state judge ordered Trump to pay $464 million in that suit, but a higher court later removed the financial penalty while upholding the underlying judgment.","summary":"The top US Democratic senator warned Sunday that President Donald Trump&#8217;s call for the Justice Department to take action against his enemies puts America on a path to dictatorship.

He wanted the best for them,” Trump said of Kirk. “That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents, and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry,” Trump added. “I am sorry Erika.”\n\nBefore Trump took to the stage, Erika Kirk fought back tears as she said she forgave the shooter who killed her husband on September 10.\n\n“My husband, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” she began. “That man, that young man, I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do.”\n\n“The answer to hate is not hate,” the widow added, in stark contrast to the president’s words. “The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love, love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”\n\nDuring the president’s tribute to Kirk, he also segued into claiming his administration has “found an answer to autism.”\n\n“It was Charlie who helped unite MAGA. And you know what MAHA is, that's right. Make America Health Again,” Trump said, before touting a White House press conference scheduled for Monday.\n\n“I think you're going to find it to be amazing. I think we found an answer to autism. How about that autism?” Trump said. “Tomorrow, we're going to be talking in the oval office in the White House about autism, how it happens. So we won't let it happen anymore.”\n\nTrump’s family, members of his Cabinet, GOP lawmakers and Elon Musk were among the tens of thousands of supporters who turned out to honor Kirk.\n\nWhite House officials, prominent MAGA figures and Kirk’s colleagues from Turning Point USA gave tributes to the murdered CEO in the lengthy ceremony, described by one speaker as “the Holy Spirit in a Trump rally.”\n\nSome of Trump’s most senior officials, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy Stephen Miller, spoke at the memorial.\n\nMiller’s speech focused on prevailing “over the forces of wickedness and evil,” with Trump’s deputy chief of staff also hitting out at “our enemies.”\n\n“You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic,” Miller said.\n\n“And to those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hatred against us, what do you have? You have nothing. You are nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio railed against the “threat of Marxism” on college campuses, while National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard said that Kirk stood up to schools that “silence debate.”\n\nSpeaking in Washington, D.C. before he departed for Arizona, Trump said that 10 years ago, colleges were “dangerous for conservatives” and “now they’re hot.”\n\nKirk was assassinated on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem on September 10 in front of a crowd of horrified students. He was shot in the neck by a single bullet. \n\n“He did a tremendous job, and he had a hold on youth because they loved him,” Trump said. “If you go back 10 years, those colleges were dangerous places for conservatives and now they're hot. They're very hot, just like this country is hot.”\n\nA sea of people dressed in red, white and blue descended on the stadium in the early hours of Sunday, waiting in line well before dawn to ensure they secured a spot inside the arena, which has a capacity of more than 63,000. \n\nPictures inside the stadium showed people in the crowd praying and crying before the service had even begun.\n\nSecurity for the event was high, with the Department of Homeland Security affording it the same level reserved for Super Bowls.\n\nKirk’s accused killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson of Utah, was formally charged with murder last week as prosecutors announced they intend to seek the death penalty.\n\nTrump has previously blamed the “radical left” for Kirk's death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating his death.\n\nFederal investigators have found no evidence linking Robinson to left-wing groups, despite claims from Trump and his administration , three sources told NBC News.\n\nThe trio of insiders is reportedly familiar with the probe into the case, which, as of now, appears to revolve around Robinson, 22, acting alone.\n\n“Every indication so far is that this was one guy who did one really bad thing because he found Kirk’s ideology personally offensive,” one person said.\n\nRobinson’s mother told investigators that he had recently become more politically active and leaned left.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s words were in stark contrast to Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-charlie-kirk-memorial-opponent-b2830917.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/21/22/49/US-POLITICS-SHOOTING-KIRK-zw656lrk.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cuFWDLxQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:14:26","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":362383310,"title":"Maduro proposes to Trump resumption of direct dialogue","text":"CARACAS, September 22. /TASS/. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has proposed to his US counterpart Donald Trump the resumption of direct dialogue to resolve disagreements between the two countries, a letter from the Venezuelan leader addressed to Trump stated.\n\nThe document was published on September 21 on the Telegram channel of Venezuela’s Minister of Information and Communication Freddy Nanez.\n\n\"During the first months of your second presidential term, we always sought direct communication to address and resolve any issues arising between our two governments,\" the president noted. In the letter, he proposed maintaining \"direct and frank communication\" between Caracas and Washington \"to settle any disagreements.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan president rejected accusations that the country’s top leadership is involved in drug trafficking, calling them \"absolutely false\" and \"the worst of the fake news directed against Venezuela to justify an escalation of armed conflict.\" To support his position, Maduro cited data from the UN and other international organizations indicating that Venezuela is not a drug-producing country and is combating illegal drug trafficking on its border with Colombia. \"Venezuela is a territory free of drug production and a country unrelated to the drug business, thanks to the efforts of our police and armed forces,\" he wrote.\n\nMaduro expressed appreciation for Trump’s efforts to end conflicts in various regions of the world and called on the United States to guarantee the preservation of peace in Latin America and the Caribbean. \"I urge you, Mr. President, to maintain peace through dialogue and mutual understanding throughout the [Western] hemisphere,\" the head of state concluded, reaffirming Venezuela’s readiness to \"defend peace.\"\n\nThreats from the United States\n\nAccording to Trump, Venezuela is taking insufficient measures to combat drug trafficking. Moreover, Washington accused Maduro of belonging to the Cartel de los Soles drug cartel, the existence of which Caracas categorically denies.\n\nAccording to Reuters, on August 19, three US Navy destroyers were sent to the southern Caribbean, to the coast of Venezuela \"to conduct operations against drug cartels.\" The United States also deployed a nuclear submarine, a missile cruiser, amphibious ships and 4,500 military personnel to the region. The US army had eliminated 14 members of the Venezuelan drug cartel during an operation in international waters.","summary":"Venezuelan president expressed appreciation for american leader’s efforts to end conflicts in various regions of the world and called on the United States to guarantee the preservation of peace in Latin America and the Caribbean","url":"https://tass.com/world/2019455","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:11:57","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":362377888,"title":"Erika Kirk Expresses Forgiveness Toward Her Husband’s Assailant","text":"Local news \n\n The City of Vidalia and Toombs County have teamed up with the…\n\n InternewscastSeptember 21, 2025\n\n \n\n Local news \n\n IE 11 is not supported.

That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-president Bashar al-Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by Sharaa. Assad’s fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.\nSince then, Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaeda militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.\nSince assuming power, Sharaa has preached coexistence and sought to reassure Syria’s minority communities but the country’s fragile recovery has been threatened by outbreaks of sectarian violence.\nFighters affiliated with the new government were also accused of killing hundreds of civilians from the Druze and Alawite religious minorities.\nAlong with his appearance at the UN General Assembly, Sharaa is likely to use his visit to push for further sanctions relief for Syria as it attempts to rebuild its war-battered economy and infrastructure.\nUS President Donald Trump met Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May and announced that he would lift decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assads’ rule.\nHe followed through by ordering a large swathe of sanctions lifted or waived. However, the most stringent sanctions were imposed by Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act passed in 2019 and will require a congressional vote to permanently remove them.\n\nAnother topic that will loom large during Sharaa’s visit is his country’s relations with US ally Israel. Since Assad’s fall, Israel has been suspicious of Sharaa’s government and has seized a formerly UN-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of air strikes on Syrian military sites.\nNegotiations have been under way for a security deal that Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces and a return to a 1974 disengagement agreement. While Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks on Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.\n“There is some progress,” he said, but the deal is “still a vision for the future”.\nAlso on Sunday, Syrian elections officials announced that the country’s first parliamentary elections since the fall of Assad will take place on October 5.\nThe members of the People’s Assembly will not be chosen via a direct popular vote, however, but through an electoral college system with electoral bodies in each province voting for two-thirds of the seats, while Sharaa will directly appoint one third.\nOfficials have said that holding direct elections at this stage would be too logistically challenging since many Syrians have lost personal documentation or are living as refugees abroad after the nearly 14-year civil war.","summary":"Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in New York on Sunday to take part in the UN General Assembly, the first president of Syria to do so in nearly six decades.\nThe last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967.

It’s like saying Donald Trump knows more about being president than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris,” he continued, pointing to an interview of Kirk where he said he would want to be remembered for his courage and faith.\n\n“And let me tell you guys, those were not empty words. Last week, Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were martyred for what they believe. According to the book of Acts, the first martyr in the early Christian church was Stephen who was stoned to death. And as Stephen was being killed, he said, ‘Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.’ Now, there are many times in the Bible where Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, but this is the only time he’s seen standing. And while the Bible isn’t explicit about this, I like to think Jesus was standing to welcome Stephen, the courageous martyr, into heaven,” Trump said, explaining that it gives him great comfort because “11 days ago, as a cowardly assassin crawled on his stomach to end Charlie’s life on Earth.”\n\n“I’m betting Charlie saw the son of God standing tall to welcome him home,” he said, adding that Kirk “always brought out the best in all of us.”\n\n“At one of the last events of the 2024 campaign at Arizona State, some lunatic called in a threat to try to keep us from going on the stage again. We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now. We won’t back down. … We won’t be intimidated,” he said, noting that the Bible repeatedly says to not be afraid.\n\n“And the 100,000 people here today are a signal to the world, our message of faith, family and country will not be silenced,” he added.","summary":"A relationship with Jesus was the most important thing to Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump Jr. said during the memorial service for the Turning Point USA founder.\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Jr.: Relationship with Jesus Was the Most Important Thing to Charlie Kirk appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/09/21/donald-trump-jr-relationship-with-jesus-was-the-most-important-thing-to-charlie-kirk/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/AP25264771517668-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:05:21","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.09},{"id":362375612,"title":"As DSS confronts Sowore’s ‘scorched-earth’ strategy","text":"By: Lewis Chukwuma\n\nARGUABLY the poster-boy of Nigeria’s activism ecosystem, online publisher of SaharaReporters and rambunctious politician, Omoyele Sowore, has probably earned his epaulets, tracking his nimble interventions and a wide swathe of comic escapades he has scripted in the last two decades, often laced with quaint rhetorical violence. But has the fire-eating activist derailed currently? Has he weaponized freedom of expression? Though he has never publicly claimed to be a candidate for sainthood awaiting final Papal proclamation, Sowore would appear to have goofed in his recent unfortunate and curious virulent attack on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. On his “X” handle page on August 25, 2025, Sowore had spawned a storm by calling out President Tinubu as a criminal. In consequence, the Department of State Services (DSS), on Tuesday, initiated legal action against him for allegedly making false claim against the person of President Tinubu. The suit filed before a Federal High Court in Abuja, trailed refusal of the defendants to pull down the said false and misleading message, as requested by the DSS.\n\nEarlier, the security agency had threatened legal action against X, formerly known as Twitter and Facebook, for offering their platforms to Sowore, who in a post called the Nigerian President a “criminal.” In the separate letters to the social media platforms, the DSS had requested that the false statement against the president be pulled down or it would initiate legal action. Defendants in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/484/2025, include; Sowore, Meta (Facebook) Incorp and X Incorp. In the five-count charge, the DSS is alleging that Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in 2019 and 2023, and convener of the #RevolutionNow protest against the administration of former President Muhammadu Buhari, contravened the provisions of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Amendment Act, 2024.\n\nFollowing the filing of the charge, Sowore is expected to be arraigned soon. One of the five-count charges read: “That you, Omoyele Sowore, adult, male on or about the 25th day of August, 2025, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, did use your official X handle page, @Yele Sowore, to send out a message/tweet as: “This criminal @ official PBAT actually went to Brazil to state that there is no more corruption under his regime in Nigeria. What audacity to lie shamelessly!,” which you know the said message to be false but posted it for the purpose of causing a breakdown of law and order in the country, especially among individuals, who hold divergent views on the personality of the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu (GCFR) and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 24 (1) (b) of the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Amendment Act, 2024.”\n\nHowever, in a counter-suit, Sowore also took the DSS, social media giant Meta (owners of Facebook), and X Corp (formerly Twitter) to the Federal High Court in Abuja over what he described as a coordinated attempt to silence him and suppress free speech in Nigeria. According to a statement issued by his lead counsel, Tope Temokun, on Tuesday, Sowore filed two fundamental human rights enforcement suits, challenging what his legal team called “unconstitutional censorship” and attempts by state agencies to influence global tech platforms to restrict citizens’ speech. Temokun stressed that the suits were not just about Sowore personally but about the principle of free expression for all Nigerians. It is interesting that Sowore is now seeking refuge in the same judicial system he has, time and again, labelled “corrupt.” There are many judges in Nigeria that Sowore has denigrated, including past and serving judicial officers at the highest level. Well, that is a matter for another day.\n\nThree instances, for the purpose of this analysis, illustrate that unlimited free speech doesn’t exist – even in well-known liberal democracies. Freedom of expression is not absolute and must be balanced against other fundamental rights. Such include the right to privacy, honor, and reputation. Making speeches that incites hatred, constitutes libel or slander, or causes serious offense may not be protected under freedom of expression. Nothing perhaps better conveys the weight of the consequences of freedom of expression than in the small East African country called Rwanda. Under the guise of freedom of expression, in April 1994, a seemingly harmless broadcast by one person was made on radio. This broadcast triggered the start of 100 days of genocide that left more than one million people dead. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. For instance, you can’t, banking on freedom of expression, say something that will cause other people harm- or kill them. One can’t, for instance, under the guise of freedom of expression, barge into a crowded hall and yell “Fire!” In the same vein, one cannot under the guise of exercising his or her freedom of expression scream “I have a bomb” on an airplane.\n\n Worried by the need to balance freedom of expression with hate speech the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, in May 2019, said, it was the duty of all to keep “hate speech from escalating into something more dangerous, particularly incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, which is prohibited under international law.” Something remarkable recently happened in the the UK that granted Nigeria independence. In the wake of the shooting to death in the US of President Trump’s supporter, Charlie Kirk, President-elect of Oxford University Student Union, George Abaraonye, made a post on a Whatsapp chat group mocking Kirk’s death. He also reportedly made a similar post on Instagram. Posted Abaronye: “Charlie Kirk got shot loool” – an elongated version of the phrase ‘lol’ which means ‘laughing out loud’. The post appeared to welcome the incident. Upon realizing the backlash his comment on the shooting which – by the way- happened thousands of miles away in the US generated, Abaronye quickly deleted the post and apologized.\n\nALSO READ: I never told anyone I wanted third term, Obasanjo opens up\n\nThe school authorities would have none of that. Oxford University insists Abaronye will be punished, saying free speech cannot and will not come at the expense of violence, intimidation or hate. In a statement posted on X late on Thursday, the Oxford University said it “unequivocally condemns the reported words and sentiments” expressed by Mr. Abaraonye, who was elected as the society’s new president in June. It is interesting to note that, even though Kirk was killed in faraway America, comments by a student in the UK were still considered offensive. The implications is that in the UK, as in everywhere, sometimes free speech has consequences. In the US, in September 2022, Uju Anya, an associate professor of applied linguistics at Carnegie Mellon University, tweeted that the reign of Queen Elizabeth II was a period of suffering and colonization for many, a sentiment she also extended to the wealth amassed by individuals like Jeff Bezos. “I heard the chief monarch of a thieving, raping genocidal empire is finally dying. May her pain be excruciating,” she tweeted. Bezos responded to Anya’s tweet, which led to widespread public discussion and support for Anya from a large community of faculty and students. Interestingly, without informing Anya, Twitter pulled down her tweet.\n\n It would be interesting to know why Twitter quickly pulled down Professor Anya’s tweet on Queen Elizabeth, the late Head of State of the United Kingdom, but has failed to pull down Sowore’s post on Tinubu, the sitting President of Nigeria. Even Prof. Anya’s school, Carnegie Mellon, joined the fray by releasing a statement condemning her tweets. The ivory tower described her tweets as “offensive and objectionable.” Stressed the school: “We do not condone the offensive and objectionable messages posted by Uju Anya today on her personal social media account. \n\nTrump’s suit cites a series of New York Times articles, an editorial prior to the 2024 presidential election, which said he was unfit for office, and a 2024 book published by Penguin titled “Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success”. “Defendants maliciously published the Book and the Articles knowing that these publications were filled with repugnant distortions and fabrications about President Trump,” Trump’s lawyers said in the filing lodged in the U.S. District Court, Middle District Florida, on Monday, September 15, 2025. The publications have harmed Trump’s business and personal reputation, thereby causing massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage to his future financial prospects, Trump’s lawyers said in the filing.\n\n“The harm to the value of TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group) stock is one example of how the Defendants’ defamation has injured President Trump,” said his lawyers, citing “a precipitous decline in the stock price.” “Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times. The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear and defame me for far too long, and that stops NOW.” Trump said earlier on Monday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. There is more.\n\nLike Trump, Tinubu, aside being a politician and Nigeria’s president, is an accomplished businessman and is believed to have business interests spanning several countries.\n\nIn the same US, in response to the threats to peace and security that arise from violent extremism, many states have adopted legislation to counter extremism and/or terrorism. These laws aim to stem violence resulting from extremist beliefs and counter the underlying ideology. In other words, Americans have come to realize that people cannot be allowed to hide behind the pillar of freedom of expression to promote religious extremism. From the jungles of Guyana in the late 1980s where self-styled Reverend Jim Jones of the notorious Peoples Temple died alongside nearly 1000 cult members, to Osama bin Laden, instances abound where people have exploited freedom of expression to violently change the world.\n\nBack home in Nigeria, through the lens of Boko Haram, we have witnessed and are still witnessing the harm that can become the lot of a nation when people are allowed to hide behind the pillar of freedom of expression to say anything they deem fit We also are witnesses to the consequences of allowing people like Nnamdi Kanu and Simon Ekpa run their mouths. After all, aren’t they entitled to enjoy their freedom of expression? That Finland, a first world country that is over 8,500 km away from Nigeria, waived Ekpa ‘s freedom of expression and convicted him, shows that such freedoms have consequences. Specifically, the the court said Ekpa exploited his extensive following on social media between August 2021 and November 2024 to promote violence and encourage unrest in the Southeast. In other words, his freedom of expression became a tool to unleash terror.\n\nFor context, democracy would lose its defining egalitarianism if it foreclosed the free expression of viewpoints by its adherents – including often seeming unreasonable perspectives by forces that seek to diminish and divide. But there is a caveat. Absolute freedom exists only in Utopia, certainly not in the real world. It should never be wielded like a cudgel. What played out from last week speaks to the consequence of pushing the much-touted freedom of expression to the extreme. As always, there are consequence. Both in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nDespite democracy’s leniency, those that, in contrast, enlist intellectual pretensions to push often illogical, flawed, antagonistic positions that misinform, diminish and obfuscate certainly deserve to be confronted and faulted. The DSS is Nigeria’s primary domestic intelligence agency, which plays a critical role in national security and intelligence gathering. Its main responsibilities are within Nigeria and include counter-intelligence, medical intelligence, economic intelligence, internal security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance as well as investigating some other types of serious crimes against the state. It is also charged with the protection of senior government officials, particularly the president, vice president, state governors and visiting heads of state and governments with their respective families. In effect, any threat to the president – physical or psychological – as in this case, requires a specific action by the agency. To act otherwise would be shirking its responsibility, putting the President- and Nigeria- at risk. This is the line the DSS is towing, albeit, in a civil manner.\n\nBy its operational mandate, the DSS could easily have chosen to move roughshod against mischief and crises entrepreneurs who have wrongly opted to game the agency’s civility. But instructively, the DSS, under the administration of the new Director-General, Adeola Oluwatosin Ajayi, is towing a different engagement strategy with those who misalign with its objectives. Funke Egbemode, a former president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, recently aptly captured the persona of the DSS boss: “This new Sheriff is a thoroughbred secret cop who rose through the ranks, not a politician or political appointee who got lucky.” For good measure she added: “Ajayi started as a rookie, and after three decades-plus of service, he’s here determined to restore the dignity of the service. The mask must stay on and the masquerade must stay in the grove unless there is reason for it to visit the people.” In effect, this ‘masquerade’ visits people or organisations for specific reasons – assuredly not picnics.\n\nCertainly, the matter between Sowore and the DSS is no picnic\n\n•Chukwuma writes in from Jos","summary":"Tribune Online\n\nAs DSS confronts Sowore’s ‘scorched-earth’ strategy\n\n\nBy: Lewis Chukwuma ARGUABLY the poster-boy of Nigeria’s activism ecosystem, online publisher of SaharaReporters and rambunctious politician, Omoyele Sowore, has probably earned his epaulets, tracking his nimble interventions and a wide swathe of comic escapades he has scripted in the last two decades, often laced with quaint rhetorical violence.

And he is a martyr for the Christian faith.”\n\nSpeakers highlighted Kirk’s profound faith and his strong belief that young conservatives need to get married, build families and pass on their values to keep building their movement. They also repeatedly told conservative activists, sometimes in confrontational tones, that the best way to honor Kirk was doubling down on his mission to move American politics further to the right.\n\n“You thought you could kill Charlie Kirk? You have made him immortal,\" said deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic.”\n\nKirk’s assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has become a singular moment for the modern-day conservative movement. It also has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division.\n\nThe shooting has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.\n\nHigh security and a full stadium\n\nThose close to Kirk prayed and the floors shook from the bass of Christian rock bands as the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals took on the feel of a megachurch service.\n\n“Charlie looked at politics as an on-ramp to Jesus,” said the Rev. Rob McCoy, Kirk’s pastor.\n\nPeople began lining up before dawn to secure a spot inside State Farm Stadium west of Phoenix, where Kirk’s Turning Point organization is based. Security was tight, similar to the Super Bowl or other high-profile event. The speakers delivered their tributes from behind bullet-proof glass.\n\nThe 63,400-seat stadium quickly filled with people dressed in red, white and blue, as organizers suggested.\n\nKirk's widow, Erika, in her own address said in the midst of her grief she was finding comfort that her husband left this world without regrets. She also said she forgives the man who is charged with killing him.\n\n“My husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” said Erika Kirk, who is taking over as Turning Point's leader. She added, “I forgive him.”\n\nComments about Kirk have become a Trump administration target\n\nTrump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others who he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.\n\nDozens of people, from journalists to teachers to late show host Jimmy Kimmel, have faced suspensions or lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk’s death.\n\nSome speakers at the memorial said Kirk was battling evil and referred often to a vague “they” as the enemy. Others were blunt.\n\n“Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were martyred for what they believe,\" said Donald Trump Jr., the president's son who had close relationship with Kirk.\n\n“Charlie was my brother. Charlie was my commanding officer,” added Jack Posobiec, a far right influencer, in his tribute. “And we will never, ever let the left, the media or the Democrats forget the name of Charlie Kirk.”\n\nKirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy of someone they see as an inspirational conservative leader.\n\nA 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred.\n\nKirk's legacy of conservative political influence\n\nTurning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.\n\n“Charlie’s having some serious heavenly FOMO right now,\" Tyler Bower, Turning Point's chief operating officer, said, likening the moment to bringing “the Holy Spirit into a Trump rally.\"\n\nThe crowd was a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America with his ability to mobilize young people.\n\nHis impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.\n\nKirk “was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome.\n\nKirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.\n\n“He slayed ignorance,” said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. “He cut through lies. He woke people’s minds, inspired people’s hearts and imparted wisdom every day.”\n\nSpeaker after speaker, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, expressed their awe at Kirk's ability to go into what many conservatives saw as the lion's den to make the conservative case: college campuses.\n\n“Why don’t you start somewhere easier,” Rubio joked when he first heard about Kirk years ago. “Like, for example, communist Cuba?\"\n\nORIGINAL 8:55 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and prominent members of his “Make America Great Again” movement will pay tribute Sunday to conservative activist Charlie Kirk, whose slaying has marked a signal moment in America’s fraught political atmosphere.\n\nThe memorial service for Kirk, whom Trump credits with playing a pivotal role in his 2024 election victory, is expected to draw tens of thousands of mourners, including Vice President JD Vance, senior White House officials and young conservatives shaped by the 31-year-old firebrand.\n\n“We're going to celebrate the life of a great man today,” Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Sunday morning to make his way to Arizona for the service. “It will be a tough day.”\n\nKirk’s assassination at a Sept. 10 appearance on a Utah college campus has set off a fierce debate about violence, decency and free speech in an era of deep political division. The shooting also has stirred fear among some Americans that Trump is trying to harness outrage over the killing as justification to suppress the voices of his critics and political opponents.\n\nThe service will take place at State Farm Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals west of Phoenix, where Kirk's Turning Point organization is based. Security is expected to be tight, with a similar level of federal law enforcement presence as for the Super Bowl or other high-profile event.\n\nMembers of the public began lining up outside the stadium before dawn to secure a spot, several hours before the start of the service.\n\nComments about Kirk have become a Trump administration target\n\nTrump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s death and threatened to go after liberal organizations and donors or others whom he feels are maligning or celebrating Kirk's death.\n\nHe criticized House Democrats who voted against a resolution that praised “the life and legacy” of Kirk, which passed the Republican-controlled chamber Friday.\n\n“Who could vote against that? All (Republicans) were saying was ‘Please condemn the assassination of a human being,’” Trump told reporters. “And (Democrats) said, ’No, no, we’re not going to do that.’”\n\nDozens of people, from journalists to teachers, already have lost their jobs as prominent conservative activists and administration officials target comments about Kirk that they deem offensive or celebratory. The retaliation has in turn ignited a debate over the First Amendment as the Republican administration promises retribution against those who air what are seen as disparaging remarks in the wake of Kirk’s death.\n\nABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show off the air indefinitely following backlash from affiliated broadcasters and the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission over the comedian’s remarks about Kirk.\n\nThe State Department has warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk’s assassination.\n\nA 22-year-old Utah man, Tyler Robinson, has been charged with killing Kirk and faces the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charges. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but prosecutors say Robinson wrote in a text to his partner following the shooting that he “had enough” of Kirk's hatred.\n\nKirk's legacy of conservative political influence\n\nTurning Point, the group Kirk founded to mobilize young Christian conservatives, became a multimillion-dollar operation under his leadership with enormous reach.\n\nThe crowd expected to fill the stadium in Glendale for Kirk’s memorial is a testament to the massive influence he accumulated in conservative America.\n\nHis impact on modern-day conservatism went beyond U.S. shores.\n\nKirk \"was very effective because he was convinced of his views and knew how to argue them,” Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said at a political rally Sunday in Rome. “But he never stopped smiling, never stopped respecting his interlocutor and anyone who challenged him.\"\n\nKirk was a provocateur who at times made statements that some called racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. That has drawn backlash from conservatives who view the criticism as cherry-picking a few select moments to insult the legacy they see of an inspirational conservative leader.\n\nKirk was a MAGA celebrity with a loyal following that turned out to support or argue with him as he traveled the country for the events like the one at Utah Valley University, where he was fatally shot. Kirk grew the organization, in large part, through the force of his personality and debating chops.\n\nArizona is the adopted home state of Kirk, who grew up outside Chicago and founded Turning Point there before moving the organization to Phoenix. Vance, who has said Kirk's advocacy was a big reason Trump picked him to serve as vice president, transported Kirk’s casket from Utah to Arizona aboard Air Force Two the day after his death, and he later served as a guest host of Kirk’s podcast.\n\nScheduled speakers at the service include Trump, Vance, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Donald Trump Jr., right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and White House aides Stephen Miller and Sergio Gor also are set to speak.\n\nLongtime worship leader Chris Tomlin will provide music, along with other big names in contemporary Christian music, including Brandon Lake, Phil Wickham, and husband-and-wife duo Kari Jobe Carnes and Cody Carnes.\n\nKirk’s widow, who has been named Turning Point’s new leader, also will speak. Erika Kirk pledged in an emotional speech days after his death that “the movement my husband built will not die.”","summary":"UPDATE 4:00 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and prominent members of his &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; movement paid tribute Sunday to Charlie Kirk, praising the slain political conservative activist as a singular force whose work they must now advance.\n\nThe memorial service for Kirk, whom...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/573636/Trump-and-his-MAGA-movement-pay-tribute-to-Charlie-Kirk-at-Arizona-memorial-service","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/9/92d1eb86e591b9287829471acd9a89ad4ee9f3cc467f9c2fa27142ba77e1c0b9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:01:00","author":"Jonathan J.

We need to clear the fog and mystique around AI development and show people it’s a helpful tool just like any other.\n\n“Building this trust across the entire country, not just those who are already evangelists for AI, must be an urgent priority if we want to bring the benefits of AI to Britain, and realise the Government’s growth agenda.”\n\nA Government spokesperson said: “AI presents huge opportunities, boosting our economy and improving people’s lives, from advancing medical breakthroughs to more personalised public services, but public trust is critical.\n\n“Around 10 million workers are expected to use AI in their day-to-day roles by 2035, so it is vital our workforce has the skills and confidence to use it.\n\n“We are partnering with leading tech firms to deliver AI skills training to 7.5 million workers by 2030, that’s a fifth of the UK workforce, and we’ve launched the AI Assurance Roadmap to build trust in AI systems, increase adoption and help drive growth across the economy.”","summary":"Nearly twice as many people see the technology as a risk to the economy rather than an opportunity, according to polling from the Tony Blair Institute","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/prime-minister-polling-government-britain-whitehall-b1248951.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/22/00/fed5cc33740a22f17e06592b58dd8c8fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU4NDcwNTg5-2.81093700.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:01:00","author":"Sophie Wingate","authors":["Sophie Wingate"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.283},{"id":362373262,"title":"Angelina Jolie looks incredibly youthful in plunging gown as she makes bold statement on the red carpet","text":"Angelina Jolie turned heads as she graced the red carpet at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, radiating effortless elegance in a striking black velvet gown.

Get the answer to autism. How to help children, how to prevent it—biggest priority for families.\"\n\nAutism, a lifelong developmental condition that an estimated one in 31 children has, is thought to be over three times more common among boys than girls, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nStudies have found ASD exists within all socioeconomic, racial and ethnic groups and, despite conspiracy theorists’ claims, there is extensive existing research showing no link between pharmaceuticals, vaccinations and autism, as per CNN Health.\n\nEarlier this year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has served as US President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary, said that he and his team would get to the root of the so-called ‘autism epidemic’.\n\nHe alleged ‘hundreds of scientists’ would be studying the apparent cause of ASD and that the HHS would ‘eliminate’ anything found to be causing autism, as per ABC News.\n\nThe politician also claimed that he believed autism was ‘coming from an environmental toxin’.\n\nHe alleged: “Somebody made it and put that environmental toxin into our air or water or medicines or food.”\n\nThis month, the Washington Post reported that Trump is expected to link pregnant women’s use of the medicine Tylenol with a risk for autism, which goes against what medical experts have said.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, medical guidelines have said it is safe for pregnant women to take Tylenol, whose active ingredient is acetaminophen, or more commonly known as paracetamol. \n\nM. Remi Yergeau, a Carleton University professor and Canada Research Chair in Critical Disability Studies and Communication, has previously refuted RFK Jr’s claims that an autism ‘epidemic’ is taking place in the US right now.\n\nElsewhere in Trump's speech, the President spoke directly to Kirk's parents.\n\n\"To Charlie’s parents, who lost their beloved Son and to the entire Kirk family, we know that no words could ever be enough to fill the void he leaves behind,\" he said.\n\n\"That’s a void that just can’t be filled.

General Assembly, the first president of Syria to do so in nearly six decades.\n\nThe last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967. That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad’s fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.\n\nSince then, al-Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaida militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.\n\nSince assuming power, al-Sharaa has preached coexistence and sought to reassure Syria’s minority communities, but the country’s fragile recovery has been threatened by outbreaks of sectarian violence. Fighters affiliated with the new government were also accused of killing hundreds of civilians from the Druze and Alawite religious minorities.\n\nAlong with his appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, al-Sharaa is likely to use his visit to push for further sanctions relief for Syria as it attempts to rebuild its war-battered economy and infrastructure.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May and announced that he would lift decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assads’ rule.\n\nHe followed through by ordering a large swathe of sanctions lifted or waived. However, the most stringent sanctions were imposed by Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act passed in 2019 and will require a congressional vote to permanently remove them.\n\nAnother topic that will loom large during al-Sharaa’s visit is his country’s relations with U.S. ally Israel. Since Assad’s fall, Israel has been suspicious of al-Sharaa’s government and has seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites.\n\nNegotiations have been underway for a security deal that al-Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces and return to a 1974 disengagement agreement. While al-Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.\n\n“There is some progress” but the deal is “still a vision for the future,” he said.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Syrian elections officials announced that the country’s first parliamentary elections since the fall of Assad will take place on Oct. 5. The members of the People’s Assembly will not be chosen via a direct popular vote, however, but through an electoral college system with electoral bodies in each province voting for two-thirds of the seats, while al-Sharaa will directly appoint one third.\n\nOfficials have said that holding direct elections at this stage would be too logistically challenging since many Syrians have lost personal documentation or are living as refugees abroad after the nearly 14-year civil war.\n\nThe Associated Press","summary":"DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) — Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in New York on Sunday to take part in the U.N.

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced last week that the state will seek the death penalty.What To KnowErika addressed thousands of mourners gathered at State Farm Stadium on Sunday to honor her late husband.During her speech, she reflected on Charlie's mission to guide young people, including those struggling or at risk, saying, \"He wanted them to have a better life and a better path.\"She drew parallels between her act of forgiveness and the teachings of Jesus Christ, citing His words from the cross, \"My husband, Charlie. He wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. That young man. That young man on the cross. Our Savior said, 'Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.' That man. That young man. I forgive him.\"She continued: \"I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.\"In addition to her message of forgiveness, Erika announced her intention to lead Turning Point USA as its new CEO.\"His passion was my passion, and now his mission is my mission. Everything that Turning Point USA built for Charlie's mission and hard work, we will make ten times greater through the power of his memory.\"What Happens Next?During her speech on Sunday, Erika pledged to expand Turning Point USA's national outreach, grow its campus presence, and continue its advocacy for freedom of speech.The organization has announced plans to create thousands of new chapters and cultivating new partnerships with pastors and congregations.Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have said the investigation into Kirk's assassination is ongoing.Update 9/21/25, 7 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with more information.","summary":"Erika Kirk told the crowd about her decision to forgive during her husband's memorial service.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/erika-kirk-husband-charlies-killer-i-forgive-him-2133437","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2727072/erika-kirk-memorial.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=120e3d2a7f938ddb0dd20faa311bb26e","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 22:31:49","author":"Hollie Silverman","authors":["Hollie Silverman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.019},{"id":362369276,"title":"Trump and Musk meet and shake hands at Charlie Kirk memorial","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.
