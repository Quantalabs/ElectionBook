Because a majority of the country doesn’t know the word. She needs non-college educated Blacks, whites and Hispanics to turn out for her, and she is smearing her rival with a mid-20th century European political philosophy.”\n\n“You think people don’t know what Hitler is?” Jessica Tarlov, a fellow panelist, asked in response.\n\nDiscussions about fascism have surged to the fore since staffers, including former White House chief of staff John Kelly, told The New York Times and The Atlantic that Trump wished for the generals “Hitler had” and that the former president had privately claimed the genocidal fascist did “some good things.”\n\nThough Trump and his campaign deny the reports are true, the comments quickly became the center of the news cycle.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall, Harris told host Anderson Cooper that the reported comments are a “911 call to the American people” about a man she described as “unstable — increasingly unstable — and unfit to serve.”\n\nAsked whether she agrees with Kelly’s description of Trump as a “fascist,” Harris told Cooper, “Yes, I do.”\n\nTrump’s alleged Hitler comments quickly became a topic of discussion across the political media and late night comedy shows.\n\nOn Fox News, Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade suggested Trump might not have known what he was talking about.\n\n“He obviously has frustration, and I could absolutely see him going out, ‘You know what? It would be great to have German generals [that] actually do what we asked them to do,’” Kilmeade told his fellow panelists. “Knowing that, maybe not fully being cognizant of the third rail of German generals were Nazis and whatever. But he was frustrated with the slowdown.”\n\nThat remark prompted a spoof on Comedy Central’s The Daily Show.\n\n“Did you just ‘whatever’ the Holocaust?” Daily Show host Michael Kosta asked during a segment on the controversy. “’Whatever’ is for insignificant things, like when you put the plastic recycling in the paper recycling. It’s not, ‘Oops I did a genocide.’ I like that Kilmeade thinks praising Hitler is a third rail, like it’s a taboo subject that’s not p.c. to discuss at the office anymore.”\n\nThe Late Show’s Stephen Colbert also did a routine about the alleged comments on Wednesday. The comedian said Trump praising a fascist wasn’t even that much of a surprise.\n\n“So this is less of an October surprise and more of an early autumn no s***,” he said.\n\n“Those who do not learn from history are doomed to say, ‘I need the kind of generals Hitler had,’ and still somehow be statistically tied in all the battleground states,” he added.","summary":"Claim comes as network hosts attempt to defend Republican candidate in wake of Hitler controversy","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jesse-watters-fox-news-fascism-b2635339.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/28/14/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pvYbgT5K-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:50:14","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.113},{"id":261005708,"title":"Donald Trump again asks court to dismiss January 6 criminal case, saying special counsel is unconstitutional","text":"(CNN) — Donald Trump’s legal team is asking a federal court to dismiss the January 6, 2021, election subversion case, saying that the office of special counsel Jack Smith is unconstitutional, in a court filing 12 days before the presidential election.\n\n“Everything that Smith did since Attorney General (Merrick) Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional,” Trump’s lawyers argue.\n\nThe defense peppered the filing on Thursday with political jabs at President Joe Biden, with a handful of mentions of the election as well as Biden’s comment this week to “lock him up … politically.”\n\nTrump’s team writes that Garland was “following improper urging from President Biden to target President Trump, as reported at the time in 2022, and repeated recently by President Biden through his inappropriate instruction to ‘lock him up’ while Smith presses forward with the case unlawfully as the Presidential election rapidly approaches.”\n\n“I know this sounds bizarre – it sounds like if I said this five years ago, you’d lock me up. We gotta lock him up,” Biden said in New Hampshire on Tuesday, adding, “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”\n\nTrump’s court filing, however, does not mention the “politically” caveat or other context.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case against Trump in DC, has repeatedly said politics is playing no part in the decisions she makes, and Justice Department regulations that govern the special counsel’s office provide several mechanisms for Smith to make decisions independently from the attorney general. Garland and Biden have also maintained they do not coordinate on appointing special counsels, and a federal grand jury sitting in the DC District Court approved the indictment against Trump.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Trump said he would fire Smith if elected.\n\n“Oh, it’s so easy. It’s so easy,” Trump said when asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would “pardon yourself” or “fire Jack Smith.”\n\n“I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump said.\n\nIn addition to the political bent, the filing also aims for higher courts than Chutkan to consider the legality of Smith’s prosecutions.\n\nTrump’s team is making some of the same arguments on the record that were successful in his bid to overturn the Florida classified documents case earlier this year, though the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which sits above Chutkan, has already found special counsel’s offices to be constitutional.\n\nThe precedent Chutkan must follow allows for special counsel’s offices to investigate and prosecute federal cases for the Justice Department. Chutkan has already indicated she is primed to uphold the constitutionality of the special counsel’s office in her court.\n\nThursday’s filing allows Trump to push the issue forward later, following Chutkan’s ruling, possibly to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon ruled, in the case about mishandling classified documents, that Smith’s team is unconstitutional, relying in part upon a recent dissent written by Justice Clarence Thomas. The Justice Department is appealing that ruling to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Cannon’s ruling and how the 11th Circuit handles the case is not binding on cases in the DC Circuit.\n\nTrump’s lawyers also say that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals’ previous reasoning around special counsels shouldn’t apply to the former president’s case.\n\nThey argue both Smith’s appointment, which came from Garland and didn’t receive congressional approval, is invalid, as is how his office is funded, because it was not specifically authorized by Congress. Trump’s lawyers also ask the judge to tell Smith immediately to stop spending public funds on his office.\n\n“Notwithstanding Judge Cannon’s findings, the Special Counsel’s Office has continued to pursue and spend money on this case, and the Office is directly pursuing the appeal of Judge Cannon’s ruling rather than the Department of Justice. These actions are ultra vires, and funded from a source of money that Smith and the Office should not be permitted to access,” the filing says.\n\nTrump’s filing to Chutkan on Thursday is one of several arguments he is making to attempt to dismiss his conspiracy and obstruction charges related to his actions up to and on January 6, 2021.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Fentanyl from China is also directly shipped to the United States in small packages.\n\n“The DEA confirmed Chinese TCO leaders hold government positions in the CCP and indicated that Chinese TCOs are dedicated to the CCP,” the Oversight Committee report said.\n\nHowever, the committee added that the DEA’s effort “can only be so successful” without a cross-government consensus and cohesive approach to “CCP unrestricted warfare and its relationship with Chinese TCOs.”\n\nUnrestricted warfare, a term coined by two Chinese colonels in 1999, describes confrontations by any lethal or non-lethal means including and not limited to terrorism, economic coercion, misinformation, and propaganda.\n\nCharacterizing the Chinese regime, the report called it “a totalitarian force that enslaves its own people; surveils and harasses critics of the Party and people of Chinese descent around the world; poisons tens of thousands of Americans every year with fentanyl; and actively seeks to destroy America.”\n\nThe regime “seeks the downfall of the United States because the CCP views the American way of life as a threat” to its authoritarian reign, the report said.\n\nAccording to Comer, there is a growing bipartisan consensus on this view.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump identified China as a “strategic competitor,” and the Biden administration said in 2022 that the Chinese regime “harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order” for its own benefit.\n\nWhile differences remain in the two parties’ approaches such as how much the United States should separate its economy from China, and the rhetoric about China and the CCP, they largely agree on controlling strategic goods and technologies, investing in innovation, re-shoring supply chains, and combating Beijing’s unfair trade practices.\n\nIn its report, the Oversight Committee said the United States is facing “a new cold war,” and is in a more vulnerable situation than it was during the last cold war against the Soviet Union.\n\n“Unlike the first Cold War, the adversary is already within, having entrenched itself within U.S. borders, institutions, businesses, universities, and cultural centers by capturing elites in influential circles,” the report reads.\n\nThe committee said more candid discussion about the CCP’s infiltration operations can “turn the tide in America’s favor.”\n\nIt’s one of four components crucial for a successful government-wide strategy to tackle the CCP’s political warfare, the committee said.\n\nThe other components include replacing country-agnostic measures with a targeted approach, deepening the knowledge required to win against unrestricted warfare, and engaging the American people about the CCP threat and providing resources when appropriate that thwart CCP ambitions.\n\nThe Chinese embassy didn’t respond to The Epoch Times’ request for comment by publishing time.","summary":"The House committee called for a whole-of-government strategy more targeted measures, and more discussion about the CCP's nature and its unrestricted warfare.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/us-federal-agencies-failing-to-deter-ccp-political-warfare-says-house-report-5747275","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/03/id5661967-06032024-DSC02840-James-Comer-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:37:01","author":"Lily Zhou","authors":["Lily Zhou"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":261004432,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Says Trump ‘Running to Be an American Tyrant,’ Performs at Harris Rally","text":"Bruce Springsteen is making things clear: He’s voting for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Kamala Harris stated that Americans want a president who leads the country with optimism and takes on the challenges they face. She accused Donald Trump of taking away fundamental freedom of people. Asked about her views on the gender gap issue in polls and why she thinks that she has more support among women than Trump, Harris responded, “I have to be honest with you, it’s not what I see in terms of my rallies, in terms of the interactions I’m having with people in communities and on the ground. What I am seeing is in equal measure, men and women talking about their concerns about the future of our democracy; talking about the fact that they want a president who leads with optimism and takes on the challenges that we face, whether it be grocery prices or investing in small businesses or homeownership.”She further said, “So, I’m not actually seeing that kind of disparity, and I intend to be a president for all Americans. And that includes paying attention, yes, to a fundamental freedom that has been taken away because of Donald Trump — the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body — and, in equal measure, to prioritize the economic needs of individuals and families in America and what we also must do in terms of upholding our strength and standing on the global stage.”She also spoke on the border issue and termed putting the resources into ensuring that US border is secure her “highest priority”. Harris pledged that, if elected, she will bring the bipartisan border security bill and sign it into law. When asked whether construction of a southern border wall will continue in her administration, Harris stated, “I will tell you that my highest priority is to put the resources into ensuring that our border is secure, which is why I’ve been very clear: I’m going to bring back up, as president, that bipartisan border security bill and make sure that it is brought to my desk so I can sign it into law.”She further said, “The biggest issue that we have right now is that Donald Trump has stood in the way of what would have been a proven part of the solution to the bigger problem, which is that we have a broken immigration system in America, and we need to fix it. And we have the tools at hand, but we have on the other side of this election, Donald Trump, who would prefer to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.I intend to fix the problem in a way that is just about practical solutions that are within our arms reach if we have the commitment to do it.”Kamala Harris will campaign with former US President Barack Obama for the first time in Georgia at a star-studded rally near Atlanta on Thursday (local time), ABC News reported.Bruce Springsteen, whose music has peppered many presidential candidates’ of Democratic Party will perform at the get-out-the-vote concert, according to ABC News report. Harris is set to appear with former US first lady Michelle Obama in Michigan on Saturday, according to the campaign officials, the report said. Barack Obama and Michelle Obama endorsed Harris in July and both made remarks at the Democratic National Convention in August.When asked about getting support from Obama and Bruce Springsteen while speaking to reporters in Philadelphia on Thursday, Harris said she is “honored” to have them at her campaign events.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/intend-to-be-president-for-all-americans-us-vice-president-kamala-harris/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/intend-to-be-president-for-all-americans-us-vice-president-kamala-harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:33:31","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":261004428,"title":"Kamala Harris: Barack Obama, Bruce Springsteen, Spike Lee and Samuel L Jackson rally in Georgia","text":"The Harris campaign is pulling out all the stops to secure votes in the final weeks of the race to the White House.\n\nThousands of people have gathered to hear Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris in the battleground state of Georgia for a star-studded rally with rock legend Bruce Springsteen and former President Barack Obama.\n\nAhead of Ms Harris’ remarks on Thursday, film director Spike Lee warned a packed crowd at the James R Hallford Stadium not to be “bamboozled” into voting for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nSpringsteen performed melancholy laments The Promised Land, and Land Of Hope And Dreams.\n\n“Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be American,” Springsteen said, as he encouraged the crowd to vote for Ms Harris.\n\nAbout 20,000 people were attending, her campaign said, which would make it her largest political rally yet, besting the 17,000 Harris drew in Greensboro, North Carolina in early September.\n\nBarack Obama explains what this election is about\n\nMr Obama took to the stage, warning Americans there is “no evidence that this man (Mr Trump) thinks about anyone but himself”.\n\n“Donald Trump is a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down that golden escalator 9 years ago,” he said.\n\nMr Obama spent a considerable amount of time talking down Mr Trump, warning Americans not to allow him to hold power again. before giving a stirring introduction to Ms Harris.\n\n“Real strength is about working hard and taking responsibility and telling the truth even when it’s inconvenient,” Mr Obama said.\n\n“Real strength about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves.\n\n“That’s what we should want in our daughters and our sons.

He’s such a guy.’\n\nHe then refocused on his opponent. \n\n‘She was the border Czar and she never made one phone call,’ Trump claimed, insinuating the vice president did not do a thing to mitigate the historic flow of migrants that have crossed into the U.S. over the past 3.5 years. \n\n‘No person who is responsible so much bloodshed and death on our soil can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States.’ \n\nHarris, on the other hand, claims she’s been working on the border, and says Trump does not have any intentions of fixing it.. \n\n ‘I reject the false choice that suggests we must choose either between securing our border and creating a system that is orderly, safe and humane,’ Harris said during a recent trip to the border in Douglas, Arizona at the end of September. ‘We can and we must do both.’\n\nTrump, she said, ‘prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,’\n\n‘And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games and their personal political future.’ \n\nHowever, data complied by the Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee reveals that between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2024, there were over 10.8 million migrant encounters. \n\nUnder Trump, between the fiscal years of 2017 and 2020 there were just three million migrant encounters. \n\nImmigration has repeatedly ranked as a top issue for voters in this cycle and the ex-president focused on the topic throughout his address.\n\nIn Arizona, border security and immigration has been found to be the single most important issues among voters there, a Center for the Future of Arizona report found.\n\nAnd recently the former president has seen more favorable polling in the southwestern state. \n\nThe RealClearPolitics national presidential polling average currently shows Trump with a small 1.5 point lead ahead of the Democrat. \n\nStill, many of these surveys are so close they are within the margin of error, meaning the race is a dead heat. \n\nHaving visited the southwestern state nearly every other week since August, Arizona has become a common stomping ground for the Trump campaign in the final weeks before the election. \n\nHarris has similarly made several stops there as the election is winding towards its culmination.","summary":"Donald Trump hammered Kamala Harris for her border security and immigration plans&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/trump-claims-kamala-harris-has-made-the-u-s-a-mess-with-border-policies/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Trump-says-Kamala-Harris-has-turned-the-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:28:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":261003898,"title":"Kamala Harris Breaks Her Own Crowd Size Record in Georgia","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris held her best-attended political rally ever alongside former President Barack Obama in Georgia on Thursday.Around 20,000 people attended a packed rally for the vice president at James R. Hallford Stadium in Clarkston, according to a Reuter's report citing the Harris campaign. The second largest political rally for Harris was attended by approximately 17,000 supporters in Greensboro, North Carolina, early last month.The seated capacity of Thursday's rally venue, which often hosts outdoor high school sporting events, is listed at 15,600. However, images and videos of the Harris rally shared online appear to show some of the boisterous crowd standing on the field, making the campaign's attendance numbers feasible.In addition to Obama, Bruce Springsteen was featured at the rally and performed briefly before the former president and the vice president took the stage. Clarkston is located in DeKalb County, which is one of the most Democratic-leaning counties in Georgia, with over 83 percent of voters having backed President Joe Biden in 2020.Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for the campaign of former President Donald Trump, said in an email to Newsweek that Harris had to \"play second fiddle\" to Springsteen to bolster her crowd size.\"Kamala Harris had to drag out and play second fiddle to Bruce Springsteen to help bolster her crowd size,\" Cheung wrote. \"Meanwhile President Trump is the star of the show and has commanded over 100,000 people at his rallies.\"While Trump is often seemingly fixated on rally crowd size, there is no evidence to support repeated claims by the former president that his rallies have been attended by 100,000 or more supporters.Earlier on Thursday, former Trump headlined a rally in front of a smaller but enthusiastic crowd in Tempe, Arizona. The event at the 5,000-seat indoor Mullett Arena appeared to be at or near capacity in images shared on social media.Trump's Deputy Director of Communications Margo Martin posted a video to X that showed a cheerful crowd as the former president took the stage, while some supporters of the former president touted the crowd size in other posts.\"THOUSANDS of AZ patriots lined up to see Trump in TEMPE!\" wrote Turning Point Action's Jacob Chacon. \"This is on Arizona State's campus, in one of the strongest Democrat strongholds in the state. Game changing.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to the Harris campaign via email on Thursday night.The candidates appear to be destined for a close race in at least seven swing states that could potentially determine the election's winner, including Arizona and Georgia. Recent polls of Arizona and Georgia have largely shown Trump holding small leads over Harris, although Harris has been leading in some surveys.Averages of recent polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight showed Trump up by 1.7 percentage points in Arizona and 1.5 points in Georgia as of Thursday evening. While Trump's advantages were small, they represented the biggest current leads for either candidate in any of the battleground states.","summary":"Around 20,000 supporters of the vice president reportedly attended a rally in Clarkston, Georgia on Thursday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-breaks-crowd-size-record-georgia-1974695","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2503977/harris-rally-crowd-breaks-record-georgia-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:28:25","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":261005516,"title":"EPHRAIM HARDCASTLE: Would Prince Andrew be able to resume his career as a helicopter pilot if he applied for a job advertised by Charles?","text":"Would Prince Andrew have been able to resume his career as a helicopter pilot if he'd applied for the vacancy currently being advertised by his brother, the King? \n\nHighly unlikely as the Palace's HR vets all candidates, stating: 'We will contact your professional, and sometimes personal, referees.

He said he voted for neither major candidate in 2016.\n\nThe 68-year-old actor called Bill Clinton a ‘low-level opportunist’ in the 1990s and was vocal against George W.

I’m feeling good. I’m sober, all of that kind of stuff, and for me it’s a dim thing in the past.

I find this utterly disgusting! These are two of the finest members of the AZ Legislature who serve our District 1 extremely well! I will NOT be voting for Mr. Finchem on November 5th.\n\nWHO’S MAKING NEWS\n\nKen Bennett is a senior member of the RINO, John McCain establishment.\n\nThe benefits of membership Bennett enjoys as a member of the McCain mafia include total familial impunity for sodomizing underage boys, (More on that below.) among others.\n\nKen Bennett has long been viewed by the McCain Mafia as a golden boy in Arizona.\n\nBennett’s bona fides include voting against legislation to protect children from transgenderism in their public schools.\n\nBennett also voted against legislation that would bar satanic displays from public property.\n\nAnd Bennett has a long track record of sabotaging election integrity in Arizona.\n\nSOUR GRAPES COULD COST REPUBLICANS THE SENATE MAJORITY \n\nMark Finchem is the man who ousted Ken Bennett. Finchem, one of Arizona’s staunchest America First patriots, won the 2022 Republican primary for Secretary of State in a landslide, in particular besting RINO Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who didn’t believe there was fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhen reached for comment on Bennett’s claims, Republican nominee Mark Finchem said, “I don’t typically respond to untruths like the claim Mr. Bennett has made. I am shocked at his display of bitterness. In effect, he is showing a willingness to turn over the Arizona Senate to Democrat control because he lost the primary with his irresponsible post.”\n\nConservative leader and Arizona’s National Committeeman Jake Hoffman has worked against the McCain wing of the party his entire career.\n\nWhen reached for comment on Bennett’s Democrat coddling duplicity, Hoffman didn’t mince words.\n\n“With a track record of fighting against election integrity, advocating for tax increases while his own constituents suffer from skyrocketing inflation, and playing footsie with radical Marxists like Katie Hobbs and Adrian Fontes while they are actively at work destroying our state — Ken Bennett is a political fossil of decades gone by that fails to possess even a basic understanding of what time it is in the current battle between good and evil. Thankfully the people are waking up to the clear and present danger posed by uniparty career politicians like him, which is why he was destroyed by more than 15 points in his recent primary.”\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nAll eleven of the state’s electoral college votes went to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election after Biden managed to slide by Donald Trump by a mere 10,457 votes out of more than 3.33 million total votes — a slim margin of only 0.3%.\n\nArizona is a key swing state for both parties’ presidential nominees, with eleven electoral college votes.\n\nSo the idea that Senator Bennett would openly work against a nominee in his own party during a contentious general election cycle would seemingly disqualify him from future participation in the\n\nBENNETT WORKED AGAINST THE ARIZONA AUDITS\n\nKen Bennett isn’t just a RINO, McCain Mafia member — he’s the primary reason audits were never able to get off the ground in Arizona.\n\nDuring the first phase of the audit, Bennett and Fann set themselves up as the director and contact point for the audit.\n\nAny time developments arose, Bennett would make a dash to any and all media as the forensic audit began.\n\n“Bennett is really a liberal wrapped in Republican cloth pretending to defend the conservative principles of a Barry Goldwater, John Rhodes, a Sam Steiger and a host of others that made Arizona nationally known for its conservative ways,” one prominent conservative told National File.\n\n“Bennett loves to brag at public gatherings how he crosses the political aisle to help Democrats feel so included and to maintain the status quo,” the source said.\n\nARIZONA IS GROUND ZERO FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nBoth Arizona and Georgia have become ground zero in the battle for election integrity in the wake of the badly run 2020 presidential election.\n\nThat’s because Biden won Arizona and Georgia by about eleven thousand votes out of millions cast — razor thin margins — resulting in 25 electoral votes for the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nBy contrast, the other swing states Biden were not nearly as competitive. In Michigan, Biden won by a margin of 155 thousand votes. In Wisconsin, Biden won by over 20k votes — nearly one full percentage point ahead of Trump. In Pennsylvania, Biden-Harris ticket won by more than 80 thousand votes. And in Nevada Biden won by over 33,500 votes — a wide margin.\n\nAdding Helene-ravaged North Carolina to the mix, where Biden only lost by 74,481 votes, Trump’s electoral math gets more difficult.\n\nBennett has a long record of voting with Democrats. \n\nWhen conservatives introduced H.B. 2481, a transparency bill that would require public comment before public bodies, Bennett joined Democrats, and voted against transparency.\n\nWhen Republicans introduced a ballot initiative HCR 2018 to prohibit municipalities from imposing mileage-based taxes and fees on owners of vehicles, Bennett joined Democrats and voted against stopping mileage based taxes.\n\nBennett also joined Democrats and voted against SB 1010 which would have banned the tracking of an individual’s miles traveled for the purposes of imposing taxes and fees.\n\nWhen Republicans introduced ballot initiative HCR 2032 to eliminate early voting by mail in Arizona, and to raise the bar to qualify for absentee ballot voting, Bennett joined Democrats by abstaining from voting in his elections committee, effectively voting to keep expanded early and absentee ballot voting.\n\nWhen Republicans introduced SB 1148 to provide an individual income tax rebate for elderly Arizonans older than age 65, Bennett joined Democrats in voting against the rebate.\n\nAnd when Republicans introduced a ballot initiative SCR 1013 to statutorily prohibit school district employees from referring to a student as anything other than pronouns consistent with the person’s biological assigned sex at birth without parental consent, Bennett once again joined Democrats and voted to allow adults to mis-gender minor children without parental consent.\n\nBennett’s protector, former state senator Karen Fann, helped to install Bennett as the liaison during the infamous audits, elevating someone who opposed Donald Trump to a position of power in a crucial swing state.\n\nFann has receded to relative obscurity since the audit controversy in Arizona.\n\nBENNETT WORKING AGAINST OTHER REPUBLICANS\n\nBennett has been known to buck the Republican party and cast decisive votes against conservative-backed bills in the narrowly divided Arizona Legislature.\n\nBAD ON IMMIGRATION\n\nBennett also refused to vote for a proposed ballot measure to make illegal immigration a state crime.\n\nHouse Concurrent Resolution 2060 would have made it a state crime to cross the Arizona-Mexico border outside of official ports of entry. That would allow local law enforcement to make arrests and local judges to order those convicted to leave the country.\n\nBennett said he doesn’t want Arizona state law to be applied to Barack Obama’s so-called ‘Dreamers.’\n\nAs Chairman of the Education Committee, Bennett regularly passed liberal legislation and denied conservative initiatives.\n\nThe Republican Party in Arizona has performed very poorly under his leadership. That’s largely due to Bennett’s facilitation of the infiltration of the McCain cabal and other RINOs and socialists masquerading as Republicans.\n\nBennett has also allocated $2 MILLION to Democrat Secretary of State Adrian Fontes’s office.\n\nHORSE TRADING TO GET IN GOOD WITH DEMOCRATS\n\nMultiple sources confirm to National File that Bennett is lobbying Sec. State Adrian Fontes and current Governor Katie Hobbes — both Democrats — in hopes of attaining a higher office.\n\nIndications point to idea that Bennett could go back in as Arizona’s Secretary of State or even that he could be named as Lt. Governor in the next gubernatorial cycle in 2026.\n\nDespite being installed by Fann as the Senator in charge of Arizona’s election audit at the Phoenix Convention Center, the public record shows that Bennett worked hard against Arizona Republicans in search of free, fair elections.\n\nNational File has spoken with a half-dozen Arizona state legislators about Bennett, and the consensus is that Bennett is lobbying Democrat statewide office holders Adrian Fontes, the Secretary of State, and former Secretary of State, no Governor Katie Hobbes.\n\nOur sources unanimously point to idea that Bennett could go back into office as either Secretary of State or he could be named as Lt. Gov in what would be pitched as a “unity” government.\n\nREAD: GOP State Senator Ken Bennett Sabotages Election Integrity in Arizona\n\nKEN BENNETT’S SON SODOMIZED 18 YOUNG BOYS\n\nKen Bennett’s adult son Clifton Bennett, then an 18-year-old, was charged with 18 counts of aggravated assault and 18 counts of kidnapping.\n\nBennett confessed that he and another teen sodomized several 11-to-14-year-old boys with broomsticks and flashlights in 40 separate incidents.\n\nBennett also caught an assault charge for choking three boys until they passed out.\n\nUnbelievably, Bennett’s prosecutor told the judge that the “broomsticking” was a “hazing ritual” and a punishment for breaking rules, and that the anal rape did not sexual assault.\n\nThe assaults were not viewed as sexual in nature, contended the prosecutor, because the prosecution could not prove that the perpetrators had “sexual intent.”\n\nREAD: Senate president’s son sodomizes 18 boys, is not charged with sexual assault\n\nWhether Bennett will be censured by the Arizona GOP remains to be seen.\n\nNational File will keep update this story as further developments emerge.","summary":"Last Updated on October 24, 2024 A long time McCain lackey and&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/former-arizona-state-senator-ken-bennett-attempts-to-switch-control-of-arizona-senate-to-democrats/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-ARIZONA-Outgoing-State-Senator-Ken-Bennett-Tries-800x430.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:16:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":261003406,"title":"G20 vows to resist protectionism ahead of U.S. presidential election","text":"Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 major economies pledged Thursday to resist protectionism, just days ahead of the U.S. presidential election, amid the stabilization of global growth despite increased geopolitical risks.\n\nFollowing a two-day meeting in Washington, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the leading developed and emerging economies said they see \"good prospects\" for a soft landing of the global economy, citing positive developments such as inflation declining from elevated levels in many parts of the world.\n\nHowever, they also warned of many challenges ahead, including wars, rising commodity prices and climate change.

Every time I come up and talk about what they’ve done to our country, I get angrier, and it’s the first time I’ve ever said ‘garbage can,’ but it’s a very accurate description.”\n\nDenigrating the U.S. or claiming the country is past its prime has long been part of Trump’s stump speech — his slogan is Make America Great Again, after all — and that has continued during this campaign, with the Republican calling America a “nation in decline” and a “third-world hellhole” run by “perverts” and “thugs.”\n\nThe former president has reserved particular venom for immigrants, however.\n\nDuring the 2024 race, he has described immigration to the U.S. as “an invasion of our country” leading the “plunder, rape, and slaughter of our American suburbs and cities,” even though there’s no documented relationship between increased migration and crime, and studies suggest immigrants are actually less likely than those born in the US to break the law.\n\nTrump has claimed that immigrants are bringing disease and “destroying the blood of our country” and vowed to deport millions of people in a mass expulsion event he suggested will be a “bloody story.” He’s falsely linked migrants to fentanyl coming into the US, even though the majority of those caught with and prosecuted for trafficking fentanyl across the border are US citizens.\n\nBoth he and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, helped spread a baseless conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets, a stance that was praised by local neo-Nazis but disavowed by local officials, who said there was no evidence behind the claims. \n\nTrump’s wider politics — which often combine dehumanizing insults towards his enemies, threats of using military force on critics, and attacks on non-white immigrants — match the definition of fascism, his former chief of staff John Kelly claimed recently, amid a wider controversy that Trump reportedly praised Hitler and his generals while in the White House. The former president denies praising Hitler and has said Kelly is lying.\n\nDespite the difference in tone, the Harris campaign has touted the vice president’s support for a scuttled bipartisan border bill that matched many Republican priorities on immigration, including surging agents to the border and restricting access to the legally protected right to claim asylum. \n\nAccording to a recent poll for The Independent, most Hispanic voters believe there is a border crisis, and the Harris campaign has a substantial advantage with this constituency.","summary":"Remarks come as Republican candidate faces fresh controversy for allegedly praising Hitler","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-us-immigration-slur-fascism-garbage-b2635333.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/25/00/GettyImages-2179949563.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hNlEt0D1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-25 00:16:04","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.124},{"id":261003776,"title":"Why southern border towns are frustrated by the immigration debate","text":"The U.S.-Mexico border as described on the campaign trail or seen on the news can easily create a picture of all border towns as lawless and chaotic. But the reality is more nuanced, as a CBS News crew learned during a 1,600-mile trip from McAllen, Texas, to the California coast.Laredo, Texas, was ranked as one of the safest cities in the state, according to analysis from the CBS News data team. Mayor Victor Trevino said his city is not the Wild West he often sees depicted. \"The cartels, there's crime and this and that, which is not true,\" Trevino told CBS News. He points to a different kind of surge, in which $320 billion in microchips, produce and General Motors and Tesla car parts come by train and truck annually through the Port of Laredo, America's busiest port of entry.About 500 miles west, in Presidio, Texas, restaurant owner Hector Armendariz sees people leaving Presidio for better paying jobs, including his three children. \"They've left and they don't come back,\" Armendariz said. \"All our kids leave and they don't come back.\" Presidio Mayor John Ferguson says the local economy relies on hundreds of Mexican citizens who legally cross the border every day to work in restaurants or oil fields. Ferguson believes Presidio would be in \"serious trouble\" if it was harder for Mexican residents to come across the border to work. \"Like, you know, the pandemic, where you didn't have enough workers and things would slow down and...certain sectors might kind of dry up,\" Ferguson said. Philip Skinner, mayor of Columbus, New Mexico, says that without border trade, many border towns would shrink, and that would come with unexpected consequences. For example, Skinner explains, there are no dentists in Columbus, but there are about 10 dentists just across the border in Puerto Palomas, Mexico. Columbus residents who need dental work will travel to Mexico, Skinner said. Arizona borders Mexico for more than 350 miles and it is a drug smuggling hotspot. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in the 2024 fiscal year, 66% of the fentanyl seized on the U.S.-Mexico border happened in the Tucson sector, which covers all the border ports in Arizona. Donald Huish, mayor of Douglas, Arizona, was in favor of the bipartisan Senate border bill that has been front and center of the presidential campaign. The bill died after criticism from former President Donald Trump.\"It would help us, because we would've had more Border Patrol agents,\" Huish said. \"...I can understand why people didn't like the entire bill, but why stop talking about it?\"Frustration is everywhere along the border, including for Mark Dannels, sheriff of Arizona's Cochise County, who struggles with the influx of drug mules and human smugglers. Dannels says he isn't necessarily optimistic or pessimistic about Cochise's future, just uncertain. \"It's more of an unknown because politics and the country is so divided right now,\" Dannels said.","summary":"Presidio, Texas, relies on hundreds of Mexican citizens who legally cross the border daily to work in restaurants or oil fields.

And we must learn from that history so that it is never repeated.”\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the expected apology.\n\nIn 2021, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary, commissioned the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative to review the impact of the federal boarding school policies. The department issued a final report this summer confirming at least 973 Native American children died while attending these federal boarding schools. The review found at least 74 marked and unmarked burial sites at 65 different schools.\n\nAt least 18,000 children were taken from their families and forced to attend more than 400 Indian boarding schools across 37 states or then-territories between 1819 and 1969.\n\n“The federal government – facilitated by the Department I lead – took deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections that are foundational to Native people,” Haaland said at the time. “These policies caused enduring trauma for Indigenous communities that the Biden-Harris administration is working tirelessly to repair.”\n\nOne of the report recommendations called for the US government to formally acknowledge its role in the boarding schools and “accompany this acknowledgment with a formal apology to the individuals, families, and Indian Tribes that were harmed by U.S. policy.” It did not specify who should make the apology.\n\nGila River Indian Community Governor Stephen Lewis told CNN the era of the Indian boarding schools is “an incredibly painful time that is still living with us in a very real way with the generational trauma coming out of that period.”\n\n“This is going to be just so significant to our boarding school survivors and the families,” Lewis said. “My hope is that by shining a light on this sad history, redeeming this through this apology, acknowledging that this in fact happened, that it will be documented in history moving forward and the hopes that this type of very painful, very traumatic history doesn’t happen again.”\n\nHaaland, Lewis and several other tribal leaders, including Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle, Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation Chairman Rodney Butler and Menominee Indian Tribe Chairwoman Gena Kakkak, joined the president aboard Air Force One to Phoenix on Thursday.\n\nThe announcement comes as the president is looking to burnish his legacy in his final months in office. Ahead of the visit, the White House has highlighted the Biden administration’s investments in the Native American community, including nearly $46 million doled out through the American Rescue Plan, bipartisan infrastructure law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, including initiatives to build roads, provide clean water, mitigate drought issues and expand access to high-speed internet in the communities.\n\nThe president has also moved to strengthen tribal sovereignty, restored or designated sacred tribal lands as national monuments, and taken steps to address violence against indigenous Americans. First lady Dr. Jill Biden has also been a frequent emissary to Native Americans, visiting 10 Native communities over the last four years.\n\nThe efforts to highlight the administration’s work with tribal communities is taking place less than two weeks before Election Day as Biden also looks to boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign. The Native American community makes up a small slice of the electorate in Arizona, but it could prove pivotal in the battleground states, where Biden beat former President Donald Trump by roughly 10,000 votes in 2020.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

D’Esposito won’t back renewing Trump tax cuts without one key tweak","text":"Freshman Rep. Anthony D’Esposito said he would oppose renewing the Trump tax cuts that expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress restores the state and local tax deduction to heavily burdened Long Island homeowners.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress in 2017 imposed a $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction, a blow to homeowners in the New York City suburbs who can pay $20,000 to $30,000 in property taxes.\n\n“If there is no SALT, we’re not supporting it,” D’Esposito said during a Post editorial board meeting Thursday.\n\n“There’s a lot of conversation that has to go into that.”\n\nD’Esposito is facing off against Democrat Laura Gillen in a tight rematch in the 4th Congressional District that runs from Long Island’s south shore through central Nassau County.\n\nThe SALT deduction is a burning issue in the district, with many Long Island homeowners paying steep property taxes as well as state income taxes and other levies well above the cap.\n\nHe has also backed a proposal which aims to eliminate the so-called “marriage penalty” for joint filers making under $500,000.\n\nThe GOP congressman said he will buck his party to fight for his constituents.\n\n“I don’t always listen to my party. We have been the biggest, loudest mouths against his [Trump’s] tax policies,” D’Esposito said.\n\nHe said the good news is that Trump, in a about face, last month pledged to lift the cap or fully restore the SALT deduction if re-elected to the White House.\n\nTrump had approved the law curbing the deduction as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \n\nThe program also slashed income taxes that benefitted many New York residents and cut corporate taxes from 28% to 21%.\n\nD’Esposito is part of the House bipartisan SALT caucus pushing to restore the deduction. \n\nHe said lawmakers will have to find offsetting cuts or savings to make up for the loss of revenue to restore SALT.\n\n“The only presidential nominee who is having any conversation about SALT is Donald Trump,” the retired NYPD cop said.\n\n“If there’s any effort to restore SALT, it will come from Republicans. The fact that President Trump has heard the cries from us and members of the New York delegation speaks volumes.”\n\nHe said he voted against the House Republican tax-cutting package earlier because it didn’t restore the SALT deduction.\n\nD’Esposito said New York House members will have “great leverage” in the next Congress because it’s likely that Republicans or Democrats will govern with a thin majority — meaning every vote could be crucial in passing legislation.\n\nGillen, asked about D’Esposito’s comments on the SALT deduction, said he failed to deliver during his two-year term.\n\n“Anthony D’Esposito has been in the majority in Congress for two years and hasn’t delivered on SALT. He is counting on voters having some kind of collective amnesia to forget that he’s failed and that Trump is the one who imposed this punitive tax policy,” Gillen said.\n\n“In Congress, I’ll stand up to ensure our SALT deduction is returned,” she said..\n\nCritics have complained that the SALT deduction had rewarded high tax, big spending Democratic-run states with affluent homeowners. \n\nD’Espito said Thursday it has been a bruising, negative re-election campaign, with millions of dollars in Gillen and Democratic campaign ads bludgeoning him over abortion rights and even his record as a police officer.\n\nWhile pro-life, D’Esposito said he opposes a federal ban on abortion.\n\nHe also said he’s the stronger candidate who will promote pro-growth economic policies to tackle inflation, tighten border security, support Israel and combat anti-semitism amid an increase in Jew hatred.\n\nThe district includes a significant pro-Israel Jewish population.\n\nHe blasted Gillen as not worthy of the congressional seat.\n\n“Every single one of her ads are negative. She doesn’t have a vision for the future,” he said of the former Hempstead town supervisor.\n\n“The term `lying Laura’ wasn’t made by me. She is the epitome of a gaslighter.”\n\nD’Esposito was asked a recent report about his relationship Devin Fass, who he allegedly had an affair with at the same time he paid her to work part time in his Garden City congressional office.\n\nThe congressman again maintained he didn’t violate House ethics rules by employing Fass or others.","summary":"Freshman Republican Rep.

Here’s what to know.","text":"As early voting opened in Texas on Oct. 21, viral claims spread online alleging that ballot machines in Tarrant County — home of Fort Worth and one of the most populous counties in the state — were “switching” votes.\n\nBut election officials refuted the claims, attributing the issue to human error that was corrected and confirming there was no evidence of machines altering votes. Similar false claims about voting machines have surfaced in Tennessee and Georgia, with election officials in each state attributing errors to voters, not machine tampering.\n\nElection security experts told CBS News that unfounded claims of machines flipping votes have circulated for years, and while voting machines have potential vulnerabilities, there is no evidence of machines being hacked or programmed to alter ballots. \n\nElection officials dispute viral claims\n\nClaims about votes being “switched” or “flipped” have been around since at least 2004 and have been leveled by both Democrats and Republicans, according to David Becker, a CBS News election law contributor and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.\n\nBecker said that human error is the cause of “every single” vote switching claim he’s encountered, yet these isolated incidents are often cited as proof to falsely claim widespread fraud. \n\nIn Tarrant County, officials said that one out of 58,000 ballots cast on the first day of early voting was misprinted due to voter error. The claims gained attention online after a viral video showed a man insisting the machine switched his vote. \n\nState officials in Georgia have disputed a similar allegation after Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed that a Dominion machine changed a voter’s ballot in her district. That claim was based on an anonymous viral Facebook post. \n\nThe Whitfield County Board of Elections and the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, as well as Dominion Voting Systems, all indicated the issue was due to voter error and said the issue was resolved while the voter was at the polling place.\n\n“There is a reason we tell people to review their ballots. Humans make mistakes,” said Gabriel Sterling, COO of the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, in a post on X.\n\nIn Tennessee, Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson alleged that votes for Democratic candidates switched to votes for Republicans. However, the Shelby County Election Commission said no voting irregularities have been found and urged voters to review their ballots carefully before casting them.\n\nElection security and voting machines \n\nIn 2020, false claims about voting machines, including Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, spread widely. The claims, amplified by then-President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates, led the companies to file defamation lawsuits against individuals and media outlets that promoted the claims. \n\nFox News settled their defamation lawsuit in 2023, agreeing to pay Dominion more than $787 million for repeatedly broadcasting false accusations about the company. \n\nIn 2024, some of Trump’s supporters, including X owner Elon Musk, have continued to cast doubt on the integrity of voting machines and called for them to be banned. \n\nVoting machines are tested both before and after votes are cast to ensure they are working properly, said Derek Tisler, counsel in the Brennan Center’s Elections and Government Program. \n\nTisler said one of the most important election security safeguards is a paper record of the vote. Implementing a paper record has been a priority for states since 2016, he said, and around 98% of votes cast in the 2024 election will have a paper trail.\n\n“Election officials will review a sample of these paper records after the election to confirm voting machine tallies,” Tisler said. “And if there is any reason to suspect an issue with voting machines, they can fall back on these paper records to determine an accurate count.” \n\nExperts also acknowledge that voting machines have potential vulnerabilities and, like any technology, should be updated and reviewed for security improvements.\n\nThe “gold standard protection” for Americans are hand-marked paper ballots, according to J. Alex Halderman, an election security expert and professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. Halderman said about 70% of the country votes via hand-marked paper ballots. \n\nTisler said issues like frozen screens or jammed ballot scanners are much more likely to happen than any type of “malicious” interference or hacking. He also said voters can unknowingly make the wrong selections on touch-screens. \n\n“When I accidentally have a typo in a text that I send, I don’t assume immediately that my phone has been hacked, and I would encourage the same sort of patience and understanding with voters,” Tisler said.\n\nExperts said it’s imperative for voters to check their ballots and confirm all selections are correct before casting it. And voters should remember that election officials have a plan in place to deal with issues and ensure your vote is counted.","summary":"As early voting opened in Texas on Oct. 21, viral claims spread online alleging that ballot machines in Tarrant County — home of Fort Worth and one of the most populous counties in the state — were &#8220;switching&#8221; votes.

On Oct. 20, he donned a red “Make America Great Again” hat and attended a town hall event with former President Donald Trump in Lancaster—pledging to cast his first-ever vote for the Republican presidential nominee in this year’s election.\n\nMbami complained about recent comments made by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. “She went on ‘The View’ and said there was nothing that she would change about how Joe Biden ran his [administration],” Mbami said.\n\n“We had four years Donald Trump and four years Joe Biden, where we [can] literally compare and contrast where and when the other person went wrong … showing me that if I don’t like [Biden] now, then I probably won’t like [Harris] in the future.”\n\nMbami is an independent voter in Pennsylvania, a state whose 19 electoral college votes make it the most influential battleground state in the 2024 election. Voters like Mbami matter most to Harris and Trump’s campaigns, because they could determine who wins the election.\n\nNone of the voters in either group spoke of these issues in similar terms, indicating a wide gap in perception between Harris’s and Trump’s coalitions ahead of the election.\n\n“This is not an ‘issue election’ for me. This is [about] freedom. It’s about the Constitution. One side wants to take away freedoms, and the other side does not,” said Mike Reilly, a retired store manager in Erie, who is supporting Harris.\n\n“This is not about policy for me, this election,” he told The Epoch Times at a rally featuring Harris on Oct. 15.\n\n“Decency, honesty, character,” said Collis Allen Jr., a truck driver and U.S. Navy veteran, when asked by The Epoch Times why he supports Harris. “[Trump] refuses to accept the fact that he lost the 2020 election.”\n\n“[Abortion] is huge. I think women are going to decide this election, and we don’t want to go back. We deserve our rights,” said Heather Ulmer, a schoolteacher in Erie backing Harris. “She’s the one that’s going to help us.”\n\nTrump supporters had other ideas.\n\n“The prices have just gone up. The prices for food, gas, electric—the bills. It’s just hard to make it. I just don’t know how people do it in a single family,” said Dana Willis, an industrial worker from Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, who, with her husband Shane Cheshire, attended Trump’s rally in Latrobe on Oct. 19.\n\n“We have two children, and we both work. It’s kind of hard to balance things out,” she said.\n\n“[Trump] wants to save the steel industry. Right now, we’re up for sale. Nippon Steel is looking to buy us. I don’t know. [My] future is unknown,” said Matthew Kantoris, a unionized steelworker for U.S. Steel in Westmoreland County who spoke approvingly of Trump’s proposal for high tariffs on imports.\n\n“If you buy steel from overseas, and it’s going to cost the same with the tariffs than it would be to buy from an American company, [then] a lot of companies would buy American because it’s better quality,” Kantoris said.\n\n“We’ve had four years of Donald Trump and four years of Joe Biden, where we [can] literally compare and contrast where and when the other person went wrong,” Mbami said.\n\n“Today, [you need] $125,000 a year to buy a house. Under Donald Trump, it was $75,000. I want to be a homeowner in life.”\n\nDoris Houseknech, an elderly voter from Hughesville, said border security is the most important issue for her.\n\n“That’s terrible. It’s un-American,” she told The Epoch Times while attending a rally held by Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) in Williamsport on Oct. 16.\n\nThe Epoch Times posed the issues highlighted by Trump supporters to Harris voters, and vice versa, to explore any common perspectives between the two groups. Yet voters responded with diametrically opposite claims about the same issues, suggesting a wide gulf of understanding between them.\n\n“We [should] go back to Bidenomics,” said Gary Grack, a retired union worker in the oil and gas industry, who now runs a business in Erie.\n\n“The stock market, the Dow—everything is booming, and 401(k)s are doing well. My business during COVID suffered a little bit ... but now, I [haven’t] had a glitch. My brother’s a business owner, and his business is booming,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nHe said that concerns about the economy are built upon false perceptions advanced by Trump.\n\n“People in Pennsylvania spend. [They] go to a baseball game, go to a football game ... these places are full. People are spending money. It’s a perception that he’s putting out there,” Grack said of Trump.\n\nRegarding the border, Harris supporters frequently cited Trump’s opposition to a bipartisan border security bill in the Senate in February to claim he lacked genuine concerns about the issue.\n\n“It is my pledge to you that when Congress passes a bill to restore the protections and reproductive freedom nationwide, as President of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law,” Harris told the crowd in Erie. “One in three women live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. Many of these bans have no exceptions for rape and incest.”\n\nTrump has said that his opposition to Roe v. Wade enables states to make independent regulations about the procedure. He also supports exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest, and where the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother.\n\nDespite Harris’s advocacy, many voters who personally support federal abortion rights said they will, nonetheless, vote for Trump.\n\n“I think it’s women’s choice,” said Holly Thomas, an accountant in Williamsport who is supporting Trump. “I'll be honest with you, there [are] multiple factors: it could be health reasons, it could be rape ... [a woman is] trying to make the best decision for [her] family at that time, and I think it should be in the hands of the woman,” she told The Epoch Times at Vance’s Williamsport rally.\n\nHer friend, Nicole Harriman, a fiscal analyst who is also backing Trump, agreed.\n\nPro-abortion voters backing Trump suggests a vulnerability for Harris’s campaign in Pennsylvania, whereby her primary abortion rights message may not be connecting with enough voters in the state. Many voters told The Epoch Times that the issue doesn’t take precedence over the economy and border security.\n\n“I don’t want to say [abortion is] unimportant, but there are bigger issues,” said Mbami. “When you fix the big problems, our economy, the border, and our relationships with other countries in the world ...[abortion] is something that we can fix after we get all of our big issues done.”\n\nAbortion may not affect Pennsylvania voters in the same manner as other battleground states, such as Arizona and North Carolina, which have stricter abortion laws.\n\nRepublicans in Pennsylvania’s Legislature indicate they have no immediate plans to change abortion law in the state, which permits the procedure up to 24 weeks of pregnancy—a limit equivalent to that established by Roe v. Wade.\n\n“For the last 50 years, [our laws] seemed to be okay with the voters of Pennsylvania. I’ve had no one call my office, send me an email, or ask me to put a complete ban on anything. Nor would I,” state Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican, told The Epoch Times at a Trump campaign event featuring Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice in Waynesburg.\n\n“What we have on the books right now, if it’s okay with my constituents, it’s okay with me,” Bartolotta said.\n\n“We have a big uphill climb here ... We need to get people educated to the point where there’s enough public support to get [a restriction] through,” said Pennsylvania state Sen. Cris Dush, a Republican who attended Vance’s Williamsport rally. “It’s going to take some time.”\n\nTime is running out for Harris and Trump to convince more voters to support them. Early voting in Pennsylvania is already underway and will conclude on Oct. 29. The general election, by contrast, is less than two weeks away, on Nov. 5.","summary":"Whether it's abortion, freedoms, or character—Pennsylvania voters are sharply divided on who and why they support their candidate.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/what-dozens-of-interviews-with-voters-in-pennsylvania-reveal-5745388","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/24/id5747371-Pennsylvania-voters-10-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:54:29","author":"Arjun Singh","authors":["Arjun Singh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":261003582,"title":"Report reveals some MAGA fans 'ready to take on a civil war' if Trump loses","text":"Atlantic reporter John Hendrickson set out on one mission during a Gwinnett County, Georgia event sponsored far-right MAGA ally Charlie Kirk earlier this week, by asking attendees one question: \"What do you think will happen if [Donald] Trump loses?\"\n\nHendrickson reports that he \"heard a range of answers,\" including \"promises to accept the outcome,\" and even \"predictions of a new Civil War.\"\n\nOne MAGA fan, Joshua Barnes, told Hendrickson that if Kamala Harris defeats Trump, \"as much as I would hate it, you kind of do have to accept it.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Outrageous abuse of power': Trump withheld aid to Dem and GOP governors who criticized him\n\nAnother attendee named Mark Williams — who says he runs \"the biggest political printing business in\" The Peach State — told The Atlantic reporter me that \"there’s going to be some crazy people that do some crazy s—t; that just happens.

Of 'American Tyrant' Trump","text":"Bruce Springsteen took the stage Thursday at Kamala Harris's star-studded campaign rally in swing state Georgia, with the rock legend warning that White House hopeful Donald Trump aims to be an \"American tyrant.\"Harris is cranking up the celebrity wattage -- including with Beyonce in Texas on Friday, according to reports -- at a series of concerts in battleground states to boost support in the final days of a nail-biting election.Thursday's rally in Atlanta is also Harris's first campaign stop with Barack Obama, the only Black president in American history and who remains widely popular with Democratic voters.But it was Springsteen's gritty commentary at the start that echoed through the packed rally, where the iconic singer said he would \"oppose\" the Republican former president because \"Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant.\"Large numbers of Americans, including about 2.2 million in Georgia, have already cast ballots in early voting, reflecting intense engagement ahead of Election Day on November 5.Springsteen brought his brand of socially conscious, working-class anthems including \"The Promised Land\" to get out the vote and bolster Harris's blue-collar credentials.The vice president herself had raised the stakes further in a CNN appearance late Wednesday when she said she considers 78-year-old Trump to be a \"fascist\" -- as charged in a bombshell interview by the Republican's former chief of staff John Kelly.Trump, the oldest major presidential nominee in US history and the first to be running with a criminal record, is also casting the election as an existential battle for the United States.But it will have profound personal implications too, given he is the subject of serious criminal probes into his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his post-presidential hoarding of top-secret documents.The Republican was campaigning Thursday in the western battleground of Arizona where he conjured dark imagery of migrant violence and warned that America had become \"a dumping ground\" for dangerous and undocumented immigrants.\"We're like a garbage can for the world,\" Trump said.In a radio interview on his way to the rally in Arizona and then another in Nevada -- both swing states -- Trump announced that if elected he'd fire the special prosecutor overseeing his remaining cases in \"seconds.\"Harris, 60, for her part assailed Trump for \"plotting revenge and retribution\" against his political enemies, and took a swipe at his energy levels.\"The sad part about that is he's trying to be president of the United States -- probably the toughest job in the world -- and he's exhausted,\" Harris told reporters.The election remains a toss-up, with the two candidates jostling within the margin of error in polls from all the swing states set to tip the overall national result.US media reported Thursday that Beyonce -- whose hit \"Freedom\" is already the Harris campaign's signature song -- will join the Democrat when she visits Houston on Friday to highlight abortion rights.Obama, 63, has been making his own headlining appearances in support of Harris in a slew of swing states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.The Harris campaign hopes the former president will reverse fears of eroding support among Black voters.Harris, 60, is of mixed Black and South Asian heritage, and is vying to become the country's first female president.Trump was expected to attack Harris's economic policies at a rally in Tempe, Arizona.His campaign said the current vice president had \"made the American Dream of home ownership unreachable for young Americans and families.\"But in his 55-minute address Trump made zero mention of soaring housing costs, opting instead to blame Harris for a \"migrant invasion\" that has overwhelmed American cities.\"No person who is responsible for so much bloodshed and death on our soil can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States,\" he said.Trump then was set to attend a Las Vegas rally aimed at recruiting volunteers and celebrating the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.Like Harris, Trump also heads Friday to Texas, where he is to deliver remarks on border security.","summary":"Bruce Springsteen took the stage Thursday at Kamala Harris's star-studded campaign rally in

And Charlamagne Tha God's Response Is Just Priceless","text":"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God couldn’t control but chuckle at Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, as she recently defended her father-in-law, Donald Trump. During her appearance on Monday’s episode of The Breakfast Club, she discussed the Trump campaign and various related issues. At one moment, Lara confidently stated she never saw him make any racist remarks.\n\nThe topic came up when co-hosts brought up allegations of racism against Donald, pointing to incidents like his stance on the Central Park Five and his unfounded claims about Barack Obama’s citizenship. However, Lara labeled the cases as 'ridiculous.'\n\nAs reported by The Daily Beast, she said, “That‘s ridiculous. I’ve known this man for 16 years.\" She added, \"There was never any proof of anything with the houses; they settled that. There was no admission of anything there.\" But her father-in-law has never retracted his comments about the Central Park Five, even after they were proven innocent. Nonetheless, as reported by Mediaite, she added, \"Donald Trump really was very beneficial to the black community when he was in the White House. I will say I’ve never seen this man say a racist thing.”\n\nThis statement from her elicited laughter from the host off-camera. Lara then stopped speaking and asked in a rather serious tone, “Why is that funny, Charlamagne?” The host replied, “It’s hysterical, because people act like there’s no such thing as Google, or we don’t have TV or we don’t have radio.” The conversation grew tense when Lara asked him to highlight any of Donald's supposed racist comments. In response, the show aired several provocative statements made by the former president over the years. For instance, it included a remark from 2015 in which he claimed that Mexicans crossing the border were 'bringing drugs' and were 'rapists.'\n\nHowever, Lara then claimed that Donald is a man who is loved by many across the nation, noting he has friendships with everybody. She also highlighted his signing of a bipartisan bill that allocated $250 million each year to historically Black colleges and universities. At one point, she argued that labeling him as racist had become a go-to tactic for criticizing Republicans. According to her, as per Donald's goals for the country, he genuinely wanted everyone to succeed, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women.\n\nAt that point, Charlamagne questioned how could she expect minorities to ignore the hurtful things Donald had said about them. To this, Lara responded by strongly emphasizing that the presidential candidate was against illegal immigration, regardless of the individuals involved. She argued that many of her father-in-law's remarks are frequently misconstrued but continued speaking about Donald’s strong opposition to people who enter the nation illegally. Despite the host trying to delve deeper into the allegations against the former president, Lara repeatedly stated that in her opinion the accusations were misunderstood and misrepresented and dismissed them.","summary":"While on &#39;The Breakfast Club,&#39; Lara Trump talked about the Trump campaign and several other related topics.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/lara-trump-says-donald-is-not-racist-and-charlamagne-tha-gods-response-is-just-priceless","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/721334/uploads/6737bd10-90f8-11ef-ab31-05f7f4b6a730_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":261003030,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Blasts Donald Trump at Kamala Harris Rally: He ‘Is Running to Be an American Tyrant’","text":"Bruce Springsteen shared pointed words for Donald Trump during an appearance at Kamala Harris and Barack Obama’s rally in Atlanta today.

But the stock erased its loss for the year and is now up 5 per cent in 2024, compared to the Nasdaq’s 23 per cent gain.\n\nTesla reported earnings per share of US72¢, topping the average analyst estimate of US58¢. Profit was boosted by $US739m in revenue for environmental regulatory credits and $US326m in revenue from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system.\n\nMusk spent much of the earnings call touting what he promises will be Tesla’s autonomous future, including a ride-hailing service that he says will open to the public as early as next year in Texas and California. Two weeks earlier, Tesla held its long-awaited robotaxi event, showcasing the concept of its Cybercab.\n\nHowever, while Alphabet’s Waymo has been operating a commercial driverless service to the public since June, Tesla has consistently missed its own projections for getting a product to market. The company still doesn’t produce or sell cars that are safe to use without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at all times.\n\nAnd while Musk unveiled both a heavy-duty Semi truck and a Roadster refresh in 2017, the Roadster design is still not finalised, and the company is only in “pilot production” with the Semi.\n\nOne topic Musk didn’t address on Wednesday’s call was his campaigning and hefty spending in support of Donald Trump.\n\nSince publicly endorsing Trump shortly after the first assassination attempt on the former president in July, Musk has stepped up his rhetoric, most notably on X, and has contributed tens of millions of dollars to a political action committee that’s supporting the Republican nominee.\n\nMusk has been campaigning in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, which he’s called the “linchpin” in this election. Over the weekend, he said he would randomly award $US1 million a day to registered voters who sign a petition for his pro-Trump PAC in an effort to get his fans in battleground states to the polls.\n\nThe US Department of Justice has warned the PAC that Musk’s voter sweepstakes may violate federal election law, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nAhead of the earnings call, many investors had questions about Musk’s political activities.\n\n“Elon Musk has the right to express his political views, but his public activism seems at odds with his responsibility as CEO to protect shareholder value,” an anonymous retail investor wrote on a forum that Tesla uses to solicit investor questions. “How does Tesla address this, and can it confirm Musk’s actions are not harming sales or growth?”\n\nThe comment had received 168 upvotes prior to the call. Another question, which had received 527 upvotes, asked if Tesla’s board is doing anything to ensure Musk’s “political engagement doesn’t detract from Tesla’s core mission and protects shareholder value and brand integrity.”\n\nIn a post on X earlier this week, Musk wrote, “I think this election is existential to the United States.”","summary":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk, already the world’s richest person, added another $US26 billion ($39.2b) in paper wealth overnight Thursday after his company’s stock had its biggest rally since 2013.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/cnbc/elon-musks-wealth-soars-39b-as-tesla-has-best-day-in-more-than-a-decade--c-16514264","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16514264/c6b66c81c74715da39529caf1807590802621ad3-16x9-x0y157w3000h1688.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:36:28","author":"Lora Kolodny","authors":["Lora Kolodny"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":261002808,"title":"Video purporting to show mail-in ballots being torn up in Bucks County is fake, DA says","text":"A video that is spreading widely on social media, purporting to show a person tearing up mail-in ballots cast for former President Donald Trump and other Republicans in Bucks County, is fake and an attempt to undermine the upcoming election, authorities in that county said Thursday. \n\nThe video was posted on X, formerly Twitter, and shared by multiple conservative-leaning accounts.

remark in motion to dismiss 2020 election interference case ","text":"Donald Trump’s legal team on Thursday cited President Biden’s call for the former president to be locked up in a motion demanding the dismissal of the federal 2020 election interference case. \n\n“The proposed motion establishes that this unjust case was dead on arrival — unconstitutional even before its inception,” Trump attorneys wrote in the filing submitted in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. \n\nThe lawyers argued to Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, that Attorney General Merrick Garland violated the Constitution when he appointed special counsel Jack Smith to oversee multiple federal investigations into Trump. \n\nThe former president’s attorneys also claim that Garland tapped Smith at President Biden’s request “to target” Trump – citing the 81-year-old president’s stunning remark earlier this week in New Hampshire. \n\n“In November 2022, the Attorney General violated the Appointments Clause by naming private-citizen Smith to target President Trump, while President Trump was campaigning to take back the Oval Office from the Attorney General’s boss, without a statutory basis for doing so,” the filing states. \n\n“Garland did so following improper public urging from President Biden to target President Trump, as reported at the time in 2022, and repeated recently by President Biden through his inappropriate instruction to ‘lock him up’ while Smith presses forward with the case unlawfully as the Presidential election rapidly approaches,” it continues. \n\nOn Tuesday, Biden declared, “We gotta lock him up,” in an apparent reference to Trump’s legal woes. \n\nAfter a four-second pause, Biden attempted to walk back the remark. \n\n“Politically, lock him up — lock him out, that’s what we’ve got to do,” he said. \n\nTrump, 78, was convicted in May by a Manhattan jury of 34 criminal counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. \n\nThe 45th president’s sentencing in that case, which was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected Democrat, is scheduled for Nov. 26.\n\nUS District Judge for the Southern District of Florida Aileen Cannon dismissed Smith’s other federal case against Trump in July on the same grounds that Thursday’s motion calls for. \n\nCannon, a Trump-appointee, ruled that the case relating to Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified White House documents could not move forward due to the “unlawful appointment and funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith.” \n\nFederal prosecutors are appealing that ruling. \n\n“Everything that Smith did since Attorney General Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional,” the former president’s lawyers wrote Thursday. \n\n“That includes Smith’s separate violation of the Appropriations Clause by relying on an appropriation that does not apply in order to take more than $20 million from taxpayers — in addition to Smith improperly relying on more than $16 million in additional funds from other unspecified ‘DOJ components’ — for use in wrongfully targeting President Trump and his allies during the height of the campaign season,” they added. \n\nSmith’s team has until Oct. 31 to file a response.","summary":"“The proposed motion establishes that this unjust case was dead on arrival — unconstitutional even before its inception,”

Trump started an insurrection","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris plans to lay out her campaign's closing argument by returning to the site near the White House where Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol in January 2021—hoping it will crystalize for voters the fight between defending democracy and sowing political chaos.\n\nHer campaign says Harris will give a speech at the Ellipse on Tuesday—one week before Election Day—and will urge the nation to “turn the page” toward a new era and away from Trump.\n\nThe site is symbolic, since it's where Trump delivered a speech on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was convening to certify Joe Biden's victory in the election that past November. In it, Trump lied repeatedly about widespread voter fraud that had not occurred and urged supporters to fight. Hundreds then stormed the Capitol in a deadly riot.\n\nWord of the speech came from a senior Harris campaign official who insisted on anonymity to discuss an address that is still in development. The Harris campaign is betting that her speaking at the Ellipse can provide an opportunity for the vice president to stress that the country no longer wants to be defined by a political combativeness that Trump seems to relish.\n\nTrump has promised to pardon those jailed for their role in the Capitol attack should he reclaim the presidency during the election Nov. 5.\n\nClosing arguments are important opportunities for candidates to sum up their campaigns and make a concise case for why voters should back them. Trump’s campaign suggested he’d begin framing his closing argument while addressing a rally last weekend in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Instead, the former president spent more than 10 minutes talking about the genitals of the late, legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, who was born in Latrobe.\n\nRELATED STORY: GOP House speaker struggles to defend Trump’s Arnold Palmer penis rant\n\nHer team announced the coming Ellipse addressed before Harris attended a CNN town hall in suburban Philadelphia on Wednesday night, where she took questions from an audience of undecided voters as part of what was once envisioned as a debate with Trump. Harris had said she would participate in a CNN debate but the two sides never worked out a formal agreement. CNN said it also invited Trump to a town hall. but that it didn’t happen.\n\nHarris told the audience that Jan. 6 saw a “president of the United States defying the will of the people in a free and fair election and unleashing a violent mob who attacked the United States Capitol.”\n\nThe first audience question was from a self-described “anti-Trump Republican” who was concerned about the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n“I believe the American people deserve better, and they deserve a president who is focused on solutions, not sitting in the Oval Office plotting every day,” Harris said.\n\nWhen it comes to Jan. 6, about 4 in 10 likely voters in a CNN poll from September said the economy was their most important issue when deciding how to vote, and about 2 in 10 said protecting democracy was. That compared to about 1 in 10 who named either immigration or abortion and reproductive rights.\n\nProtecting democracy also seems to be more important to Democrats and Harris supporters. Roughly 4 in 10 voters who back Harris call it their top issue, compared to about 2 in 10 who say that about the economy. For Republicans and Trump supporters, about 6 in 10 name the economy as their top voting issue, followed by immigration. Only 5% of Trump supporters said protecting democracy was their top issue.\n\nDuring the town hall, Harris said Trump is “increasingly unstable and unfit to serve.” Asked directly if she thought her opponent was a fascist, Harris responded, \"Yes, I do.\"\n\nA short time later, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded, “Kamala will say anything to distract from her open border invasion and record high inflation.\"\n\nDuring the event, Harris was asked how her presidency would be different from Biden’s given that she’s been a part of his administration for nearly four years—a question she's answered in recent weeks without naming major contrasts. This time, Harris seemed better prepared to talk about how things would be different, saying, “My administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration” and saying she represented a “new generation of leadership on a number of issues.”\n\n“I’m pointing out things that haven’t been done that need to be done,” the vice president said of Biden’s policies, also noting, “I’m not going to shy away from saying, ‘Hey, these are still problems that we need to fix.’” She pointed specifically to her promises to increase federal grants for small businesses and to expand government funding for home health care to people caring for their elderly parents and children simultaneously.\n\nOne audience member pressed Harris on key issues where she’s flip-flopped. That includes hydraulic fracturing, which she suggested that she’d support banning while running in the 2020 Democratic primary but now says should be allowed to continue. Harris said Wednesday that the U.S. can invest in a greener energy economy without halting fracking, which is key to the economy of parts of Pennsylvania.\n\nShe added that she sees many key policies differently now: “Frankly I now have the experience and perspective of having been vice president.”\n\nAsked about the greatest weakness she’d bring to the White House, Harris offered, “I’m kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess” while admitting to making “parental mistakes” with her two stepchildren.\n\nThe vice president also mentioned praying every day, saying, “I was raised to believe in a loving God, to believe faith is a verb.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris plans to lay out her campaign's closing argument by returning to the site near the White House where Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol in January 2021—hoping it will crystalize for voters the fight between defending democracy and sowing political chaos.\n\n\n\nHer campaign says Harris will give a speech at the Ellipse on Tuesday—one week before Election Day—and will urge the nation to “turn the page” toward a new era and away from Trump.\n\n\n\nThe site is symbolic, since it's where Trump delivered a speech on Jan. 6, 2021, as Congress was convening to certify Joe Biden's victory in the election that past November.

He has stumped on the trail, hosting a Trump town hall in the auditorium of a Pennsylvania high school last week and telling locals to go “hog wild” on voter registration. And, in his latest stunt, he has offered $1 million a day to registered voters in swing states who sign an America PAC petition backing the First and Second Amendments—a move that the Justice Department reportedly said might be breaking election laws. His efforts may prove consequential: As my colleague Franklin Foer wrote this past weekend, “If Trump wins, it will likely be by a narrow margin that can be attributed to turnout. Musk can tout himself as the single variable of success.”\n\nMusk is far from the only major donor in this race. Bill Gates has reportedly given $50 million to Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, and various billionaires publicly support Harris or Trump. What distinguishes Musk though, beyond his on-the-ground efforts, is his ownership of X. He can spread information (and disinformation) with ease, and stifle views he doesn’t like, Sophia Rosenfeld, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania, told me in an email. Media owners have always been influential in American politics (Rupert Murdoch, for example, played a prominent role in past elections through his leadership of Fox News). But Rosenfeld noted that Musk’s particular combination of wealth and media control is “unprecedented.”\n\nMusk’s audience is massive on X: His posts, many of which have amplified false and inflammatory rhetoric, get billions of views. Over the weekend he boosted the baseless claim that Michigan had more registered voters than eligible citizens. After Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said that wasn’t true—and that Musk was spreading “dangerous disinformation”—Musk doubled down and accused her of lying to the public. This disinformation had a swift real-world impact: Benson told CBS that her team received harassing messages and threats after Musk’s post. Such rhetoric has the potential to warp how much voters trust election processes. Musk’s America PAC has also been urging people to report examples of “voter fraud” through what it calls the Election Integrity Community on X. Though such fraud remains exceptionally rare, his efforts could further sow distrust in election integrity and lay the groundwork for future claims of a stolen race. (America PAC did not immediately respond to my request for comment.) So prominent is Musk’s role in the MAGA movement that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz joked archly at a recent rally: “I’m going to talk about [Trump’s] running mate …. Elon Musk.”\n\nMusk wasn’t always aligned, at least in public, with such zealotry. He reportedly said that Trump was a “stone-cold loser” in 2020, and he supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Still, as my colleague Charlie Warzel told me last month, Musk’s feelings of being aggrieved and attacked escalated when he faced pushback from liberals after his Twitter takeover; soon after, he began using X as a megaphone for MAGA. And, though his Trump endorsement seemed out of step with his long-standing image as a climate innovator, it is consistent with his rightward drift: Over the past few years, he has reportedly been quietly donating to Republican causes and candidates, including giving $10 million to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year for his ill-fated primary run.\n\nThe wealthy have long played an outsize role in politics—but Musk, as he so often does, is venturing to new extremes. If Trump wins, Musk’s gamble may pay off handsomely: In addition to a promised role in Trump’s government, he is poised to receive epic government contracts for his companies. But even if Trump doesn’t win, Musk could set a precedent for uber-rich donors getting more directly involved with political campaigns; that could intensify the “oligarchic side of modern American democracy,” Rosenfeld warned. Though Musk’s hands-on, incendiary campaigning methods are chaotic—and possibly illegal—his efforts during this election may pioneer a model for other megadonors looking to reshape a race.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nRatpocalypse Now\n\nBy Annie Lowrey\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nWatch.

The poll surveyed 1,186 likely Georgia voters from October 17 to October 22. It has a margin of error of 3.9 percent.Trump fared better than Harris in a poll released on Wednesday by Bloomberg News/Morning Consult. The survey of 855 likely Georgia voters from October 16 to October 20 gave the former president a narrow 1.5 percent edge over the vice president. Trump was backed by 49.9 percent of respondents, while Harris was supported by 48.4 percent. The poll has a 3 percent margin of error.Most other recent polls of Georgia have shown Trump with a small lead, although Harris has a small advantage in some. An average of recent polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight also showed Trump leading by 1.5 percentage points as of Thursday, making Georgia one of only a few battleground states where either candidate has a lead of more than 1 point.Newsweek reached out for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns via email on Thursday evening.President Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, won Georgia by only 11,779 votes in 2020, becoming the first Democratic ticket to carry the Peach State in a presidential election since 1992.Trump's small average lead over Harris in Georgia this year has been holding since mid-September. The vice president last led the state in the FiveThirtyEight average on September 7, when she was ahead of Trump by just 0.2 percent.The former president has made some small but potentially significant recent advances in other battleground state polls. In Pennsylvania, where Harris was leading by a small margin in the FiveThirtyEight average as recently as last week, Trump was ahead by 0.3 percent on Thursday.Michigan polls have also been more favorable toward the ex-president recently. While Harris was still up by 0.7 percent in the average as of Thursday, she had been leading the state by as many as 2.8 points just weeks earlier.In Wisconsin, the vice president's highest average polling lead of 3.8 percent in August had diminished to only 0.2 percent this week. Harris was leading in the FiveThirtyEight average of Nevada polls by an identical 0.2 percent margin on Thursday, down from a lead of just over 1 percent earlier this month.Trump was leading Harris by just under 1 percent in average of polls for North Carolina on Thursday. The Republican had a more substantial but still small average advantage in Arizona, where he was leading the Democrat in the average by 1.7 points.Nationally, Trump has made some inroads recently by taking a modest lead in some polls, although all signs continue pointing to a neck-and-neck race for the White House next month.

I could have gotten Hillary Clinton very easily. And when they say lock her up, whenever they said lock her, you know, they’d start, 30,000 people, lock her up, lock her up. What did I do? I always say take it easy, just relax. We’re winning. Take it easy. Take it easy,’ Trump said.\n\nThe statement papers over the several times Trump himself said ‘lock her up’ when speaking about Clinton.\n\n(Biden himself said in New Hampshire days ago ‘lock him up’ when speaking about Trump, in a flub he immediately tried to walk back by saying lock him up ‘politically.’ \n\n‘I could have had her put in jail. And I decided I didn’t want to do that. I thought it would look terrible. You had the wife of the president of the United States going to jail. I thought it would be very bad if we did that. And I made sure that didn’t happen, okay? I thought it would be bad. What I didn’t know is that they were going to play dirty with me. Who thinks that?’ Trump said.\n\nTrump’s comments overlook his 2017 call for the Justice Department to investigate Clinton and his reported 2018 comments to his White House counsel that he wanted her prosecuted.\n\nTrump said in 2020 soon after he launched his reelection effort, ‘Lock them up. You should lock them up. Lock up the Bidens. Lock up Hillary.’\n\nHis current rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, on Wednesday accused him of making an ‘enemies list’ and cited his recent comments on facing an ‘enemy from within.’ \n\nTrump himself faces the resumption of his January 6 trial after Election Day. Smith, the special counsel who brought charges in that case and the classified documents case, is appealing a Trump-appointed lawyer’s decision dismissing that case in Florida.\n\nHe faces sentencing late next month in his New York hush money case, where he is unlikely to get jail time.","summary":"Donald Trump isn&#8217;t ruling out issuing a pardon for &#8216;bad boy&#8217; Hunter Biden&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-discusses-potential-pardon-for-hunter-biden-hes-in-trouble/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Trump-reveals-whether-he-would-be-open-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:19:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.514},{"id":261001428,"title":"Could Latino voters in Pennsylvania decide the election?","text":"Could Latino voters in Pennsylvania decide the election?\n With Election Day less than two weeks away, Pennsylvania could decide who wins the White House.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in more than two years and drew an angry reaction from Kyiv. Guterres called for “a just peace” in Ukraine, in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions. He also urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon and Sudan.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday night, Putin was asked about former U.S. President Donald Trump’s promise to end the fighting in Ukraine.\n\n“What Mr. Trump said recently, what I heard, (is) he spoke about the desire to do everything to end the conflict in Ukraine,” Putin said. “It seems to me that he said it sincerely. We certainly welcome statements of this kind, no matter who makes them.”\n\nPutin also was asked about whether any North Korean troops were in Russia, which he neither confirmed nor denied. The U.S. said Wednesday that 3,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are training at several locations.\n\n“Images are a serious thing, if there are images, then they reflect something,” he said when asked about satellite photos of troops.\n\nPutin noted that lawmakers in Moscow earlier in the day ratified a pact with North Korea on mutual military assistance as part of a “strategic partnership” with Pyongyang..\n\n“We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously. What and how we will do within the framework of this article (of the agreement) is our business,” he said.\n\nThe summit covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, efforts to settle regional conflicts and expansion of the BRICS group of nations.\n\nThe alliance that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa when it was founded in 2009 has expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining.\n\nThe Kremlin touted the summit as “the largest foreign policy event ever held” by Russia.\n\nSpeaking at what was dubbed the “BRICS Plus” session, which included countries that are considering joining the bloc, Putin accused the West of trying to stem the growing power of the Global South with “illegal unilateral sanctions, blatant protectionism, manipulation of currency and stock markets, and relentless foreign influence ostensibly promoting democracy, human rights, and the climate change agenda.”\n\n“Such perverse methods and approaches -– to put it bluntly -– lead to the emergence of new conflicts and the aggravation of old disagreements,” Putin said. “One example of this is Ukraine, which is being used to create critical threats to Russia’s security, while ignoring our vital interests, our just concerns, and the infringement of the rights of Russian-speaking people.”\n\nRussia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network SWIFT and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners.\n\nIn a joint declaration Wednesday, participants voiced concern about “the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures, including illegal sanctions” and reiterated their commitment to enhancing financial cooperation within BRICS. They noted the benefits of “faster, low-cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments built upon the principle of minimizing trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.”\n\nChina’s President Xi Jinping has emphasized the bloc’s role in ensuring global security. Xi noted that China and Brazil have put forward a peace plan for Ukraine and sought to rally broader international support for it. Ukraine has rejected the proposal.\n\n“We should promote the de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible and pave the way for a political settlement,” Xi said.\n\nPutin and Xi had announced a “no-limits” partnership weeks before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. They already met twice earlier this year, in Beijing in May and at a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan in July.\n\nRussia’s cooperation with India also has flourished as New Delhi sees Moscow as a time-tested partner since the Cold War despite Russia’s close ties with India’s rival, China. While Western allies want New Delhi to be more active in persuading Moscow to end the fighting in Ukraine, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has avoided condemning Russia while emphasizing a peaceful settlement.\n\nAddressing the BRICS Plus session, Guterres urged an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza, Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan. “We need peace in Ukraine, a just peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions,” he said.\n\nRussia’s Kremlin-controlled media touted the summit as a massive policy coup that left the West fearing the loss of its global clout. State TV shows and news bulletins underscored that BRICS countries account for about half the world’s population comprising the “global majority” and challenging Western “hegemony.”\n\nTV hosts elaborately quoted Western media reports saying that the summit highlighted the failure to isolate Moscow. “The West, the U.S., Washington, Brussels, London ended up isolating themselves,” said Yevgeny Popov, host of a popular political talk show on state channel Rossiya 1.","summary":"KAZAN, Russia — Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday closed a summit of the BRICS [...]","url":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/world-news/putin-ends-brics-summit-that-sought-to-expand-russias-global-clout/","image":"https://www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/BRICS.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:14:03","author":"Gdpr Cookie Consent,Staff Reporter","authors":["Gdpr Cookie Consent","Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","source_country":"zw","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":261000752,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Calls Trump an ‘American Tyrant,’ Performs at Harris Rally in Georgia","text":"Bruce Springsteen is making things clear: He’s voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. On Thursday night, The Boss took the stage at her campaign rally in Clarkston, Georgia, to perform three of his songs, and called Donald Trump an “American tyrant.”\n\n Springsteen, dressed in blue jeans and a vest, took the stage as he strummed his guitar and played the harmonica while singing the lyrics to “The Promised Land” in front of the packed crowd.\n\n “I’m Bruce Springsteen and I’m here to support Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for President and Vice President of the United States, and to oppose Donald Trump and JD Vance,” Springsteen said onstage. “I want a president who reveres the Constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for a woman’s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle-class economy that will serve all our citizens.”\n\n “There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris,” Springsteen continued. “She’s running to be the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American. That’s why on November 5th, I’m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.”\n\n “I urge all of you who believe in the American way to join me. Thank you,” Springsteen said, before performing his song, “Land of Hope and Dreams” and teasing more “entertainment” as he started to sing his hit, “Dancing in the Dark.”\n\n Actor Samuel L. Jackson, directors Spike Lee and Tyler Perry, and former President Barack Obama are expected to make appearances at the rally. Harris will also end the night with a speech.\n\n Springsteen endorsed Harris in an Instagram video earlier this month, saying Harris and VP candidate Tim Walz (who’s a huge Springsteen fan) are “committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone.”\n\n Along with citing Harris’ and Walz’s commitment to inclusivity regardless of “class, religion, race, your political point of view, or sexual identity,” Springsteen said, “They want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That’s the vision of America I’ve been consistently writing about for 55 years.”\n\n Springsteen has regularly endorsed (and often campaigned for) Democratic candidates for years. He endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and called Trump a “moron” in a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone. In 2020 he gave his support to Joe Biden, even narrating and soundtracking a campaign ad for the future president.","summary":"\"I want a president who reveres the Constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy,\" Springsteen said onstage","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-harris-georgia-rally-calls-trump-tyrant-1235142492/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/bruce-springsteen-harris-rally-atlanta.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:09:23","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.532},{"id":260999722,"title":"Hating someone for their political preference is self-defeating — and Taylor Swift proves it","text":"Be like Taylor Swift. Cultivate friendships with people outside of your ideological circle — and keep them.\n\nLast week she wrote self-professed Swiftie Dave Portnoy a thank-you note for always having her back. And it was hand-delivered by her brother to the Barstool Sports honcho at her Miami concert.\n\nNice gesture, right?\n\nNope. As with anything in the Swift universe, it’s caused an earthquake: spawning think pieces, social media reactions and tons of coverage.\n\nEvery article about the note mentioned the players’ support of presidential candidates. He endorsed Trump; she endorsed Harris — noteworthy because, in 2024, our brains are so broken that we can’t conceive of admiring or befriending someone with opposing politics.\n\nBut a tweet from New York magazine’s The Cut took the cake — asking “which Trump supporter will she embrace next?“\n\n“In a truly baffling decision, Swift has decided to be friendly with … Dave Portnoy,”author Olivia Craighead wrote in the story that went with the tweet— adding that Swift thanked the Barstool honcho for his loyalty.\n\n“As far as I can tell, she’s referring to the fact that Portnoy — a proud Donald Trump supporter — did not immediately disavow his favorite pop star when she announced she was voting for Kamala Harris,” Craighead wrote. “How big of him.”\n\nYes, Portnoy wasn’t judging someone for their political affiliation, unlike the author of The Cut’s piece. Actually I think Swift was referring to Portnoy’s intense backing of her that’s gone on for years, through public spats with celebrities and music honchos.\n\nBut politics, especially the presidential kind, have eaten into every previously non-partisan sphere of our society: sports, pop culture, show biz — lines must be drawn. The act of self-sorting, of casting away those with ideological differences, has become a public display of virtue.\n\nHowever, that’s seemingly not the casewith Swift, who, mind you, is not above a petty beef. Just ask any of her exes.\n\nShe’s keeping her Trump-leaning pals, like fellow Chiefs WAG Brittany Mahomes, despite her fans’ anger.\n\nIf you remember, Mahomes murdered a group of children while wearing a MAGA hat. Just kidding. She liked a Trump post — a vicious thought crime brought to light by her index finger tapping a heart.\n\nBut Swift’s fans demand purity from their hero.\n\nWhen photos dropped in September of Mahomes and Swift together at the US Open, it was to a flurry of disgust on X.One wrote, “The fact that she’s made a whole thing about her being so anti-Trump in 2020, released a whole documentary highlighting her political stance and how she ‘wants to be on the right side of history’ and yet.”\n\nVoting practices have, however, become a litmus test. Too many Democrats believethe Harris supporter is virtuous and saving democracy; the Trump voter is evil, racist and, likely, a Nazi — and thus, should be surgically removed from all aspects of your life.\n\nSince 2016, there have been countless articles about Trump’s mere political existence ruining marriages, friendships and families.\n\nIn 2017, a Reuters Ipsos poll found that 13% of 6,426 participants had given the ol’ heave-ho to a friend or family member over politics. And to this day, we’re still having to endure the very weak, hackneyed genre of holiday-themed media stories on how to deal with your MAGA relatives at Thanksgiving.\n\nI recently learned the phrase “MAGA orphan” — someone who claims to have “lost” their parents to Donald Trump — while I was reporting on the crazy frenzy of progressives proclaiming Tim Walz can replace the fathers they have disowned over politics.\n\nEarlier this month, creepy nonbinary influencer Jeffrey Marsh told his followers that they should cut off family members who vote for Trump. Woke zombie Howard Stern recently declared that he “hates” all Trump voters.\n\nAll that pathetic cutting-people-off thing feels very Trump’s first term.\n\nIn her defiant act of being friends with people who might disagree with her, Swift has stood up for sanity — showing that relationships transcend what happens in a small booth every four years in November.\n\nBurrowing yourself into an ideological silo isn’t healthy, it’s cowardly. It will only atrophy your world view. This goes for righties as well as lefties.\n\nYour politics can be red or blue, but your social circle should never deliberately not be purple.\n\nOtherwise, you’re giving a politician you hate much more control over your life — which feels very much like a self-own.","summary":"One of the best examples Taylor Swift has ever set?

Similar false claims about voting machines have surfaced in Tennessee and Georgia, with election officials in each state attributing errors to voters, not machine tampering.Election security experts told CBS News that unfounded claims of machines flipping votes have circulated for years, and while voting machines have potential vulnerabilities, there is no evidence of machines being hacked or programmed to alter ballots. Election officials dispute viral claimsClaims about votes being \"switched\" or \"flipped\" have been around since at least 2004 and have been leveled by both Democrats and Republicans, according to David Becker, a CBS News election law contributor and founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.Becker said that human error is the cause of \"every single\" vote switching claim he's encountered, yet these isolated incidents are often cited as proof to falsely claim widespread fraud. In Tarrant County, officials said that one out of 58,000 ballots cast on the first day of early voting was misprinted due to voter error. The claims gained attention online after a viral video showed a man insisting the machine switched his vote. State officials in Georgia have disputed a similar allegation after Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed that a Dominion machine changed a voter's ballot in her district. That claim was based on an anonymous viral Facebook post. The Whitfield County Board of Elections and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, as well as Dominion Voting Systems, all indicated the issue was due to voter error and said the issue was resolved while the voter was at the polling place.\"There is a reason we tell people to review their ballots. Humans make mistakes,\" said Gabriel Sterling, COO of the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, in a post on X.In Tennessee, Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson alleged that votes for Democratic candidates switched to votes for Republicans. However, the Shelby County Election Commission said no voting irregularities have been found and urged voters to review their ballots carefully before casting them.Election security and voting machines In 2020, false claims about voting machines, including Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, spread widely. The claims, amplified by then-President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates, led the companies to file defamation lawsuits against individuals and media outlets that promoted the claims. Fox News settled their defamation lawsuit in 2023, agreeing to pay Dominion more than $787 million for repeatedly broadcasting false accusations about the company. In 2024, some of Trump's supporters, including X owner Elon Musk, have continued to cast doubt on the integrity of voting machines and called for them to be banned. Voting machines are tested both before and after votes are cast to ensure they are working properly, said Derek Tisler, counsel in the Brennan Center's Elections and Government Program. Tisler said one of the most important election security safeguards is a paper record of the vote. Implementing a paper record has been a priority for states since 2016, he said, and around 98% of votes cast in the 2024 election will have a paper trail.\"Election officials will review a sample of these paper records after the election to confirm voting machine tallies,\" Tisler said. \"And if there is any reason to suspect an issue with voting machines, they can fall back on these paper records to determine an accurate count.\" Experts also acknowledge that voting machines have potential vulnerabilities and, like any technology, should be updated and reviewed for security improvements.The \"gold standard protection\" for Americans are hand-marked paper ballots, according to J. Alex Halderman, an election security expert and professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. Halderman said about 70% of the country votes via hand-marked paper ballots. Tisler said issues like frozen screens or jammed ballot scanners are much more likely to happen than any type of \"malicious\" interference or hacking. He also said voters can unknowingly make the wrong selections on touch-screens. \"When I accidentally have a typo in a text that I send, I don't assume immediately that my phone has been hacked, and I would encourage the same sort of patience and understanding with voters,\" Tisler said.Experts said it's imperative for voters to check their ballots and confirm all selections are correct before casting it. And voters should remember that election officials have a plan in place to deal with issues and ensure your vote is counted.","summary":"Election security experts told CBS News that unfounded claims of machines flipping votes have circulated for years.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/false-claims-machines-switching-votes-what-to-know/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/01/807794d2-efa8-4af6-a5b2-9b2aa1b9b677/thumbnail/1200x630/6d136937a03828fe2be82ac5a67c6e36/1727826895077.png?v=c72f52c71e431fd7dde1ba5ae2f69280","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3283178_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:09:00","author":"Layla Ferris","authors":["Layla Ferris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.583},{"id":260999960,"title":"Voting On A Workday?

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race nationally and within swing states.

Now, both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are ramping up their campaigns in hopes that Wisconsin will be theirs to win this time around.After almost three weeks away from the Badger State, Trump will make a return to Wisconsin, the campaign announced Thursday. The Republican nominee will deliver marks in northeastern Wisconsin days before the November 5 election, appearing at the Resch Center in the Green Bay suburb of Ashwaubenon Wednesday night, his campaign said.Wisconsin has increasingly emerged as a pivotal state in November's election. Polls show a deadheat between Trump and Harris. FiveThirtyEight's tracker has Harris up just 0.2 percentage points, as of Thursday. RealClearPolling's aggregator has Trump with the same-sized advantage.Both Trump, Harris and their surrogates have ramped up their travels to Wisconsin in recent months. Trump barnstormed the state earlier this month, making four visits in just eight days. This week, Harris held an event in Brookfield with former Republican Representative Liz Cheney, while former President Barack Obama stumped with Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.Wisconsin is critical to the \"blue wall\" that Democrats need to hold onto the White House. In 2016, Trump scored a massive upset after he unexpectedly won the state by 0.7 percent—a victory that many Democrats said cost Hillary Clinton the election. Clinton infamously did not step foot in Wisconsin during her campaign. Joe Biden was able to flip the Badger State in 2020, eking out a win by 0.63 percentage points, or around 20,000 votes.This time around, neither campaign is willing to take Wisconsin for granted, Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist in Wisconsin, told Newsweek. Trump and Harris, however, are using strikingly different strategies to ensure that Wisconsin goes their way.Harris' Wisconsin StrategyHarris has logged a lot of trips to Wisconsin. She made her first trip to the battleground state just two days after Biden stepped aside as the nominee and she's continued to storm through as Election Day nears.Last Thursday, Harris held events and rallies in three different Wisconsin cities, stopping at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee before heading to western Wisconsin for an afternoon event and then appearing before an at-capacity crowd of more than 4,000 at the same expo center Trump will campaign in next week.\"Harris has obviously taken [the Clinton] lesson and used it well,\" Scholz said.But the cities in which she and her surrogates have appeared leads Scholz to believe that Harris' campaign is not trying to sway undecided voters or more moderate Republicans. Seeing Obama and Walz stump in Madison—which Biden carried with more than 75 percent of the vote in 2020 and Clinton carried with 70 percent—\"says to me, part of the Harris strategy here is to make sure that base is rock solid from a turnout perspective.\"\"They're going to Milwaukee, they're going to Madison, and somebody will get up to Green Bay. But to me, they're really focusing on the base here in Wisconsin,\" Scholz said. \"Harris isn't taking it for granted at all, even if she's just locking down these hardcore Democrat areas.\"He added, \"The same holds true for Tim Walz, the VP Democratic candidate whose multiple trips into Wisconsin serve to motivate and fortify the Democratic base vote.\"Harris has also shored up major endorsements from Wisconsin Republicans, like Waukesha Mayor Shawn Reilly and the state's longest-serving state senator, Robert Cowles. And she's appeared at the Sharon Lynne Wilson Center for the Arts with Cheney and conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes on Monday.But Scholz is questioning whether the gambit to convince Republicans to switch from Trump to Harris is gaining any traction in America's Dairyland.\"If Republicans haven't made up their mind between Trump and Harris, Liz Cheney couldn't change that,\" he said. \"It just hasn't generated that chatter at the kitchen table, so to speak, on the street with your friends.\"Trump's Wisconsin StrategyTrump, on the other hand, does not appear to be too focused on solidifying the GOP base. Instead, he's made a number of targeted stops that include heavily Democratic Counties, like Dane County, where Madison is located, while also fortifying the Republican vote in the state's southwestern corner, a less popular stop.\"The idea was for Trump to generate enthusiasm,\" Scholz said. \"If he could push Republican voters above their 2020 levels, they might contribute more votes to that 10,000 to 20,000 votes that [Trump and Harris] are going to need to push the other one off the top.\"\"I don't know that [the rally] necessarily had thousands of people there, but it certainly was generating a boatload of news in the market,\" he said.This is Trump's Wisconsin strategy: He comes in, hits hard and then sends it.\"Those targeted appearances that he did early on helped move the needle into Wisconsin,\" Scholz said.Earlier this month, Trump told a crowded airplane hanger in rural Juneau. \"They say that Wisconsin is probably the toughest of the swing states to win. I don't think so.\"\"If we win Wisconsin, we win the presidency,\" the former president said.Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, will also appear in Wisconsin on Monday to talk about \"Kamalanomics,\" a visit that comes not long after his Sunday trip to a bar in Waukesha where he watched the Packers game and spoke to supporters.Scholz doesn't expect Vance's appearances in the Badger State to be a game changer but said the senator will help fortify the Republican base by making a few headlines that motivate voters to go out to the polls.Either way, Scholz stressed that Wisconsin is still a toss-up state.\"You still have undecideds—whether they be their ticket splitters, independents, maybe a few Republicans, maybe a few Democrats—What's moving them? So far, they're holding, they're holding their pattern.\"\"[Wisconsin is] inside the margin of error, we're going to be inside the margin of error between now and Election Day,\" he said. \"It's going to come down to the really boring subject of infrastructure, voter ID and turnout. Whether it's sophisticated or old line, if you ain't got the best program in town, then you're not going to turn out that last group of voters that you're going to need to win.\"","summary":"Both campaigns are approaching Wisconsin differently as Trump and Harris try to lock in the critical battleground state.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-wisconsin-strategies-2024-election-2016-tipping-point-hillary-clinton-1974671","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2503949/trump-harris-wisconsin-strategies.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:06:47","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":261000150,"title":"Between Harris and Trump, More Doubts Than Certainties for Latin America","text":"by Humberto Marquez (caracas)Thursday, October 24, 2024Inter Press Service\n\nInterest and tension have grown after dozens of polls and bookmakers have shown similar chances of victory for Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, particularly in a few decisive states.\n\nLatin America has been treated by many US administrations as its ‘backyard', but it is now commonplace that Washington's international priority lies far from the region.\n\nNevertheless, \"we should not underestimate the ways in which Democrats and Republicans are different\", warned Tullo Vigevani, former professor of international relations at Brazil's Paulista State University.\n\n\"For example, their proposals and policies are very different on the environment, in general and in relation to Latin America; on renewable energy and biofuels - particularly in the case of Brazil - and regarding human rights and some authoritarian trends in the region\", Vigevani told IPS from Sao Paulo.\n\nEven if some governments are more sympathetic to Harris or Trump, Vigevani believes that both Washington and the region's capitals will seek understandings and a relationship as normal as possible, after the 5 November election.\n\nMigration rules\n\nAmong the campaign issues, such as economy and employment, taxes, health, wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and the opposing personalities of both candidates, migration stands out, with Latin American countries being the main expellers of migrants to the United States.\n\n\"It is a sensitive issue for Americans, whether they are Democrats, Republicans or independents. It affects the immigrant population, the millions of refugees, and therefore the countries of Latin America,\" Vilma Petrash, a Venezuelan professor of political science and international relations at Miami Dade College, told IPS.\n\nOf the 336 million people living in the United States, 46.2 million were of foreign origin in 2022, according to the non-governmental Pew Research Center; 49% are already U.S. citizens, 24% are legal permanent residents, and the rest, more than 11 million people, are unauthorised immigrants, eight million of whom are from Latin American and Caribbean countries.\n\nIn fact, the United States is currently home to 65 million ‘Hispanics', as Latin Americans are called in the country, according to different reports, and they have become a desired prize for the two candidates.\n\nTrump, who pushed for the construction of a wall on the southern border during his presidency (2017-2021), now offers massive deportations of illegals - one million immediately, according to his vice-presidential candidate, James Vance -, and to contain irregular border immigration even by using the military.\n\nThey are \"the enemy within\", Trump has said, and has stigmatised migrants: he said that criminals from Venezuela have left their country for the United States, \"leaving Caracas as one of the safest cities in the world\", or that Haitians \"are eating the pets\" in the northern industrial state of Ohio.\n\nHarris, who is the current vice-president and lead programmes with which president Joe Biden also tried to address causes of migration, such as poverty in Central America, has said that the immigration system \"needs reform\", without going into details.\n\nWhichever side wins, the controls will predictably increase, and Washington's announcement that it will not renew in 2025 the temporary stay permits (parole), which allow Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans to enter and remain in the United States for two years, was a warning sign.\n\nThe United States isolates itself\n\nThe migration issue shows the United States' willingness to isolate itself, to withdraw, instead of taking a proactive approach, as a great global power, to solving problems in the region and the world.\n\nAccording to Petrash, \"after Washington's retreat from the wars it got into in the Middle East, there is resistance among people to getting involved in the world's problems, which weakens the liberal democratic order. Donald Trump's ‘America First' policies are a case in point\".\n\nThe expert said from Miami, in the southeastern state of Florida, that there is also a lack of consensus over foreign policy, and in general over governance, to the point that a part of the population still, countering evidence, supports the version that it was Trump and not Biden who won the election four years ago.\n\nWhile Biden has consistently supported Ukraine in the war against Russia, and Israel's current military offensive in the Middle East, his political action in favour of democracy in Latin America has been weaker, and Harris would continue this, although with revisions, according to Petrash.\n\nThis is despite the certainty that, for example, among the alternatives for containing regional migration, in which the exodus of more than seven million Venezuelans in the last decade stands out, is to promote a solution to the democratic crisis in that country.\n\nAs a result of its policies and omissions, its polarised political confrontation and doubts about its electoral system, and the rise of isolationism, the United States \"would have to regain the moral stature necessary to help stem democratic backsliding in the region\", says Petrash.\n\nThese setbacks are expressed in left-wing governments with authoritarian tendencies, such as those in Nicaragua and Venezuela, but also in sectors that have backed right-wing presidencies such as those of Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022) in Brazil and the current administrations of Javier Milei in Argentina and Nayib Bukele in El Salvador.\n\nBolsonaro, Milei and Bukele have openly identified with Trump, whose sector harbours a far-right conservative current. For Petrash, this could favour a rapprochement with Latin American countries where there is a democratic backlash.\n\nChina moves forward\n\nPetrash points out that the United States's international retreat was acute in Latin America, \"its natural strategic zone\", after the failure of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) initiative in 2005. \"It abandoned its vision of free trade in the region and let China move forward with its enclaves,\" she said.\n\nChina, \"an economic, political and ideological rival, has sold itself as successful authoritarianism, and has taken advantage of Washington's absences in Latin America to advance its quiet, pragmatic diplomacy,\" says Petrash.\n\nTrade between China and Latin America reached US$480 billion in 2023 after increasing 35-fold in 2000-2022, while the region's total trade with the world increased four-fold, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). Nevertheless, trade with the Asian giant is still far from the region's trade with the United States, which in the same year amounted to US$1.14 trillion.\n\nRelations between Latin America and China \"have grown and even strengthened in strategic areas such as new materials for energy production, lithium batteries -South America has large reserves of the mineral-, or artificial intelligence\", Vigevani states.\n\nBrazil and Mexico\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil is concerned about Washington's disdain – which will be evident if Trump wins - for multilateral institutions, starting with the United Nations and the proposed renewal of its Security Council in order to make it effective.\n\nFor Vigevani, this distancing from multilateralism is illustrated by the blockade, which Washington has maintained since 2020, on the appointment of new members to the dispute settlement body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), initiated by Trump and continued by Biden.\n\n\"Even if relations with Brazil and Latin America in general look normal, this United States refusal raises doubts for the future, because it is saying it is not interested in multilateral organisations,\" said Vigevani.\n\nIn the case of a Trump victory, the Brazilian professor points out, there are also unanswered questions about what his war and peace policies will be.\n\nAn example is the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Trump has said that \"ending this war quickly is in the best interest of the United States\" and that he can achieve \"a peace agreement in one day\", without offering further details, said Vigevani.\n\n\"It is important because, despite the war, Brazil has a strong relationship with Russia, and a very active participation in the Brics group (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa),\" Vigevani recalled.\n\nAccording to Petrash, with Trump's international policy, \"the great power can be the bull in the china shop, and even more, the bull isolating itself in the china shop\".\n\nAt the other end of the region is Mexico, a partner of Canada and the United States in the trade agreement known as USMCA, which replaced in 2020 the North American Free Trade Agreement that has existed since 1994.\n\nAlong with maintaining the 3150-kilometre southern border of the United States, a destination for hundreds of thousands of migrants who cross the region each year, Mexico faces the campaign promise from both Harris and Trump that they intend to revise the USMCA as soon as they reach the White House.\n\nTrump is expected to introduce tariffs and protectionist barriers, for example on Mexican production involving Chinese parts or technologies, and Harris is expected to increase environmental and labour requirements that favour industries with United States labour.\n\nWhichever side wins, \"with the new American policy of bringing companies back to the United States or to its partners in the USMCA, possibly the biggest issue now is the end of globalisation and the return to a developmentalist nationalism\", summarised Vigevani.\n\n© Inter Press Service (2024) — All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press Service","summary":"CARACAS, Oct 24 (IPS)  - Migration, trade, the defence of democracy, the confrontation with China and the collapse of multilateralism are issues that shed more doubts than certainties on Latin America's expectations of the imminent presidential elections in the United States.\n\nRead the full story, “Between Harris and Trump, More Doubts Than Certainties for Latin America”, on globalissues.org →","url":"https://www.globalissues.org/news/2024/10/24/38057","image":"https://static.globalissues.org/ips/2024/10/Trump-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:04:28","author":"Global Issues,Humberto Marquez","authors":["Global Issues","Humberto Marquez"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.078},{"id":261001842,"title":"Trump says China’s leader will bully Harris ‘like a baby’ - The Associated Press","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump said Thursday that China’s leader would handle Vice President Kamala Harris “like a baby” if she’s elected to the White House, as the former president and his top allies increasingly have moved to infantilize the Democratic nominee. \n\n“If somehow Kamala wins, she’d have to deal with Xi Jinping,” conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said of the Chinese president. “How would he handle her?” \n\nTrump replied, “Like a baby.” \n\n“He’d take all the candy away very quickly,” Trump continued. “She wouldn’t have any idea what happened. It would be like a grand chess master playing a beginner.”\n\nTrump has built his political career around name-calling, inventing jeers for his opponents going back to his first run for president in 2016, when he slammed Republican primary rivals like “Low Energy” Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and “Little” Marco Rubio, the Florida senator. The former president also has a long history of belittling women.\n\nBut Trump has unleashed a special array of personal — often condescending — attacks against Harris, from calling her “lazy” — a word long used to demean Black people in racist terms — to insisting she’s a “stupid person” and asking whether she is “on drugs.” He’s also called Harris, the first woman of color to lead a major-party ticket, “slow” and has accused her of having a “low IQ.”\n\nThe latest line of attack, combining sexism and deeply personal jeers with referring to Harris as a child, comes with Election Day now barely a week off. His campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the remarks. \n\nThe former president, who has escalated his already dark and inflammatory rhetoric in the race’s final stretch, spoke at a rally later Thursday in Tempe, Arizona, where he criticized Harris’ handling of immigration. He accused Harris of perpetrating “a wicked betrayal of America” and having “orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people,” even though crime is down. His campaign was holding an evening event in Las Vegas.\n\nHarris has offered her own share of insults against Trump, calling him “increasingly unhinged and unstable.” During a CNN town hall Wednesday she also called Trump a “fascist.” She was set to join a rally Thursday night in the Atlanta suburbs with former President Barack Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen.\n\nIn his Thursday morning interview with Hewitt, Trump said he watched Harris’ town hall on CNN and described her as coming off “like a child, almost.”\n\n“She’s an empty vessel,” Trump said. “But she’s beautifully pushed around by a very smart, very powerful, very liberal, viciously liberal but very, very smart, powerful party called the Democrats.”\n\nSome of Trump’s allies have used similar attack lines. On Wednesday, former Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson was warming up the crowd at a Trump rally in Georgia when he suggested that Trump was ready to punish the vice president. \n\n“Dad is pissed,” Carlson told the crowd. “And when dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl, and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now.’”\n\nBrenden Dilley, a frequent online poster and fierce defender of Trump, reacted to Harris’ town hall even more viscerally, posting, “This dumb bitch might lose every state if voters see this.” \n\nWhile Dilley doesn’t work for the Trump campaign, the Republican nominee and his team often share memes made by his team.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Jill Colvin and Jonathan J. Cooper in Tempe, Arizona and Will Weissert in Washington contributed.","summary":"Trump says China’s leader will bully Harris ‘like a baby’  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-insults-harris-infantilize-baby-sexism-b2ab4c91580d87d843aa3b19f958a6e8","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4be4362/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3773x2122+0+199/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1d%2F76%2Fa178c6e16e9b014e098726550dce%2Fc4bfd44ff3d948e8a0fdba66caa3f03b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:03:00","author":"Dan Merica","authors":["Dan Merica"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":261000580,"title":"Why calling Trump 'fascist' closes the deal","text":"I think the clearest evidence that being called a fascist is hurting Donald Trump is the reaction by “independent” and GOP talking heads who foolishly defend him against the allegations or deflect them. \n\nTheir thinking goes something like this: \n\nYes, yes. It was bad when Trump said, as president, that he wanted “Hitler’s generals.” It was also bad when his former chief of staff said he fits the profile of a fascist. And OK, it was really bad when the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said he’s “a fascist to the core.” \n\nBut we’re used to all that, they say. That’s just Trump being Trump. The real question is how will Kamala Harris appeal to undecided voters. \n\nI’ll tell you how she’s going to do that.\n\nBy calling him a fascist. \n\nAmong these talking heads, there is a working assumption – that undecided voters are not moved by politics but only by policy. If Harris hopes to win them over, they say, the question is what policies are they looking for and how is she going to sell those policies to them. \n\nThere is a second assumption layered on top of the first – that Harris can’t reach them with policy if she’s focused on politics. Conclusion: calling Donald Trump a fascist is going to alienate undecided voters. \n\nThese assumptions were implicit in Republican pollster Frank Lutz’s commentary last night after the CNN town hall, in which the vice president put the word “fascist” in her own mouth for the first time. \n\n“The pivot to the ‘threat to democracy’ messaging also coincides” with her drop in polls, Luntz said on Twitter Wednesday. “Nearly all forecasts now give Trump a higher chance of winning in November.”\n\nThat’s not quite right. Trump’s lead, if you want to call it that, is within the margin of error in polls that shows him a bit ahead of Harris. You can call it “a higher chance of winning” or you can call it a dead heat. \n\nPoint is, Luntz assumes cause and effect. He assumes that the more she says Trump is a threat to democracy, the lower her polling will go. Conversely, he assumes that the more she talks about policy, the higher it will go. This interpretation is based on conventional wisdom since the 1990s. It says openly attacking your opponent backfires.\n\nI think there’s something to this conventional wisdom about undecided voters. Obviously, Kamala Harris does, too. That’s why she has spent so much time on the campaign talking about popular government policies that will improve the lives and lift the fortunes of ordinary Americans. \n\nBut I also think this conventional wisdom largely gets undecided voters wrong. Policy and politics are not necessarily two distinct things to them. They can be two things, but they are not always. What’s more is that undecided voters very often don’t care about policy. What they care about is often something murkier, like character or vibes. \n\nYou could say calling Trump a fascist doesn’t “close the deal.”\n\nBut you could say it does.\n\nGiven what we know, I think the second one is right. \n\nI’m not alone. CNN’s John King asked a panel of undecided voters for their thoughts after watching Harris call Trump a fascist for the first time while characterizing him as unstable and unfit. She said that while he has an “enemies list,” she has a “to-do list.” King asked the panel if anyone is more likely to vote for Trump. No hands. King confirmed that everyone was either open to Harris or committed.\n\nThis is just one TV panel, but it seems to represent a meaningful correction to the conventional wisdom, especially the idea that voters are so inured to Trump’s villainy that nothing he says or does will make a difference. We heard that after he was convicted on 34 felony counts. We heard it again after two former generals said that he’s a fascist. \n\nAnd yet, when a CNN panel of undecided voters heard Harris’ case for herself and against Trump, they were not prone to giving the former president a second chance. They were not alienated by the vice president’s arguments. They were open to her or committed. \n\nGiven all that, the panel’s pro-Harris reaction could be interpreted as if they had learned about the details in the case against Trump for the first time or had finally understood those details with sufficient clarity. In other words, there’s another, third assumption – that undecided voters have heard it all and what they really want to know is policy. \n\nNo, they have not heard it all, and Harris knows it. \n\n“I don’t necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly,” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, before explaining to the audience what many of them might not know, which is that: \n\n“The people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans … who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, former national security advisor, former secretaries of defense and his vice president, have all called him unfit and dangerous.” \n\nShe went on: “They have said explicitly that he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. They have said that he should never again serve as president of the United States. We know that’s why Mike Pence is not running with him, why the job was empty. And today, we learned that John Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was his longest-serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently in the last two weeks of this election talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is.” \n\nShe added: “Why is he telling the American people now? I think of it as if he’s putting out a 911 call to the American people. Understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House. This time, we must take seriously: those folks who knew him best and who were career people are not going to be there to hold him back.”\n\nHow is she going to convince millions of people who already know all this? Cooper had asked. Her answer was they don’t already know. \n\nThey need to be told. Once they are told, they will be convinced. \n\nThat’s been her campaign from the start. It’s not about the odds, but the stakes, with basic faith in the people to make the right choice.","summary":"I think the clearest evidence that being called a fascist is hurting Donald Trump is the reaction by “independent” and GOP talking heads who foolishly defend him against the allegations or deflect them. \n\nTheir thinking goes something like this: \n\nYes, yes.

Benefits from the program make up more than half of many retirees’ incomes; a substantial number have almost nothing else to live on.\n\nSo it’s important to be aware that one effect of Donald Trump’s economic proposals, if enacted, could be to drive Social Security into bankruptcy, impoverishing many older Americans — not in the distant future, but within around six years. And while I have in the past assumed that Social Security will be bailed out if necessary, that looks less certain in the antidemocratic nation we may become if Trump wins.\n\nFirst things first: Social Security is a government program, counted as part of federal spending. So how is it possible for an individual program to go bankrupt if the federal government as a whole remains solvent (which, despite Trump, it probably will)?\n\nThe answer is that Social Security has its own, separate budget. If you get pay stubs, you’ll see that there’s a deduction for FICA, the federal payroll tax. Your employer pays an equal amount, and when you include the employer share, around two-thirds of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. Most of these payroll tax receipts are dedicated to Social Security (the rest support part of Medicare).","summary":"Retirement benefits for millions of Americans are on the line.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/opinion/trump-social-security.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/24/opinion/24krugman1/24krugman1-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-24 23:00:10","author":"Paul Krugman","authors":["Paul Krugman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":261004996,"title":"Fox News and GOP senator bash immigrants to push racist conspiracy","text":"Florida Sen.

[This is a] 1.2-square-mile village — it’s unsustainable.”\n\nNearly all of the migrants are from the Muslim-majority country on Africa’s Atlantic coast, which is among the poorest in the world.\n\nThe influx of migrants has put the town over the edge and in desperate need for resources as the new arrivals have overwhelmed local housing capacity and emergency services.\n\nThe Mauritanians have been directed to go to Lockland through TikTok posts and WhatsApp groups instructing them to flock to the small town, according to the mayor. \n\nHe said he’s not sure exactly why Lockland has become a prime destination for the 4,000-mile journey from Mauritania. \n\nBut the posts appears to direct migrants from the nation of 4.3 million to travel to Turkey, and then Latin America — then make their way across the border and up into Cincinnati just south of Lockland. \n\nThe migrants were permitted to enter the US by the federal government, but are still awaiting approval to work, which can take over a year. \n\nMeanwhile, with thousands of migrants unable to work legally, the mayor is concerned that the migrants aren’t paying any taxes.\n\n“We’re looking at, right now, at probably close to a $200,000 shortfall in our earnings income tax revenue,” said Mason.\n\nMigrants have also chosen to settle in Springfield, Ohio, which has seen the arrival of an estimated 20,000 Haitians in recent years. \n\nSpringfield, which is home to 60,000 residents, became the subject of the national spotlight with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowing to deport the Haitian migrants from Springfield after he amplified unsubstantiated claims they were eating locals’ pets during his Sept. 10 debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“In the last year it’s just ballooned,” Mason said. \n\n“TikTok stories telling people how to get to the Village of Lockland and I think that has aided the explosion.”\n\nFire chief and town administrator Doug Wehmeyer said the number of emergency calls have increased 12% as a result of the migrant influx, per WCPO. He said those calls have led to emergency responses to two apartment complexes — where almost all of the 200 units are occupied by Mauritanian migrants — who are cramming sometimes more than a dozen people into single units.\n\nThe largest number of calls are for cooking fires.\n\n“​If you look at a response map of our area, there are two bright red hot zones on the heat map and that heat map would show you the two apartment complexes that the majority of the Mauritanians are living at,” he said.\n\n“On the more severe end we’ve responded to a structure fire that involved two apartment units within the Mulberry Court complex which involved the evacuation of literally hundreds of Mauritanians,” he said. \n\n“In 35 years in the fire service, I don’t think I’ve ever seen more people standing outside the outside of a building as I did when we arrived on scene.”\n\nLanguage barriers with the migrants, who speak Arabic and French, and some minor public safety issues have been the biggest challenges for local cops, Lockland Police Chief Michael Ott told The Post. \n\n“The biggest things we deal with are minor, jaywalking. Maybe not obeying bike laws, just petty sort of things,” said Ott.\n\n“Trying to educate them on that, there’s obviously language barriers. We have translators that we try to use, we’d have to have a translator with us probably 100% of the time during the day in order to communicate some of the information that we need to,”\n\nThe fire department also struggles to inform the migrants about fire safety and code restrictions.\n\nSo far, the village hasn’t received any assistance with the overwhelming situation.\n\n“I think with the attention that this is getting, we are starting to get more phone calls back and so I think we’re headed in the right direction,” Mayor Mason said. \n\n“And it’s not the fact that they’re Mauritanians. They could be Croatians or whoever. It’s the fact that this 1.2 square mile village cannot absorb this kind of increase on our population,” he said.\n\n“We didn’t ask for them to come here. There’s people out there saying ‘Oh, Lockland’s making money off this.’ We’re not making a dime off this. If anything it’s costing us money.”","summary":"A small Ohio town is the latest victim of the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policy after 3,000 migrants from the West African nation of Mauritania moved in in the past year — lured by TikTokers who are posting instruction videos with maps of the Cincinnati suburb.
