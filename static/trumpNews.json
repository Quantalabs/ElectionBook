And I think they recognize that,” said Sullivan, who followed several of the U.S. Olympians to Boston University before an 11-year NHL playing career and two decades more as a coach. “Without a doubt, that 1980 team, still to this day, has had such an influence on American hockey.”\n\nAfter sitting out the last two Winter Olympics, the NHL’s best returned to international play this month for a tournament that replaced the league’s All-Star Game, a midseason exhibition that mattered little and was treated by the players as such.\n\nInstead, the United States, Canada, Finland and Sweden all sent their stars. And something happened once they started playing for their countries: The hockey has been historic, especially the fight-filled round-robin matchup between the North Americans on Saturday that was the most-watched non-Stanley Cup Final game in a decade.\n\n“Anybody that thought they were going to come in here and see an All-Star Game was sorely, sorely mistaken. This has been anything but,” Canada coach Jon Cooper said Wednesday. “It’s been all-stars, but it’s not been an All-Star Game.”\n\nAdd in the cross-border tension following President Donald Trump’s tariff war and his calls for Canada to be made the 51st state, and the tournament has much of the flavor of the Cold War meeting with the Soviets in Lake Placid.\n\nCanadian fans loudly booed the U.S. national anthem on Saturday night in Montreal. In Boston on Monday, when the TD Garden public address announcer called for respect, the payback for “O Canada” was tepid; instead, the Americans belted out “The Star-Spangled Banner” at full throat.\n\n“All that stuff – throw it all out the window. It’s one game here, and one game for everything,” U.S. forward Matthew Tkachuk said. “Our team’s helped grow the game here in this country already. And I think a win can just knock that door right down and open up a whole new wave of hockey players throughout the whole country.”\n\nCanadian forward Brad Marchand, who plays for the Boston Bruins and will be skating on what is ordinarily his home ice, dismissed the political angle, saying the hockey was good enough to sell itself. He recalled watching in his family’s basement when the Canadians beat the U.S. in the gold medal game of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.\n\nAnd he hopes some kid in Nova Scotia was watching when the Americans and Canadians matched up on Saturday in Montreal, or again on Thursday night in Boston.\n\n“This will be another memory, another core memory for a lot of a lot of kids growing up, a lot of hockey fans for both American and Canadian players – and probably kids all across the world,” he said. “So it’s a gift and a privilege to play in these games. And definitely one you don’t take for granted.”\n\nThe 3-1 U.S. victory in the round-robin began with three fights in the first nine seconds, then settled into a fast-paced clinic that ranks among the top games in international hockey history.\n\nThe sequel “feels bigger than that,” Tkachuk said.\n\n“It’s going to be an incredible environment,” he said. “Obviously, wearing the jersey and representing your country is such an incredible honor and what we play for. But the opportunity that we have is something that – I don’t even think we thought was possible and what we could create.”\n\nThat’s what compelled Ted Sells to make a five-hour drive from his home in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, to a 12-hour flight through Calgary and Dallas to get to Boston for the title game. He wandered through the TD Garden pro shop looking for Canadian gear and saw none; a clerk told him they were sold out.\n\nSells said he hoped the teams could set aside the politics and just play hockey.\n\n“Everybody has their team and their favorite,” he said. “But they shake hands at the end. And that’s good.”\n\nAcross the store, James Kopacki said he had no animosity toward the Canadians; he was deciding whether to buy his wife, a Bruins fan, a Marchand jersey. The U.S. Navy veteran came up from Fort Worth, Texas, to watch the game, buying tickets after watching the Americans beat Canada in the opening round.\n\n“That game turned out to be so good. That’s why we’re here,” he said. “I’ve never seen a game like that, as far as the tension and the desire to win. And not just that: the tension between our countries.”\n\nKopacki said he spent $1,500 on the tickets, and he’s been monitoring the price as the hype increases.\n\n“If the tickets reach $5,000,” he said, “then we’re going to sell them and go to a bar in Boston and watch for free.”\n\nMATTHEW TKACHUK, HAGEL TRADE BARBS\n\nMatthew Tkachuk and Canada’s Brandon Hagel traded punches on Saturday night. Ahead of their rematch, they’re trading words.\n\nHagel said Tuesday that his fight with Tkachuk off the opening faceoff – one of three fights in the first nine seconds of Team USA’s electrifying win in Montreal – was done “for the flag and not the cameras.” He also called out U.S. players J.T. Miller and Matthew and Brady Tkachuk for preplanning their fights against Canada via group chat.\n\n“We don’t need to initiate anything. We don’t have any group chats going on. We’re going out there playing our game and then giving it everything and doing it for our country,” Hagel said, via Sportsnet. “We’re just going to play as hard as we can and do it for the flag on the chest.”\n\nMatthew Tkachuk was asked about Hagel’s comments on Wednesday morning.\n\n“Maybe their team doesn’t like each other then, if they don’t have group chats,” he said.\n\nTkachuk and Hagel are rivals in the NHL, as Tkachuk plays for the Florida Panthers and Hagel skates for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n“That’s just a player enjoying his opportunity. Our team does not care about anything that they say. There’s been a lot of chatter and talk from individuals, but we care about one thing in this room,” Tkachuk said. “We have millions of people that are watching us and supporting us around this country and we’re very prideful in playing for them. So it’s an opportunity of a lifetime for us.”\n\nQUINN HUGHES WILL NOT JOIN TEAM USA\n\nDefenseman Quinn Hughes will not travel to Boston to join the United States team as an injury replacement option for the championship game, ESPN reported on Wednesday.\n\nESPN, citing unnamed sources, reported that the Americans will have Buffalo Sabres center Tage Thompson and New Jersey Devils defenseman Brett Pesce as injury insurance for the title game.\n\nHughes, 25, was expected to join the Americans for the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game after defenseman Charlie McAvoy was lost for the tournament. McAvoy was hospitalized Monday with an infection in his right shoulder and a significant injury to his AC joint.\n\nHughes initially made Team USA’s roster but had to back out because of an oblique injury. He still hasn’t been officially cleared by the Vancouver Canucks to return to play, having been out of action since Jan. 31. He wore a red non-contact jersey in Canucks practice Tuesday before being cleared for contact for Wednesday’s practice.\n\nESPN reported that Hughes recently flew across the country back to Vancouver from the East Coast. To fly to Boston, and then to Las Vegas for the Canucks’ next game Saturday, would have been a taxing travel week for him.\n\nMcAvoy, 27, had been a key contributor to the American team in the international tournament whose big hits on Canadian stars Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby were credited with setting a tone in the round-robin matchup.\n\nTournament roster rules would allow a player replacement only if the team did not have enough “able-bodied” players to skate a full team. Even without McAvoy, the Americans do have the required six healthy defensemen.\n\nSullivan said he expects his other players, including brothers Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, to be available.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk seemed to be favoring his groin at practice on Wednesday. Brady Tkachuck, who left Monday’s game with an undisclosed injury, skipped practice entirely.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk said it wouldn’t keep him from playing.\n\n“It’s going to be an incredible game,” he said, “and I don’t want to miss it.”","summary":"Both teams are trying to skate back the geopolitical tension that has infiltrated the tournament as they look ahead to Thursday night’s championship

US jets on standby","text":"A UKRAINE peace plan drawn up by Sir Keir Starmer has been revealed proposals to put thousands of boots on the ground as tensions rise between Europe and the US.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister has backed Ukraine and outlined plans for a \"reassurance force\" after President Zelensky warned the West that it can either choose \"Putin or peace\".\n\nZelensky's fighting talk comes as Donald Trump blasted the heroic president as a \"dictator\" and a \"moderately successful\" comedian.\n\nThe US president slammed Zelensky for not holding an election during the conflict as he enters talks with Russia to bring a swift end to the war - a move that has sent world leaders into a tailspin.\n\nNot only is Ukraine feeling sidelined by Trump's actions, but so are European leaders who were not given a seat at the talks held between the US and Russia in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.\n\nStarmer is hoping to act as \"a bridge\" between the US and Europe when he meets with Trump in Washington next week where he is expected to present his peacekeeping plan to the President.\n\nThe PM is hoping to show how European forces could help enforce and protect any peace deal that is secured by the US to deter Russia from breaking the agreement.\n\nBut despite suggestions from Trump that Europe needs to be in charge of its own protection, the PM is expected to ask for American jets and weapons to be on standby in Eastern Europe under the plan.\n\nWestern officials briefed on the plans have signalled that a peacekeeping force to police a 1000km frontline could be as small as 30,000 troops.\n\nThis is despite Ukraine’s President Zelensky saying it would take at least 200,000 soldiers to deter a new Russian invasion.\n\nBut a senior western official said: “30,000 feels still on the high side, because the purpose of that force would be predominantly around reassurance and trying to instil some confidence in the Ukraine population and in the state.”\n\nHe said the troops would have specific tasks such as showing the world “that that nuclear power plants are now under an international security umbrella to allow the surveys to take place, to allow the maintenance to be caught up.”\n\nThese European-led soldiers would be deployed to various cities, ports, and other critical areas including commercial shipping routes in the Black Sea to keep the peace.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, one official said it will rely on \"technical monitoring\" from intelligence, surveillance, and information from drones and satellites to give a \"picture of what is going on.\" \n\nThis means that a much larger amount of troops is not needed, as leaders hope to find the right line between a force for deterrence and one seen as a threat.\n\nThe source added that the peacekeeping operation will be backed up with weapons to \"monitor and shoot those attacks down.\"\n\nThe plan, constructed between France and the UK, was presented to leaders in Paris this week at an emergency meeting in response to Trump beginning peace talks with Russia.\n\nThe sudden U-turn in US policy towards Russia had European leaders scrambling to take action amid fears that Trump will walk away from the situation once any deal is made.\n\nIt came after US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that Europe and Canada alone would be responsible for enforcing peacekeeping operations in Ukraine.\n\nTrump has also warned that putting boots on the ground could spark World War Three with Russia.\n\nUS 'BACKSTOP'\n\nStarmer is expected to talk to the President about the importance of the US staying involved in taking action against Russia as the conflict continues.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron who has also worked on the peacekeeping plan is also due to visit Washington next week to lobby Trump and claw back US support.\n\nIt comes as:\n\nZelensky said Trump was living in a 'disinformation bubble'Trump demanded elections in UkraineUkraine warned Vlad is 'bluffing' over talks with TrumpPutin blitzed Ukraine leaving 160k without powerNato held war games in RomaniaUS could withdraw troops from Nato's frontlineCould the 'Iron General' be the new president on Ukraine?\n\nAfter crisis talks in Paris, the PM highlighted how any peacekeeping mission would need a US backstop to deter a third attack from Russia.\n\n“The purpose of the backstop would be to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,” a Western official familiar with the plans told the Telegraph.\n\nUS support for the plan would most likely be through air power, with jets based in Poland and Romania in case of a breach of the agreement by Russia.\n\nHowever, it seems as though Trump is bringing Putin in from the cold and is starting to hold Europe and Nato at a distance.\n\nStarmer will be hoping Trump will agree to the backstop plan as US troops will not be required to be on the ground and the plan will not put Nato forces in direct confrontation with Russia.\n\nBut with Germany, Italy, and Spain opposed to deploying troops in Ukraine, Europe has few options and appears more fractured than ever.\n\nNATO is also eyeing talks about its mutual defense clause, where an attack on one member is considered an attack on all, a European official told The Telegraph.\n\nUNITED FRONT\n\nAs tensions continue to rise, the UK PM spoke to Zelensky on Thursday evening, stressing the need for \"everyone\" to work together, Downing Street has said. \n\nA spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister expressed his support for President Zelensky as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader and said that it was perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II.\n\n“The Prime Minister reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression.”\n\nIt was also revealed on Thursday that the UK is set to funnel an extra £1.5 billion in aid to Ukraine until a peace deal can be agreed. \n\nOfficials have pledged to send a total of £4.5billion to Ukraine this year after boosting the nation with £3billion each year since the conflict began in 2022.\n\nThe additional funding to \"keep Ukraine in the fight until they get peace\" will be taken from unfrozen Russian assets.\n\nIt is thought that the aid will help Ukraine find \"peace through strength\".\n\nZelenksy said he is \"counting on Ukrainian unity\" as well as the \"unity of Europe\" and the \"pragmatism of America\" for victory.\n\nHe added that Ukraine has wanted an end to the war from \"the very first second that\" Russia invaded in February 2022 and that he wants a peace deal that will ensure Moscow will not attack again.\n\n\"I am confident that we will end it, and with a lasting peace. And so that Russia cannot come to Ukraine again, and so that Ukrainians return from Russian captivity, and so that Ukraine has a future. This is a normal desire of every nation,\" he said.\n\nHe also thanked the UK and Starmer for support saying \"we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens.\"\n\nBritain and Kyiv's European allies have also vowed to keep Ukraine “in the fight” as the US continued talks with Russia and Zelensky calls for \"security guarantees\".","summary":"","url":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14368220/starmer-peace-plan-ukraine-troops/","image":"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-mv2ezhbn6-1740012571924.jpg?1740012817&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:51:24","author":"Emma Crabtree,Jerome Starkey","authors":["Emma Crabtree","Jerome Starkey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":292326406,"title":"It’s not your imagination, Trump siding with Putin on Ukraine is scary","text":"Donald Trump’s vindictive and personal attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows us the US president has now fully adopted the propaganda of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin – a significant and scary moment in world affairs.\n\nTrump’s dismissal of Zelensky as a “modestly successful comedian” and a “dictator without elections” comes straight from Kremlin talking points.

But it has to be done in line with the tripartite agreement signed by the governments of Chad, Nigeria and the United Nations Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Worthy of note is that the repatriation process has started with 3,000 refugees brought back to Nigeria from Chad. That came into effect with the remarkable assistance from Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State.\n\nThere was the promise made by the NCFRMI that Cameroon will follow suit. Also reiterating the support of the UNHCR, the Deputy Representative in Nigeria, Bernadette Muteshu, stated that the agency was committed to ensuring that the agreement signed by both countries – Chad and Nigeria – was strictly adhered to. She, however, called on them to be there as strong shoulders to lean on when needed, especially in seeing the repatriation to its logical conclusion. But there are apprehensions on the likelihood of a repeat scenario of the large number of Nigerian citizens leaving the country, sooner than later.\n\nThat is the concern of experts on the economy, more so if the challenges of high inflation rate of goods and services persist. The need for preventive measures to be put firmly in place is because of what transpired in 2024.\n\nAs reflected in the video clip that went viral some 40,000 Nigerians were caught rushing to the Republic of Niger, traceable to the sweeping hunger and starvation in the land. It was the perilous period of economic dire strait that led to the #EndBadGovernance protests that hit the streets of Kano, Sokoto down south to Oyo and Lagos.\n\nAlthough some of those involved were youth caught stranded as they could not make their way to Europe en route through some African countries, the rising tide of the flaming questions cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand. Such questions demanding urgent and sustainable answers to the current economic quagmire include finding and addressing the causative factors of the hardship in the land.\n\nAnd that is because it was all preventable! How do we grapple with, and fashion the way out of hunger in the midst of the insecurity conundrum? What has been the missing link between the vast natural resources God has abundantly blessed the country with and the abysmally low Human Development Index (HDI)? One of the credible answers to the questions is the holistic restructuring and the enthronement of fiscal responsibility in the entity called Nigeria.\n\nMuch as President Tinubu has been hailed by some as mustering the political courage to “take some hard decisions”, with regards to fuel subsidy removal, and coming up with the tax reforms issue, he is yet to face the fact of giving a nod to the long call for restructuring the country. With it, the enormous powers at the Federal Government centre would be devolved to the federating geo-political zones. That would serve as a catalyst for the zones to have full access to and control of their natural resources, as well as ignite the spirit of positive competition amongst them.\n\nIt would of course, bring out the best in them as it took place amongst the then regions of the North, East and West. Another important decision to take is to ensure that the principles of accountability, transparency and probity are put into full practice with regards to how public funds are spent. All those found culpable in corrupt practices should be made to face the full wrath of the law to serve as deterrence to others. That is no matter how highly placed they might be.\n\nWe should do away with the obnoxious concept of the untouchables, primarily based on political and ethno-religious sentiments. To shape the socio-economic dynamics of the future generations, so as to make them believe in the huge economic potentials of Nigeria, and stay back to develop the country, instead of the self-decimating ‘japa syndrome’ our leaders must lead by example both in words and actions. All these will cumulatively lead to a drastic reduction in the number of Nigerian refugees in the neighbouring countries.","summary":"ShareThe recent disclosure made by the Federal Commissioner of the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI), Tijani Ahmed, to the effect that over 400,000 Nigerian refugees currently reside in Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon is not only worrisome but demands an urgent intervention on the part of government and other stakeholders....\n\n\nThe post Challenge Of Repatriating 400,000 Nigerians From Niger, Chad, Cameroon appeared first on New Telegraph.","url":"https://newtelegraphng.com/challenge-of-repatriating-400000-nigerians-from-niger-chad-cameroon/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screen-Shot-2025-02-19-at-4.52.32-PM.png?fit=574%2C371&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:49:50","author":"New Telegraph-Admin","authors":["New Telegraph-Admin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":292323000,"title":"Trump’s Plan & More – Hollywood Life","text":"President Donald Trump declared himself the “King” on social media, claiming he has ended NYC’s controversial congestion pricing amid rising costs.\n\nOn Wednesday, after a letter from his transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, was sent to New York Governor Kathy Hochul, ending the transportation department’s agreement with the state over the new congestion pricing program for Manhattan, Trump wrote on Truth Social:\n\n“CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”\n\nBut the question of whether Trump and his administration can successfully stop the toll program remains uncertain. Learn more about the tolls and the likelihood the President can keep his promise.\n\nWhat Is the Cost of NYC’s Congestion Toll?\n\nThe program, which began on January 5, imposes a $9 toll for drivers entering Lower and Midtown Manhattan, and a $2.25 toll overnight.

Trucks and buses are charged between $14.40 and $21.60 for each entry into the zone.\n\nMotorcyclists are also subject to a toll—$4.50 during peak times and $1.05 overnight, with the toll applied once daily.\n\nWhere Are NYC’s Congestion Tolls Located?\n\nAccording to the NYC 311 website, vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone, which includes local streets and avenues in Manhattan south of and including 60th Street, are being charged a toll.\n\nCan President Trump End NYC Congestion Pricing?\n\nTrump’s social media post has sparked mixed reactions, with some celebrating his bold statement and others opposing it. Ultimately, the question remains how much power the “King” truly has to maintain his promise.\n\nBefore his election, Trump pledged to “terminate” congestion pricing and has faced pressure from local members of Congress to do so. However, attempting to halt the program is likely to trigger a legal battle, as New York State and the MTA plan to sue to prevent it from being stopped.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday with MTA leadership, Governor Hochul responded to Trump’s “long live the king” comment posted on social media.\n\n“I’m here to say, New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years, and we are not, we sure as hell are not gonna start now.

This only served to anger the US President, who made a number of unfounded claims about aid money going missing while trying to pressure Mr Zelensky into calling an election – a key demand of Vladimir Putin.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, who is due to travel to Washington next week, did not issue a direct rebuke of Mr Trump’s attack.\n\nBut in a thinly veiled swipe, he told Mr Zelensky during a phone call last night that he backed him as Ukraine’s ‘democratically elected’ leader.\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch issued a more direct statement, saying: ‘President Zelensky is not a dictator. He is the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin’s illegal invasion.

It is my sincere hope the whole political spectrum in the UK will speak with one voice in opposition to Trump’s lies.’\n\nFormer Tory foreign secretary James Cleverly said: ‘The USA is a friend and ally. But we must be honest and courageous when we disagree.’\n\nMr Trump’s tirade came after Mr Zelensky hit back over US demands for access to billions of dollars’ worth of Ukraine’s natural resources and infrastructure as the price of lasting peace.\n\nVowing not to ‘sell our state’, he said Mr Trump was living in a ‘disinformation bubble’ after the US President told Kyiv, in response to it being frozen out of negotiations so far: ‘Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it… you should have never started it.’\n\nHours later, in an outburst on his Truth Social site, Mr Trump raged: ‘A Dictator without Elections, Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to have a country left.’\n\nHe added: ‘I love Ukraine, but Zelensky has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues.’\n\nThe total death toll of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, alongside Ukrainian civilians, stands at almost 150,000, according to the latest figures from Kyiv, the UN and BBC Russia.\n\nParroting unproven claims from Russia in the early days of the war that Western money was being siphoned off, Mr Trump said ‘Zelensky probably wants to keep the “gravy train” going ... Zelensky admits that half of the money we sent him is “MISSING”.\n\n‘Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelensky, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and “TRUMP,” will never be able to settle’, the President blasted.\n\nEuropean nations have spent more on Ukraine than the US. Washington has in fact spent around $120billion [£95billion] on the war, if all types of aid – military, humanitarian and other financial aid – are included, much less than the $350billion he claimed.\n\nWithin moments Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said: ‘We will defend our right to exist.’\n\nGerman premier Olaf Scholz said Mr Trump’s comments were ‘wrong and dangerous’, adding: ‘What is correct is that Volodymyr Zelensky is the elected head of state of Ukraine.’\n\nMr Trump also faced condemnation in his own country. John Bolton, who served as his national security adviser in his first administration, said: ‘Trump’s characterisations of Zelensky and Ukraine are some of the most shameful remarks ever made by a US president.’\n\nMr Trump’s deputy, JD Vance, however, accused Mr Zelensky of acting ‘disgracefully’ over his ‘disinformation’ comments. He said dealing with grievances publicly was ‘not a good way to deal with President Trump’.\n\nYesterday Putin said he was pleased with progress. ‘I was briefed [on the talks].

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday will arrive in Johannesburg to take part in a two-day Group of Twenty ministerial meeting.\n\nSouth Africa is holding presidency in the Group of Twenty this year, being the first African country to host G20 events.\n\nLavrov’s visit to South Africa will take place shortly after the milestone Russian-US talks in Riyadh and the G20 top diplomats are likely to want to learn about them firsthand. According to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, Lavrov plans to hold a series of bilateral meetings in Johannesburg.\n\nExperts don’t rule out that other Western countries may follow the United States’ lead and ask for a meeting with Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 event. The Russian side has always said that it is ready for dialogue if foreign ministers are interested in it. However, Western officials have been demonstratively avoided meeting with the top Russian diplomat during the past three years.\n\nScandal with the US\n\nA difficult situation is unfolding around another participant in the Riyadh talks - US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has decided to skip the meeting in Johannesburg amid a scandal in bilateral relations between Washington and Pretoria.\n\nOn February 7, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to stop assistance to South Africa and accused that country’s leadership of discriminating the white population and plans to seize lands from farmers. He also lambasted the South African side for filing a lawsuit against Israel with the UN International Court of Justice in December 2023, accusing the Israeli side of staging genocide in the Gaza Strip.\n\nRubio said he would not take part in the G20 meeting due to South Africa’s anti-American policy. He also criticized the meeting’s agenda. Pretoria officially invited Washington to discuss the situation and requested explanations from it, but no response has followed as of yet.\n\nThe meeting’s agenda\n\nSpeaking to Russian lawmakers, Lavrov noted that the G20 should be used to \"teach Western counterparts to work in a mutually respectful manner, rather than impose their unilateral approaches and prescriptions.\" He noted that Russia and its BRICS partners, as well as other countries of the global South are managing to contain the West’s attempts within the G20 \"to Ukrainize the agenda, impose discriminatory economic, financial, trade, and climate solutions.\"\n\nSouth Africa, as the host country, plans to offer a really unifying agenda for discussions. Thus, according to Zakharova, South Africa’s priorities are called to promote economic growth, reduce inequality and disbalances, ensure fair access to financing for countries of the global South.\n\nSpecial attention is expected to be focused on the international situation, which \"is degrading because of the confrontational policy of the neoliberal Western elites.\"\n\nLavrov’s speech\n\nThe top Russian diplomat will address his G20 counterpart with a detailed analysis of the international situation, with a focus on the root causes of the critical conflicts and will outline concrete steps to overcome them.\n\n\"It is also planned to once again call for ensuring the openness of the global economy, rejecting trade wars, illegitimate, criminal sanctions and other manifestations of unfair competition,\" Zakharova noted. \"The Russian side will reiterate its course toward ensuring the United Nations’ central role in global affairs and, naturally, will once again stress the need for observing the United Nations Charter.\"\n\nApart from that, in her words, Lavrov will also speak about those associations \"that develop fair, productive relations without dictation and blackmail, such as the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and BRICS.\" \"And, naturally, special attention will be paid to Russia’s initiative of greater Eurasian partnership,\" she added.","summary":"Lavrov’s visit to South Africa will take place shortly after the milestone Russian-US talks in Riyadh","url":"https://tass.com/politics/1916175","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:36:44","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"RU","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":292325946,"title":"Indonesia Industrial Coal Power Plans Undercut Emissions Pledge: Report","text":"Indonesia's planned expansion of \"captive\" coal plants used to power industry is threatening its pledge to cut CO2 emissions by 2030 and close all coal-fired plants by a decade later, said a report published Thursday.Coal-dependent Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, is one of the world's top emitters but President Prabowo Subianto last year committed to phasing out coal in just 15 years and reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.Indonesia's new national electricity master plan announced in November projects growth in renewables but also a sharp rise in coal generation beyond 2030, according to a report by London-based energy think tank Ember.The new plan raises \"concerns that Indonesia's latest electricity masterplan could significantly increase coal power generation\", Ember said.

In a statement this week to The Wall Street Journal, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “The Kennedy Center learned the hard way that if you go woke, you will go broke. President Trump and the members of his newly-appointed board are devoted to rebuilding the Kennedy Center into a thriving and highly respected institution where all Americans, and visitors from around the world, can enjoy the arts with respect to America’s great history and traditions.”\n\nWhat is the Kennedy Center and how long has it been around?\n\nSupported by government money and private donations and attracting millions of visitors each year, the center is a 100-foot high complex featuring a concert hall, opera house and theater, along with a lecture hall, meeting spaces and a “Millennium Stage” that has been the site for free shows.\n\nThe center’s very origins are bipartisan.\n\nIt was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a “National Culture Center.” In the early 1960s, Democrat President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.\n\nConstruction began in 1965 and the center formally opened six years later, with a premiere of Leonard Bernstein’s “Mass,” otherwise known as “MASS: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers).”\n\nWho has performed at the Kennedy Center?\n\nThe center has long been a showcase for theater, music and dramatic performances, with artists ranging from the Paul Taylor Dance Company to a joint concert by Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga. Other highlights have included the annual Mark Twain Award for comedy, with recipients including Lorne Michaels, Tina Fey and Bob Newhart, and the annual Kennedy Center ceremony honoring outstanding artists, most recently Francis Ford Coppola, Bonnie Raitt and the Grateful Dead, among others.\n\nPresidents have routinely attended the honors ceremony, even in the presence of artists who disagreed with them politically. The good-natured spirit was well captured in 2002, during Republican President George W. Bush’s first term, when Steve Martin offered tribute to honoree Paul Simon. Martin digressed into a tangent about pirated music recordings and joked that he had been approached by Bush about getting bootlegs of Barbra Streisand, a prominent Democrat.\n\n“It’s been nice being a citizen,” Martin added, as Bush and others laughed in response.\n\nWhy is Trump focusing on the Kennedy Center now?\n\nTrump mostly ignored the center during his first term, becoming the first president to routinely skip the honors ceremony. One honoree, producer Norman Lear, had threatened not to attend if Trump was there.\n\nMirroring his overall governing approach, Trump has been far more aggressive and proactive in his second term, citing some drag show performances at the center as a reason to transform it entirely.\n\n“At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN,” he wrote on his social media website earlier this month. “I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Kennedy Center website still includes a passage about the core mission, one that strives “to ensure that the education and outreach programs and policies of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts meet the highest level of excellence and reflect the cultural diversity of the United States.”\n\nAlso listed on the site is a new project called “Promise of US,” for which “the public is invited to submit an artistic self-portrait to be part of a virtual wall of faces expressing the myriad diversity of America’s peoples and the promise of America’s future. This ever-expanding mosaic will be featured on the Center’s website and social channels.”\n\nWho is in charge now?\n\nTrump pushed out the incumbent board chair David M. Rubenstein, a philanthropist and Baltimore Orioles owner. He now presides over a board that by tradition was divided between Democratic and Republican appointees, but is now predominantly Republican, with recent additions including Attorney General Pam Bondi, country star Lee Greenwood and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n\nKennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter, brought on by Rubenstein in 2014, resigned soon after the board shakeup. Trump replaced her, on an interim basis, with diplomat Richard Grenell, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Germany during the president’s first term.\n\n“I’m really, really, really sad about what happens to our artists, what happens on our stages and our staff who support them,” Rutter said during a recent interview with NPR. “The Kennedy Center is meant to be a beacon for the arts in all of America across the country.”\n\nWhat has been the fallout?\n\nThe fallout is unprecedented. Kennedy Center consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Renée Fleming have resigned and actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny have canceled appearances. During a concert last weekend that proceeded as scheduled, singer-songwriter Victoria Clark wore a T-shirt reading “ANTI TRUMP AF.”\n\nFurther controversy is possible. Next month’s schedule includes “RIOT! Funny Women Stand Up, a special comedy event in celebration of Women’s History Month.” Conan O’Brien is to receive the Twain award in an all-star event that will likely include jokes about the president. (Representatives for O’Brien have not responded to requests for comment.) The center also is scheduled to host “Eureka Day,” a stage play centered on an outbreak of mumps, a sensitive topic with the confirmation of vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.","summary":"'The Kennedy Center learned the hard way that if you go woke, you will go broke,' the White House press secretary said.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/19/kennedy-center-trump/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trump_Kennedy_Center_76426.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:35:49","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.299},{"id":292325618,"title":"Historic Plummet in Illegal Border Crossings Reveals the Root Cause of the Biden Border Crisis","text":"The massive flood of illegal aliens across the southern border has become a trickle, disappearing almost as swiftly as it first emerged four years ago.\n\nThe Daily Signal’s Fred Lucas reported on Tuesday that, according to the White House and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the number of border apprehensions in January fell to the lowest point in five years.\n\nFebruary looks to have even lower numbers than January. According to the New York Post, “about 359 illegal migrants per day have been caught across the entire southern border — down more than 90% from February 2024.”\n\n“Total illegal border crossings for fiscal year 2025 are on track to fall to the lowest rates since 1968,” Lucas reported. On Monday, President Donald Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, noted how remarkably quiet the border has suddenly become.\n\nIsn’t it interesting how quickly the issue at the border has begun to solve itself now that we have a president who is willing to uphold the law? It seems even before he returned to office, potential border crossers got the message they wouldn’t be here to stay.\n\nIf you recall, the Biden administration insisted for years that there was no crisis at the border and that it was “secure.”\n\nNot only was there a very real crisis, but given the timing of the surge at the southern border and now its sudden halt, it seems clear that this whole thing was intentionally fabricated. The Biden border problem wasn’t merely a result of incompetence, it was the product of an intentional subversion of U.S. immigration laws.\n\nIn some of his first official acts Biden as president, Biden decimated Trump’s border policies. The Daily Signal reported in 2021 that the “Biden administration immediately stopped wall construction, ended the Remain in Mexico program, tore up the Cooperative Asylum Agreements, started releasing illegal aliens into the U.S., and ended 90% of Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals.”\n\nThe result was four years of mayhem. The border was completely overrun. Cities across the country were filled to the brim with illegal aliens and were begging the Biden administration for help.\n\nIn 2021 the Biden administration enlisted Vice President Kamala Harris in a mission to uncover the “root causes” of illegal immigration from South and Central America. Whether she identified those root causes or not, the problem not only continued, it exploded.\n\nA new record for illegal border crossings was set nearly every year of the Biden presidency.\n\nAccording to an October report from the House Homeland Security Committee, federal law enforcement encountered nearly 11 million illegal aliens crossing the border since Biden took office.\n\nTo put those numbers in perspective, this is more people than the entire population of all but seven states according to the 2020 census.\n\nWhen the border issue became politically toxic, the Biden administration attempted to create the appearance of orderliness while doing nothing to stem the real “root cause” of the problem: their insistence that border enforcement was fundamentally illegitimate.\n\nThe only significant thing the Biden White House did in four years was to insist that Congress pass legislation to send money to mostly Democrat-run cities (and Ukraine) and to codify the catastrophic new border policies into law. This was billed as an attempt to solve the problem that they had loudly insisted didn’t exist.\n\nIt wasn’t a solution, it was a farce meant to distract the American people and construct a sophist argument that it was really Republicans who didn’t want border security. That argument was about as believable as Biden’s absurd claim that Republicans were the ones who wanted to defund the police.\n\nI do believe that peddling these fantasies and the legacy media’s complicity in promoting them are at least part of the reason Trump marched back into the White House in January with even more support than his first go around.\n\nThe bottom line is that the stunning turnaround at the border is primarily due to two simple factors. The Biden administration didn’t want to uphold the law, and Trump does. As the Washington Examiner noted on Wednesday, it didn’t take any new legislation from Congress to see immediate and spectacular changes at the border.\n\n“Biden did not need new legislation, as he had claimed, to push Mexico to help strengthen the border,” editors at the Examiner wrote. “Trump did not need congressional action to reinstate his successful Remain in Mexico policy. Congress can still improve our immigration system, but Biden’s claims that his hands were tied by limited resources dictated by Congress was always a lie.”\n\nThe problem for the Trump administration going forward is what to do about the millions of people now living illegally in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden administration and its immigration activist supporters no doubt hoped that by bringing in so many people, they would make it both messy and unpopular to attempt to deport even a small percentage of them.\n\nBut so far, Trump’s border policies seem more popular than ever. Biden’s border madness created a historic vibe shift. It’s up to the Trump administration to clean up the mess.","summary":"The massive flood of illegal aliens across the southern border has become a trickle, disappearing almost as swiftly as it first emerged four years ago....

The commander-in-chief gave himself one more honorific while gloating over the potential end of New York City's congestion pricing: king. \n\nTrump crowned himself in a celebratory post to Truth Social, in which the outer-borough-born mogul prematurely announced that tolls for traveling by car into the busiest parts of Manhattan were dead.\n\n\"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED,\" he wrote. \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\"\n\nThat announcement was also posted by the official White House account on X, adding an image of the president in front of the New York skyline with a crown on his head.\n\nThe post follows similarly concerning statements from Trump earlier this week, in which the president seemingly declared himself above the law. \n\nThe crowing came after Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy sent a letter to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, announcing that an agreement allowing the tolls between the state and the Federal Highway Administration had been rescinded. Duffy called congestion pricing \"a slap in the face to working-class Americans\" and \"backwards.\" \n\n\"Commuters using the highway system to enter New York City have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes. But now the toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative, and instead, takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways,\" he wrote. \"Every American should be able to access New York City regardless of their economic means. It shouldn't be reserved for an elite few.\"\n\nHochul initially shared a message stating simply that the toll cameras were \"staying on.\" In a subsequent press release and press conference, the governor rejected Trump calling himself a king and said that the Trump administration was attacking the state's sovereignty.\n\n\"New York hasn’t labored under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to start now,\" Hochul said. \"We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington.\" \n\nNew York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority — the agency responsible for public transit in the city — immediately sued the Trump administration over their attempt to kill congestion pricing. At a press conference on Wednesday, MTA head Janno Lieber defended the program.\n\n\"We tried gridlock for 60 years. It didn't work,\" he said. \"It cost our economy billions. But you know what's helping our economy? What's making New York a better place?

In a news conference this week, Trump also incorrectly said that Ukraine started the war with Russia.\"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues.....,\" Trump concluded in a post to Truth Social on Wednesday.What To KnowIn The Economist/YouGov poll surveying over 1,600 U.S. adults from February 16-18, both Trump and Zelensky scored a 47 percent favorable opinion. Trump has a 49 percent unfavorable rating compared to Zelensky's 28 percent. The poll has a 3.3 percent margin of error.Zelensky is seen the most favorably by Americans age 65 and older, with 60 percent, while Trump is viewed most favorably among whites, with 54 percent, the poll shows.Last week's Economist/YouGov poll showed Trump's favorability at 46 percent, with an unfavorable rating of 52 percent.Trump's favorability ratings have been inching closer to a net positive since winning the presidential election in November, according to polling aggregate 538.What People Are SayingTrump posted to Truth Social on Wednesday, in part: \"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn't be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and 'TRUMP,' will never be able to settle. The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe's money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn't Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe than it is to us — We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation.\"On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is 'MISSING.' He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle.' A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only 'TRUMP,' and the Trump Administration, can do.

Over the next five years, this would amount to approximately $290 billion in reductions, according to reports from US media on Wednesday.\nPentagon Ordered to Develop Cost-Cutting Plans\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has instructed the Pentagon to develop these deep spending cuts, as reported by The Washington Post, which cited an internal memo.\nCurrently, the Pentagon’s budget for 2025 stands at around $850 billion. While lawmakers from both parties recognize the necessity of this funding to counter global threats, particularly from China and Russia, the proposed cuts would reduce this figure to about $560 billion by the end of the five-year period.\nUncertainty Over Areas Targeted for Cuts\nDetails about which sectors of the military will see reductions remain unclear. However, an earlier report from The Washington Post indicated that the focus would be on junior civilian workers rather than uniformed personnel.\nThe announcement of these budget cuts follows a reported visit to the Pentagon last week by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from military officials and members of Congress.\nImpact on Defense Contractors\nNews of the potential budget cuts briefly impacted the stock prices of major US defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Investors reacted to the possibility of reduced government contracts in the coming years.\nPriorities and Exemptions in the Budget Cuts\nAccording to Hegseth’s memo, the Pentagon must present its proposed cuts by February 24. The plan includes 17 specific categories that President Trump wants to exempt from reductions. These include border security operations and the modernization of nuclear weapons and missile defense systems. Funding is also expected to continue for regional commands such as the Indo-Pacific Command and Space Command.\nHowever, certain major centers are notably absent from the exemption list, including European Command, which plays a key role in US strategy regarding the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, Africa Command and Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, were not mentioned as priorities.\nTrump’s Vision for Military Reform\nIn the memo dated Tuesday, Hegseth emphasized the need for urgent action to reform the military. “The Defense Department must act urgently to revive the warrior ethos, rebuild our military, and reestablish deterrence,” he wrote.\nHe further outlined that the budget would focus on creating a more effective fighting force, cutting unnecessary expenditures, reducing bureaucracy, and making meaningful progress toward completing a full financial audit.\nALSO READ: Double Engine Government In Delhi: What It Means For The National Capital?","summary":"The Trump administration has directed senior US military leaders to prepare for significant budget cuts that could reduce defense spending by up to eight percent annually","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/donald-trump-administrations-new-direction-petagon-to-plan-major-defense-budget-cuts/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trumpppp-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:28:07","author":"Srishti Mukherjee","authors":["Srishti Mukherjee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.222},{"id":292323566,"title":"The actual truth behind Trump's social post that took aim at Zelenskyy","text":"Donald Trump has ratcheted up his language towards Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a \"dictator\" just a day after blaming him for the war Russia is waging against Ukraine.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump has made broad statements about Mr Zelenskyy's performance as a leader, saying he had done a \"terrible job\", but also reached for personal comments about the Ukraine president's former career.\n\nThere has been significant response to the statement, most notably from Mr Zelenskyy himself and European leaders.\n\nWe have seen Americans respond too, including those who support Mr Trump's approach as well as those who are alarmed at the extent to which their president is willing to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and to publicly admonish Ukraine.\n\nThis is a break down of what Mr Trump said in his Truth Social post.\n\nHere is the post exactly as he published it:\n\nThere is some speculation Mr Trump's post is in response to comments from Mr Zelenskyy overnight that the US president was living in a \"disinformation space\" created by Russia.\n\nNow there appears to be a war of words over a real life conflict that has cost thousands of lives.\n\nHere are some key points to note when considering what Mr Trump has said, and to help understand just how significant this language is coming from the president of the United States as the world hangs in this delicate moment.\n\n1. Trump starts by getting personal\n\nTrump: \"Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy … \"\n\nThis is Mr Trump's commentary on Mr Zelenskyy's pre-political life when he was an actor and comedian.\n\nAmong other projects, Mr Zelenskyy starred in a series television series about a lovable high school teacher fed up with corrupt politicians who accidentally became president.\n\nMr Trump's path to presidency also stopped by the silver screen.\n\nHowever, despite the similar plotlines of their political origin stories, Mr Trump appeared to use Mr Zelenskyy's history to pass judgement on him.\n\nStarting his message on Truth Social with this apparent shade towards Mr Zelenskyy set a tone about the personal and increasingly controversial accusations Mr Trump would then go on to make.\n\n2. Trump claims US has given hundreds of billions more than Europe\n\nTrump: \"The United States has spent $200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe's money is guaranteed, while the United States will get nothing back. Why didn't Sleepy Joe Biden demand Equalization, in that this War is far more important to Europe that it is to us — We have a big, beautiful Ocean as separation.\"\n\nMr Trump has said repeatedly over the past week that the US got a bad deal out of its funding of Ukraine's defence effort.\n\nHe has expressed frustration over his belief the US is giving more overall, but the numbers around support for Ukraine are much more complex than Mr Trump has made out.\n\nThe US is the single biggest contributor, but collectively the nations and institutions of Europe have contributed slightly more, according to recent analysis from the Kiel Institute.\n\nIn his post today, Mr Trump claimed the US had spent $US200 billion ($315 billion) more than Europe on the effort in Ukraine.\n\nWhat we can look at is the different types of aid Ukraine is receiving to get a sense of the numbers.\n\nThe US outstrips individual European nations several times over, having contributed nearly 120 billion euros, or $US125 billion ($196 billion), according to Kiel Institute analysis released this month.\n\nAnalysis from the institute's Ukraine Support Tracker, broke the support down into military, financial and humanitarian aid.\n\n\"Europe as a whole has clearly overtaken the US in terms of Ukraine aid,\" a release from February 14 said.\n\n\"In total, Europe has allocated 70 billion euros ($115 billion) in financial and humanitarian aid as well as 62 billion euros ($102 billion) in military aid.\n\n\"This compares to 64 billion euros ($105 billion) in military aid from the US as well as 50 billion euros ($82 billion) in financial and humanitarian allocations.\"\n\nThe Kiel Institute analysis of European aid includes contributions from European Union members, European institutions, as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Kiel figures put the total US contribution at $187 billion.\n\nUS Ukraine Oversight documents note the Washington contribution to September last year as being $288 billion.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the US Ukraine response funding totals nearly $US183 billion ($288 billion), with $US124 billion ($195 billion) of that being spent by the Department of Defense, according US Ukraine Oversight.\n\nThere is no apparent source for the claim the US has given $US200 billion more than Europe.\n\nMr Trump also said: \"On top of this, Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is 'missing.'\"\n\nIt is unclear what Mr Trump is referring to, but on Tuesday, local time, at a press conference in Florida he said this issue had come up during a conversation with Mr Zelenskyy.\n\n\"I believe President Zelenskyy said last week that he doesn't know where half of the money is that we gave him,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to equalise with Europe, because Europe has given … a very much smaller percentage than that.\n\n\"Where is all the money that's been given? Where is it going? … I've never seen an accounting of it.\"\n\n3. Trump calls Zelenskyy a 'dictator'\n\nTrump: \"He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden \"like a fiddle.\" A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"\n\nUkraine is under attack from Russia and declared martial law as the war began three years ago.\n\nMr Zelenskyy's term was due to come to an end last year, but under the Ukrainian constitution, elections are legally suspended while it defends itself.\n\nAccording to the United Nations refugee agency, some 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees have been registered worldwide since February 2022.\n\nOf those, millions remain outside the country due to the war. It would be nearly impossible for all of those who have been displaced to participate in an election, potentially robbing millions of their right to vote.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Mr Trump calling Mr Zelenskyy \"a dictator without elections\" was \"false and dangerous\", German newspaper Spiegel reported.\n\n\"It is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelenskyy his democratic legitimacy,\" Mr Scholz said.\n\nYesterday, Mr Trump blamed Ukraine for starting the war, and over the past week he has referenced Mr Zelenskyy's polling performance several times and his belief there was a need for an election.\n\nFormer UK prime minister Boris Johnson offered a firm response, saying: \"Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections.\n\n\"There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course Zelenskyy's ratings are not 4 per cent. They are actually about the same as Trump's.\n\n\"Trump's statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action.\"\n\nMr Zelenskyy \"retains a fairly high level of public trust\" — about 57 per cent — according to a report released on Wednesday by the Kyiv International Institution of Sociology.\n\n4. Trump makes signal on Ukraine role in peace talks\n\nTrump: \" … we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only \"TRUMP,\" and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the \"gravy train\" going.\"\n\nIt was a week ago when US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shocked Europe when he said it was \"unrealistic\" for Ukraine to expect to return to its internationally recognised border and the land it held before 2014, when Russia took Crimea and before its march towards Kyiv three years ago.\n\nThat same day Mr Trump announced he'd spoken to Vladimir Putin and negotiations to end the war would begin, with the US leading those talks.\n\nSince then, there has been a nervousness about how involved the US would permit both Ukraine and Europe to be in the process.\n\nDespite some moves by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to insist there would come a time for them both to be at the table, Mr Trump's statement today appears to insist America will handle it.\n\nHe says \"we are successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia\". This language is important.\n\nThis war was started by Russia and Vladimir Putin's forces now occupy about 20 per cent of Ukraine and are slowly but steadily gaining more territory in the east, according to Reuters.\n\nUkraine has fired into Russia and last year moved across the border itself to occupy the Russian town of Sudzha, but Russia is the aggressor.\n\nMr Trump's line that \"only Trump and the Trump Administration\" can negotiate with Russia to end the war will do little to reassure Ukraine and Europe they will have a seat at the table when a deal is made about the future of their region.\n\nAnd today's statement comes after Mr Trump falsely claimed Ukraine started the war.\n\nMr Johnson said this: \"Of course Ukraine didn't start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor.\"\n\nIn terms of negotiations, there is still little indication the Kremlin is serious.\n\nIn its assessment of the conflict released Wednesday night, local time, the Institute for the Study of War said: \"Many recent Russian statements show that Putin remains uninterested in engaging in good faith negotiations and retains his objective of destroying the Ukrainian state while the Kremlin has offered no public indication that it would materially compromise.\"\n\n5. Trump's claim about the number of lives lost\n\nTrump: \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died.\"\n\nNo estimates by any reputable analysis place deaths near the millions.\n\nWhile exact figures of the number of deaths are unknown, Mr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the start of the full-scale war in February 2022.\n\nHe has also said that \"tens of thousands of civilians\" had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but that no exact figures would be available until the war was over.\n\nThe most recent data from the Russian Defense Ministry, published in January 2023, pointed to just more than 6,000 military deaths, although reports from US and UK officials put that number significantly higher.","summary":"Here are some key points to note when considering what Donald Trump has said, and to help understand just how significant this language is coming from the president of the United States as the world hangs in this delicate moment. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/donald-trump-truth-social-post-zelenskyy-explained/104958416","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cda31fd3b7cc229472471c2d888d4a36?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=720&cropW=1280&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:27:21","author":"Emily Clark","authors":["Emily Clark"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.003},{"id":292319674,"title":"Vehicle price hike looms as US plans 25% tariff","text":"Freight forwarders have said that Nigerian vehicle importers may be spending more following the plans by US President, Donald Trump to impose auto tariffs “in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent” and similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.\n\nAccording to Reuters on Wednesday, this is the latest in a series of measures threatening to upend international trade.\n\nTrump said the levies on automobiles would come as soon as April 2, “the day after members of his cabinet are due to deliver reports to him outlining options for a range of import duties as he seeks to reshape global trade.”\n\nTrump has long railed against what he calls the unfair treatment of US automotive exports in foreign markets.\n\n“The European Union, for instance, collects a 10 per cent duty on vehicle imports, four times the US passenger car tariff rate of 2.5 per cent. The US, though, collects a 25 per cent tariff on pickup trucks from countries other than Mexico and Canada, a tax that makes the vehicles highly profitable for Detroit automakers,” the report stated.\n\nReacting to the development, the Head of the Department of Shipping and Terminals of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, Mr Nnadi Ugochukwu, said the decision by the US President would definitely affect vehicle importation into Nigeria. \n\n“Yes, it will definitely affect vehicle importation into Nigeria because most of the cars that come into Nigeria are from the US. So if they are buying it higher it means they will be selling it higher to Nigerians,” Nnadi said.\n\nThe Reuters report stated that the European Union Trade Chief Maros Sefcovic, would meet with US counterparts – Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to be US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the various tariffs threatened by Trump.\n\nAsked whether the EU could avoid reciprocal tariffs he proposed last week, Trump repeated his claim that the EU had already signalled it would lower its tariffs on US cars to the US rate, although EU lawmakers have denied doing so.\n\nHe said he would press EU officials to increase US imports of cars and other products.\n\nTrump also told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago Estate in Florida on Tuesday that sectoral tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductor chips would also start at 25 per cent or higher rising substantially over the course of a year.\n\nThe U.S. President did not provide a date for announcing those duties and said he wanted to provide some time for drug and chip makers to set up U.S. factories so that they could avoid tariffs.","summary":"Freight forwarders have said that Nigerian vehicle importers may be spending more following the plans by US President, Donald Trump to impose auto tariffs “in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent” and similar duties on semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

A dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a country left,” Trump noted.\n\nTrump also suggested that the only way to end the war was through negotiations led by him, stating that the Trump administration was the only one capable of securing peace.\n\nThe US president said, “In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only “TRUMP,” and the Trump Administration, can do.

More than 80% of that workforce lives outside the Washington area.\n\nThere is no official figure available of the total firings or layoffs. The Associated Press tallied how agencies are being affected based on AP reporting and statements from lawmakers and employee unions.\n\nHere is a look at some of the broad and specific ways federal agencies and employees are being affected by the administration's reductions, as of Wednesday:\n\n'Deferred resignation' proposal for federal workers\n\nThe White House offered a \"deferred resignation\" proposal in exchange for financial incentives, like months of paid leave, to almost all federal employees who opted to leave their jobs by Feb. 6.\n\nBut just before that deadline, a federal judge blocked Trump's plan, wanting to hear arguments from the administration and the labor unions, which said the offer was illegal.\n\nAccording to the Office of Personnel Management, about 75,000 federal employees had accepted the offer as of Feb. 12.\n\nProbationary employee layoffs\n\nThere have also been wide-ranging layoffs of probationary employees - those generally on the job for less than a year and who have yet to gain civil service protection. Potentially hundreds of thousands are affected.\n\nOn Feb. 13, the administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all such workers. According to government data maintained by OPM, 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job as of March 2024.\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nOn Feb. 13, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the dismissal of more than 1,000 employees who had served for less than two years. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.\n\nEducation Department\n\nAt least 39 people have been fired from the Education Department, including special education specialists and student aid officials, according to a union that represents agency workers.\n\nThere have also been nearly $900 million in cuts to the department's Institute of Education Services, which tracks the progress of America's students. It is unclear to what degree the institute would continue to exist. Industry experts said at least 169 contracts were terminated Feb. 10.\n\nEnergy Department\n\nHundreds of federal employees tasked with working on the nation's nuclear weapons programs were laid off Feb. 13, but that move was largely rescinded hours later, according to a memo obtained by the AP. Three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said as many as 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were ousted, with some losing access to email before they had learned they were fired.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services\n\nThe jobs of more than 5,000 probationary employees are on the line at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOn Feb. 14, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were told they were losing nearly 1,300 probationary employees - about one-tenth of the agency's workforce - but the final number was closer to 700, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the cuts.\n\nProbationary employees were also fired at public health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but HHS has not released a final number.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security\n\nThe probationary cuts included more than 130 employees at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the nation's critical infrastructure, including the federal efforts to secure election systems. It is not clear whether those included 17 employees who had worked on election security and had already been placed on leave.\n\nFour employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency - its chief financial officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist - were fired Feb. 11 over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants.\n\nInternal Revenue Service\n\nThe IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two people familiar with the agency's plans who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt is unclear how many IRS workers will be affected or when the cuts will happen.\n\nNational Park Service\n\nThe administration has fired about 1,000 newly hired National Park Service employees who maintain and clean parks, educate visitors and perform other functions.\n\nThe firings were not publicly announced but were confirmed by Democratic senators and House members. Adding to the confusion, the park service now says it is reinstating about 5,000 seasonal jobs that were initially rescinded last month.\n\nSeasonal workers are routinely added during the warm-weather months to serve more than 325 million annual visitors who descend on the nation's 428 parks, historic sites and other attractions.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau\n\nThe administration has ordered the agency - created after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal - to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting it down.\n\nAgriculture Department\n\nThe new agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, said on Feb. 14 that her agency had invited Elon Musk's DOGE team with \"open arms\" and that layoffs \"will be forthcoming.\"\n\nForeign aid and development\n\nTrump swiftly ordered a halt to much of the aid that the United States sends abroad. Several weeks later, the pause is on pause.\n\nIn his first week in office, Trump issued an executive order directing a 90-day hold on most of the foreign assistance disbursed through the State Department.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio issued several specific exemptions, including emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt from the freeze on foreign assistance. But thousands of U.S.-funded humanitarian, development and security programs worldwide stopped work or prepared to do so.\n\nWithout the money to pay staff, aid organizations including the U.S. Agency for International Development began laying off hundreds of employees. Crews removed the agency's signage from its Washington headquarters.\n\nBut on Feb. 13, a federal judge considering some of the lawsuits challenging agency cuts ordered the administration to temporarily lift the funding freeze.\n\nFederal grants and loans\n\nThe White House said last month it was pausing federal grants and loans as the Republican administration began an across-the-board ideological review.\n\nThe freeze could affect trillions of dollars and cause widespread disruption in health care research, education programs and other initiatives. Even grants that have been awarded but not spent are supposed to be halted.\n\n\"The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\" said a memo from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDemocrats and independent organizations said the move was illegal because Congress had already authorized the funding.\n\nInspectors general\n\nEach of the federal government's largest agencies has its own independent inspector general who is supposed to conduct objective audits, prevent fraud and promote efficiency.\n\nTrump has fired at least 17 of them, including watchdogs he appointed in his first term. At least one Democratic appointee, Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department, was spared.\n\nTrump told reporters that \"it's a very common thing to do\" and that he would \"put good people in there that will be very good.\"\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the firings were a \"chilling purge.\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a top Trump ally, acknowledged that the firings may have violated the law, but he added, \"Just tell them you need to follow the law next time.\"\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nIt's normal for politically appointed U.S. attorneys to be replaced, but it is not standard procedure for career prosecutors to be ousted with a change in administrations.\n\nThe Justice Department said last month that it had fired more than a dozen employees who worked on criminal prosecutions of Trump by special counsel Jack Smith's team.\n\nBy tradition, career employees remain with the department across presidential administrations regardless of their involvement in sensitive investigations.\n\nMultiple senior career officials were also reassigned.\n\nState Department\n\nA large number of senior career diplomats who served in politically appointed leadership positions - as well as in lower-level posts at the State Department - left their jobs at the demand of the new administration.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many nonpolitical appointees were being asked to leave.","summary":"There is no official figure available of the total firings or layoffs.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/has-been-laid-off-doge-comprehensive-look-doges-firings-layoffs-far/15933900/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15933355_021925-CC-N1-DOGE-Latest-Wed-PKG2-vid.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/wls/021925-wls-doge-cuts-latest-4p-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:20:25","author":"Meg Kinnard","authors":["Meg Kinnard"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":292325702,"title":"Federal worker firings by Trump, Musk are chaos, not cost-cutting","text":"While you’re reading this, the odds are good that hundreds of civil servants are being told by the Trump administration to pack up their desk, office or lab and get out.\n\nThe mass firings of federal workers taking place across the country are more than a slap in the face to the workers themselves. \n\nWhat does it say about the state of America right now when Elon Musk — who has zero experience serving the public — and his legally questionable Department of Government Efficiency have the power to sack thousands of workers who keep our air and water clean, care for our military veterans, maintain food safety, staff our national parks, respond to weather disasters, ensure airline safety, process tax filings and more? \n\nIt’s chaos, not sensible cost-cutting, no matter what Musk and President Donald Trump claim. \n\nIf we’re wrong, show us the detailed cost-savings analysis, not Musk’s wildly inflated claim of $55 billion in savings; the tally on DOGE’s website reportedly shows just $16.6 billion saved. More important, how will those savings benefit everyday Americans who rely on government workers in ways we too often forget — till those workers aren’t on the job?\n\nFinally, if Musk and Trump were serious about doing right by Americans and making government more effective, they would make it clear that these fired workers won’t someday be replaced by political loyalists under Trump’s Schedule F plan to “transform” the civil service. \n\nDon’t hold your breath.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the civil service system, created in 1883 under the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to ensure that merit and expertise — not politics — are the basis for hiring government employees. As for any claims Trump and Musk make about a “bloated bureaucracy,” consider this: The total number of federal civil servants today is roughly the same as it was in the late 1960s, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.\n\n‘A loss for all of us’\n\nThe Chicago area has some 48,300 federal workers, more than half of the 82,000 federal workers based in Illinois as of December 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBefore the firings, many of them experienced “harassment, and abuse, and intimidation,” as one U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs worker told Sun-Times reporter Mitchell Armentrout. “For people who think it’s a normal kind of downsizing — it’s not.”\n\nHere’s what one young scientist, among dozens of employees fired Friday from the Chicago office of the Environmental Protection Agency, wrote to us in a letter:\n\n“Civil service attracted me because of the opportunity to use science to serve the American public,” wrote Bridget Lynch, who was also interviewed by Sun-Times reporter Brett Chase. “I’m not worried for myself — I will get another job. I share my experience to highlight the broader implications of these shortsighted decisions: The loss of young talent in the federal government is a loss for all of us.\n\n“The government has established layoff procedures that consider essential roles. These were not followed. No matter where you stand politically, I plead with you to see that we, as a nation, are on the wrong track.” \n\nLynch and other scientists interviewed by Chase were told Wednesday that they can return to work — a twist that shows no one should fool themselves that Musk and DOGE, staffed by inexperienced techies who likely draw their inspiration from that shopworn bizspeak cliche about “disruption,” have any clue what they’re doing.\n\nConsider these other missteps too: \n\nFired workers from the National Nuclear Safety Agency were called back after the Trump administration realized their jobs are essential to maintain the safety of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.\n\nOfficials working to respond to the bird flu epidemic that has sent egg prices soaring and decimated poultry farms were “accidentally” fired from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The department said it is “working to swiftly rectify the situation.” \n\nThen there’s the claim made by Musk and Trump that the Social Security Administration is riddled with fraud, including payments being made to 150-year-olds. Turns out that yes, some improper payments have been made by the agency, but the overall rate of fraudulent payments is less than 1%, not the “millions and millions” of fraudsters Trump claimed.\n\nHow long before the administration has to rehire air traffic control staff — whom they began to fire Monday — to ensure air travel safety as we head into the busy spring break and summer travel seasons?\n\nTop officials from the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Treasury Department, and the U.S. Department of Justice are among those public servants who have stood up to Musk and DOGE’s actions. \n\nSadly, they ended up resigning. But they showed integrity, a quality that seems in short supply in Washington these days.\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds.

But CCS is one climate technology his administration wants to accelerate.\"Carbon management is a real bright spot in climate and energy policy,\" Jessie Stolark, executive director for the Carbon Capture Coalition trade group, told Newsweek. \"Especially in terms of potential for bipartisanship.\"Some of the Trump cabinet's top environmental officials gathered Tuesday to promote faster permitting of CCS projects in places that produce fossil fuels.\"Geologic storage makes so much sense for our country,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at an event Tuesday with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin.Burgum and Zeldin joined lawmakers from West Virginia to officially approve a state-run program for permits for underground CO2 storage in the state where coal and natural gas are dominant industries.\"We need to produce more energy right here in the United States, and that requires cooperative federalism and permitting reform,\" Zeldin said.West Virginia became the fourth state approved by the EPA to have primary control over permits for underground CO2 storage via what are known as Class VI injection wells. The other states—Louisiana, North Dakota and Wyoming—are also major fossil fuel producers.Burgum, who previously served as governor of North Dakota, said his state had implemented programs that pull greenhouses gases from the waste stream at a facility that produces biofuels.\"We've permitted some of the biggest injection wells in the U.S. without any risk to the environment,\" he said. Burgum said state agencies can move faster than the EPA to approve the projects.Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican who chairs the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said her state has relevant expertise to support the work. For example, she said, the state is home to the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory, which has conducted research on geologic storage of CO2.\"West Virginians know West Virginia best,\" Capito said. \"They can formulate what's going to work.\"Some people in West Virginia opposed giving state officials control over permits for CO2 storage, however. Autumn Crowe, deputy director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, a nonprofit group, said the state's environmental enforcement agency is \"already stretched thin\" without the additional fast-paced permits for CO2 storage.\"The EPA's decision to grant West Virginia primacy over Class VI carbon injection wells, despite widespread public concern, puts our communities at risk,\" Crowe told Newsweek via email. \"Adding oversight of Class VI wells without adequate safeguards endangers the quality of our waters, air, and the health of nearby residents.\"The Ohio River Valley Institute, a regional think tank, said in a statement that West Virginia officials have struggled to adequately protect groundwater from other types of underground waste injection.Tom Torres, hydrogen program director for the institute, said via email that people commenting on the EPA's proposal to grant primary control to the state also raised concerns that the state lacks the funding and expertise to regulate carbon storage wells.Instead of addressing those concerns, Torres said, the EPA stripped from the original proposals any references to environmental justice, and sections mentioning concerns about \"Black, rural, and underserved communities\" were removed.The EPA's \"recent reversal in removing references to potential disproportionate impacts only compounds the injustice at the heart of this approval,\" Torres said. \"We fear that West Virginia's most vulnerable communities will all too soon experience the impacts of this reckless decision.\"West Virginia's coal industry has long touted the promise of CCS to make coal, the most carbon-intensive of fossil fuels, a low-emission source of energy. The industry dubbed this \"clean coal,\" and the catchphrase became a prominent part of Trump's first presidential campaign in 2016.But despite hefty federal spending over the past 20 years, CCS never caught on at commercial scale for U.S. coal-fired power because of the prohibitive costs it added. Coal production and employment in West Virginia and elsewhere around the country continued a long-term decline, chiefly due to competition from other cheaper fuel sources such as natural gas and renewable energy.\"I think if you look at the larger regulatory forces facing the coal fleet in the U.S., [CCS] is not a panacea,\" Stolark of the Carbon Capture Coalition said. \"It's not going to come in and save the day.\"Stolark said that CO2 storage will play a \"central but complementary role\" in climate policy according to several studies of the technologies that will be needed to achieve net-zero emissions. She said CCS will be especially important to address pollution from heavy manufacturing such as steel and cement.\"These technologies are a platform of enabling industries to produce the materials that society's demanding,\" she said.However, CCS remains controversial among climate researchers. Critics say the technology can prolong dependence on fossil fuels and that the money spent on big-ticket CCS projects would be better spent on speeding the transition to cleaner energy sources.In a study published earlier this month in Environmental Science & Technology, Stanford University civil and environmental engineering professor Mark Jacobson and colleagues found that for most countries around the world, investments in wind, solar and hydropower would yield better results than money spent on CCS.\"If you spend $1 on carbon capture instead of on wind, water, and solar, you are increasing CO2, air pollution, energy requirements, energy costs, pipelines, and total social costs,\" Jacobson said in a statement accompanying the study's release. \"It's much cheaper and more efficient just to replace the fossil source with electricity or heat provided by a renewable source.\"","summary":"The Trump administration is scrapping most support for clean energy and pulling out of climate agreements but wants more carbon capture and storage.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/carbon-capture-storage-donald-trump-administration-climate-energy-policies-2033506","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2591829/coal-power-plant-west-virginia.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-20 00:03:52","author":"Jeff Young","authors":["Jeff Young"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":292319410,"title":"Washington prosecutor probes threats against DOGE, takes aim at Schumer - Reuters","text":"SummaryCompaniesMusk's DOGE has triggered a wave of federal layoffsInterim US Attorney Ed Martin is a Trump appointeeSchumer in 2020 told Senate he regretted language; meant to cite 'political consequences'\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The top U.S. prosecutor in Washington launched an investigation on Wednesday into threats against federal workers, and said the department would probe Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, after people working in Elon Musk's drive to downsize and overhaul the government said they had been threatened.\n\nInterim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin said in an email seen by Reuters that the probe was inspired by a conversation with an employee of billionaire Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an entity created by Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nDOGE has triggered a wave of layoffs across the federal government.\n\n\"Late last night I took a call from a senior DOGE staffer.

Starmer backed Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call on Wednesday after Donald Trump claimed the Ukrainian president was “a dictator without elections”.\n\nIn the call, the Prime Minister gave Mr Zelensky his support “as Ukraine’s democratically elected leader” and said it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War Two”, according to a Downing Street spokesperson.\n\nThe call followed a war of words between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, with the US president criticising his Ukrainian counterpart for postponing elections and incorrectly claiming Ukraine started the war with Russia.\n\nMr Zelensky was elected as president of Ukraine in May 2019.\n\nElections were previously scheduled to go ahead in 2024, but they were not held as a result of martial law being in place.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Zelensky said Mr Trump was living in a “disinformation space”, while others have accused the president of repeating Russian talking points.\n\nOther British political figures, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, also pushed back against Mr Trump’s remarks, although Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, understood to be travelling to the United States, was yet to comment.\n\nThe spat between the two men comes at a delicate moment in global politics after US and Russian officials met for the first time in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to begin talks aimed at brokering a peace deal in Ukraine.\n\nSir Alex Younger, whose tenure as head of MI6 covered Mr Trump’s first term as president, warned that the president’s comments would be “emboldening” for Vladimir Putin, adding that the Russians “probably” believed he agreed with them.\n\nHe told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: “I saw this happen in Afghanistan where he gave away the biggest concessions before we even started.\n\n“It’s a strange art of the deal, honestly.”\n\nSir Keir himself is expected to travel to Washington next week for talks with Mr Trump, including on Ukraine and European security, with French President Emmanuel Macron reported to be heading to the White House in the same week.\n\nThe meeting will be Sir Keir’s first with Mr Trump since his inauguration as US president in January, and will see Britain attempt to balance its support for Ukraine with the need to keep the White House onside.\n\nMeanwhile, two of Sir Keir’s top ministers are expected to spend Thursday in talks with other allies.\n\nDefence Secretary John Healey will continue his visit to Norway, where he has already met troops near the Russian border alongside his Norwegian counterpart Tore Sandvik.\n\nIn South Africa, Foreign Secretary David Lammy is attending a two-day meeting of G20 foreign ministers and is expected to directly criticise the Kremlin and emphasise the UK’s unwavering support for Ukraine, as well as addressing other areas.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Lammy said: “At this precarious geopolitical moment, we must work with the widest possible coalition of countries to stand up for Ukraine, build stability in the Middle East and act urgently on Sudan and the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo).”","summary":"A former head of MI6 suggested the dispute between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky would be ’emboldening’ for Vladimir

Hong Kong holds the biggest collection of the late artist’s work outside France.\nM+ revealed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with MoMA on Tuesday to foster collaboration in areas such as curatorial research and exchange, conservation, programme sharing and talent development.\n\nThe partnership comes amid worsening Sino-US relations since President Donald Trump took office last month. He imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on imports from Hong Kong and mainland China in a move that places an extra burden on the city’s manufacturers and exporters.\nTrump is also planning tariffs on all of the US’ trade partners.\n“[The MOU] represents the beginning of a fruitful partnership between the two esteemed institutions, built on a shared commitment to international collaboration, cultural exchange and museum development,” M+ said.\nMoMA, set up in 1929, is one of the world’s most famous museums and has a 200,000-item collection that includes masterpieces such as Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night and Pablo Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon.\nM+ is relatively new, opening in 2021.

I am protecting Ukraine. I can't sell it away. I can't sell our state.\" \n\nIn regard to U.S. talks with Russia, he said: \"I believe that the United States helped Putin to break out of years of isolation...

History says that could be a big mistake","text":"The relationship between the United States and key ally Ukraine is dissolving before our eyes.\n\nDonald Trump's social media diatribe on Wednesday, local time, in which he described the country's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" who's \"done a terrible job\", was just the latest deterioration.\n\nIt's been three years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the new US president has made it clear he'd rather deal with Moscow than Kyiv when it comes to finding a way to end the conflict.\n\nTo understand why that could be a big mistake, let's rewind one day to when the US and Russia got back on speaking terms, publicly at least.\n\nTrump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who's been in the job for four weeks, led a US delegation to Saudi Arabia for a hastily organised meeting with Kremlin counterparts.\n\nSitting opposite him was Sergey Lavrov — the Russian foreign minister of 21 years — who's seen it all before.\n\nThere was plenty of anticipation ahead of the summit, which was billed as an important precursor to three touted get-togethers between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs Rubio pointed out, Tuesday's meeting marked the first \"regularised\" contact between Moscow and Washington in three-and-a-half years.\n\nThat may be true, but there are claims Putin and Trump have never stopped talking, since the latter was swept out of the White House in 2020.\n\nA book by journalist Bob Woodward released late last year detailed seven phone calls between the pair that allegedly took place in the years after Trump lost the presidency.\n\nThat's on top of the five in-person meetings that they had when they were both in power — a period when Trump famously described Putin as \"strong\" and \"nice\".\n\nForget needing to break the ice with a summit in Riyadh this week, some have gone as far to describe the pair as being in a \"bromance\".\n\nIt's not just Trump that's giving clear signs he wants the US to get closer to Russia.\n\nRubio, after Tuesday's meeting concluded, said ending the war in Ukraine could create \"incredible opportunities\" to partner with the Russians on issues of common interest.\n\nEvery country that's got a stake in the conflict — and there are many — claims they'd like to see it end, albeit on vastly different terms.\n\n\"So far I have seen zero evidence that Putin is willing to give one inch in order to negotiate a peace deal,\" Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia posted to social media.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has already flagged the possibility of several concessions, including cutting aid to Ukraine and denying its bid for NATO membership, encouraging Kyiv to cede territory to Russia and withdrawing US troops stationed in Eastern Europe — something considered a deterrent for Putin, amid fears he could launch future invasions.\n\nWhat has the Russian president promised in return? Nothing, apparently.\n\nRussia showing signs of weakness\n\nSome analysts contend that, despite the deadly Ukraine conflict, this is not the right time to be bowing down to Russia, which is showing clear signs of weakness.\n\nWhile its economy has defied predictions (or in some cases, hopes) that Western sanctions and Putin's prolonged invasion of Ukraine would prove ruinous, there are plenty of red flags.\n\nRussia's currency, the rouble, has fallen to some of its lowest levels in a decade. Inflation, in December, was 9.5 per cent, with the cost of household essentials soaring.\n\nLabor shortages, sparked by people being sent to Ukraine and fighting-age males fleeing the country, are stymieing the economy.\n\nAnd, while Russia undeniably wrested the upper hand in the war last year, it came at an enormous cost.\n\nCasualties are estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. With prisons already emptied and no appetite for another round of conscription, Putin became so desperate he turned to North Korea for troops and weapons.\n\nElsewhere, rebel forces swept Russia out of Syria without so much as peep amid the fall of dictator Bashar Al Assad, whose regime the Kremlin had devoted copious amounts of money and blood propping up over decades.\n\nSome experts argue the West should seize the opportunity to exploit Putin's weakness and, potentially, flip the tables in Ukraine, rather than offer him a seat at the table.\n\nThe events of the past week have sparked concerns in some quarters that the US and Russia could be growing too close.\n\nDialogues, however, are nothing new.\n\nOfficials from both nations have gathered in person and spoken over the phone regularly throughout the past 20 years.\n\nLavrov and Putin met George W. Bush Jnr. and key figures in his administration on multiple occasions.\n\nAt one point, the Russian president even stayed at his American counterpart's family home, where they went fishing and discussed the \"possibility of raising our relations to an entirely new level\".\n\nBarack Obama held several in-person talks with both Lavrov and Putin. Trump met Putin five times, and Lavrov on multiple occasions. The veteran foreign minister and Russian leader also attended a summit with Joe Biden in Geneva.\n\nPutin could start another war\n\nEven when diplomatic contact between Washington and Moscow was officially cut after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, dialogue continued elsewhere.\n\nSecret talks the White House described as \"unsanctioned\" took place in New York in 2023. Again, Lavrov was there.\n\nWhen put in an historical context, there's a case to be made that US-Russia meetings are more routine than revolutionary.\n\nStill, there are concerns that Trump, despite being an experienced negotiator, is underestimating Putin.\n\n\"I hate to jump to premature conclusions but suspect that Putin-Trump's bromance will not be long-living because the strategic goals of the Russian Federation and US are strikingly different and the level of anti-Americanism in Putin's Russia is exorbitant,\" Russia expert and visiting fellow to the Australian National University Leonid Petrov said.\n\nThe Kremlin says Putin is ready to talk about peace in Ukraine, but analysts argue Russia's entire economic system has been entwined with, and even powered by, war for a long time.\n\nUnder Putin's decades-long reign, Moscow has pursued multiple conflicts: in Chechnya for 10 years from 1999, in Georgia in 2008, in Crimea in 2014 before a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nLast week, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy warned his country had intelligence that Russia was training up to 150,000 troops to, possibly, launch another attack on \"maybe Poland, maybe the Baltic countries\" as early as next year.\n\nPutin has made no secret of his imperialist ambitions, even comparing himself to Peter the Great, a tsar who annexed swathes of new land for Russia centuries ago.\n\nWhile many in the international community would welcome an end to the bloody war in Ukraine, questions remain about the wisdom of negotiating with an autocrat so thirsty for territorial expansion, who's presiding over an increasingly frail economy and military.\n\nCongressman Joe Wilson, from Trump's own Republican Party, argued in a social media post on Saturday: \"The fastest way to end the war is to win it. War Criminal Putin is weaker than ever. The killing stops immediately when Russia leaves Ukraine.\"\n\nThat ship appears to have sailed, though. Trump and Putin are organising multiple meetings, and the US president's rhetoric about Ukraine is deteriorating.\n\nTrump this week claimed the war could have been settled years ago \"very easily\".\n\nWhat the president may find more of a challenge is ensuring the \"strong\" and \"nice\" Russian leader does not to start another one.","summary":"The new US president has made it clear he would rather negotiate with Moscow than Kyiv when it comes to ending the war in Ukraine, and some say there's good reason to be worried about that.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-analysis-after-zelenskyy-spray/104953186","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fc430b3393844cd39c05f28ab9d41de2?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1367&cropW=2431&xPos=0&yPos=122&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:57:03","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.222},{"id":292325624,"title":"Trump’s Pro-Union Labor Secretary Pick Draws Scrutiny From Senators of Both Parties","text":"Senators from both parties had tough questions Wednesday for Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, who breaks the traditional GOP mold in her support of unions.\n\nChavez-DeRemer, a former Republican congresswoman from Oregon who represents Trump’s efforts to woo union members, came under fire from Republicans concerned about her previous policies on right-to-work laws, and from Democrats, who used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize Trump’s attempted downsizing of the federal workforce.\n\nThe nominee’s intent to present herself as a pro-union politician was on full display as she walked into the hearing room alongside Teamsters President Sean O’Brien.\n\n“Your nomination has support from both unions and businesses. You’re in a unique position to build a bridge between all workers,” said Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nBut in his opening statement, the Louisiana lawmaker made it clear that he had serious questions, taking issue with the nominee’s previous support of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.\n\n“There are concerns, however, about your past support for the Democrats’ cornerstone legislation, the PRO Act. Workers should have the freedom to decide if they wish to join a union or not. The PRO Act would eliminate this freedom, allowing workers to be coerced and intimidated into unionization,” he said.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who introduced Chavez-DeRemer, was one of her strongest supporters at the hearing.\n\nFirst, he had to address the elephant in the room—the presence of O’Brien, with whom he had nearly gotten into a physical altercation on the Senate floor in 2023, an intense exchange that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., broke up.\n\n“The last time Sean and I were in this room together, obviously, we had our differences. And, Bernie, I think you remember that well. But somehow, we were able to put our differences aside, because President Trump asked us to,” said Mullin.\n\nThe Oklahoma lawmaker proceeded to urge Republican senators to set aside their reservations, citing his newfound friendship with O’Brien as an example, and also urged populist Democrats, such as Sanders, to throw their support behind Chavez-DeRemer for her pro-union work.\n\n“I’ve had to move a long ways. And if I can move, and Sean and I can move and come together on this, then that, if nothing else, should set some type of example,” Mullin said.\n\n Chavez-DeRemer had the opportunity over the course of the hearing to clarify her positions for skeptical Republicans. \n\n“Do you still support the PRO Act?” Cassidy asked her point blank.\n\nChavez-DeRemer responded that she was no longer a representative and had some regrets over supporting the act.\n\n“I will not be that lawmaker anymore. But I was working for Oregon’s 5th Congressional District in representing that … . I respect the right of the right-to-work states, and I have said that the bill was imperfect, and I’m no longer the lawmaker.” Right-to-work laws are intended to bar union from being able to compel all workers at a company to join its ranks if they don’t wish to. \n\nShe would face that same question a number times throughout the hearing.\n\nSanders, asking the exact same question, received what he considered an unclear response, to which he said, “I’m gathering that you no longer support the PRO Act.”\n\nChavez-DeRemer also went through heated back-and-forths with Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tim Kaine of Virginia over whether or not she supports the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency’s downsizing of federal agencies, to which she generally replied that this was not in her purview and that she was not in the government yet.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., questioned Chavez-DeRemer on her position on abortion.\n\n“You worked in Planned Parenthood years and years ago,” said Tuberville. “[Are] you pro-life or pro-choice?”\n\nChavez-DeRemer responded, “I am supportive of the president’s agenda. I have a 100% pro-life voting record in Congress, and I will continue to support the America First agenda, which we know includes life.”\n\n“Good answer,” replied Tuberville.\n\nBy the end of the hearing, Chavez-DeRemer had managed to avoid overly offending both parties.\n\nThe nominee reassured Republicans of her respect for right-to-work laws and reached agreements to work alongside Democrats—such as Sens. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Lisa Blunt-Rochester of Delaware—on expanding education and apprenticeship opportunities for young people.\n\nChavez-DeRemer also found two close allies in Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Jim Banks of Indiana, both of whom said they wished to work with her on combat human trafficking.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, Cassidy expressed his support for the nominee.\n\n“You did very well,” he said.","summary":"Senators from both parties had tough questions Wednesday for Lori Chavez-DeRemer, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, who breaks the traditional GOP mold in...

to fire people, and he resents congressional constraints on that presidential prerogative.\n\nWhile Trump’s opponents may view that attitude as one more manifestation of his autocratic instincts, his complaint is grounded in legitimate concerns about the separation of powers that presidents of both parties have raised for many years.\n\nA century ago, the Supreme Court held that Congress overstepped its constitutional authority when it decreed that presidents could remove “postmasters of the first, second, and third classes” only “with the advice and consent of the Senate.”\n\nBased on extensive historical analysis, the majority concluded that Article II of the Constitution “grants to the President” the “general administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment and removal of executive officers.”\n\nIn that case, it was a Democratic president, Woodrow Wilson, who was asserting that power by dismissing a postmaster in Portland, Ore. \n\nNine years later, the court addressed a similar controversy involving another Democrat, Franklin Roosevelt, who had fired a member of the Federal Trade Commission appointed by his Republican predecessor.\n\nThe commissioner’s restrained view of the FTC’s mission was inconsistent with Roosevelt’s policy agenda, which was the reason the president gave for dismissing him.\n\nThis time, the Supreme Court sided with Congress, which had said an FTC commissioner “may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”\n\nReading that language as a limit on the president’s power, the court nevertheless upheld it, reasoning that FTC commissioners, unlike postmasters, were not “purely executive officers.”\n\nRather, the FTC was a “nonpartisan” panel of “experts” with “predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative” functions that was meant to be “independent of executive authority.”\n\nThe Supreme Court implicitly recognized the difficulties with that approach in 1988 and 2010, and in 2020 it ruled that Congress had violated the separation of powers by putting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the command of a single director whom the president could remove only for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”\n\nAlthough the majority distinguished that arrangement from the one upheld in 1935, which involved a “multimember” commission that supposedly did not “wield substantial executive power,” its logic cast doubt on the viability of that precedent.\n\nThe CFPB decision reaffirmed that “the entire ‘executive Power’ belongs to the President alone,” which means he must have “power to remove — and thus supervise — those who wield executive power on his behalf.”\n\nThe majority also conceded that “the Court’s conclusion that the FTC did not exercise executive power has not withstood the test of time.”\n\nThe following year, the court ruled that the principle it had defended in the CFPB case also condemned the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which like the CFPB was run by a single director, whom the president could remove only “for cause.”\n\nBy the same logic, the Trump administration argues, the president should have unlimited power to fire the head of the Office of Special Counsel, an investigative and prosecutorial agency charged with protecting federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nAt this stage of the case, the president’s lawyers are not questioning the constitutionality of independent agencies like the FTC.\n\nBut the Supreme Court may ultimately revisit that issue in this case, or in another involving Trump’s assertion of executive power.\n\nThe 2020 CFPB decision “repudiated almost every aspect” of the court’s ruling in the case that Roosevelt lost, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a partial concurrence joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThey think the court should explicitly overturn that 1935 precedent, which they say blessed “unaccountable independent agencies” that “exercise vast executive power outside the bounds of our constitutional structure.”\n\nThey have a point.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the federal government consists of three distinct branches: legislative, executive and judicial.\n\nIn recognizing an amalgam that is independent of presidential control, the justices effectively authorized a fourth branch of government that the framers never imagined.\n\nJacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.","summary":"Despite the flurry of leftist lawsuits, Trump's claim to fire federal

tries to hijack interview in ugly exchange","text":"CNN anchor Pamela Brown had a heated exchange with an aide for newly appointed health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. over his priorities during this administration.\n\nCalley Means, who is serving as an adviser to RFK Jr., interjected as Brown asked her other guest, infectious disease specialist Dr Paul Offit, about the uptick in measles cases.\n\n'Pamela, with respect, why aren't you asking me about the fact that 50 per cent of teens have obesity,' he said.\n\nBrown instantly hit back with a withering takedown, arguing that she has questions for both of them and intended to cover a wide range of topics relating to healthcare.\n\nShe noted that she's been 'at the forefront of covering a lot of these issues.'\n\n'Please don't make that claim that I'm not asking the right questions... I do want to talk about obesity. Don't... claim that I'm not asking about important things because I've covered that on this show.\n\n'I have other questions for you, but we're talking about this,' Brown said, attempting to turn her attention back to Dr Offit.\n\nBut Means continued to rally against any discussion of the measles outbreak in Texas, where 58 cases have been diagnosed. \n\n'Day after day after day, Pamela, it's breathless coverage of five measles cases,' Means said.\n\n'Why aren't we asking why 16 per cent of COVID deaths worldwide were Americans when we're only 4 per cent of the world's population, because the CDC said our immune system-'\n\nBoth Dr Offit and Brown pulled faces at Means' comments before the latter attempted to interject, but she was once again cut off by RFK Jr's adviser, who snapped: 'No, it is related, Pamela, let me say why. \n\n'The entire coverage of Bobby Kennedy is around measles...Bobby Kennedy has said one thing about vaccines and one thing only: that they should be studied like any other product.' \n\nHe went on to say that Kennedy has 'written multiple books, not about being anti vax, but about having good science,' prompting another swift rebuke.\n\n'I think it is fair to say, given his history and his past remarks, though, that he is at the very least, a vaccine skeptic. All right? A vaccine skeptic, it's fair to say.'\n\nMeans denied the term, arguing that he sees Kennedy as 'a pro science advocate.'\n\nKennedy himself shared his top priorities in his new role just yesterday, during his first speech as an official member of Donald Trump's cabinet as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHe said he hopes to focus on tackling the health epidemic nationwide and scrutinizing every aspect of Americans' medicines, drugs and food. \n\nThe new HHS head talked about his belief that vaccines led to a spike in childhood autism cases in the U.S., and said that he will welcome 'unbiased science' processes to investigate that claim.\n\nKennedy listed the many areas he wants HHS to 'scrutinize,' specifically standards for foods, medicines, drugs and pesticides that he feels have been overlooked or given a pass in the past.\n\n'Some of the possible factors we will investigate were formerly taboo or insufficiently scrutinized – the childhood vaccine schedule, electromagnetic radiation, glyphosate, other pesticides, ultra-processed foods, artificial food additives, SSRI and other psychiatric drugs, PFAs, PFOAs, microplastics,' Kennedy said. 'Nothing is going to be off limits.'\n\n'Whatever belief or suspicion I have expressed in the past, I'm willing to subject them all to the scrutiny of unbiased science,' he continued. 'That is going to be our template: unbiased science.'\n\n'That's something that will make us all proud of this agency and of our role in restoring American health.'\n\nKennedy's appointment and a DOGE effort to purge departments under his remit have caused a stir at high levels, with the head of the Food and Drug Administration's food division resigning on Monday after 89 staffers at his agency were laid off.\n\nJim Jones cited 'indiscriminate' cuts as part of the reason for his decision to step down.\n\nReports also emerged on Tuesday revealing the Centers for Disease Control's Acting Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah is also stepping down.\n\nLast week, 3,600 newer HHS employees who were still in their probationary period were laid off.\n\nThe firings were primarily among staffers at the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.","summary":"Calley Means, who is serving as an adviser to RFK Jr., interjected as Brown asked her other guest, infectious disease specialist Dr Paul Offit, about the uptick in measles cases.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14415145/cnn-pamela-brown-calley-means-robert-kennedy-health.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/19/23/95389887-0-image-m-54_1740008629012.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/18/3995767319911772911/1024x576_MP4_3995767319911772911.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:54:21","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":292325916,"title":"Fred Sirieix gets married!

We're getting married next year in Jamaica.'\nThe nuptials were undoubtedly a lavish affair as company documents released in 2020 revealed Fred had nearly £1 million in the bank at the time. \nIn December, Fruitcake revealed that she was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy and admitted she 'doesn't recognise her own reflection'.\nBell's Palsy is a neurological condition which causes temporary weakness or paralysis in the muscles on one side of the face.\nThe fashion expert, 50, admitted she had been rushed to hospital in an ambulance after the symptoms appeared, as they can be similar to that of a stroke. \nFruitcake shared a collection of selfies from throughout her battle with Bell's Palsy as she gave fans an insight into her recovery. \nTaking to Instagram, she said: 'Hello, everyone! I've been away for the past couple of months due to a diagnosis of Bell's Palsy.\n'For those who may not know this condition causes sudden, temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.'\n\nFruitcake shared a collection of selfies from throughout her battle with Bell's Palsy as she gave fans an insight into her recovery\n\nThe fashion expert, 50, admitted she had been rushed to hospital in an ambulance after the symptoms appeared, as they can be similar to that of a stroke\nOpening up about her symptoms, she said: 'Initially, I experienced excruciating pain, facial distortion (check out my pics - last one is most recent), and discomfort in my ear and head, which was incredibly painful and challenging to manage. \n'The symptoms of Bell's Palsy are similar to a stroke. And so when I called the NHS helpline, I was rushed to A&E by ambulance for immediate care. \n'Now, I'm managing some ongoing issues like visual disturbances and aches in my ear and jaw.'\nFruitcake shared that the loss of feeling in her face meant at times she didn't recognise her reflection. \n'One of the toughest challenges has been not recognising my reflection in the mirror, which made me retreat from social situations,' she said. \n'However, each day brings new blessings, and I'm starting to look more like myself again. Since my diagnosis, I've delved into researching the condition—something I hadn't even heard of until now. Hearing the stories of others in similar situations has been incredibly inspiring.'\nShe added: 'I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude—my family and friends have been incredible throughout this journey.\n'Thank you to everyone who has reached out to check on me; your support means the world! Thank you also to everyone at the NHS who looked after me. You guys are brilliant x\n'I feel truly blessed that my recovery is progressing faster than I initially anticipated. \n'As we approach the holiday season, I wish you all a lovely Christmas and all the best in 2025! I'll be back soon to share my fashion finds, but in the meantime, please stay safe and, most importantly, healthy! Take care, and see you soon! ❤️.' \n\nIt comes after Fred's scandal plagued co-star Gino D'Acampo (R) left a dancer humiliated by suggesting she join both men in a threesome while filming their latest ITV series \nIt comes after Fred's scandal plagued co-star Gino D'Acampo left a dancer humiliated by suggesting she join both men in a threesome while filming their latest ITV series Emission Impossible.\nThe TV chef, 48, has been rocked by 'over 40' allegations of sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour over a 12-year period - claims which he denies, saying he finds them deeply distressing.\nIn a clip obtained by The Sun, which was filmed in October 2023 but did not air, Italian Gino and Frenchman Fred ventured to Austria where they were taught traditional dancing.\nAccording to the publication the married chef repeatedly quizzed the female dancer if she 'prefers Italian or French' men, despite her insisting she had a boyfriend. \nLater Gino allegedly pretended to slap his co-star's genitals while they performed the routine before asking the dancer: 'Why don't you just have a threesome.'\n'No' she replied firmly, before asking the audience: 'Everybody happy?'.\nTo which the dancer once again hit back: 'Not me', the exchange reportedly led to the family dance troupe complaining to the series' production company. \nA source said: 'The show was subject to a number of complaints from contributors and crew. These were escalated to ITV when filming was halted after a week on location in Austria.\n'This was supposedly due to Gino's ill health. But there were already concerns about his behaviour when the shoot was pulled'.\n'You can see in the video that the dancers are visibly uncomfortable during filming and Gino made a number of sexually inappropriate comments to them.' \n\nThe TV chef, 48, has been rocked by 'over 40' allegations of sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour over a 12-year period\nMailOnline have contacted Gino's reps, ITV for comment. \nOn Sunday, Fred reportedly made a public show of support for Gino amid allegations of 'inappropriate behaviour' and liked his pals latest, according to The Mirror - which no longer appears on the post. \nGino posted a video of his meet and greet with fans at an Asda store where he flogged his cook book.\nMailOnline have contacted Fred's representatives for a comment. \nCarefree Gino enjoyed a night out with wife Jessica Stellina Morrison and co-star Fred just 24-hours before his axe from ITV over allegations of sexually inappropriate and intimidating behaviour.\nBut before the news broke Gino, 48, and Jessica, who share sons Luciano, 22, Rocco, 19, and 12-year-old Mia, were enjoying a rollicking outing with co-star Fred, 53.\nIn the clip shared to Instagram all three beamed and giggled as they entered the event with Gino joking his wife had 'chosen the wrong foreigner' as she held hands with French man Fred.\nIt is understood the Italian chef was secretly ditched from Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip after refusing to sign a morality clause in his contract that would have allowed ITV to sack him if his behaviour on set was problematic.\nWhile Fred continues to show support for his pal Gino, Gordon Ramsay has stayed silent amid the furore. \nHints that their relationship was not all that it seemed date back to 2019 when Gordon made no secret of his fury that his then-teenage daughter Tilly was dating his co-star's son Luciano. \nBoth 17 at the time, the young lovebirds made headlines after meeting on the set of their fathers' joint ITV food show, Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, with the foul mouthed British chef branding the relationship a 'nightmare'.\nHis reservations are now thrown into a whole new light after the treasured friendship between the two men soured in recent months, with Gordon even accused of 'throwing Gino under the bus' as he battles to save his reputation.\nFred SirieixInstagramGino D'Acampo\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFred Sirieix gets married!

The hosts have picked “solidarity, equality, sustainability” as the theme of the G20 this year.\n\nSouth Africa, the first African nation to hold the group's presidency, says it will try to advance the interests of poor countries, especially with debt refinancing and helping them mitigate the impacts of climate change, where the developing world is asking rich countries to pay more.\n\nRubio posted on X this month that he would also not attend the main G20 summit in Johannesburg in November, saying South Africa was using the gathering to promote diversity, equality and inclusion frameworks, \"In other words: DEI and climate change.\"\n\n“My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism,” Rubio wrote.\n\nRubio's decision to skip the G20 meeting also underscores a major deterioration in U.S. relations with South Africa, one of its key trade partners in Africa.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month stopping U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa over a land law that he says discriminates against some of the country's white minority. The order also called South Africa's foreign policy anti-American and criticized its ongoing case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the United Nations' top court, and what it said was the country's closeness to the Communist Party in China.\n\nSouth Africa is due to hand over the presidency of the G20 to the U.S. at the end of this year, and the two countries are expected to work together under G20 protocols.\n\nSouth African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said on Wednesday that the U.S. would be represented in Johannesburg this week “in one form or shape or another” and stressed that Rubio's decision was “not a complete boycott of South Africa's G20” by the U.S.\n\nAnalysts in Africa say they still see a way for the G20 to make progress under South Africa's presidency, even with limited U.S. interest. The EU, Russia and China have expressed support for South Africa's G20 leadership.\n\n“No one wants to be on the wrong side of the United States,\" said Oscar van Heerden, senior researcher at the University of Johannesburg’s Centre of African Diplomacy and Leadership. “But I think everyone also realizes that what drives the foreign policy of the United States is not necessarily what drives the foreign policy of the European Union or the other members of the G20.”\n\nEuropean allies have their own concerns over future cooperation with the Trump administration after they were sidelined by its move to hold bilateral talks this week with Russia.\n\n\"Multilateralism is under threat right now,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said in South Africa, “We also need to use this opportunity to develop the international system further to be more inclusive for all countries in the world.”\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Team Trump is coming to the rescue of working-class motorists by killing the city’s despised “congestion” tolls.\n\nKudos to President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for making the move.\n\nAs Duffy explained in revoking federal approval Wednesday, the $9 hit for driving in Manhattan below 60th Street was a fraud from the start.\n\nRather than cut traffic, it was actually designed primarily to raise money for the MTA.\n\nYet motorists — teachers, cops, deli workers, secretaries and others, many with no alternative but to drive into the city — got stuck with the tab. That’s blatantly unfair.\n\nNew York’s “congestion pricing plan is a slap in the face to working-class Americans and small-business owners,” fumed Duffy in a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nIt “takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. It’s backwards and unfair.” \n\nHear, hear! Wealthy Manhattanites have plenty of access to public transportation, yet the “congestion” funds go to shore up the system they disproportionately use.\n\nAnd the toll scheme left drivers — particularly those from the outer boroughs, Jersey and Connecticut — with no “free highway alternative.”\n\nWhich gave Duffy solid grounds for overturning it, since the “pilot program” under which the Biden crew OK’d these tolls, is supposed to allow motorists a non-toll option.\n\nPlus, as he noted, the Midtown tolls clash with federal highway-aid program rules that bar tolls on federally funded roads unless Congress grants a waiver.\n\nThis was a clear perversion of rules for “pilot” (i.e., test) programs that are to explore ways to reduce traffic — not to find a means of generating “transit revenue” forever.\n\nSure, the MTA is facing budget gaps. \n\nBut it’s always facing budget gaps.\n\nFares rise, taxes shoot up, government handouts grow — all to plug the system’s holes. Yet the agency’s “financial crisis” never goes away.\n\nSocking motorists who have no other choice but to drive with stiff tolls is no way to finance a transit system.\n\nThe MTA and its ultimate boss, Kathy Hochul, need to figure out how to fix the agency’s budget woes (cut costs, fix work rules, end union-demanded perks, etc.) without repeatedly hitting riders, taxpayers and now . . . motorists.\n\nMeantime, thank goodness Team Trump is standing up for the little guy.","summary":"Hooray!

And I think they recognize that,” said Sullivan, who followed several of the U.S. Olympians to Boston University before an 11-year NHL playing career and two decades more as a coach. “Without a doubt, that 1980 team, still to this day, has had such an influence on American hockey.”\n\nAfter sitting out the last two Winter Olympics, the NHL’s best returned to international play this month for a tournament that replaced the league’s All-Star Game, a midseason exhibition that mattered little and was treated by the players as such.\n\nInstead, the United States, Canada, Finland and Sweden all sent their stars. And something happened once they started playing for their countries: The hockey has been historic, especially the fight-filled round-robin matchup between the North Americans on Saturday that was the most-watched non-Stanley Cup Final game in a decade.\n\n“Anybody that thought they were going to come in here and see an All-Star Game was sorely, sorely mistaken. This has been anything but,” Canada coach Jon Cooper said Wednesday. “It’s been all-stars, but it’s not been an All-Star Game.”\n\nAdd in the cross-border tension following President Donald Trump’s tariff war and his calls for Canada to be made the 51st state, and the tournament has much of the flavor of the Cold War meeting with the Soviets in Lake Placid.\n\nCanadian fans loudly booed the U.S. national anthem Saturday night in Montreal. in Boston on Monday, when the TD Garden public address announcer called for respect, the payback for “O Canada” was tepid; instead, the Americans belted out “The Star-Spangled Banner” at full throat.\n\n“All that stuff — throw it all out the window. It’s one game here, and one game for everything,” U.S. forward Matthew Tkachuk said. “Our team’s helped grow the game here in this country already. And I think a win can just knock that door right down and open up a whole new wave of hockey players throughout the whole country.”\n\nCanadian forward Brad Marchand, who plays for the Boston Bruins and will be skating on what is ordinarily his home ice, dismissed the political angle, saying the hockey was good enough to sell itself. He recalled watching in his family’s basement when the Canadians beat the U.S. in the gold medal game of the 2002 Salt Lake City Games.\n\nAnd he hopes some kid in Nova Scotia was watching when the Americans and Canadians matched up on Saturday in Montreal, or again on Thursday night in Boston.\n\n“This will be another memory, another core memory for a lot of a lot of kids growing up, a lot of hockey fans for both American and Canadian players — and probably kids all across the world,” he said. “So it’s a gift and a privilege to play in these games. And definitely one you don’t take for granted.”\n\nThe 3-1 U.S. victory in the round-robin began with three fights in the first nine seconds, then settled into a fast-paced clinic that ranks among the top games in international hockey history.\n\nThe sequel “feels bigger than that,” Tkachuk said.\n\n“It’s going to be an incredible environment,” he said. “Obviously, wearing the jersey and representing your country is such an incredible honor and what we play for. But the opportunity that we have is something that — I don’t even think we thought was possible and what we could create.”\n\nThat’s what compelled Ted Sells to make a five-hour drive from his home in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan, to a 12-hour flight through Calgary and Dallas to get to Boston for the title game. He wandered through the TD Garden pro shop looking for Canadian gear and saw none; a clerk told him they were sold out.\n\nSells said he hoped the teams could set aside the politics and just play hockey.\n\n“Everybody has their team and their favorite,” he said. “But they shake hands at the end. And that’s good.”\n\nAcross the store James Kopacki said he had no animosity toward the Canadians; he was deciding whether to buy his wife, a Bruins fan, a Marchand jersey. The U.S. Navy veteran came up from Fort Worth, Texas, to watch the game, buying tickets after watching the Americans beat Canada in the opening round.\n\n“That game turned out to be so good. That’s why we’re here,” he said. “I’ve never seen a game like that, as far as the tension and the desire to win. And not just that: the tension between our countries.”\n\nKopacki said he spent $1,500 on the tickets, and he’s been monitoring the price as the hype increases.\n\n“If the tickets reach $5,000,” he said, “then we’re going to sell them and go to a bar in Boston and watch for free.”\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL","summary":"BOSTON (AP) — The U.S. and Canadian hockey teams tried to skate back the geopolitical tension that has infiltrated the 4 Nations Face-Off as they looked ahead to the championship game Thursday night for what has turned into one of…","url":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/u-s-and-canada-want-to-put-the-new-cold-war-on-ice-and-play/article_ef893c71-b870-5752-a53b-e2154043a79d.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/32/f32670e9-8c73-5459-a701-b6497774cca4/67b66f5634723.image.jpg?crop=1855%2C974%2C0%2C53&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:51:32","author":"Jimmy Golen The Associated Press","authors":["Jimmy Golen The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.009},{"id":292314816,"title":"Trump makes another power grab","text":"The Logoff is a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.\nWelcome to The Logoff. Today I’m focusing on the Trump administration’s effort to exert control over independent regulators, a power grab with implications for the government’s balance of power — and for your daily life.\n\nWhat’s the latest? Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that would put a series of independent regulatory agencies (and their investigations and rulemaking processes) directly under White House control.\n\nHow does that change the way things work now? The dozens of independent agencies in the federal government have the power to interpret federal law and launch investigations into alleged rulebreakers. The president appoints the leaders to the agencies’ boards. But many commissioners’ terms are longer than a single administration’s, and the president can’t fire them simply because he doesn’t like their decisions.\n\nUnder Trump’s new rules, that autonomy would go away. What are these independent agencies? There are dozens of them, including:\n* The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the stock market;\n* The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates businesses’ relationships with consumers;\n* The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the airwaves and internet.\nAre they all included? The order specifically exempts the Federal Reserve’s work to set interest rates, but that’s it!\nWhat’s next? The executive order will almost certainly face legal challenges, and the question over the reach of executive power could get kicked all the way up to the Supreme Court. These agencies’ independence is protected by law, but the Trump team argues those laws are unconstitutional.\nWhat’s the big picture? Trump is again attempting to expand the president’s power. Congress passed laws giving these agencies a measure of independence, and putting lawmakers in charge of their oversight. Trump is now claiming that power for himself, arguing their independence makes them unaccountable.\nBut how does it affect me? These agencies regulate so many facets of daily life — preventing everything from predatory business practices to nuclear reactor meltdowns.\nAnd with that, it’s time to log off ...\nHow are you sleeping these days? If the answer is “not well,” I have a listen for you, courtesy of Vox’s Explain It to Me podcast. This week, they interviewed a sleep psychologist to get answers to questions like: Why am I a night owl? How can I nap responsibly? And what should I do about my chronic struggle to stay asleep? I hope you enjoy it. And I’ll see you back here tomorrow.","summary":"The Logoff is a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.&#160;Subscribe here.

It requires a public health policy,\" she said.Felbab-Brown said that asking Mexico to completely halt the influx of fentanyl into the United States was \"an unachievable demand.\" According to Trump's executive order, it is US policy \"to ensure the total elimination of these organizations' presence in the United States and their ability to threaten the territory, safety, and security of the United States through their extraterritorial command-and-control structures.\"Dudley doubts that the cartels can be eliminated, either by deploying more troops on the ground or by using legal tools, because they are \"sophisticated and very dispersed\" organizations, capable of quickly recomposing.\"It cannot be solved by capturing a single person... or by dismantling an entire organization,\" he said.According to Felbab-Brown, unilateral US military strikes \"would almost certainly fail to destroy the cartels.\"Replacements for leaders who were killed would be quickly found and the cartels \"have repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to re-create damaged drug labs within days,\" she added.The designation \"theoretically allows US authorities to impose penalties on entities and individuals that provide material support to cartels, including companies paying extortion fees under duress,\" according to the Mexican political risk consultancy EMPRA.According to Dudley, the broad legal scope of the decree means that \"in the hands of irresponsible authorities\" it could be \"extremely dangerous.\"If the Mexican subsidiary of a US company pays extortion to a cartel, the parent company could be accused of \"material support\" for terrorism, he said.\"Providing even a pencil, a toy, or a cup of coffee can trigger severe criminal and financial penalties,\" Felbab-Brown said.","summary":"US President Donald Trump's decision to designate eight Latin American drug trafficking groups as \"terrorist\" organizations has raised speculation about possible military action on foreign soil.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/could-terrorist-designation-lead-us-strikes-drug-cartels-3764334","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4583628/truck-burns-mexican-cartel-stronghold-culiacan-which-has-been-hit-gang-infighting-murders.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:48:22","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":292317144,"title":"Canada, U.S. ready for 4 Nations final with political tensions high off the ice","text":"Jon Cooper is a hockey coach.

John Kennedy (R-La.). 'I also believe, from bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a gangster. He's a gangster with a black heart' who he said shared Josef Stalin's 'taste for blood.' \n\nBut other Senate Republicans picked up Trump's criticism that Zelensky, who declared martial law after Putin's troops invaded his country, must now stand for reelection following the first talks between U.S. and Russian negotiators. That is a key demand of Moscow. \n\n'We need elections in Ukraine,' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said after emerging from a luncheon of Senate Republicans attended by VP JD Vance. 'Soon,' the Trump ally told DailyMail.com.\n\n'He should hold an election,' said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\n'We held elections during World War II,' Hawley told DailyMail.com.

I don't think that's different.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump's stunning comments blaming \n\nHe added: 'I'm concerned they haven't held an election in a long time and we are funding their government.'\n\nZelensky posted on X Wednesday that he spoke to Graham by phone. 'We greatly appreciate the bicameral and bipartisan support of the US Congress to the Ukrainian people in our fight against the Russian aggression,' he wrote. \n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nTrump tears into 'dictator' Zelensky as he doubles down on criticism\n\nHe also was rushing to reach out to world leaders to shore up his country's position, amid fears it could get carved up at the negotiating table. Zelensky said he will met with Trump's envoy Gen. Keith Kellogg on Thursday. \n\nAs always, Senator Graham is constructive and doing a lot to help bring peace closer. It’s all-important that security guarantees remain on the table—and that they work for Ukraine, for real and lasting peace.'\n\nThat appreciative phone call came after Vice President JD Vance criticized Zelensky's own slaps at Trump for pushing 'disinformation' in exclusive comments to DailyMail.com.\n\n'The idea that Zelensky is going to change the president’s mind by bad mouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration \n\nTrump called Zelensky a 'dictator' and a 'modestly successful comedian'\n\nCongress has steered billions in military aid to Ukraine, but public support has been waning\n\nZelensky said he spoke to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) following Trump's 'dictator' attack on him\n\n'I think Vladimir Putin started the war,' said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.)\n\nZelensky declared martial law after Russia's 2022 invasion of his country. Elections were to be held in 2024. In a stunning move, Trump attacked Zelensky as a dictator, calling him a 'modestly successful comedian' a day after accusing Ukraine of starting the war.\n\nMoscow, and now Trump, have said he should stand for reelection before any peace deal can go into effect. That comes after Russian negotiators and their U.S. counterparts discussed potential economic cooperation. The Russian side even said the sides discussed potential joint oil and gas drilling in the Arctic.\n\nTrump's comments forced lawmakers of his own party to grapple for ways to explain the administration's new posture, after years of steering billions to aid Ukraine's fight.\n\n'The President speaks for himself,' said new Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said he disagreed with Trump's decision to meet with the Russians without the Ukrainians being present. '“They were invaded by Putin and he’s responsible for murder, rape, torture, kidnapping of an untold number of Ukrainians. They’ve got to be at the table,' he said. \n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told CNN Monday when asked if Putin can be trusted in talks: 'No. Putin is a war criminal who should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.' \n\nRepublicansVladimir PutinUkraineJD Vance\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRepublican senators call out 'gangster' Putin but demand Zelensky face voters after Trump's 'dictator' attack\n\nAdd comment","summary":"President Trump's blasts at Ukrainian Zelensky including calling him a 'dictator' prompted calls from Senate Republicans for him to stand for reelection.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14414923/senators-putin-ukraine-zelensky-election-trump-dictator.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/19/22/95346317-0-image-m-18_1740005330551.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:46:26","author":"Editor,Geoff Earle","authors":["Editor","Geoff Earle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":292320392,"title":"USA, Canada hockey stars who fought each other throw subtle jabs ahead of 4 Nations final","text":"For Team USA, their three fights in nine seconds against Team Canada on Saturday night all started with a group chat. Brady Tkachuk, who was involved in the second fight just one second after his brother, Matthew, dropped the gloves, revealed that the brothers and JT. Miller also made a group chat earlier that day and planned out their fights (Brady fought Matthew's Florida Panthers teammate, Sam Bennett). When speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Brandon Hagel, who fought Matthew, threw a slight jab at the texters, saying he fought \"for the flag\" and \"not the cameras.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Hagel added as a subtle shot that his Canadian teammates \"don't have any group chats.\" Well, Matthew caught wind of that on Wednesday and hit back with a jab of his own. \"Maybe their team doesn't like each other, then, if they don't have group chats,\" Matthew said. The rivalry, which has spanned decades, is probably the hottest it's ever been, and it's only going to get hotter when the two bordering countries duke it out on Thursday night in Boston for the 4 Nations Face Off final. USA-CANADA 4 NATIONS FIGHTS WERE 'FAKE,' SPORTS RADIO LEGEND CHRIS 'MAD DOG' RUSSO SAYS The fights occurred shortly after the Canadian crowd booed \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" And while that's mostly fanfare due to the political tension between the two countries, it's very clear that the USA players were not fans of what they heard. Canadian crowds have booed the USA anthem at recent sporting events amid President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canada. The tariffs have since been paused, but the president has also teased Canadians with the idea of Canada becoming the \"51st state.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Team USA earned a 3-1 win on Saturday after the fights in round-robin play, despite Canada's Connor McDavid opening up the scoring.

At least six of the workers were notified Wednesday that the “agency is rescinding your termination. You are not being removed from EPA or from federal civil services at this time.”\n\nThe group of workers who regained their jobs includes three scientists who were earlier interviewed by the Sun-Times about being fired last week.\n\nThose EPA new hires include Nyla McCranie, a scientist on the environmental justice team; Nicole Smith, who works on air quality issues; and Bridget Lynch, a scientist focused on drinking water and ground water protection.\n\nAll three spoke to the Sun-Times on Tuesday but declined to comment on their reinstatement, citing agency policy to not discuss EPA matters with the media.\n\nEPA’s regional office in Chicago oversees environmental protection and air, water and land pollution issues in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and 37 Native American tribes. The agency has historically employed more than 1,000 people in Chicago and across the Midwest.\n\nQuestions about the decisions were referred to the EPA’s media relations team in Washington, which provided a broad statement on probationary employees across the country.\n\n“EPA has terminated 388 probationary employees after a thorough review of agency functions in accordance with President Trump’s executive orders,” the statement said. The agency “has followed standard protocols and procedures, ensuring impacted staff received notifications of their status.”\n\nA union official in Chicago called Trump’s actions “chaotic and disturbing.”\n\n“It’s so difficult to work at the agency right now,” said Nicole Cantello, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704. The union represents hundreds of Midwest EPA workers.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/02/19/trump-reinstates-recently-fired-chicago-epa-workers-pollution","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11f5fb9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6762x3860+0+325/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2F06%2F22a042354f449d2a2b960f6db6d9%2Fepar","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:45:56","author":"Brett Chase","authors":["Brett Chase"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.151},{"id":292317412,"title":"Ex-NFL punter Chris Kluwe arrested over protest of MAGA plaque","text":"Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe was arrested Tuesday at a city council meeting in Huntington Beach, California, for protesting a plaque on display at the public library through “peaceful civil disobedience.” \n\nKluwe, 43, and other residents were on hand to protest a plaque at the library they viewed as a “propaganda statement” because of its references to the Make America Great Again movement. \n\nIn a video from the meeting, the eight-year Vikings veteran (2005-12) told the seven-member city council — all Republicans — what MAGA stood for to him before he stepped toward the government body, leading to his arrest. \n\n“Unfortunately it’s clear that this council doesn’t listen, so instead I’m gonna take my time to say what MAGA has stood for these past three weeks,” Kluwe said. “MAGA stands for trying to erase trans people from existence. MAGA stands for resegregation and racism. MAGA stands for censorship and book bans.” \n\nOn the plaque, the words “Magical,” “Alluring,” “Galvanizing,” and “Adventurous” are next to each other to spell out MAGA, and below it, appeared to be a direct reference to the political movement popularized by President Donald Trump. \n\n“Through hope and change our nation has built back better to the golden era of Making America Great Again!” the wording reads, according to the Orange County Register. \n\nKluwe, an outspoken activist on LGBTQ+ issues and marriage equality, eventually called MAGA “explicitly a Nazi movement” before informing the council that he would then perform an act of civil disobedience. \n\nHe then took a step toward the council members and was quickly stopped by Huntington Beach police. \n\nKluwe was arrested and carried out of the chambers by several uniformed law enforcement officers.\n\nThe Philadelphia native was cited and released after he spent four hours in custody on Tuesday. \n\nKluwe’s outspoken nature on social issues is believed to have led to a rift between Kluwe and the Vikings coaching staff. \n\nHe told the OC Register that what he did was not really directed toward the council, but more about the general public. \n\n“This was done not with the intention of changing the council’s mind, because I don’t think those minds can be changed,” Kluwe said. “It was done so that people who are watching and people who will watch understand that this is important enough to get arrested for. That it’s important to stand up and speak truth to power and to do so in a way that other people can emulate.”","summary":"Kluwe, 43, and other residents were on hand to protest a plaque at the library they viewed as a “propaganda statement” because of its references to the Make America Great Again movement. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/sports/ex-nfl-punter-chris-kluwe-arrested-over-maga-plaque-protest/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/newspress-collage-5ara0bdjj-1740007737939.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1739989806&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 23:44:39","author":"Christian Arnold","authors":["Christian Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049}]}
