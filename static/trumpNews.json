Letters will start going out “pretty soon\" before the approaching deadline , he said. “We’ll look at how a country treats us — are they good, are they not so good — some countries we don’t care, we’ll just send a high number out,” Trump told Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" during a wide-ranging interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday. Those letters, he said, would say, “Congratulations, we’re allowing you to shop in the United States of America, you’re going to pay a 25% tariff, or a 35% or a 50% or 10%.” Trump had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation. The administration had set a goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days . Negotiations continue, but “there's 200 countries, you can't talk to all of them,” he said in the interview. Trump also discussed a potential TikTok deal, relations with China, the strikes on Iran and his immigration crackdown. Here are the key takeaways: Few details on possible TikTok deal A group of wealthy investors will make an offer to buy TikTok, Trump said, hinting at a deal that could safeguard the future of the popular social media platform , which is owned by China’s ByteDance. “We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way. I think I’ll need, probably, China approval, and I think President Xi (Jinping) will probably do it,” Trump said. Trump did not offer any details about the investors, calling them “a group of very wealthy people.” “I'll tell you in about two weeks,” he said when asked for specifics. It's a time frame Trump often cites , most recently about a decision on whether the U.S. military would get directly involved in the war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites just days later . Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for 90 more days to give his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. It is the third time Trump extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court — took effect. Trump insists US ‘obliterated’ Iran's nuclear facilities U.S. strikes on Iran “obliterated” its nuclear facilities, Trump insisted, and he said whoever leaked a preliminary intelligence assessment suggesting Tehran's nuclear program had been set back only a few months should be prosecuted. Trump said Iran was “weeks away” from achieving a nuclear weapon before he ordered the strikes. “It was obliterated like nobody’s ever seen before,” Trump said. “And that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said Sunday on X that Trump \"exaggerated to cover up and conceal the truth.\" Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, told CBS' “Face the Nation” that his country's nuclear program is peaceful and that uranium “enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right and we want to implement this right” under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. “I think that enrichment will not — never stop.” Rafael Grossi , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on CBS that “it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it’s not total damage.\" Grossi also said the U.N. nuclear watchdog has faced pressure to report that Iran had a nuclear weapon or was close to one, but “we simply didn’t because this was not what we were seeing.” Of the leak of the intelligence assessment, Trump said anyone found to be responsible should be prosecuted. Journalists who received it should be asked who their source was, he said: “You have to do that and I suspect we’ll be doing things like that.” His press secretary said Thursday that the administration is investigating the matter. A ‘temporary pass’ for immigration raids on farms and hotels? As he played up his immigration crackdown, Trump offered a more nuanced view when it comes to farm and hotel workers. “I’m the strongest immigration guy that there’s ever...","summary":"Trump had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/not-planning-to-extend-pause-on-global-tariffs-beyond-july-9-trump-1888339","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/06/30/1933076-aa-500843111zon.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 01:16:52","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":336533938,"title":"‘A Tool in the Toolbox’ – US Senator Says His Russian-Sanctions Bill Has Trump’s Support","text":"Counter to recent statements on Russian sanctions by the US Administration, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) claimed on Sunday that the bill he introduced proposing new penalties on Russia will pass Congress in July, and President Donald Trump will sign it.\n\nGraham said that Trump now supports his bill, which proposes imposing a 500-percent tariff on imported Russian goods. But, Graham added, Trump himself would make the final decision on how precisely to impose those measures independently, the senator told ABC News.\n\nThose goods include Russian oil, natural gas and uranium.\n\n“If you’re buying products from Russia and you’re not helping Ukraine, then there’s a 500 percent tariff on your products coming into the United States,” Graham said, explaining the language of the bill.\n\n“India and China buy 70 percent of Putin’s oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the president to put tariffs on China and India and other countries to stop them from supporting Putin’s war machine, to get him to the table,” Graham added.\n\n“But we’re going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn’t have today.”\n\nWhile the European Union continues to move forward with restrictive measures on Russia, extending its 17th such round of sanctions last week, and proposing to eliminate its Russian fuel imports in its next round, Trump has been reticent to add any additional penalties on Moscow.\n\nLast Wednesday, June 25, Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly said that Trump would not support Europe’s request to strengthen sanctions, because the US president fears that would derail the already sputtering peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nGraham announced the bill in April, about a month before he and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. At the time, he said he had 67 co-sponsors in he Senate. Now it has 84.\n\nIn an upper chamber split between 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, that gives Graham’s bill strong bi-partisan support.\n\n“Ukraine’s fight is our fight,” Blumenthal, one of the Democratic co-sponsors said during his Kyiv visit. “Our national security is at stake because [Russian autocrat] Vladimir Putin will keep going and his aggression will continue not just against Ukraine but against our allies and we will be obligated by our treaty to put troops on the ground,” Blumenthal said.\n\n“Now is the time to stop Putin, now is the time to support Ukraine and I’m inspired by the continuing bravery and strength of the Ukrainian people,” he said.","summary":"“My bill has 84 co-sponsors,” Sen.

its aim was to keep the Islamic republic from developing a nuclear weapon — an ambition Tehran has consistently denied, insisting it has the right to develop nuclear power for civilian purposes like energy.\n\nThe fighting derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, a staunch ally of Israel’s.\n\n“We did not start the war, but we have responded to the aggressor with all our power,” Iran’s armed forces chief of staff, Abdolrahim Mousavi, was quoted as saying by state television, referring to Israel.\n\n“We have serious doubts over the enemy’s compliance with its commitments including the ceasefire, we are ready to respond with force” if attacked again, he added, six days into the ceasefire announced by US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres published on Sunday, Iran demanded that the United Nations recognise Israel and the United States as being to blame for this month’s war.\n\n“We officially request hereby that the Security Council recognise the Israeli regime and the United States as the initiators of the act of aggression and acknowledge their subsequent responsibility, including the payment of compensation and reparations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote in the letter.\n\nThe United States joined Israel in its campaign during the war, carrying out strikes on three key facilities used for Iran’s atomic programme.\n\nTrump has threatened further strikes should Iran enrich uranium to levels capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons.\n\nAccording to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran had enriched uranium to 60 percent in 2021, well above the 3.67 percent limit set by a 2015 agreement from which the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018.\n\nTo make a weapon, Iran would need to enrich uranium up to 90 percent.\n\nIsrael has maintained ambiguity about its own atomic arsenal, neither officially confirming nor denying it exists, but the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated it has 90 nuclear warheads.\n\nAccording to Iran’s health ministry, at least 627 civilians were killed and 4,900 injured during the 12-day war with Israel.\n\nRetaliatory missile attacks by Iran on Israel killed 28 people, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nDuring the war, Iran arrested dozens of people it accused of spying for Israel, also saying it seized equipment including drones and weapons.\n\nIran’s parliament on Sunday voted to ban the unauthorised use of communications equipment, including tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service, according to the official news agency IRNA.\n\nAn Israeli strike on Tehran’s Evin prison during the war killed at least 71 people, Iran’s judiciary said Sunday.\n\nThe strike on Monday destroyed part of the administrative building at Evin, a large, heavily fortified complex in the north of Tehran, which rights groups say holds political prisoners and foreign nationals.\n\nAccording to judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir, the victims at Evin included administrative staff, guards, prisoners and visiting relatives as well as people living nearby.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday that detained French nationals Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, held at Evin for three years, were not believed to have been harmed by the Israeli strike, which he described as “unacceptable”.\n\nOn Tuesday, a day after the strike, the judiciary said that the Iranian prison authority had transferred inmates out of Evin prison, without specifying their number or identifying them.\n\nThe inmates at Evin have included Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi as well as several French nationals and other foreigners.","summary":"TEHRAN: Iran on

US strikes to destroy Tehran’s nuclear programme have been. \n\nUS officials have stated that their strikes obliterated key nuclear sites in Iran, although US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would consider bombing Iran again if Tehran is enriching uranium to worrisome levels. \n\n“The capacities they have are there.

You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have.” Grossi was also asked about reports of Iran moving its stock of highly enriched uranium in the run-up to the US strikes and said it was not clear where that material was. “So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved,” he said.","summary":"VIENNA: Iran could be producing enriched uranium in a few months, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog Rafael Grossi was quoted as saying on Sunday, raising doubts about how effective US strikes to destroy Tehran’s nuclear programme have been. \n\n\n\nUS officials have stated that their strikes obliterated key nuclear sites in Iran, although US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would consider bombing Iran again if Tehran is enriching uranium to worrisome levels. \n\n\n\n“The capacities they have are there.

'It's been really hard on [Hailey].'\nBieber landed himself in hot water with the public in late May after posting troubling back-to-back social media posts.\n'love u moms but mothers day sucks *ss,' the Canadian singer wrote as an Instagram Note on Hailey's first Mother's Day as a parent. She returned the swipe one month later on Father's Day.\nAnd days later he shared the cover image of Vogue's summer issue, starring Hailey.\nAlong with the picture, he added an anecdotal caption that began, 'Yo, this reminds me [of] when Hailey and I got into a huge fight.'\nHe shockingly confessed, 'I told Hails that she would never be on the cover of Vogue. Yikes. I know, so mean.'\n\nView gallery\n\nBieber has drawn attention in recent weeks for his social media antics, with sources saying his longtime wife Hailey is stressed out by his behavior\n\nView gallery\n\nView gallery\n\nOn Friday Justin shared a slew of photos from his and model Hailey's, 28, life with son Jack Blues, 10 months \n\nView gallery\n\nIn one recent picture, which was also posted by Hailey, baby Jack sat in lush green grass on a soccer field\n\nHailey Bieber leaves comment on Justin's Father's Day post\n\nProgress: 0%\n\nCurrent Time 0:00\n\nDuration Time 0:31\n\nVideo Quality\n\nText Edge Style\nFont Family\n\nBut according Bieber's weekend Instagram pictures, which he spread out through multiple posts, the spouses are sticking together.\nJack was dressed in a blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and a pair of jeans in several posts.\nIn another picture, which was also posted by Hailey, the infant sat in lush green grass on a soccer field.\n'Justin's going through a difficult time, and Hailey is giving him room to get himself back on track. He's doing his best, but it's tough,' a second source told Us Weekly.\nBut, ultimately, the person close to the couple said: 'She knows that's part of the industry and who she's married to,' adding that the odds of them calling it quits 'are very slim, especially because of their faith.'\n'Faith is a big part of their life. They believe they are soulmates and meant for each other. They'll do anything to make it work,' the source emphasized. 'They are going to get through it.'\nJustin BieberHailey Baldwin\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Bieber emerges solo at Hollywood spa after dropping major hint about relationship status with wife Hailey\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments (0)\n\nComments are subject to our House rules and Terms\n\nLog in to comment\n\nWorst rated\n\nNo one seems to have shared their thoughts on this topic yet\nLeave a comment so your voice will be heard first.\nTerms | Privacy | Feedback\n\nEnter search term:\n\nHarry Styles 'passionately snogs mystery woman at Glastonbury Festival as sparks fly in the VIP section'\n\nRod Stewart makes political statement at Glasto after backing Reform as he is joined by rock legends - amid fury at Bob Vylan's anti-Israel chant \n\nJessica Alba's lookalike daughter Honor, 17, quietly steals the spotlight at Bezos-Sánchez wedding amid her parents' bitter split\n\nEva Longoria sizzles in pink bikini during steamy Spain getaway as she steals spotlight from BFF Lauren Sánchez after ditching wedding of the century\n\nHolly Willoughby makes a rare appearance with husband Dan Baldwin as she opts for a chic paisley dress for the final day of sun-soaked Glastonbury\n\nSchool uniforms that pass the test!

GOP leaders are rushing to meet Trump’s July 4 deadline to pass the package, but they barely secured enough support to muscle it past a procedural hurdle in a tense scene the day before.\nA handful of Republican holdouts revolted, and it took phone calls from Trump and a visit from Vice President J D Vance to keep it on track.\nGOP Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday he would not seek reelection after Trump badgered him for saying he could not vote for the bill with its steep Medicaid cuts.\nA new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. It also said the package would increase the deficit by nearly USD 3.3 trillion over the decade.\nBut other Senate Republicans, along with conservatives in the House, are pushing for steeper cuts, particularly to healthcare, drawing their own unexpected warning from Trump.\n“Don’t go too crazy!” the president posted on social media. “REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected.” All told, the Senate bill includes some USD 4 trillion in tax cuts, making permanent Trump’s 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.\nThe Senate package would roll back billions in green energy tax credits that Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide, and impose USD 1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements and making sign-up eligibility more stringent.\nAdditionally, the bill would provide a USD 350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.\nIf the Senate can push through overnight voting and pass the bill, it would need to return to the House. Speaker Mike Johnson has told lawmakers to be on call for a return to Washington this coming week.\n Democrats ready to fight all night Unable to stop the march toward passage of the 940-page bill, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress is using the tools at its disposal to delay and drag out the process.\nDemocrats forced a full reading of the text, which took some 16 hours, ending Sunday afternoon. Then senators took over the debate, filling the chamber with speeches, while Republicans largely stood aside.\n“Reckless and irresponsible,” said Senator Gary Peters of Michigan.\n“A gift to the billionaire class,” said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\nSenator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, raised particular concern about the accounting method being used by the Republicans, which says the tax breaks from Trump’s first term, in 2017, are now “current policy” and the cost of extending them should not be counted toward deficits.\n“In my 33 years here in the United States Senate, things have never — never — worked this way,” said Murray, the longest-serving Democrat on the Budget Committee.\nShe said that kind of “magic math” won’t fly with Americans trying to balance their own household books.\n“Go back home and try that game with your constituents,” she said. “We still need to kick people off their health care — that’s too expensive. We still need to close those hospitals — we have to cut costs. And we still have to kick people off SNAP — because the debt is out of control.” Sanders said Tillis’ decision not to seek reelection shows the hold that Trump’s cult of personality has over the GOP.\n“We are literally taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids,” Sanders said, while giving tax breaks to Jeff Bezos and other wealthy billionaires.\n GOP leaders unphased Republicans are using their majorities to push aside Democratic opposition, and appeared undeterred, even as they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks.\n“We’re going to pass the ‘Big, beautiful bill,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, the Budget Committee chairman.\n“And President Trump is going to sign it.” The holdout Republicans remain reluctant to give their votes, and their leaders have almost no room to spare, given their narrow majorities. Essentially, they can afford three dissenters in the Senate, with its 53-47 GOP edge, and about as many in the House, if all members are present and voting.\nTrump, who has at times allowed wiggle room on his deadline, kept the pressure on lawmakers to finish.\nHe threatened to campaign against Tillis, who was worried that Medicaid cuts would leave many without healthcare in his state.\nTrump badgered Tillis again on Sunday morning, saying the senator “has hurt the great people of North Carolina.” Later Sunday, Tillis issued a lengthy statement announcing he would not seek reelection in 2026.

In a recent interview on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures, Trump said, I don't think I'll need to extend the cutoff. However, he also added, I could, no big deal, stating that he could do so if needed. Trump's comments come after he said Friday that the administration could do whatever we want with the deadline, whether by extending or shortening it. I'd like to make it shorter. I'd like to just send letters out to everybody, 'Congratulations, you're paying 25%,' Trump said in a press briefing on Friday. Trump's initial stance was to impose 25% tariffs on countries that don't strike deals by the deadline. The Trump administration started this pressure campaign earlier this year, asking trading partners to cut deficits and remove barriers during the negotiation period before April's suspended country-based tariffs are reimposed. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that while countries are approaching us with very good deals, it may not be possible to finalize agreements with all major partners by July 9. Bessent suggested a more realistic trade wrap-up by Labor Day, saying 10 or 12 of the important 18 relationships could be finalized first. This highlights the contrast between Trump's tough public stance and the complicated reality of negotiating with dozens of countries at once. Despite these challenges, trade teams remain active with recent Washington meetings involving Indian officials, one country Trump said is close to a potential deal. There are major concerns over the comprehensiveness of trade deals that can be struck by either deadline. The much-publicized UK deal still has key issues unresolved, while the recently signed China agreement leaves questions on fentanyl trafficking enforcement and US exporters' access to Chinese markets. These cases highlight fears that deals made under deadline pressure may not be thorough enough. Trump's hardline stance gives him leverage but also risks imposing economically disruptive tariffs if meaningful agreements aren't reached. The administration continues to present its approach as necessary to correct unfair trade imbalances, even as businesses prepare for possible tariff impacts if negotiations extend beyond July without extensions or completed accords.","summary":"US President Donald Trump has said that he doesn't expect to extend the July 9 deadline for trade partners to strike deals with the US and avoid hefty tariffs of up to 25%.","url":"https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/business/trump-signals-no-extension-for-july-9-trade-deal-deadline/story","image":"https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l92520250630003528.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 00:38:22","author":"Akash Pandey","authors":["Akash Pandey"],"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":336529534,"title":"Kyodo News Digest: June 30, 2025","text":"The following is the latest list of selected news summaries by Kyodo News.\n\nChina lifts ban on Japanese seafood imports imposed in 2023\n\nBEIJING - China on Sunday lifted its ban on Japanese seafood imports imposed in August 2023 following the release into the sea of treated radioactive wastewater from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant.\n\nBeijing introduced the blanket ban in a demonstration of its strong opposition to the ocean discharge. The Asian neighbors agreed to begin procedures to resume Japanese seafood imports in May, but it may take a few months until shipments begin following the completion of procedural steps.\n\nTOKYO - Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Sunday he will consider what will be \"the most appropriate\" framework for his coalition government after a crucial election next month for the House of Councillors where his ruling coalition is seeking to retain its majority.\n\nIn an interview with Kyodo News, Ishiba called securing a majority of the 248-member upper chamber a \"must-attain\" goal but said it is not an easy task, at a time when conservative supporters are increasingly looking to alternatives to his Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nTrump shows no willingness to compromise on Japan auto tariffs\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump made clear in an interview broadcast Sunday that he has no plans to roll back hefty auto tariffs imposed on Japan, despite its strong opposition expressed in now-stalled negotiations.\n\nTrump said his administration is ready to unilaterally send letters \"starting pretty soon\" to Japan and many other trading partners informing them of tariff rates for their exports to the United States.\n\nTOKYO - Half of Japanese voters want Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition to lose its majority in the House of Councillors in next month's election, a Kyodo News survey showed Sunday.\n\nThe nationwide telephone poll conducted Saturday and Sunday found that 50.2 percent of respondents want the Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito party to lose their upper house majority, while 38.1 percent want them to retain control following the July 20 election.\n\nBEIJING - China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade scheduled for Sept. 3 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, sources familiar with the matter said Sunday.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, has proposed that Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the country during the same month, coinciding with a U.N.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive intelligence, said Ratcliffe laid out the importance of the strikes on the metal conversion facility during a classified hearing for US lawmakers last week.

Details about the private briefings surfaced as President Donald Trump and his administration keep pushing back on questions from Democratic lawmakers and others about how far Iran was set back by the strikes before last Tuesday's ceasefire with Israel took hold. “It was obliterating like nobody's ever seen before,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\". Also Read | Earthquake in Nepal: Quake of Magnitude 4.2 on Richter Scale Hits South Asian Country. \"And that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.” Ratcliffe also told lawmakers that the intelligence community assessed the vast majority of Iran's amassed enriched uranium likely remains buried under the rubble at Isfahan and Fordo, two of the three key nuclear facilities targeted by US strikes. But even if the uranium remains intact, the loss of its metal conversion facility effectively has taken away Tehran's ability to build a bomb for years to come, the official said. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Sunday on CBS' “Face the Nation” that the three Iranian sites with “capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree\". But, he added, “some is still standing” and that because capabilities remain, “if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again\". He said assessing the full damage comes down to Iran allowing in inspectors. \"Frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared, and there is nothing there,\" Grossi said. Trump has insisted from just hours after three key targets were struck by US bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles that Iran's nuclear program was “obliterated.” His defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said they were “destroyed\". A preliminary report issued by the US Defence Intelligence Agency, meanwhile, said the strikes did significant damage to the Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites, but did not totally destroy the facilities. As a result of Israeli and US strikes, Grossi said that “it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage\". Israel claims it has set back Iran's nuclear program by “many years\". The metal conversion facility that Ratcliffe said was destroyed was located at the Isfahan nuclear facility. The process of transforming enriched uranium gas into dense metal, or metallisation, is a key step in building the explosive core of a bomb. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in comments at the NATO summit last week also suggested that it was likely the US strikes had destroyed the metal conversion facility. “You can't do a nuclear weapon without a conversion facility,\" Rubio said. \"We can't even find where it is, where it used to be on the map. You can't even find where it used to be because the whole thing is just blackened out. It's gone. It's wiped out.” The CIA director also stressed to lawmakers during the congressional briefing that Iran's air defence was shattered during the 12-day assault. As a result, any attempt by Iran to rebuild its nuclear programme could now easily be thwarted by Israeli strikes that Iran currently has little wherewithal to defend against, the official said. Ratcliffe's briefing to lawmakers on the US findings appeared to mesh with some of Israeli officials' battle damage assessments. Israeli officials have determined that Iran's ability to enrich uranium to a weapons-grade level was neutralised for a prolonged period, according to a senior Israeli military official who was not authorized to talk publicly about the matter. Tehran's nuclear programme was also significantly damaged by the strikes killing key scientists, damage to Iran's missile production industry and the battering of Iran's aerial defence system, according to the Israeli's assessment. Grossi, and some Democrats, note that Iran still has the know-how. “You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Grossi said, emphasising the need to come to a diplomatic deal on the country's nuclear programme.

It could also make Tillis a wild card in a party where few lawmakers are willing to risk Trump’s wrath by opposing his agenda or actions. Trump had already been threatening him with a primary challenge, and posted Sunday that Tillis' announcement was “Great News!”\n\n“In Washington over the last few years, it’s become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species,” Tillis said in a lengthy statement.\n\nTillis said he was proud of his career in public service but acknowledged the difficult political environment for those who buck their party and go it alone.\n\n“I look forward to having the pure freedom to call the balls and strikes as I see fit and representing the great people of North Carolina to the best of my ability,” Tillis said in a statement.\n\nRepublicans hold a 53-47 edge in the Senate.\n\nTrump, in social posts, had berated Tillis for being one of two Republican senators who voted on Saturday night against advancing the massive tax bill.\n\nThe Republican president accused Tillis of seeking publicity with his “no” vote and threatened to campaign against him, accusing the senator of doing nothing to help his constituents after last year’s devastating floods in western North Carolina from Hurricane Helene.\n\n“Tillis is a talker and complainer, NOT A DOER,” Trump wrote.\n\nThe announcement from the two-term senator surprised senior Republicans with its timing, but not necessarily the substance. Tillis had planned to announce his reelection plans later this year, likely September at the latest, but had been heavily leaning in favor of retiring, according to a person close to the senator.\n\nIn the hours before his announcement, Tillis was weighing two questions: whether Trump and the White House would give him freedom to campaign with some independence, and whether Tillis would have the full protection of Senate Republican leaders, said the person, who was granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics.\n\nThe GOP leadership’s decision to forge ahead with cuts to Medicaid that Tillis repeatedly warned would devastate North Carolina, and the president’s Truth Social post calling for a primary challenger to the senator made it clear to him that the answers to those two questions were no.\n\nTillis then decided he would announce his retirement, with the thinking that it would remove any ambiguity whether he would flip his opposition to the GOP’s sweeping tax bill.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican Party chairman, Jason Simmons, said the party wishes Tillis well and “will hold this seat for Republicans in 2026.” Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the chairman of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans, did not mention Tillis in a statement but said the party's winning streak in North Carolina will continue. Scott noted that Trump won the state three times.\n\nDemocrats expressed confidence about their prospects.\n\nFormer Rep. Wiley Nickel, who announced his candidacy in April, said he was ready for any Republican challenger.\n\n“I’ve flipped a tough seat before and we’re going to do it again,” Nickel said in a statement.\n\nSome said Tillis' decision is another sign of the dramatic transformation of the Republican Party under Trump, with few lawmakers critical of the president or his agenda remaining in office.\n\nIt \"proves there is no space within the Republican Party to dissent over taking health care away from 11.8 million people,” said Lauren French, spokesperson for the Senate Majority PAC, a political committee aligned with the chamber’s Democratic members.\n\nTillis rose to prominence in North Carolina when, as a second-term state House member, he quit his IBM consultant job and led the GOP’s recruitment and fundraising efforts in the chamber for the 2010 elections. Republicans won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time in 140 years.\n\nTillis was later elected as state House speaker and helped enact conservative policies on taxes, gun rights, regulations and abortion while serving in the role for four years. He also helped push a state constitutional referendum to ban gay marriage, which was approved by voters in 2012 but was ultimately struck down by the courts as unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2014, Tillis helped flip control of the U.S. Senate to the GOP after narrowly defeating Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. During his more than a decade in office, he championed issues such as mental health and substance abuse recovery, Medicaid expansion and support for veterans.\n\nAs a more moderate Republican, Tillis became known for his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues. That got him into trouble with his party at times, most notably in 2023 when North Carolina Republicans voted to censure him over several matters, including his challenges to certain immigration policies and his gun policy record.\n\n“Sometimes those bipartisan initiatives got me into trouble with my own party,\" Tillis said, \"but I wouldn’t have changed a single one.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Joey Cappelletti in Washington and Makiya Seminera in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

apart from Spain - agreed to lift defence spending to five per cent of GDP over the next decade. \n\nTrump, who has threatened Spain with retaliatory tariffs, has signalled he expects Australia to follow suit by increasing defence expenditure, but Albanese is so far holding firm.\n\nNow, Mr Qian has ramped up the pressure on the Australian Prime Minister to keep military spending down to its current level, which aims to reach 2.3 per cent of GDP over the next ten years.\n\nWithout explicitly naming the United States, Mr Qian slammed the 'so-called China threat narrative', while painting Chinese President Xi Jinping as a man of peace.\n\n'Such rhetoric and actions are steeped in Cold War mentality, blatantly creating division, fuelling a global arms race as well as threatening world peace and stability, which warrants our high vigilance,' he wrote in The Australian.\n\n'By playing up international and regional tensions and slandering China’s normal military build-up, these countries are merely seeking nothing but excuses to drastically grow their military spending, even arbitrarily reaching beyond its geographical scope and mandate.'\n\nChina has warned Anthony Albanese not to increase defence spending, claiming both countries are 'friends, not foes'\n\nWithout explicitly naming the United States, China's top diplomat in Australia slammed the 'so-called China threat narrative', while painting Chinese President Xi Jinping (pictured) as a man of peace\n\nMr Qian accused the US of wanting to 'maintain their hegemony' by stifling the 'development and advancement of countries such as China'.\n\nHe also sought to appeal to Albanese's domestic pressures, claiming an increase in defence spending would come at a high price, especially during the cost of living crisis.\n\n'Dramatically increasing military spending places a heavy fiscal burden on the countries involved, undermining their efforts to boost economies and improve livelihoods, and further straining a global economy already struggling with weak recovery,' he said.\n\nMr Qian also claimed China had 'never initiated a war or occupied an inch of a foreign land' over the last 70 years - despite invading Vietnam in 1979.\n\n'China unwaveringly adheres to a defensive national defence policy, with military spending accounting for just 1.5 per cent of its GDP,' he added.\n\n'It is far below the global average and paling in comparison to certain hegemons or their allies and partners.'\n\nMr Qian talked up China and Australia's reliance on one another as trade partners - a relationship that has thawed significantly under Albanese's Labor administration. \n\n'As I often hear from Australian friends, \"we have hundreds of reasons to be friends, and none to be enemies\",' he wrote.\n\nMr Qian added that China and Australia are 'friends, not foes'. \n\nDonald Trump, who has threatened Spain with retaliatory tariffs, has signalled he expects Australia to follow suit by increasing defence expenditure, but Albanese is so far holding firm\n\n'This should never have been in question,' he said.\n\n'China has been always developing bilateral friendship and co-operation with the utmost sincerity and patience, and we hope Australia will work with us in the same direction.'\n\nTrump indicated last week that he expects his allies in the Asia-Pacific - including Australia - to increase their defence funding in line with NATO members. \n\n'Yeah, look, if our allies in Europe and our NATO allies can do that, I think our allies and our friends in the Asia Pacific region can do it as well,' White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Friday.\n\nMs Leavitt said she would leave the 'specific relations and discussions' for individual countries to Trump.\n\nThis means that Albanese may be pressured to increase defence spending if he hopes to secure a carve-out from the punishing tariffs imposed by the US on imports, including a 50 per cent levy on steel and aluminium.\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong is heading to Washington this week for 'Quad' talks with her counterparts from the US, India and Japan. \n\nShe is expected to hold one-on-one meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \n\n'The United States is our closest ally and principal strategic partner,' Senator Wong said.\n\n'Our alliance contributes to the peace, prosperity and stability of our countries and the region we share.' \n\nAnthony AlbaneseSpainNATOChina\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nChina issues a dark warning to Anthony Albanese: 'This should never have been in question'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"China has delivered a tough message to Anthony Albanese's government.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14859189/China-issues-urgent-warning-Anthony-Albanese-never-question.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/30/01/99842339-0-image-a-13_1751241924110.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-30 00:11:13","author":"Editor,Max Aitchison","authors":["Editor","Max Aitchison"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":336530074,"title":"Glastonbury 2025 is one of the festival’s most politicised events in recent memory","text":"Glastonbury Festival became the unwilling centre of a row involving Keir Starmer’s government and the BBC, after it played host to not one but two controversial performances over the weekend. \n\nThis year’s event was held in its traditional location of Worthy Farm, Somerset, where around 200,000 music fans flocked to see performances from acts including rock band The 1975, pop singer Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart and Neil Young.\n\nDominating much of the conversation this year, however, was the presence of Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap and a headline-generating performance from punk band Bob Vylan, who played the Other Stage immediately before Kneecap’s set. \n\nThe prime minister and other public figures had earlier voiced their objections to Kneecap’s performance due to band member Liam Og O hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, being charged with a terror offence – for allegedly displaying a flag in support of proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah, while saying “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” at a gig in November last year.\n\nHe has denied the charges, calling them a “distraction” from the plight of Palestinians. \n\nDiscussing his bandmate's forthcoming court date onstage, Naoise O Caireallain, who performs under the name Moglai Bap, said they would “start a riot outside the courts”, before clarifying: “No riots, just love and support, and support for Palestine.”\n\nThe trio also led chants of “f*** Keir Starmer” after the prime minister said their performance would not be “appropriate”. \n\nHowever, it was Bob Vylan’s set in the moments before Kneecap took to the stage that generated a bigger row, and made this year’s festival one of the most politicised in recent memory. \n\nThe duo led crowds in a chant of “death, death to the IDF” – a moment that was broadcast live by the BBC – prompting Avon and Somerset Police to say they were assessing video footage of both performances. \n\nGlastonbury organisers said they were “appalled” by Bob Vylan’s conduct and that their chants “very much crossed a line”. The BBC called the band’s language “deeply offensive” and confirmed it would not be shown on demand on iPlayer. \n\nThe prime minister said: “There is no excuse for this kind of appalling hate speech... The BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast.”\n\nKneecap and Bob Vylan’s performances –as well as statements in support of Palestine from artists including Joy Crookes, Turnstile, Nadine Shah – were in stark contrast to headliners The 1975. Controversial frontman Matty Healy made a nervous speech about how he didn’t want the band’s legacy to be “one of politics… we want it to be that of love and friendship”. \n\n“I’m not trying to be too earnest, but you can go out into the world and there’s loads of politics everywhere,” he continued. “We don’t need more politics. We need more love and friendship.”\n\nIn a positive review for The Independent, critic Hannah Ewens wrote: “Undoubtedly, nerves or not, they’ve established themselves as the first future legacy headlining band of their generation.”\n\nThere were plenty of secret sets across the sun-soaked weekend (along with plenty of sunburn), predictably most of which were rumbled hours before the acts in question took to the stage. It had long-been rumoured (and was later confirmed) that US pop star Lorde would make an appearance on the day she released her new album, Virgin. The mysterious “Patchwork” – in a prime spot on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday – turned out to be Britpop heroes Pulp, while Haim blurted out that they were the “TBA” act on the Park Stage later that evening.\n\nOther highlights singled out by The Independent’s critics included Irish pop singer CMAT’s triumphant spot on the Pyramid Stage, pop-rock star Alanis Morissette, and Grammy-winning rapper Doechii, pop star Charli XCX and headliner Neil Young, whose three sets clashed as Young topped the bill on Saturday night. American rapper Busta Rhymes received a rapturous reception, while the UK’s own Skepta saved the day after alt-rock band Deftones were forced to cancel their set due to illness.\n\nFollowing the controversies of Saturday’s sets by Kneecap and Bob Vylan, musician Nadine Shah played on the Other Stage with a backdrop that displayed images of a devastated Gaza. She ended her set by playing voicenotes from Palestinian children, which brought her to tears. The backdrop was designed by digital artist Cold War Steve and closed on an image of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu sitting on deckchairs in a bombed-out Gaza while Starmer served them cocktails. At the end of the set, she read out an open letter by Artists for Palestine UK in support of Palestine Action – the organisation that the government is proposing to ban under anti-terrorism laws. \n\nAround the festival site, too, were demonstrations and statements against figures including Tesla CEO and former Trump advisor Elon Musk. The protest group Led By Donkeys erected a billboard installation that featured Musk inside a rocket, with figures including Trump, Netanyahu, Vladimir Putin, Jeff Bezos, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and author JK Rowling queuing to board. “Send them to Mars… while we party on Earth,” the slogan said.\n\n“Music brings us together!” Rod Stewart told his audience at the Pyramid Stage as he took on the Legends Slot on Sunday, not long after endorsing Farage in an interview with The Times. The “Maggie May” rocker brought out special guests Mick Hucknall of Simply Red Fame, as well as The Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood and singer Lulu. He also invited Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis onto the stage, to celebrate his upcoming 90th birthday, with his proud daughter, festival co-organiser Emily Eavis, watching. \n\nIn a two-star review for The Independent, critic Mark Beaumont compared him negatively to headliner Neil Young, commenting: “The overall sense of the set is of the wringing out the dregs of a career. Far more than Neil Young last night, Stewart’s show suggests that the old guard’s time has well and truly passed, and that in future all legend slot bookings need to involve a fresh audition tape.”\n\nReactions to Olivia Rodrigo’s closing headline set were considerably more glowing. In a five-star review for The Independent, Kate Solomon said the pop star had the crowd “so deeply in their feelings that it feels like any deadbeat ex in the vicinity would burst directly into flames”.\n\nGlastonbury organisers have disclosed that 2026 will mark the festival’s traditional fallow year, in which the grounds where the festival is held are given time to recover. After a year so fraught with political tension, the Eavis family might need some time too.","summary":"Controversial performances from Bob Vylan and Kneecap sparked complaints from prime minister Keir Starmer, while murals protesting Elon Musk and Donald Trump popped up during the weekend","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/glastonbury/glastonbury-2025-politics-highlights-palestine-bob-vylan-kneecap-b2779228.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/29/10/Britain_Glastonbury_Music_Festival_Day_4_10053.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HkJCSkcU-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-30 00:05:00","author":"Roisin O'Connor","authors":["Roisin O'Connor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.098},{"id":336533156,"title":"Huge pop star 'goes public for the first time with new man at Glastonbury' after playing surprise set - as his ex takes a savage swipe","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jun 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Meghan's £6.50-a-jar 'crafted' raspberry jam is made on an industrial estate 2,000 miles from Montecito\n\nAt least 2 shot dead as snipers ambush firefighters and police in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after 'blaze set as bait'\n\nSchoolboy, 12, dies in West Yorkshire after trying social media challenge as family warn of dangers\n\nThe gangster guide to Dubai: The criminals from Manchester, Liverpool and beyond who call it home - and the tricks they use to live it up... without alerting authorities\n\nWhen I started balding in my teens I was so insecure.

The fatwa from Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi called on Muslims around the world to take a stand, according to the New York Sun. It states that any individual or government that challenges or endangers the leadership and unity of the global Islamic community (the Ummah) is to be regarded as a \"warlord\" or a \"mohareb,\" defined as someone who wages war against God. Under Iranian law, those identified as mohareb can face execution, crucifixion, limb amputation, or exile. \"Those who threaten the leadership and integrity of the Islamic Ummah are to be considered warlords,\" Makarem said in the ruling. He finished with a prayer asking for protection from these \"enemies\" and for the swift return of the Mahdi, a messianic figure in Shiite Islam. IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER SLAMS TRUMP JUST DAYS AFTER US STRIKES ON NUCLEAR SITES British-Iranian commentator Niyak Ghorbani condemned the fatwa, describing it as a state-endorsed incitement to global terrorism.

IRANIAN DICTATOR’S MOUTHPIECE INCITES FIRING BULLETS INTO TRUMP’S ‘EMPTY SKULL’ On June 13, Israeli airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear and military facilities, reportedly killing top scientists and commanders. In retaliation, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Israeli cities. The U.S. joined the conflict a week later, striking three Iranian nuclear sites.

While they sought approval from Capitol Hill in some of those cases, Congress never provided it.\n\nThat history has muddled the Democrats’ current argument that Trump, in striking three Iranian nuclear facilities last weekend, violated the Constitution by acting on his own, without the formal approval of Congress.\n\nThe dynamic has not been overlooked by Republican leaders, who have hailed the strikes on Iran as a national security necessity and defended Trump’s powers to launch them unilaterally. Those voices are pointing specifically to the actions of Clinton, Obama and Biden to bolster their arguments.\n\n“Since [World War II] we’ve had more than 125 military operations from Korea and Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. They have occurred without a Declaration of War by Congress,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told reporters after the strikes. “Presidents of both parties have exercised that authority frequently.”\n\nJohnson ticked off a few examples under the most recent Democratic administrations. Biden, he noted, ordered strikes against terrorist groups in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. Obama sustained a months-long bombing campaign in Libya. And Clinton had bombed parts of the former Yugoslavia during the Bosnian war of the mid-1990s. \n\n“Every one of those actions were taken unilaterally and without prior authorization from Congress,” Johnson said. \n\nThat background is forcing Democrats to reckon with that past just as many of them are now demanding that Trump cease all military operations in Iran without explicit congressional approval. Some of them are quick to acknowledge the incongruity, voicing something like regret that Congress didn’t stand more firm in the face of those unilateral Democratic missions.\n\n“Just because it was wrong then doesn’t mean it’s not wrong now,” said Rep. Ted Lieu (Calif.), a former Air Force attorney who’s now the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. “The Constitution is the Constitution. And it says only Congress has the power to declare war. And it’s been a bipartisan problem, with Congress ceding way too much power to the executive branch.”\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, seemed to agree. He lamented that the politics of Washington have sometimes curtailed Congress’s appetite for asserting its war powers as a check on the president, especially when Congress and the White House are controlled by opposing parties. \n\n“That part is unfortunate. Maybe we’ve missed a few opportunities,” Aguilar said. \n\n“But that doesn’t mean that we turn a blind eye right now,” he quickly added. “It doesn’t mean that we just let Donald Trump walk all over us. It means that we stand up for our authority and speak up on behalf of our constituents at every opportunity.”\n\nThe Constitution makes clear that Congress and the White House both play crucial roles in conducting military operations. Article I lends Congress the power to declare war, and Article II stipulates that the president is “Commander and Chief” of the Armed Forces, responsible for executing wars that Congress sanctions. \n\nYet that conceptual balance has tilted heavily toward the executive branch over most of the last century: The last time Congress formally declared war was in 1941, after Pearl Harbor. And since then, the president has assumed virtually all power, not only to steer the Armed Forces, but also to launch them into battle.\n\nIn 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress sought to reassert its authority by passing the War Powers Act. (President Nixon vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode him). The law requires presidents to “consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities,” but it does not demand the formal authorization of the legislative branch.\n\nAs tensions in the Middle East exploded earlier in the month, lawmakers in both parties sought to limit U.S. involvement with war powers resolutions requiring Trump to get explicit congressional consent before using military force in Iran. One was sponsored by three leading Democrats: Reps. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.), Jim Himes (Conn.) and Adam Smith (Wash.). Another was bipartisan, championed by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).\n\nSupporters of the resolutions are quick to acknowledge that the president has the power to act unilaterally in extraordinary circumstances, like if the nation is attacked. But there’s no evidence, they say, to indicate that Iran posed an immediate threat to Americans ahead of Trump’s strikes. \n\n“Any president has self-defense authority under Article II of the Constitution. But to meet that threshold, you have to show that there was an imminent risk of attack against Americans or U.S. facilities. That’s the standard,” said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. “As a member of the Armed Services Committee and the House Intelligence Committee, I have not seen any evidence leading up to the attack that there was an imminent risk to Americans or to U.S. facilities to meet that threshold.”\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delivered a similar assessment. \n\n“If our country is attacked, all and any powers go to the president to act,” she said. “That didn’t exist here, so the president should have come to Congress.”\n\nComplicating their argument are the actions of Democratic presidents who also activated the Armed Services without congressional consent. \n\nIn 1998, for instance, in response to the terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Clinton ordered the launch of cruise missiles targeting al Qaeda strongholds in Sudan and Afghanistan. He also joined NATO forces in bombing Serbian targets in the former Yugoslavia. \n\nObama infuriated liberals in Congress in launching strikes against numerous countries during his eight-year reign, including an extensive campaign in Libya in 2011, which helped in the toppling of President Muammar Gaddafi, as well as subsequent incursions in Syria, Yemen and Somalia. \n\nObama had asked Congress for specific authorization in some cases, but lawmakers on Capitol Hill couldn’t agree on a resolution to provide it. Instead, those operations leaned heavily on a 2001 resolution known as an authorization of military force, or AUMF passed by Congress to sanction the Afghanistan War after the attacks of 9/11. \n\nIn the same vein, Biden used U.S. forces to target terrorist cells in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. \n\nLieu, for one, emphasized that he was opposed to Obama’s use of force without Congress giving the OK. \n\n“I publicly stated at the time that Obama needed congressional authorization to strike Syria. I believe Trump needs congressional authorization to strike Iran,” he said. “My view of the Constitution does not change based on what party the president happens to belong to.” \n\nOther Democrats sought to keep the debate focused more squarely on current events.\n\n“We can write books and fill your column inches with regrets under this dome. We’ll save that for other days,” Aguilar said. “But what is in front of us today is: are we going to stand up for our constitutional authority?”\n\nA week after the strikes, the debate over war powers may already be academic. \n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel that, if it holds, may make the constitutional disagreement moot. Massie has said he won’t force a vote on his war powers measure if the ceasefire continues. Johnson has refused to consider such a resolution in any event, calling the War Powers Act unconstitutional. And Trump officials are expected to meet with Iranian officials later this week, when the U.S. will seek a commitment from Tehran to abandon any plans to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nStill, there are plenty of questions swirling about the ultimate success of the strikes in dismantling Iran’s nuclear capabilities. And Trump, asked whether he would attack again if necessary, didn’t hesitate. \n\n“Without question,” he said. “Absolutely.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDemocrats bashing President Trump for striking Iran without congressional consent are bumping&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Democrats Scramble to Justify Their Party&#8217;s Past Amid Criticism Over Iran first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/democrats-scramble-to-justify-their-partys-past-amid-criticism-over-iran/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Democrats-howling-over-Iran-forced-to-defend.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:48:44","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.387},{"id":336533152,"title":"Harry Styles 'passionately snogs mystery woman at Glastonbury Festival as sparks fly in the VIP section'","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Jun 30th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevealed: Meghan's £6.50-a-jar 'crafted' raspberry jam is made on an industrial estate 2,000 miles from Montecito\n\nAt least 2 shot dead as snipers ambush firefighters and police in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after 'blaze set as bait'\n\nSchoolboy, 12, dies in West Yorkshire after trying social media challenge as family warn of dangers\n\nThe gangster guide to Dubai: The criminals from Manchester, Liverpool and beyond who call it home - and the tricks they use to live it up... without alerting authorities\n\nWhen I started balding in my teens I was so insecure.

Avon and Somerset Police are reviewing videos of the performance. Yet upsetting lots of people was, perhaps, his exact intention. For in the urban music scene, notoriety sells. And in the six years his act Bob Vylan has been in existence, its shtick has revolved almost entirely around making (sometimes puerile) efforts to provoke controversy.\n\nThe duo’s first major festival, Reading, saw lead singer Bobby – his partner, a percussionist, is confusingly named Bobbie Vylan – take to the stage wearing a tattered Union flag, while yelling ‘this country’s in need of a good f***ing spanking’ and ‘Kill the queen! She killed Diana!’\n\nOn their debut at Glastonbury, in 2022, they sang a ditty about the Thatcher government: ‘F*** that, let’s go dig up Maggie’, went one verse. ‘Let’s dig up Maggie’s grave.’\n\nThe targets of Vylan’s invective are, to this end, an entirely predictable checklist of the sort of people and institutions that the modern Left abhors.\n\nThey range from the UK – there’s ‘nothing great about Great Britain’, he says – to the Royal Family, who he calls ‘the thieves in the palace’, to anyone who happens to own a buy-to-let property, about whom he sings ‘Landlord just raised your rent – mate, get yourself a gun.’\n\nIn Bobby Vylan’s world, takeaway restaurant owners are not enterprising businessmen who offer employment and create wealth, but exploitative charlatans who deliberately harm their customers. ‘The killing of kids with £2 chicken and chips/ Is a tactic of war, waged on the poor,’ goes another song.\n\nDespite this claim, the band is, with somewhat flagrant hypocrisy, the holder of a financial interest in the food industry: it sells an own-brand variety of vegan hot sauce called ‘Burn Britannia’. Of little surprise, given his attitude to Israel, is the fact the group regards Sir Winston Churchill, who did as much as anyone to prevent the Jewish people being wiped out by the Nazi regime, as an evil colonialist who people wrongly ‘feel they have to revere’.\n\nEqually inevitable is the fact Vylan has been championed from the start of his career by the BBC, who decided to broadcast Saturday’s display of casual and vile anti-Semitism into the nation’s homes. He appears to have first crossed our national broadcaster’s radar after being asked to perform at the Black and Asian Police Association conference in Manchester in 2005, at the age of just 14. And, in 2007, BBC Suffolk described him as an ‘established performance poet’.\n\nBack then, Vylan, who is now 34, had yet to create his current stage moniker. Instead, he performed under his real name: Pascal Robinson-Foster.\n\n‘Pascal believes that poetry can have a powerful message,’ read the BBC introduction to an interview with him. ‘He tells us about his influences and why he loves slam poetry.’\n\nThe grandson of a Windrush immigrant, who was raised in Ipswich, Robinson-Foster’s background was not without connections. Indeed, his family has links to hip-hop royalty. A godfather is Ricky Martin Lloyd Walters, the multi-millionaire Anglo-American rapper and record producer better known as Slick Rick, who is famed for his ostentatious diamond-encrusted jewellery.\n\nIn an early interview, Robinson-Foster claimed his passion for music came from ‘growing up in a boring place’, saying ‘people either played football, dabbled in illegal activity or rapped… and I never liked football’.\n\nBy his early 20s, he was performing as a grime artist named Nee-Hi, who was dubbed ‘The Fresh Prince of Ipswich’ by the music Press ‘for his energetic performances and old-school style.’ Nee-Hi released an album in 2012, around the time Robinson-Foster had a daughter, who is now a teenager, but subsequently dropped off the radar. He began performing as Bobby Vylan in 2019.\n\nTeaming up with Bobbie, whose real name is unknown, the duo built a following via their ability to ‘evoke the spirit of classic anti-establishment punk, fusing it with the rebelliousness of grime, a genre that has evolved into a voice of some of London’s most repressed communities,’ according to an interview with the Irish Times in 2019.\n\nDiscussing their desire to spark political controversy, Bobby told the newspaper: ‘You have Stormzy, for example, performing at Glastonbury at the main stage in a stab-proof vest with the Union Jack on it. That’s a political statement. But now you look at punk music and it’s not what it once was.’\n\nDespite quickly building a following on the live music circuit, Bob Vylan’s music was initially rejected by record labels, who found them ‘too extreme’ to sign. And Bobby’s bitterness at the music industry continues to this day. At Glastonbury on Saturday, he took a pop at a Jewish music company executive who appears to have signed a petition against Kneecap, the controversial Irish group scheduled to perform after the duo.\n\n‘Recently a list was released of people trying to stop our mates Kneecap from performing here today. And who do I see on that f****** list, but that bald-headed c*** I used to f****** work for. So look, we have done it all, from working in bars to working for f****** Zionists.’\n\nIn the past, reviews have waxed lyrical about their ‘notoriously lively’ stage shows ‘with pictures online even showing Bobby Vylan crowd surfing with his genitals exposed’. Others have praised his combative way with hecklers. At a recent gig in Manchester, he told a heckler ‘I tell you what – buy a ticket to the show at the Ritz, I’ll f****** meet you outside and punch you there, you d***head.’\n\nNow Vylan has picked a fight with an entire country, not to mention the British Government. But it may come at a cost. In a couple of months, he’s due to perform a series of lucrative gigs in the US. But whether Donald Trump’s immigration service will now allow him across the border is anyone’s guess.","summary":"Bobby Vylan last graced the news pages in 2021, thanks to an incident that saw him halt a gig in Norwich to launch a foul-mouthed tirade at a blameless young woman in the audience.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14859191/Glastonbury-death-IDF-chanter-Bobby-Vylan-hates-Britain.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/30/00/99842127-0-image-m-65_1751239168095.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:25:16","author":"Editor,Guy Adams","authors":["Editor","Guy Adams"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.054},{"id":336522906,"title":"Trump anticipated to tour the ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention center this week","text":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — President Donald Trump is anticipated to attend the official opening of a controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades on Tuesday, which state leaders have nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.”\n\nThe Palm Beach Post revealed on Sunday that Federal Aviation Administration data suggested Trump would be in South Florida for the event. This was confirmed by two White House officials and a Florida official who are familiar with the president’s travel plans, stating that Trump is “likely” to attend.\n\nThe detention center is located on an infrequently used airstrip in Miami-Dade County. Governor Ron DeSantis’ administration acquired the land via emergency powers to establish housing for undocumented immigrants. DeSantis initially issued an emergency order concerning immigration in early 2023 and has renewed it multiple times since. This order grants him substantial authority, including the power to commandeer land. Some local politicians in Miami-Dade County have opposed DeSantis’ decision to use the land for the Everglades-based detention site.\n\nThe facility, which was set up quickly — in roughly one week — by the DeSantis administration, was the brainchild of state Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is DeSantis’ former chief of staff and one of his top political advisers.\n\nEnvironmental groups sued to block the plan Friday, arguing it could have devastating effects on the Everglades.\n\n“The site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other iconic species,” Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Florida Everglades, which is among the groups suing, said in a statement. “This scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.”\n\nHundreds of people also turned out Saturday for a protest against construction of the facility, which is expected to have 5,000 immigrant detention beds. \n\n“Alligator Alcatraz” has been hyped as the highest-profile example of Florida’s push to be the state that most aggressively tries to align with Trump’s immigration agenda. \n\nThe facility is estimated to cost $450 million annually, and it has been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, which has said it is likely to reimburse the state for at least some costs associated with operation.\n\nThe facility has received significant national attention, resulting in a media and political boon for Uthmeier and DeSantis, who on Friday gave a tour of the facility to Fox News. \n\nBeyond the significant national media attention, political fundraising is up for both Uthmeier and the Republican Party of Florida, which has started selling branded merchandise off the idea, NBC News reported Saturday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. — President Donald Trump is anticipated to attend the official&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump anticipated to tour the &#8216;Alligator Alcatraz&#8217; detention center this week first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trump-anticipated-to-tour-the-alligator-alcatraz-detention-center-this-week/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-expected-to-visit-the-039Alligator-Alcatraz039-detention-facility-this.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:24:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":336522918,"title":"Trump Takes Aim at Senator Thom Tillis and Delivers Stern Message to GOP","text":"Donald Trump celebrated the news that North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis will not seek re-election when his term is up in 2026 and fired a warning shot to his fellow Republican rebels.\n\nTillis drew the ire of Trump Sunday over his opposition to the president’s ‘big, beautiful’ budget bill currently making its way through the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe president wrote on Truth Social Sunday afternoon: ‘Great News! ‘Senator’ Thom Tillis will not be seeking reelection.’ \n\nHe then warned any other members of the GOP who were not on board with the bill due to how much they believe it would add to the debt that they would have to face the voters after it became a success.\n\n‘For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected. Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,’ he said. \n\nTillis was one of two Republican senators who voted against the ‘motion to proceed’ on Trump’s budget bill Saturday evening, along with Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. Paul was still trumpeting his refusal to vote for the bill on Sunday. \n\nThe North Carolina Republican made his announcement earlier Sunday, via a statement shared by his political team.\n\n‘As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven’t exactly been excited about running for another term,’ Tillis wrote.\n\n‘That is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home. \n\n‘It’s not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,’ he added. \n\nIn a post made to his social media site Truth Social Sunday morning, President Trump came after Tillis, claiming that he ‘hurt the great people of North Carolina’ and calling him a ‘talker and complainer.’\n\n‘Thom Tillis has hurt the great people of North Carolina. Even on the catastrophic flooding, nothing was done to help until I took office. Then a Miracle took place! Tillis is a talker and complainer, Not A Doer! He’s even worse than Rand ‘Fauci’ Paul,’ Trump wrote on Sunday morning.\n\nTillis, who was set to face a reelection fight in a critical swing state next year in the 2026 midterms, raised significant concerns this week over the budget bill’s deep cuts to Medicaid.\n\nTillis shared projections that his state could lose $38.9 billion, impacting more than 600,000 North Carolinians.\n\nCutting Medicaid was seen by a number of Republicans as a way to pay for the president’s policy agenda, which includes increases in areas such as border security, which the White House asked to be at $150 billion.\n\nNotably, Republican leaders in Tillis’ own state said they were willing to work with the hand they were dealt by Washington. \n\nNorth Carolina’s State Senate Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger wrote on X, formerly Twitter Saturday that he supports ‘@realDonaldTrump’s Big Beautiful Bill and the legislature will work through any implementation issues.’ \n\nTills’ decision creates a political opportunity for Democrats seeking to bolster their numbers in the 2026 midterm elections, creating a wide-open Senate race in a state that has long been a contested battleground.\n\nNorth Carolina is state that Trump has narrowly won in all three of his elections, yet still sees Democrat leadership at the state level, making it a swing state.\n\nIt is also home to a number of nationally prominent Republicans who could be frontrunners to replace Tillis, such as National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Chairman Richard Hudson and Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Michael Whatley. \n\nTrump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump – wife of his son Eric – is also from the state, and could potentially make a bid for the seat. After serving as the RNC Co-Chair in 2024, Lara Trump is now the host of My View with Lara Trump on Fox News. \n\nThe North Carolina Republican Party chairman, Jason Simmons, said the party wishes Tillis well and ‘will hold this seat for Republicans in 2026.’ \n\nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the chairman of the campaign arm for Senate Republicans, did not mention Tillis in a statement but said the party’s winning streak in North Carolina will continue. Scott noted that Trump won the state three times.\n\nTillis rose to prominence in North Carolina when, as a second-term state House member, he quit his IBM consultant job and led the GOP’s recruitment and fundraising efforts in the chamber for the 2010 elections. \n\nRepublicans won majorities in the House and Senate for the first time in 140 years.\n\nTillis was later elected as state House speaker and helped enact conservative policies on taxes, gun rights, regulations and abortion while serving in the role for four years. \n\nHe also helped push a state constitutional referendum to ban gay marriage, which was approved by voters in 2012 but was ultimately struck down by the courts as unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2014, Tillis helped flip control of the U.S. Senate to the GOP after narrowly defeating Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. \n\nDuring his more than a decade in office, he championed issues such as mental health and substance abuse recovery, Medicaid expansion and support for veterans.\n\nAs a more moderate Republican, Tillis became known for his willingness to work across the aisle on some issues. \n\nThat got him into trouble with his party at times, most notably in 2023 when North Carolina Republicans voted to censure him over several matters, including his challenges to certain immigration policies and his gun policy record.\n\n‘Sometimes those bipartisan initiatives got me into trouble with my own party,’ Tillis said, ‘but I wouldn’t have changed a single one.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump celebrated the news that North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis will&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Takes Aim at Senator Thom Tillis and Delivers Stern Message to GOP first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-takes-aim-at-senator-thom-tillis-and-delivers-stern-message-to-gop/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-mocks-Senator-Thom-Tillis-and-fires-brutal-warning-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:20:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.014},{"id":336529660,"title":"Trump announces that there is a TikTok buyer and he's going to announce who it is in two weeks.

Engineering Battalion, the Times of Israel reports.\n\nThe IDF soldier moved from London to Israel with his family 11 years ago, according to the paper, which adds that he has three siblings.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it is 'looking into reports that an IDF soldier who died in combat in Gaza is a British national'. \n\nIsrael continues to operate in Gaza, almost two years on from Hamas's attacks on October 7, 2023. \n\nThe initial attacks saw thousands of Hamas fighters storm into southern Israel where they killed a reported 1,320 Israelis and took a further 251 hostage. \n\nSome 50 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza but 28 of them are believed to be dead.\n\nIsrael's subsequent strikes on the Gaza Strip have reportedly killed more than 56,000 people and left thousands displaced, wounded and struggling for water, food and healthcare.\n\nIt comes after the Hamas chief allegedly behind the October 7 attacks was killed by an Israeli airstrike, according to the IDF.\n\nIn a post on X on Saturday, the IDF reported it 'eliminated' Hakham Muhammad Issa Al-Issa in a targeted airstrike on the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza on Friday.\n\nDescribing him as both 'one of the founders of Hamas' military wing' and Hamas itself, it said: 'Issa led Hamas' force build-up, training, and planned the October 7 massacre.'\n\nIt continued: 'As Head of Combat Support, he advanced aerial & naval attacks against Israelis.' \n\nThe force has killed several other high-ranking Hamas officials since October 7. \n\nThe Israeli military said earlier this month it killed the leader of a Palestinian militant group that took part in the October 7 attacks.\n\nAsaad Abu Sharia, who led the Palestinian Mujahideen Movement and its armed wing the Mujahideen Brigades, was killed in a joint operation with Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency.\n\nHis death and that of his brother Ahmed Abu Sharia were announced after it was reported by Gaza's civil defence agency an Israeli airstrike had hit their home in Gaza City's Sabra area.\n\nIsrael also said at the end of May its forces had killed Hamas' Gaza chief Mohammad Sinwar.\n\nHe became the leader of the militant group in the Gaza Strip after his older brother Yahya Sinwar was killed last October.\n\nThe Israeli military said at the time he was the target of a strike on a southern Gaza hospital on May 13.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then told parliament he had been 'eliminated'.\n\nIn the last 20 months, repeated US-led attempts at a ceasefire have fallen through but on Friday it emerged that US President Donald Trump and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed on a rapid end to the war in Gaza.\n\nThey discussed a solution during a phone call after the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, Israeli media has reported quoting a source 'familiar with the conversation'. \n\nThe two leaders agreed that four Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, would jointly govern the strip in place of Hamas, Israel Hayom is reporting.\n\nLeaders of the Hamas terror group would be exiled and all hostages released, a source is said to have told the outlet.\n\nBut it remains unclear how such a proposal would be implemented, with Hamas vowing it will not leave the territory and Arab states repeatedly asserting that they would not step into a governing role.\n\nTrump and Netanyahu held the call on Monday a day after US bombers hit nuclear targets in Iran, with a source reportedly describing the call as 'euphoric'.\n\nThey were joined on the call by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, according to the report.\n\nUnder the agreement, Palestinians who wished to leave Gaza would be taken in by unnamed states, the men reportedly said, and Saudi Arabia and Syria would establish diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\nIsrael in turn would express support for a future two-state solution on the condition that the Palestinian Authority bring in reforms, according to the report.\n\nThe United States would recognise Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank as part of the agreement, it also said.\n\nIsrael Hayom reports that the 'ambitious' nature of the plan explains Trump's fury over Israel's planned retaliation against Iran for its 'minor' breach of the US-brokered ceasefire on Tuesday.\n\nTrump called the Israeli Prime Minister and warned him to 'stop the planes', reportedly telling him he did not understand why Netanyahu was 'disrupting' their agreed upon 'plan for peace' because of a 'small tactical incident'.\n\nThe outlet also claims that Trump's post calling for an end to Netanyahu's trial was also linked to the plan.","summary":"Sergeant Yisrael Natan Rosenfeld,

yearbook photo that destroyed her tough girl from the Bronx image","text":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defended her supposed 'Bronx girl' upbringing after a Republican lawmaker exposed her yearbook photo from a top-ranked, suburban public school. \n\nOn Tuesday, State Assemblyman Matt Slater jumped into the online clash between AOC and President Donald Trump, after the liberal progressive called for Trump's impeachment over his approval of airstrikes on Iran without congressional authorization.\n\nAfter the discourse led users to show off her alleged old home in Yorktown Heights - supposedly now valued at over a half a million dollars - Ocasio-Cortez responded to allegations she grew up 'privileged.'\n\n'I’m proud of how I grew up and talk about it all the time! My mom cleaned houses and I helped. We cleaned tutors’ homes in exchange for SAT prep,' she wrote to social media.\n\n'Growing up between the Bronx and Yorktown deeply shaped my views of inequality & it’s a big reason I believe the things I do today!'\n\nSlater told The New York Post the left-wing congresswoman was just continuing to double down on her inconsistent story.\n\n'She’s embarrassing herself for doing everything possible to avoid saying she grew up in the suburbs instead of the Bronx.'\n\n'She has said she visited extended family, she has said she commuted,” Slater said. “Now she’s in between. It’s clearly desperate attempts to protect the lie that she is from the Bronx.' \n\nOcasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, though she moved to Yorktown at the age of five, eventually graduating from Yorktown High School before attending Boston University. \n\nThe original clash earlier this week ignited a fiery exchange between AOC and Trump, during which the congresswoman appeared to invoke her Bronx roots as a source of her toughness.\n\n'Also, I'm a Bronx girl. You should know that we can eat Queens boys for breakfast. Respectfully,' AOC wrote to X in regards to the president's Queens upbringing. \n\nBut Slater escalated the debate by unveiling a yearbook photo of her as a high school freshman in the affluent suburb of Yorktown, Westchester County - a 40-minute drive from the Bronx.\n\n'If you're a BX girl then why are you in my Yorktown yearbook?' Slater wrote on X. 'Give it up already.'\n\nAlongside his tweet, the Republican lawmaker posted two images: a black-and-white throwback of a young, smiling AOC, and the 2004 yearbook cover from Yorktown High School.\n\nIn a statement to The New York Post, he dismissed the 'AOC-Bronx mythology' as 'laughable,' adding that the claim is just as laughable to the 36,000 residents of the Westchester community. \n\n'The truth is AOC is Sandy Cortez who went to Yorktown High School and lived at the corner of Friends Road and Longvue Street,' Slater told the outlet.\n\n'She may think it makes her look tough or like some kind of champion for the radical left who voted for Zohran Mamdani, but she really needs to come clean and drop the act,' he added. \n\nThe takedown came shortly after AOC - who represents parts of both the Bronx and Queens - called for Trump's impeachment following his order to deploy a dozen 30,000-pound 'bunker buster' bombs that reportedly 'obliterated' Iran's three largest nuclear facilities. \n\n'The president's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers,' she said on Saturday.\n\n'He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.'\n\nTrump swiftly fired back, challenging her to 'go ahead and try impeaching me, again.'\n\n'Stupid AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the 'dumbest' people in Congress, is now calling for my Impeachment, despite the fact that the Crooked and Corrupt Democrats have already done that twice before,' he wrote in retaliation.\n\nTrump then noted that the liberal firebrand 'can't stand the concept of our country being successful again,' because members of her party 'aren't used to winning.' \n\nAfter that came the personal attacks on the congresswoman's intelligence, as Trump added 'when we examine her test scores, we will find out that she is not qualified for office.'\n\nLess than an hour later, AOC replied to Trump's jab, writing: 'Mr. President, don't take your anger out on me - I'm just a silly girl.' \n\n'Take it out on whoever convinced you to betray the American people and our Constitution by illegally bombing Iran and dragging us into war,' she added.\n\n'It only took you five months to break almost every promise you made.' \n\nBut Slater - representing parts of both Putnam and Westchester counties - quickly jumped in, posting the two photos with the caption beneath one: 'Here's the Yorktown High School '04 yearbook pic. Friends Road looks nothing like the Bronx.'\n\nThe 35-year-old Democratic socialist congresswoman has faced scrutiny over her suburban upbringing since her unexpected triumph in 2018 catapulted her onto the national stage.\n\nDuring her campaign, AOC highlighted her deep personal ties to the borough by sharing stories of her childhood and neighborhood life, aiming to authentically connect with Bronx voters and present herself as 'one of their own.'\n\nEven during a segment with late-night host Stephen Colbert during Trump's first term, she reaffirmed her Bronx identity, telling him, 'I don't think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx.' \n\nHowever, at just five years old, AOC moved with her family to a modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street in Yorktown Heights - a suburban relocation driven by the search for better schools, according to a 2018 article by The New York Times.\n\nIn 2007, the congresswoman graduated from Yorktown High School before attending Boston University, where she studied economics and international relations—and briefly engaged with establishment politics - before returning to the Bronx.\n\nOnce back in the borough, she began advocating for improved childhood education and literacy - and even launched a children's book publishing company aimed at portraying the Bronx in a more positive light.\n\nDespite criticism of her suburban roots, AOC has continued to lean into and defend her Bronx narrative, arguing that her time in Yorktown highlighted the stark disparities people face based on where they're born.\n\n'It is nice. Growing up, it was a good town for working people,' she said in reference to Yorktown in a 2018 tweet. \n\n'My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here & I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity.' \n\nAOC’s biography notes that she was born in the Parkchester neighborhood of the Bronx before her family moved north to Yorktown.\n\n'Alexandria’s mother was born and raised in Puerto Rico and worked throughout her childhood as a domestic worker,' her biography reads. 'Alexandria’s father was a second-generation Bronxite, who ran a small business in The Bronx.'\n\nThroughout her childhood, Representative Ocasio-Cortez traveled regularly to The Bronx to spend time with her extended family,' it adds.\n\n'From an early age, the stark contrast in educational opportunities available to her and her cousins, based on their respective zip codes, made an impression on her.","summary":"After the discourse led someone to show off her alleged old home in Yorktown Heights, Ocasio-Cortez responded to allegations she grew up 'privileged.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14858939/AOC-breaks-silence-yearbook-photo-destroyed-Bronx-image.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/29/23/99807423-0-image-a-8_1751237459246.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/09/01/2651807889310137624/1024x576_MP4_2651807889310137624.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:11:56","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Hostilities continued for 12 days, during which the US dropped bombs on three of Iran's nuclear sites: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan.\n\nThe extent of the damage caused to Iran's nuclear programme by US strikes has been unclear, and Takht-Ravanchi said he could not give an exact assessment.\n\nRafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the strikes caused severe but \"not total\" damage, while US President Donald Trump declared that Iran's nuclear facilities were \"totally obliterated\".\n\nGrossi also said Iran had the capacity to start enriching uranium again in \"a matter of months\". In response, Takht-Ravanchi said he did not know if that would be the case.\n\nIran's relationship with the IAEA has become increasingly strained. On Wednesday, its parliament moved to suspend cooperation with the atomic watchdog, accusing the IAEA of siding with Israel and the US.\n\nTrump has said he would \"absolutely\" consider bombing Iran again if intelligence found that it could enrich uranium to concerning levels.\n\nTakht-Ravanchi said no date had been agreed upon for a possible return to talks and he did not know what would be on the agenda, after Trump suggested discussions could take place this week.\n\nIran's deputy foreign minister said \"right now we are seeking an answer to this question: are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?\"\n\nHe said the US had to be \"quite clear on this very important question\" and \"what they are going to offer us in order to make the necessary confidence required for such a dialogue\".\n\nAsked if Iran could consider rethinking its nuclear programme as part of any deal, possibly in return for sanctions relief and investment in the country, Takht-Ravanchi said: \"Why should we agree to such a proposal?\"\n\nHe reiterated that Iran's programme, including enriching uranium to 60%, was \"for peaceful purposes\".\n\nUnder a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was not permitted to enrich uranium above 3.67% purity - the level required for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants - and was not allowed to carry out any enrichment at its Fordo plant for 15 years.\n\nHowever, Trump abandoned the agreement in 2018 during his first term as president, saying it did too little to stop a pathway to a bomb, and reinstated US sanctions.\n\nIran retaliated by increasingly breaching the restrictions - particularly those relating to enrichment. It resumed enrichment at Fordo in 2021 and had amassed enough 60%-enriched uranium to potentially make nine nuclear bombs, according to the IAEA.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20r18x8x05o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e0de/live/3c326b50-552a-11f0-8485-7bd50fa63665.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:02:50","author":"Lyse Doucet","authors":["Lyse Doucet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":336522784,"title":"These are the most sought-after workers in the UK right now","text":"Healthcare support workers are currently the most sought-after professionals in the UK job market, new research reveals, signalling key areas of demand within the economy.\n\nData from jobs site Adzuna indicates that social care workers, sales assistants, and warehouse staff are also experiencing high demand from employers. \n\nOther roles attracting significant interest include software developers, cleaners, healthcare assistants, labourers, and project managers.\n\nAndrew Hunter, co-founder of Adzuna, said: \"May reinforced the sense that the job market in the UK is gradually regaining its footing.\" \n\nHe highlighted a positive shift, noting: \"While overall vacancies dipped slightly, we’ve now seen three straight months of annual vacancy growth – a clear shift after more than a year of decline.\" \n\nMr Hunter also pointed to rising remuneration.\n\n“Advertised salaries continue to climb, too, with average pay up nearly 9 per cent compared to last year, comfortably outpacing inflation,” he said.\n\nDespite the overall positive outlook, Mr Hunter expressed a watchful concern for specific sectors. \n\n\"While certain sectors remain in strong demand and provide a backbone of stability, we will be keeping a close eye on the decline in roles for the previously steady healthcare and nursing sector, and how that may play out over the coming months.\"\n\nThe research also found that the average time to fill a job stands at approximately 35 days, with a ratio of two jobseekers for every available vacancy.\n\nActivity across the UK’s private sector has grown in June as some easing of US tariff policy helped lift business sentiment, data from a separate survey shows.\n\nThe volume of new business returned to growth in June, ending a six-month period of contraction, the survey found.\n\nThis was primarily driven by the service sector – the largest part of the UK’s economy, spanning industries including hospitality, entertainment and culture, finance and real estate.\n\nA further slight expansion of activity in the sector was contrasted by another drop in production for manufacturers, led by a decline in overseas export orders.\n\nConcerns over the impact of Donald Trump’s tariffs on US imports were partly behind the slump, despite some businesses saying confidence had improved as a result of the president striking new trade deals with countries including the UK.","summary":"The job market is ‘gradually regaining its footing’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/most-in-demand-jobs-uk-employment-b2779061.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/13/6/17/employment-workers-walking-stock.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sxez09jL-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-29 23:01:00","author":"Alan Jones","authors":["Alan Jones"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":336525774,"title":"A key civil right is losing support.

Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The court was catching up to the American public’s changing attitudes on the issue. But now those attitudes are changing again, at least among Republicans.\n\nIn 1996, just 27% of Americans thought same-sex marriages were valid and worthy of the same legal rights as heterosexual marriages, according to Gallup. By May 2015, the month before the Obergefell ruling, that share had slowly and pretty steadily risen to 60%. Now it’s 68%.\n\nEven Republicans came around on the issue. In 1996, just 16% supported same-sex marriage, but in 2021 and 2022, their support hit a high of 55%. Since then, however, it has tumbled. This year, just 41% of Republicans support same-sex marriage.\n\nBecause 88% of Democrats support same-sex marriage, there is now a stunning 47-percentage-point gap between the parties—the largest since Gallup has tracked the question. Oddly, though, this homophobic backsliding seems contained to Republicans. Independents support same-sex marriage at nearly the same level as Democrats do—76%—and it’s grown since 2022, when support was at 72%.\n\nThis Republican backlash is likely the result of the GOP’s viciously negative attacks on LGBTQ+ people and rights more broadly. Around 2022, when the Republican electorate was most supportive of same-sex marriage, their party’s leaders coalesced around smearing queer people and their Democratic allies as “groomers,” reviving a homophobic lie about queer adults sexually abusing children.\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Republicans underperformed in the midterm elections. But rather than learn from their bigoted mistakes, the party has leaned into them, further demonizing one of the LGBTQ+ community’s most marginalized groups: transgender people, and trans youth in particular. Last year, then-candidate Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans viciously attacked trans people, trying to scare voters into backing the GOP.\n\nAnd it might’ve worked. The electoral success of the anti-trans message is disputable. In the days before the 2024 election, 80% of likely voters wanted both Democratic and Republican candidates to focus less on transgender issues and more on the economy, according to a poll from Data for Progress.\n\nNevertheless, it seems clear that the Republican Party’s anti-LGBTQ+ messaging is igniting a backlash, though it remains to be seen how far this wildfire of hate will spread. After all, the Supreme Court is now much more conservative than it was in 2015, and its right-wing majority has evinced little respect for precedent or civil rights.\n\nA big miss in the Big Apple\n\nThis past Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani, a state lawmaker and self-described democratic socialist, pulled off what appears to be a shock victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary against disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. And perhaps none were more shocked than pollsters, which, with one exception, predicted a large Cuomo win.\n\nIn polls conducted since the start of April, Cuomo led Mamdani by an average of 14 points in the first round of the city’s ranked-choice voting process. And yet Mamdani ended up winning the first round by 7 points, with 93% of votes counted as of Friday. \n\nLocal elections are notoriously hard to poll. Even so, a 21-point miss is a terrible showing.\n\nMany pollsters say the error mainly stemmed from surveys including only those who’d voted in previous primaries, which caused them to miss first-time voters this year. Just one pollster—the left-leaning Public Policy Polling—showed Mamdani leading the first round of voting. Because PPP accurately recognized that Mamdani was energizing young and first-time voters, they gave extra weight to those groups and included people regardless of whether they’d voted previously.\n\n“Tens of thousands of people voted in their first Mayoral election this year,” the firm said in a statement published Tuesday night, after Mamdani’s presumptive victory. “We found those who didn’t vote in 2021 breaking 63-18 for Mamdani. We included them in our poll.”\n\nThe primary’s final results are expected on July 1, after ranked-choice tabulations occur. If Mamdani has indeed won, he’d face Mayor Eric Adams in the general election this November. Adams, who ditched the Democratic Party and is running as an independent, has an atrocious approval rating largely due to him buddying up to Trump, which he seemingly did so that the federal government would drop his corruption indictment. That apparent quid pro quo may keep Adams out of prison, but it could also kick him out of Gracie Mansion.\n\nIn November, Mamdani would also go up against Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, who founded the volunteer crime-prevention group Guardian Angels and lost the 2021 mayoral race by nearly 40 points. He may also face … Andrew Cuomo, who refuses to rule out running as an independent, because this asshole is just like that.\n\nStill, Mamdani would be the likely front-runner for the mayorship since the Democratic candidate is usually the heavy favorite. He’s also brought together a fresh, cross-cultural, multiracial, class-spanning coalition due to his relentless campaigning over fixing the city’s cost-of-living crisis.\n\nPlus, dude cuts a stellar ad:\n\nIran, Iran so far away (from my recently held political beliefs)\n\nAmerica first, no longer. The Republican base appears to be following Trump wherever he stumbles, even if it’s into the middle of a war between Israel and Iran.\n\nDays before Trump’s decision to attack three nuclear sites in Iran last weekend, a YouGov/Economist poll found that only 16% of Americans supported the U.S. getting involved in the war. That included just 23% of Republicans.\n\nBut in a YouGov/Economist poll fielded June 20 to 23—i.e., right before, during, and after the strikes—29% of Americans supported the U.S. attacking Iran’s nuclear sites, driven largely by a majority of Republicans (57%) who supported the strikes. Just 9% of Democrats and 21% of independents felt the same way. This icy reaction in the broader electorate may have persuaded the Pentagon to confusingly claim that despite directly attacking a hostile foreign nation amid an ongoing war, it didn’t want to be part of that war.\n\nAnd now a newer poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University entirely after the U.S. strikes on Iran, finds that 81% of Republican voters support the U.S. joining Israel’s attacks on Iran. Talk about a flip-flop. Meanwhile, Democrats and independents didn’t change their beliefs that much: 75% and 60%, respectively, oppose the attacks.\n\nThere’s less need for the GOP to manufacture consent these days. Not only do they not really care what the public wants, they also have a base of voters willing to follow them wherever, ideological consistency be damned.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Americans hate Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, but they’re sure to hate them once it comes time for back-to-school shopping. Early shoppers are already getting slapped with higher prices, according to a new poll from Morning Consult. Among the 34% of American parents who have started back-to-school shopping, 62% say clothes are more expensive than last year, while majorities also say the same thing about electronics (61%), home goods (61%), school supplies (57%), and books (54%). While most (59%) hold inflation responsible for the higher prices, more than 1 in 3 blame tariffs directly.\n\n The paywall: You know it, you hate it, you try to find the information elsewhere because now everything is a subscription. New data from Pew Research Center backs that up: 53% of Americans who hit a paywall will search for the news elsewhere, while another 32% will just give up looking. Only 1% of Americans who bump into a paywall will pay for access. Trouble is, news ain’t free, and advertising dollars are withering. So please, if you can, chip in to Daily Kos and keep the site paywall-free. You can even buy your own subscription, ditch the ads, and help Daily Kos fight Trump’s Justice Department as it comes after us.\n\nThe news is a bad place these days, and that’s bad news for Trump when it comes to all his favorite policy topics. The president is underwater on his handling of inflation, trade, the economy, and even immigration, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling averages.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans flip-flop-flip on same-sex marriage\n\nJune 26 marked the 10-year anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v.

A group of deficit-concerned senators, including Scott, helped secure a vote on the amendment, which will occur during an anticipated marathon session of voting, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before senators will vote on final passage of the bill.\n\n“We think it’s really good policy,” Thune told reporters Sunday. “We’re going to do what we can to support that effort.”\n\n“There’s a high level of interest in our conference of making it part of the final bill,” Thune added. “I don’t know how Republicans couldn’t be in favor.”\n\nThe amendment, however, could die on the Senate floor due to moderate GOP senators’ opposition to reducing the federal government’s contributions to state Medicaid programs, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). Scott’s proposal notably exempts the existing expansion population on Medicaid rolls.\n\nTrump notably thanked Scott and the cohort of fiscal hawks for ultimately supporting the opening of debate on the bill Saturday night. The president said he would work with the group to “REDUCE WASTEFUL SPENDING” and “ENSURE OUR MEDICAID SYSTEM HELPS THOSE WHO TRULY NEED IT” among other priorities, in a statement on the social media platform Truth Social.\n\nA majority of the $1.6 trillion in cuts over a decade within the Senate’s budget bill come from reducing federal spending on Medicaid and Medicare with the vast majority of savings coming from the former.\n\n“We are making some commonsense reforms to Medicaid to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse and protect the program for the people who need it the most,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a speech on the Senate floor on June 17 that previewed his conference’s ambitious reforms to the entitlement program.\n\nSenate Republicans are proposing to implement nationwide work requirements for some able-bodied adults on Medicaid and crack down on certain states’ use of provider taxes to collect additional federal Medicaid funding.\n\nThune has touted these reforms as “commonsense” measures to rein in federal Medicaid spending, which is projected to balloon to more than $650 billion in 2025, amounting to a 60% increase between 2019 and 2025. The majority leader has also argued that Medicaid needs to be “strengthened” to serve pregnant women, children, seniors and the disabled rather than continuing to expand coverage to able-bodied adults or illegal immigrants — as some blue states have done.\n\nThe majority leader has also repeatedly made the case for lowering the ceiling on provider taxes in Medicaid expansion states, arguing the tax maneuver allows states to unfairly leverage more federal dollars to pad state budgets. Thune and other Senate Republicans have also argued that provider taxes force the federal government to contribute more dollars for the coverage of able-bodied adults rather than the vulnerable groups Medicaid is intended to serve.\n\nUnder Senate Republicans’ current proposal, provider taxes would be gradually reduced to 3.5% in Medicaid expansion states starting in 2028 — a provision that is expected to result in hundreds of billions in savings. A number of moderate GOP senators, including Thom Tillis of North Carolina have voiced deep objections to this proposal, citing billions of dollars in Medicaid funding their states could lose.\n\nOther Medicaid reforms that would yield savings could also be incorporated in the upper chamber’s final budget bill, but remain in flux as Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, an unelected official with outsize influence over the budget reconciliation process, continues to review provisions to ensure compliance with budget rules.\n\nThough MacDonough has signed off on the vast majority of provisions that Democrats have challenged as violating budget rules, several Medicaid-related provisions have been flagged as noncompliant and must be revised to be included in the final package.\n\nThese provisions include reducing federal Medicaid contributions to states that offer healthcare to illegal immigrants through state funds and prohibiting illegal immigrants’ access to Medicaid dollars. MacDonough has yet to rule if Republicans can move forward with banning abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funds.\n\nThough Trump has criticized the MacDonough’s influence over the final shape of his bill, he has not explicitly called for her ouster unlike several House and Senate Republicans.\n\nSenate GOP leadership has also gone on offense against Democrats’ messaging accusing the president’s landmark bill of “gutting Medicaid” with the imposition of work requirements among other reforms. That proposal would require able-bodied adults including those with children 14 years-old and older to be working, seek work, volunteer or be in school for at least 20 hours a week.\n\n“An American Enterprise Institute study recently found able-bodied adults on Medicaid who don’t work spend 4.2 hours every day watching TV and playing video games,” Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, the number-two ranking Republican, wrote in an op-ed for the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That is 125 hours per month. They ought to be working – or at least looking for a job.”\n\n“Senate Republicans are proposing a responsible path to self-reliance for able-bodied, working-aged people,” Barrasso added. “No more taxpayer-funded coddling.”\n\nThe upper chamber’s budget bill also slashes spending on green energy subsidies by accelerating the termination of solar and wind tax credits, which could save hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe Senate’s proposal will have to clear the House before Trump signs the budget bill into law. A number of moderate Republicans in the lower chamber are voicing concern about aggressive spending cuts while members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are pushing for more deficit reduction.\n\n“For all cost cutting Republicans, of which I am one, REMEMBER, you still have to get reelected,” Trump wrote on the social media platform Truth Social Sunday evening. “Don’t go too crazy!”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Don’t go too crazy! We will make it all up, times 10, with GROWTH, more than ever before,” he wrote. This statement underscores the deep divisions within the GOP as it wrestles with the ambitious legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\nThe bill, exceeding 900 pages, combines roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts with targeted spending reductions and increased funding for defense and border security. It seeks to make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and certain auto loans. The child tax credit would rise to $2,200 under the Senate version, while deductions for seniors would increase temporarily. However, to offset these tax cuts, Republicans propose significant cuts to Medicaid and nutrition programs, sparking fierce debate within the party.\n\nModerate Republicans from high-tax states are pushing for a higher cap on state and local tax deductions (SALT), while conservatives demand deeper spending cuts, particularly targeting Medicaid. These internal disagreements complicate efforts to secure the narrow Republican majorities needed in both chambers to pass the bill, which Democrats uniformly oppose as favoring the wealthy and worsening inequality.\n\nTrump’s social media message reflects an attempt to balance these competing pressures — urging fiscal restraint to satisfy conservatives while emphasizing that robust economic growth will compensate for revenue losses and help reduce deficits over time. This supply-side economic approach projects that growth will “make it all up” despite near-term increases in the national debt, which nonpartisan analysts estimate could add trillions to the existing $36.2 trillion debt.\n\nCrypto analyst Will Clemente’s reaction on X (formerly Twitter) shortly after Trump’s post captures a common market sentiment: “How can you read this and hold long term US treasuries at current yields lol... Also, how can you read this and not hold any Bitcoin or gold.” Clemente’s skepticism toward long-term U.S. Treasuries reflects concerns that the bill’s deficit-financed tax cuts and modest spending cuts signal a loose fiscal policy that could fuel inflation and currency debasement.\n\nIn this context, traditional fixed-income assets like Treasuries may appear less attractive, as rising deficits and potential monetary accommodation threaten bond values. Conversely, hard assets such as gold and Bitcoin are increasingly viewed as stores of value and hedges against inflation and fiscal risk. The expectation of sustained deficits and political challenges to fiscal discipline bolster demand for these inflation-resistant assets.\n\nWith the Senate racing to finalize the bill before the July 4 holiday, Trump’s call for unity and moderation highlights the high stakes and political challenges in passing one of the most consequential fiscal packages in recent U.S. history. The bill’s fate remains uncertain as lawmakers negotiate to balance tax relief, spending cuts, and political feasibility.\n\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\n\nFrom June 28 15:00 to June 29 14:00 UTC, BTC traded from $107,194 to $108,489, a 1.21% intraday range.Support was established at $107,300, with multiple rebounds during the 02:00–03:00 window.Volume peaked at 7,538 BTC between 08:00 and 11:00 UTC on June 29, confirming upward momentum.During the final session hour (13:05–14:04 UTC), BTC fell from $108,219 to $108,059, forming a descending channel.A 130 BTC volume spike at 13:35 coincided with a sharp dip to $108,030, which was tested and held.Final intraday rally pushed price back toward $108K before fading slightly by 22:22 UTC to $107,937.\n\nDisclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.
