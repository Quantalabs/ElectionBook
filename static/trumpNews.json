Elumelu stated this in an interview published by the Financial Times on Friday. The businessman, who said he dreaded oil theft, said the menace contributed to the divestment of international oil companies in Nigeria. He said he discovered first-hand why international oil companies were partly divesting from onshore assets after criminal gangs began stealing crude from his pipelines. In 2022, when things got to a point where his company had to shut down production, Elumelu took to social media, tweeting, “How can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Instead, it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator Shell to declare force majeure. “It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple! “Meanwhile, oil-producing countries are smiling as their foreign reserves are rising. What is Nigeria’s problem? We need to hold our leaders more accountable!” Speaking with Financial Times, Elumelu expressed optimism, saying, however, that oil thieves still take away 18 per cent of crude from his field. “42,000 barrels of crude are pumped out daily. Theft still takes away about 18 per cent of production,” he stated. Asked who was behind the theft, he replied, “This is oil theft; we’re not talking about stealing a bottle of Coke you can put in your pocket. The government should know; they should tell us. “Look at America — Donald Trump was shot at and quickly they knew the background of who shot him. Our security agencies should tell us who is stealing our oil. You bring vessels to our territorial waters and we don’t know?” The 61-year-old founder of Heirs Holdings recalled how the previous administration of President Muhammadu Buhari allegedly stopped him from acquiring an oilfield. He disclosed that Heirs Holdings had been looking to purchase the oilfield since 2017, having raised $2.5 billion to purchase a different one. But in a twist, he claimed that former President Buhari and his late Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, blocked the deal. Speaking on the mass relocation of Nigerians abroad, Elumelu declared, “I support it totally. I don’t have a problem with people saying ‘I’m going to Canada, the UK or the US.’ “Joblessness is the betrayal of a generation. You’ve gone to school and come back with your dreams and aspirations and you don’t have the opportunity. “People who decide to find solutions elsewhere, no one should stop them. But for those who decide to stay, they should try to create an impact and build a legacy.”","summary":"Nigerian businessman, Tony Elumelu, has said the government and security agents in Nigeria should be able to tell Nigerians who steal the country’s crude oil, especially using vessels that move through the territorial waters.

On Tuesday, J.D. Vance managed the first with aplomb, crisscrossing two battleground states ahead of Harris (aides call it ‘bracketing’), generating headlines and made-for-social media memes as he tried to confront the vice president at a tiny regional airport in Wisconsin. But the latter may be harder as DailyMail.com discovered aboard Vance’s campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two. Lunch was sandwiches and fries from Chick-Fil-A. In a wide-ranging interview, with wife Usha sitting beside him, Vance discussed everything from his role in the campaign, the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, adjusting to having a Secret Service detail and how much weight he lost after becoming a senator. A croissant sat untouched on the conference table, part of a breakfast-skipping regimen of frequent exercise and healthier eating. ‘I haven’t taken any drugs. Obviously, you eat a little bit less, but it’s also just eating better,’ he said. ‘I tend to skip breakfast, whereas before I would have, like, you know, three waffles and scrambled eggs and bacon.’ The catalyst was completing his successful Senate campaign two years ago and realizing that he was out of breath just horsing around with his three children. He started running and making sure he could fit the gym into his routine. The result was dropping 30lb, he said. The new svelte figure was noticed by Donald Trump. He told aides he was impressed by the way Vance’s suits were fitting better. ‘Time will tell man,’ said Vance. ‘In three months, maybe I’ll be a lot fatter.’ The first stop of the day is Shelby Township, in Michigan, giving Vance the chance to demonstrate his role. This is not a rally but a question-and-answer session with regional journalists. And Trump’s attack dog is like a canine with a bone. A question from a local Michigan reporter about terrorists from the Middle East, simply ‘highlights the weakness of the Kamala Harris administration,’ according to Vance. A question about why Donald Trump picked him as running mate brings a pivot to attack Harris for selecting Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as hers, ‘bending the knee to the far left of the Democrat Party.’ And a question about whether Trump made a racist attack on Harris last week quickly becomes an attack on the vice president for ‘faking who she is depending on her audience.’ Some Trump insiders were unsure about the choice of Vance. Could the MAGA darling complement the former president’s hold on the base? His campaign team has come up with plan, devising events that contrast with Trump, generating headlines without hogging the limelight (the worst possible crime in Trump world). On Friday, Trump will address a very different audience in Montana: Thousands of supporters at one of his typically barnstorming rallies. So while the top of the ticket is riling up fans in arenas, Vance is leaning into his obsession with detail, honed at an Ivy League law school, to dissect the polices of Kamala Harris. ‘I think that one, I grew up in a town that was affected by very stupid policies,’ he told DailyMail.com, referring to his difficult upbringing in southern Ohio and Kentucky. ‘But two, just because because I like this stuff, and I like to get into the details, we can just highlight for the American people how bad she is on public policy, and how good Donald Trump is on public policy.’ He said it was important not to underestimate Harris but to unpick the meaning underneath her frequent waffling. ‘I actually don’t think she’s dumb,’ he said. ‘I think the word salad comes from she’s clearly hiding what she actually believes from the American people. ‘She’s a far left liberal who wants to take San Francisco liberalism nationwide.’ The former Marine seemed happy to be on the attack after two weeks of weathering incoming. News organizations had busied themselves sifting through old interviews and social media posts to attack him for comments about ‘childless cat ladies’ or inventing smears about couches. He expected that, he said, and has gone out of his way to engage with what he called the ‘hostile press.’ But other aspects of becoming Trump’s running mate meant more difficult adjustments. ‘The Secret Service thing is just weird. I don’t think we’ll ever get used to it,’ he said of the 24-hour protection given to presidential candidates and their VP picks. ‘I hate not driving. Our kids have finally kind of gotten used to it. They call them their police friends.’ The couple have three children all under the age of seven. Usha was engaged in a book as her husband chatted, but smiled occasionally at the questions and at his responses. Much has been made of Vance’s love of books by English author J.R.R. Tolkien. His venture capital firm is named Narya, after one of the rings featured in the “Lord of the Rings”. And he said there was no doubt it had inspired some of his thinking. ‘The fundamental implication, or the moral lesson, of “The Lord of the Rings” is that, compared to something like “Game of Thrones” or more modern novels, is that we often know the right from the wrong,’ he said. ‘The really important thing is whether you have the courage and the will to see the right through. I think that’s a very important moral lesson.’ Plus Tolkien was a thoughtful Catholic, added Vance, who officially converted to Catholicism in 2019. ‘There are, I’m sure, all these subtle ways in which has influenced me,’ he said. His current reading may surprise people: “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” by Joan Didion. Her 1968 collection of essays chronicles California counterculture of the time. Usha introduced him to her work when they were dating, he said, and he sees parallels between her takedown of Sixties hippy culture and today’s liberals. ‘There’s an essay where she’s basically criticizing a think tank. Like these people sit around and they used to be important, and now they just write s***ty articles. And I’m like, Oh, God … everything old is new again.’ The seatbelt signs come on as the plane, a chartered 737 decorated with campaign slogans (think ‘Drain the Swamp of Washington Corruption’), approaches Detroit airport about an hour after leaving Vance’s home base of Cincinnati. With Trump staying home for the early part of the week, it is up to Vance to lead the campaign attack. He knows that his boss will be watching and scoring his performance. But Vance played down the idea that Trump is a demanding or temperamental person to work for, playing up their rapport and his sense of humor. Only one other person knows what it is like to be Trump’s running mate. Mike Pence played a near perfect hand as the straight man to the president’s antics until falling out in spectacular style over Trump’s attempts to upend the Constitution and hold on to power after the 2020 election. ‘I do want to talk to Mike Pence, because obviously he was vice president for four years, said Vance, before adding: ‘but I haven’t spoken to him since I was asked to be the VP nominee.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s attack dog has two goals for the election campaign: Take&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Traveling with Trump&#8217;s aggressive ally: JD Vance shares his weight loss journey, strategy against Kamala Harris, intention to meet Mike Pence, and current reading choice first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/traveling-with-trumps-aggressive-ally-jd-vance-shares-his-weight-loss-journey-strategy-against-kamala-harris-intention-to-meet-mike-pence-and-current-reading-choice/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/08/13/88308171-13723407-image-a-1_1723121617076.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-11 00:02:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":253846404,"title":"Donald Trump's Campaign Says Hit By Hackers, Blames \"Foreign Sources\"","text":"Donald Trump's campaign said Saturday it had been hacked, blaming \"foreign sources\" for distributing internal communications and a dossier on running mate J.D.

Dion’s management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada, said in a statement on X the use of the song and video was “in no way” authorised. “Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use...

The former president appeared on track to win back the White House before Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, but Harris has made big gains since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket and announcing Tim Walz, Minnesota’s governor, as her running mate. “My Heart Will Go On” was released on Dion’s album Let’s Talk About Love and the soundtrack to Cameron’s film Titanic. It became one of the biggest songs of all time, selling 18 million copies and earning Dion an Oscar, a Golden Globe and several Grammys. Dion, 56, was forced to cancel a string of shows in 2023 and 2024, saying she was not strong enough to tour after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. But she delighted fans last month by singing from the Eiffel Tower at the opening of the Olympics in Paris.","summary":"‘Really, THAT song?

The former president, 78, took aim at the Montana senator's largess as the Democrat faces a tough re-election fight in November for a race that could define who controls the upper chamber of Congress. 'I don't speak badly about somebody's physical disability,' Trump said, possibly noting that Tester lost three fingers on one hand in a meat-grinder accident when he was nine. 'But he's got the biggest stomach I've ever seen,' Trump added. Scrutiny has fallen on Trump's operation in recent days amid an apparent slow-down in campaigning, but the former president drew a huge crowd to Friday's event in Bozeman, Montana. Insiders told the New York Times that he has found the transformation after Biden dropped out as being disorientating. In response to the change in rivals, behind close doors, he has reportedly branded Harris a 'b****', two people told the outlet. His campaign denied that language in a statement, but his quickness to attack has reportedly left him open to manipulation. While attacking Tester's weight, Trump rallied his supporters by slamming the senator on issues from the southern border to his voting record. 'For years, Tester has been telling Montana that he’s a moderate,' he said. 'While he votes with Biden, Harris, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.' Trump's jab at Tester's 'biggest stomach' is not the first time he has attacked the Montana Democrat's weight. He reportedly said Tester 'looks pregnant' at a private fundraiser in May, according to Politico. He told attendees: 'Have you ever seen this guy? He doesn’t look like a fat guy, except that his stomach is out.' That fundraiser in May was in aid of Texas Congressman - and former White House physician - Ronny Jackson, who also spoke at the rally in Montana on Friday night. In his remarks in Bozeman, Jackson echoed Trump's attack on Tester's weight as he branded him a 'hippopotamus.' 'This man is a sleazy, disgusting swamp politician,' Jackson said. 'The end of Jon Tester's career starts tonight. 'We're going to bring (Tester's election opponent) Tim Sheehy to the Senate to replace this swamp hippopotamus Jon Tester. Trump's focus on Tester's weight comes as many have noticed the former president appeared to lose weight in recent years, sparking speculation from some that he joined a growing number of celebrities who take Ozempic. Tester is seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the senate in this election cycle, as one of the leading incumbents in a state that Trump won handily in the 2020 presidential race. With control of the senate currently a 50-50 split only decided by Vice-President Kamala Harris, close senate elections are drawing the spotlight ahead of November. With Montana routinely a Republican supporting state, Tester's campaign has attempted to draw a clear line between him and the Biden-Harris administration. In a Tester campaign advert released earlier this year, it was claimed that he 'worked with Republicans fighting to shut down the border, target fentanyl traffickers, and add hundreds of new Border Patrol agents. 'And he fought to stop President Biden from letting migrants stay in America instead of remain in Mexico.' In contrast, Sheehy's remarks at Friday's event saw him attempt to lump Tester in with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, branding him a 'rubber stamp for the Biden-Harris agenda every single time it matters.' 'Jon Tester couldn’t find the courage to say, \"I’m going to vote against these terrible policies that are bad for Montanans,''' said Sheehy, a former military officer and businessman. According to a Decision Desk HQ poll cited by The Hill, Sheehy is running slightly ahead of Tester heading into the election, at 49 percent to 45 percent.","summary":"Trump drew a large crowd to Bozeman, Montana on Friday night, where he focused his remarks on Democrat Senator Jon Tester - and launched several crude attacks on his weight.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13731631/Donald-Trump-Jon-Tester-weight-fat-shaming-bozeman-montana.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/10/23/88393839-0-image-a-14_1723329210956.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 23:57:46","author":"Editor,Will Potter For","authors":["Editor","Will Potter For"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":253846352,"title":"Harris, Trump campaign for support in the West","text":"Harris, Trump campaign for support in the West Hundreds stood in the blistering desert heat in Las Vegas to show their support for Vice President Kamala Harris Saturday, a day after former President Donald Trump held an event in Bozeman, Montana, to boost the chances of Senate candidate Tim Sheehy.

The campaign statement came shortly after news website Politico revealed it began receiving emails in July from an anonymous source offering authentic documents from inside Trump’s operation, including a report about running mate J.D. Vance’s “potential vulnerabilities”. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. Reuters has not independently verified the identity of the alleged hackers or their motivation. The Trump campaign referred to a Friday report from Microsoft researchers that said Iranian government-tied hackers tried breaking into the account of a “high-ranking official” on a US presidential campaign in June. The hackers had taken over an account belonging to a former political adviser and then used it to target the official, the report said. That report did not provide further details on the targets’ identities. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to name the targeted officials or provide additional details after the report was published. Iran’s foreign ministry and its United Nations representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Friday, in response to Microsoft’s findings, Iran’s mission to the UN in New York said that its cyber capabilities were “defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces” and that it had no plans to launch cyberattacks. “The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere,” Iran’s mission to the UN said. The US former president had tense relations with Iran while in office. Under Trump, the United States killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020 and withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,” Cheung said. Trump survived an assassination attempt in July. While there have been no suggestions that the suspect was linked to Iran, CNN reported last month that the US had intelligence about an Iranian plot against Trump. Iran has denied such charges. Late last month, a senior intelligence official told reporters in a briefing that Tehran and Moscow maintain their same presidential preferences as in past cycles, where Iranian operatives will attempt to tear down the Republican ticket while Russia has made efforts to smear Democrats, according to prior intelligence community assessments.","summary":"A US news outlet says an anonymous source offered it a report on running mate J.D.

Jesse Ventura defended the man occupying his former office who has come under scrutiny since being selected as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate. Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) served 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005 to focus on his House bid. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), running against Walz for the vice presidency, has led the charge in attacking his opponent for avoiding a deployment that was announced shortly after his retirement. A former Navy SEAL, Ventura described those attacks as “shameful,” “despicable,” and “hogwash” Friday on CNN. “They talk about him missing his deployment, well maybe Mr. Vance should ask the real question: What is the National Guard doing deploying to a foreign country in a foreign war?” Ventura said, criticizing former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney for entering the Iraq War “based on lies.” “They needed more bodies,” Ventura said. “They couldn’t implement the draft, that would be political suicide. So what George Bush did was sign an executive order sending the National Guard into foreign deployment. The National Guard is not for foreign deployment. Their name says what they do: They guard our nation from within.” Ventura said he never deployed with any E-9s, the highest rank an enlisted official can achieve, who “are not going to walk the point” or “be involved in any combat whatsoever.” “I think Vance is doing a disservice to himself and a disservice to the United States Marine Corps,” Ventura said. “I know a lot of great Marines, and Marines show respect. And Vance is not showing respect.” Ventura, a former professional wrestler, further criticized Vance for having respect for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, whom he called the “biggest draft dodger from the Vietnam War.” “It’s despicable on [Vance’s] behalf for doing that, and I hope all veterans feel like I do about it,” Ventura said. “You don’t criticize another veteran and how they served, whether they’re a cook or whatever they do, they all have a job to do, and if you’re going to be successful, everybody has to do their job and pitch in.” Despite his independent affiliation and rumored spot on presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s vice presidential short list, Ventura also endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket because “it’s time for a woman president — we men have screwed it up enough.” “I want to be alive to see the first woman president of the United States of America and the first woman commander in chief, and we’ve got her right now,” Ventura, 73, said. Ventura previously endorsed Walz’s 2022 gubernatorial reelection bid, specifically hailing his stance on abortion rights and his work to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota.","summary":"Former Minnesota Gov.

The 39-year-old revealed that the crash took place on Monday when he was traveling to pick up his son Cy, two, from school. He was rushed to the ICU after snapping two nerves that control his muscles - an injury that in some cases leaves the patient permanently unable to walk. However Schulman assured his fans that he is 'not paralyzed' and is 'projected to make a full recovery,' in an Instagram post on Saturday. Schulman posted several videos of himself wearing a neck brace in the hospital, including one of him rising slowly from his bed with the help of two staffers.

His album contained a grisly close-up of the gash along the back of his neck, as well as X-rays indicating the extent of first the internal damage and then his recovery. Schulman also included heartwarming pictures and video of his family rallying around him and comforting him in the hospital. In one photo, his wife Laura Perlongo could be seen cuddling up next to him in his bed, the two of them pulling brave smiles for the camera. A brief clip showed their three children Cleo, seven, Beau, five, and Cy, two, paying him a visit and wrapping him in a group hug. 'I went fishing with my family on Sunday. It was incredible, my son’s idea. One of those days that just work,' he recalled. 'It was magical. A day full of love and wonder in the way only calm days in nature with family can be.' He added: 'Monday was not a day like that. Monday was a day where I learned what \"before the accident\" really means. And Monday gave weight to just how lucky I was to have Sunday. It’s true what they say - life can change in an instant.' Schulman wrote: 'I never made it to pick up my son from school on the bike. In fact in some ways, I’m glad I didn’t. I was alone on impact. Me and the truck. And then I guess the pavement. I was alone and unconscious. And then conscious. Maybe I was fine (I wasn’t). Maybe I can still do my long run on Thursday (I couldn’t).'

C5 and C6 to be exact. Stable fractures. I’m not paralyzed. My hands were a question mark there for a minute but the human body is incredible and so are HUMANS.' Praising the 'incredible knowledge and care' he received from the medical profession, he reflected: 'It’s hard to feel sorry for myself when I hear from the doctors about how many people with similar injuries will never walk again.' He noted that he was 'lucky to be here, alive, standing and hugging my family, projected to make a full recovery. 'And I’m really starting to understand the meaning of gratitude. For the big and little things before the accident, and now everything moving forward.' He added: 'We hadn’t planned on fishing last Sunday and my instinct was to say no to scramble-planning a day trip, but looking back a week later, I’m so glad I said yes.'

The movie popularized the term 'catfishing,' which is often used to refer to people lying about their appearance or identity while online dating. Catfish, which was co-directed by Schulman's older brother, became a pop culture phenomenon and spawned a reality show of the same name. Schulman co-hosts Catfish: The TV Show on MTV, in which each episode follows the trajectory of a different online romance.

Nabil Boudi said in a press release: \"The boxer Imane Khelif has decided to begin a new fight, a fight for justice, dignity and honour\". He further stated that Khelif has lodged a formal complaint with Paris prosecutors, asserting \"aggravated online harassment\". Boudi elaborated on his client's aim with the lawsuit, stating: \"The investigation will determine who was behind this misogynist, racist and sexist campaign, but will also have to concern itself with those who fed the online lynching.\" Khelif clinched a convincing victory through a unanimous decision over China's Yang Liu in the women's welterweight final on Friday. She had faced considerable backlash before the fight, particularly after failing a gender test at the 2023 Women's World Championships. Criticism increased against Khelif after her contentious victory over Italian boxer Angela Carini, who ended their bout just 46 seconds in, declaring \"this is unjust\" while leaving the ring in tears. Carini, conceding defeat without acknowledging Khelif post-fight - an action she later regretted - told journalists that the punches from the Algerian were among the toughest she'd ever encountered. The sporting world has erupted with controversy as hundreds took to social media to express their outrage over the participation of boxer Khelif in the Paris Games, with high-profile figures like Elon Musk, JK Rowling, and Donald Trump leading the charge against her competing in the women's category. In the wake of her victory over Carini and amidst a storm of criticism and threats, Khelif stood up for herself, stating that such negative attention \"harms human dignity,\" and called for more respectful treatment of athletes. \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said during an interview with SNTV, speaking in Arabic. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\" Echoing Khelif's call for respect, Boudi on Saturday condemned the \"iniquitous harassment\" faced by Khelif in Paris, branding it as \"the biggest stain on these Olympic Games\". Despite the tumultuous backdrop, Khelif remained undeterred in her quest for Olympic glory, dispatching opponents Luca Anna Hamori of Hungary and Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng with ease, earning her place in the final bout for the gold medal against Liu. After her triumph in the quarter-finals, she boldly claimed: \"I don't care what anyone is saying about me with the controversy. All that is important to me is that I stay on the level and give my people the performance they deserve. I know I'm a talented person and this is a gift to all Algerians.\"","summary":"Algerian boxer Imane Khelif has filed a legal complaint for online harassment after winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics, her lawyer has announced","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/imane-khelif-olympics-official-complaint-33438678","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33438676.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_boxing-olympic-games-paris-2024-day-14.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 23:40:12","author":"Matthew Neschis","authors":["Matthew Neschis"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":253846114,"title":"The Trump campaign, citing a Microsoft threat report, says it was hacked and blames 'foreign sources'","text":"The campaign of former President Donald Trump on Saturday said it had been hacked following Politico's receipt of internal campaign documents from an anonymous email account.Documents sent to Politico included vice-presidential vetting materials related to Ohio Sen.

Vance at Bozeman on Friday, Aug. 9, event organizers played a video of Dion performing \"My Heart Will Go On,\" her 1997 hit song from the Titanic soundtrack, according to NBC News. In a message shared to Dion's X (formerly Twitter) account on Saturday, Aug. 10, the singer's team responded to the campaign's use of the song. \"Today, Celine Dion’s management team and her record label, Sony Music Entertainment Canada Inc., became aware of the unauthorized usage of the video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion singing 'My Heart Will Go On' at a Donald Trump / JD Vance campaign rally in Montana,\" the statement reads. \"In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,\" the statement adds, finishing with a question for the Trump campaign: \"…And really, THAT song?\" Dion previously turned down Trump's request for her to perform at his 2017 presidential inauguration.

During the former president's re-election campaign in 2020, John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival issued a cease-and-desist letter to Trump after he used the band's song \"Fortunate Son\" at campaign events, according to Rolling Stone. \"I wrote this song because, as a veteran, I was disgusted that some people were allowed to be excluded from serving our country because they had access to political and financial privilege. I also wrote about wealthy people not paying their fair share of taxes,\" Fogerty wrote at the time. \"Mr. Trump is a prime example of both of these issues. The fact that Mr. Trump also fans the flames of hatred, racism and fear while rewriting recent history, is even more reason to be troubled by his use of my song.\" That same year, Consequence of Sound reported that Phil Collins' team also sent Trump's campaign a demand to stop using \"In the Air Tonight\" after it was played at an Iowa rally. The use of the song was \"particularly inappropriate since it was apparently intended as a satirical reference to Covid-19,\" Collins' lawyer wrote at the time. \"That reference was made at a time when Iowa was suffering from an acceleration of Covid-19 infection.

Among them was his fawning interview with Elon Musk in November. This could have been an -opportunity to challenge the tech billionaire on why he’s turned X/Twitter into a super sewer for bile, racism and abuse. He could have asked him why he allowed the far-right spreader of hate Tommy Robinson back on the platform, or whether it was acceptable for him to compare Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler, or why he endorsed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on X. Instead the lickspittle demeaned himself and his office by asking a series of patsy questions which only served to stroke Musk’s ego. When Musk said he wanted to make X as “accurate as possible and as truthful as possible”, instead of rolling his eyes in disbelief, Sunak meekly nodded along. Musk showed last week why he prefers leaders who kowtow before his self-proclaimed brilliance rather than call him out for allowing the far right to use X to spread lies, hatred and social unrest. When Keir Starmer slapped down Musk for claiming that “civil war is inevitable” in the UK, the bully boy billionaire responded with a series of posts attacking the Labour leader. Mr Starmer has tried to avoid engaging in a Twitter spat with the owner of Twitter. He is right to stand firm in the face of Musk’s keyboard baiting. It’s not just that he’s turned X into a cesspit. Nor is it that he’s a Donald Trump fanboy. It’s because Musk has more power and influence than most heads of state but is totally unaccountable. Consider this: Ukraine is totally dependent on Musk’s Starlink satellite system for its internet communications. The country’s ability to win the war rests on Starlink and, by extension, on Musk’s goodwill. But Musk came close to pulling the plug because of the mounting cost to his SpaceX company. There are allegations, denied by Musk, that at one point he switched off Ukraine’s Starlink coverage over Crimea. This thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack on Russian ships. Vessels which, according to Kviv, have since launched lethal rocket attacks. Following panicked phone calls between senior Pentagon officials and the billionaire, the US government agreed to pay a reported $400million to maintain Starlink’s coverage of Ukraine. A Pentagon official told the New Yorker: “Living in the world we live in, in which Elon runs this company and it is a private business under his control, we are living off his good graces. That sucks.” No individual should have such power. Sunak grovelled before these tycoons who act like tyrants. Starmer should take them on.","summary":"No person should wield the amount of power X boss Elon Musk has, and after last week's cesspit of rioting, the Prime Minister should stand up to his bullying and smears, writes Mirror columnist Jason Beattie","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/after-vile-riots-keir-starmer-33437469","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33424943.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_FILES-US-AUTOMOBILE-TESLA-INTERNET-TWITTER-MUSK.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 23:08:35","author":"Jason Beattie","authors":["Jason Beattie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":253844998,"title":"Iran appears to be trying to influence the US election against Trump, Microsoft says","text":"Iran is accelerating online activity that appears intended to influence the U.S. election, in one case targeting a presidential campaign with an email phishing attack, Microsoft said Friday. Iranian actors also have spent recent months creating fake news sites and impersonating activists, laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall, especially in swing states, the technology giant found. The findings in Microsoft’s newest threat intelligence report show how Iran, which has been active in recent U.S. elections, is evolving its tactics for another election that’s likely to have global implications. The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran’s United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election. The report doesn’t specify Iran’s intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran’s efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who’s alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump. The report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year. Microsoft’s report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November’s election draws closer. First, a group linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn’t identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email’s origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said. Days later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn’t successful, Microsoft’s report said. The company notified those who were targeted. In a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said. One fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him “raving mad” and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery. A third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election. Finally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts. Iran’s U.N. mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: “Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran’s cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.” The Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions. Microsoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle. While many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven’t had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have “pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past — simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.” Microsoft’s report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America’s adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November’s vote. Top intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024. Iran’s efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That’s a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general. The influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said. America’s foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections.

The campaign of the Republican US presidential candidate sent out a statement shortly after news website Politico revealed it began receiving emails in July from an anonymous source offering authentic documents from inside Trump's operation, including a report about running mate JD Vance's \"potential vulnerabilities\". Reuters has not independently verified the identity of the alleged hackers or their motivation. The Trump campaign referred to a Friday report from Microsoft researchers that said Iranian government-linked hackers tried breaking into the account of a \"high-ranking official\" on a US presidential campaign in June. The hackers had taken over an account belonging to a former political advisor and then used it to target the official, the report said. That report did not provide further details on the targets' identities. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to name the targeted officials or provide additional details after the report was published. Iran's foreign ministry and its United Nations representative did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Friday, in response to Microsoft's findings, Iran's mission to the UN in New York told Reuters that its cyber capabilities were \"defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces\" and that it had no plans to launch cyber attacks. The former president had tense relations with Iran while in office. Under Trump, the United States killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020 and withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal. \"The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,\" Mr Cheung said. Trump survived an assassination attempt in July. While there have been no suggestions that the suspect was linked to Iran, CNN reported last month that the US had intelligence about an Iranian plot against Trump. Iran has denied such charges. Late last month, a senior intelligence official told reporters in a briefing that Tehran and Moscow maintained their same presidential preferences as in past cycles, where Iranian operatives will attempt to tear down the Republican ticket, while Russia has made efforts to smear Democrats, according to prior intelligence community assessments.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) will be elevated to the highest-held position of their careers at the conclusion of the 2024 election season. Their voting records in the Senate provide telling insights into their ideological leanings and agendas. Harris, who represented California in the Senate from 2017 to 2021, has faced criticism from former President Donald Trump and others for being “the most liberal” member of the Senate. Vance, on the other hand, has only been on the job since 2023, but his limited record shows he has been more willing to vote across party lines than Harris was. In 2019, nonpartisan congressional tracker YouGov rated Harris the most liberal senator. She was also the sixth-least likely senator to vote across party lines in 2019, according to The Lugar Center’s McCourt School Bipartisan Index, and the 11th-least likely in 2017. Vance, by comparison, was the 22nd-least likely in 2023. On The Lugar Center’s index, a lower score indicates a lower willingness to vote across party lines. Harris scored -0.92670 in 2019 and -1.19719 in 2017. While Vance did not score high on the ranking, his -0.79354 score from 2023 indicates that he is more willing to cross party lines to pass legislation. Is Vance as conservative as Harris is liberal? Aside from YouGov’s now-deleted 2019 report card which rated Harris as the most liberal senator, the tracker graded her the second-most liberal senator on its 2020 report card and the fourth-most liberal on the 2018 edition. YouGov does not have data on Vance yet. Voteview, based out of the University of California, Los Angeles, also grades senators based on how ideologically extreme they are. Harris was the second-most liberal senator behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in Voteview’s ratings in both 2017 and 2019. Vance was ranked the fifth-most conservative member in 2023, while Warren and Harris were ranked the most liberal by a notable margin in 2017 and 2019. Sens. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Mike Lee (R-UT) all came in as more conservative than Vance. Harris received critical ratings from conservative grading organizations based on her Senate voting record, including a 0% score from Campaign for Working Families, another 0% from Heritage Action for America, a 9% from American Conservative Union, 10% from Eagle Forum, and 20% from Conservative Review. Left-leaning graders were far more favorable to Harris, including Americans for Democratic Action, which gave her a 90% rating, and Progressive Punch, which graded her at 86%. Vance received a 6% score from liberal Progressive Punch but was graded at 93% by right-leaning Heritage Action for America and 100% by Eagle Forum. Reaching across the aisle Both Harris and Vance have voted alongside members of the opposite party to pass legislation, although their scores on The Lugar Center’s McCourt School Bipartisan Index suggest that Vance is more willing to reach across the aisle. Vance, for example, worked with Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bob Casey (D-PA), and John Fetterman (D-PA) to introduce the Railway Safety Act in 2023 after the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment. Harris voted in favor of the 2018 First Step Act introduced by former Republican Rep. Doug Collins and signed by Trump. No Democratic senators voted against the bill, however, 12 Republicans did. There have also been numerous bills, motions, and nominations that passed with bipartisan support and little-to-no opposition that the pair voted with members of the opposite party to pass. What can Harris and Vance do with elevated power? Despite no longer serving as a senator, Harris has cast 33 votes in the Senate since becoming vice president, who casts the tiebreaking vote when there is gridlock in the upper chamber of Congress. That role will belong to Vance if Trump wins in November. There is no guarantee Vance would even have to cast a single vote if elected, as 12 vice presidents, including President Joe Biden, did not get a chance to break a Senate tie. Harris’s 33 votes rank as the most of any vice president, and she has done so in far less time than any of her predecessors who have come close. Democrats have a 51-49 Senate majority, so the only time Harris has to vote is when they cannot get a unanimous vote within the party. There are 33 seats up for election in 2024, 10 held by Republicans and 23 held by Democrats. If one party ends up with a multi-seat majority, the next vice president may not cast many votes. According to Cook Political Report, each GOP seat up for grabs is in a state that leans Republican. Four Democratic-held seats are rated as toss-ups and one is rated as being “Solid Republican.” The Hill’s 2024 election forecast gives the GOP a 78% chance to take control of the Senate, predicting a 51-47 majority with two independents caucusing with Democrats.

She would also be able to issue executive orders to execute certain policies without being voted on by Congress.

Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice president, “misspoke” in a 2018 video about “weapons of war that I carried in war,” a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson said Saturday. Republicans, including the vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, began questioning Walz’s military record after Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate for president, named the governor as her running mate on Tuesday. Some of the criticism centers on comments by Walz in a 2018 video circulated on social media by the Harris campaign in which he speaks out against gun violence and says, “We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” The comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone. Walz served 24 years in various Army National Guard units but he was never in a combat zone. Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign, said Saturday in a statement that Walz misspoke in the 2018 video. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It’s the American way,” Hitt said. “In making the case for why weapons of war should never be on our streets or in our classrooms, the Governor misspoke,” Hitt added. “He did handle weapons of war and believes strongly that only military members trained to carry those deadly weapons should have access to them, unlike Donald Trump and JD Vance who prioritize the gun lobby over our children.” Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, similar to a military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPHOENIX – Minnesota Gov.

The first woman elected Mayor of Los Angeles, the former Congresswoman is in Paris for Sunday’s Olympics Closing Ceremony and the handover to the City of Angels for the Games of the XXXIV Olympiad. In that handover from Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Mayor Bass will be the first Black woman mayor to receive the Olympic flag in what will be the first female mayor to female mayor transfer. “I hope that it sends a message to girls in general around the world, but especially Black girls in the United States,” declares the first term mayor from the streets of the City of Light ahead of tomorrow’s closing ceremony in the 80,000-capacty Stade de France. Of course, in this year of a distinctly unpredictable election in the United States, a smart retail politician like Bass is in Paris to suss out what can be learned from the past two weeks of competition and culture for the next summer Olympics here in Los Angeles. In that context, the Mayor chatted with me about Paris 2024 and the closing ceremony, plus LA 2028. Mayor Bass also spoke about her efforts to help jump start the film and TV industry in Los Angeles after a hard past few years that have seen a pandemic, strikes, cuts galore and more belt tightening by the studios and streamers. And then there’s that matter of a certain history making Vice President and a certain convicted felon. DEADLINE: In taking the Olympic flag from Mayor Hidalgo in Sunday’s closing ceremony,, you will be the first black woman mayor ever to receive the flag. What does that mean to you as both the mayor of LA and as an individual? MAYOR KAREN BASS: Well, first of all, it is an incredible source. of pride. I am very excited about it and humbled by it. I hope that it sends a message to girls in general around the world, but especially Black girls in the United States. I mean, we’re on the verge of a Black female president. So, I think it’s just an exciting time. I’m always interested in young people feeling as though that they can do anything. But if I can make a small contribution to a young person feeling that way, then I will be very satisfied. DEADLINE: On the topic of the closing ceremony, there are a lot of rumors about what we are going to see from LA near the end. We reported on Tom Cruise swooping down. There’s talk of the likes of Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and others performing, and a big Hollywood production from LA 2028. Besides your own flag handover role, what else are we going to see? MAYOR BASS: (laughs) Very seriously, I don’t know. DEADLINE: C’mon … MAYOR BASS: I’m serious, I don’t know. DEADLINE: Okay, we’ll take your word for that, but staying on LA 2028 and the end of Paris 2024, looking at what we’ve seen over the past two weeks, what are the pros and cons for you looking forward four years from now? MAYOR BASS: Well, I think what we could learn from them pro is how to have a wonderful event that involves everybody, how to have a guarantee set aside for small businesses. And then I think on the con, I don’t know what is the con you know. DEADLINE: Really? MAYOR BASS: Perhaps how they did their opening ceremony. I think we would focus more on the athletes. I don’t think it’s a con or a criticism, just something we would choose to do. DEADLINE: The 2028 Olympics will occur halfway what through would be your second term, which means you will not only have a great deal of influence on the Games, but will be literally the host and the one handing over the flag to the Mayor of Brisbane . How will you use that influence? MAYOR BASS: I view it as a target date in which we need to address a number of challenges in our city. And I will tell you that I want to see the game take place and benefit the entire city. So, one of the things I’ve loved about being here is that even in neighborhoods where the games are not actually being played, there’s complete participation still with cultural events and fan festivals.. DEADLINE: How so? MAYOR BASS: I was in front of City Hall earlier this week and there were thousands of people out there watching one of the games on a big screen, I would like to see that same type of thing happen for or games. I want all of Los Angeles cooking, electric and involved. DEADLINE: Inside and outside the venues then? MAYOR BASS: Yes, because we’re so fortunate in LA to have so many venues. So, the Griffith Observatory could be one place for people. You know one of the things in terms of communities, I want to see us use the Greek Theatre, I want to see us use the Hollywood Bowl. We have the BMO Stadium. We have Exposition Park. Oh, my goodness, we are so fortunate. DEADLINE: I get those locations but I wonder what you feel about the sometimes overlooked parts of our city – South LA and some of the satellite cities that don’t get recognized as much or over in amazing Boyle Heights and East LA. We have the Watts Tower, a national landmark, that I know many people in LA have never seen in person. How do we bring those parts of the city in to play, so to speak, for 2028 to show the full, rich picture of LA? MAYOR BASS: Well, we are definitely going to do that because we’re going to have folks all over the place. So, the Watts Tower, absolutely, By then we will also have the open spaces of Destination Crenshaw We have the incredible murals of East L.A. and at the San Fernando Valley. I want to make sure that all of those neighborhoods are represented including our various ethnic neighborhoods like Little Ethiopia and Koreatown. Little Armenia, Little Bangladesh. DEADLINE: Madame Mayor, that all sounds both ambitious and great, but one of the biggest challenges LA faces now and heading towards 2028 is homelessness, both for the unhoused themselves and the tension have so many people on the streets has created in the city … MAYOR BASS: Yes.. DEADLINE: Governor Newsom recently signed a new order based on the Supreme Court’s ruling about homelessness and encampments. LA has made it pretty clear that they’re not going to take what some have called draconian measures, but I know that dealing with this crisis has been a major part of your administration. Talking to people, I hear a lot: “Oh, God, we can’t have an Olympics. There’s all these people on the street.” What would you say to those people? MAYOR BASS: First of all, Dominic you know I’m around for this, because that has been my focus, my passion, my concern, and I’ve worked on this night and day since even before I took office. So, for the first time in many years, we’ve actually had a decline in street homelessness. Where I agree with the governor and have worked in very close partnership with him, is we have been clearing out encampments, we’re going to continue to do that. The difference is that for us that is clearing out an encampment for us is defined by getting people housed. What I don’t think works is just telling people to move along. DEADLINE: On another local issue, you recently made moves to boost production here in the home of Hollywood, and put together an Entertainment Industry Cabinet, with the likes of MPA boss Charlie Rivkin, NBCU VP Yvette Estrada, ex-Film Czar Ken Ziffren, Netflix’s Amy Lemisch, and Jason Reitman in it. MAYOR BASS: Yes.. DEADLINE: When you and I spoke at the Shirley premiere on March 19 you mentioned to me about you were trying to see if the governor would even enlarge the state’s $300 million annual film and TV tax credits. So, coming out of the pandemic coming out of last year’s strikes, what do you think needs to be done that can really help to get the industry back on its feet, get production back to where it used to be and get people back to work? MAYOR BASS: First of all, on my end, as mayor, we can make filming much easier. We can make the development of soundstages much easier. We can expedite things. Then down the line when the economy is better I want us to consider A local tax credit. DEADLINE: For real? MAYOR BASS: Yes, and in Sacramento, and I do understand with the deficit this is not the year for it, but we have got to expand our tax credit. All these other states once again, are beating us and tits slowing our local industry. DEADLINE: And, let’s be honest, the city has become too damn expensive for many. We see that with the working homeless. We see that with people who have seen the bank accounts decimated by a lack of work, and leaving for greener pastures … MAYOR BASS: Absolutely, I agree. LA has become unaffordable. This is a problem for everyone. We want people to be able to live in LA, to work in the entertainment industry and to have a very fruitful life. DEADLINE: On the subject of a fruitful life in LA, it’s not a secret that a lot of people have said they want to leave America if Donald Trump is back in the White House. You mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris’ historic bid for the White House at the top of this conversation, so from your perspective over in France right now, what is the feeling over there about the presidential election? MAYOR BASS: Dominic, let me just say that the world is depending on us to get this election right. Also, I really want to see at the convention an incredible celebration of President Biden. He is going to have a legacy as President of accomplishments of monumental importance, like infrastructure, President Joe Biden came in and got it done. And I can’t wait next January to be at the inauguration of the first woman, first black Asian woman as our next president. And by the way, let me just say a word about our incoming vice president, Tim Walz. I served with him in Congress for eight years. I think the Vice President made a wonderful selection. I can only imagine the chemistry between the two, but his history of service then leaving the house and becoming such a great governor of Minnesota, I think this is a real winning ticket. DEADLINE: Gold medal winning? MAYOR BASS: (laughs) Of course.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Karen Bass is about to make some history, again.

Her voice could be heard wailing the 1998 classic 'My Heart Will Go On' over the speakers in Bozeman, Montana, shortly before Trump took the stage on Friday. Dion on Saturday made it clear that the use of 'video, recording, musical performance, and likeness of Celine Dion' was unauthorized. 'In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,' she said in a statement along with her record label, Sony. Dion then mocked Trump's choice, adding, '…And really, THAT song?' Celine Dion's iconic 'My Heart Will Go On' played at Donald Trump 's Montana rally Celine Dion, who sang at the Olympic Games opening ceremony, mocked Trump for choosing the song, and made clear it was unauthorized The epic ballad that conjures images of a doomed ship striking a massive iceberg, which is not the best comparison to a presidential campaign. Even worse, it was played just hours after Trump's plane was forced to divert to Billings while en route to Bozeman over a 'mechanical issue.' Be the first to commentBe one of the first to commentComments Is Trump's campaign going down like the Titanic? Comment now Some political pundits on social media felt the song was a metaphor for the Trump campaign's flagging momentum, which comes just weeks after a victory in November felt all but assured. One even suggested there could be a 'pro-Kamala Harris' mole secretly working to undermine Trump's re-election. One person said: 'Omg, Trump’s rally in Montana is showing a video of Celine singing \"My Heart Will Go On\" from the film Titanic. Is the rally coordinator trolling Trump?' Pictured: Celine Dion's full statement about Trump using her song The former president's plane was forced to divert to Billings while en route to event in Bozeman over a 'mechanical issue' on Friday 'Seems to me it’s a cry for help from a sinking ship. Has anyone checked on his campaign managers, are they being held hostage or maybe water boarded,' said another. Many people noted the irony in the theme song for a movie about a disaster being played at the event. 'Trump is saying he is going down like the Titanic,' said one person. 'The irony is not lost,' said another. 'How fitting because the Trump campaign right now is just like the titanic. Everyone’s in the bar drinking telling themselves the ship is not sinking,' a third person said. One person created a meme movie poster recreating a scene from James Cameron's 1997 film with Trump and Vance captioned, 'Collide with failure. This November.' Read More BREAKING NEWS Trump campaign is 'HACKED' - amid claims secret documents about JD Vance and court cases were leaked 'Bro, the Trump campaign keeps giving. These are real life SNL skits. Who the f**k plays a song famously associated with a sinking ship at a rally for a campaign that is sinking,' a person said. 'Is the Titanic metaphor a little on the nose, or what,' another said. Others questioned if the Canadian singer gave Trump's team permission to play her song.' 'Celine seems like a truly kind and compassionate legend, but you know she's on the couch at home saying, \"Yeah, f**k no!\" in French,' one person said. 'He can’t have Celine Dion, sorry,' a second person said. 'Celine Dion, are you getting paid for this? You might want to call your lawyer. There's a payday waiting for you right here,' another said. Celine's statement comes amid a tough day for the Trump campaign. A new poll by The New York Times released by the outlet on Saturday suggests that Harris has now moved ahead of Trump by four points in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - all vital battle ground states. Then hours later, the Trump campaign revealed it had been hacked, suggesting that they were targeted by Iran. The campaign blamed 'foreign sources hostile to the United States' and cited a Microsoft report on Friday that Iranian hackers attempted to hack a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign. Céline Dion and her late husband, René Angélil (pictured with Trump and Melania in 1999), frequently dined at Mar-a-Lago Trump has also spent part of the week fending off criticism of a story where he claimed to have almost been in a helicopter crash with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. On Friday night, he was accused of mixing Brown up with another black lawmaker, former California State Senator Nate Holden. Holden told Politico he and Trump were almost in a chopper smash in 1990 and said: 'Willie is the short Black guy living in San Francisco. I’m a tall Black guy living in Los Angeles.'

She was a fan of the French chef Bernard Goupy, especially his signature Caesar salad that was built in an edible cheese bowl. But one day, Trump decided he wasn't making a proper Caesar salad, tossing the salad himself and firing Goupy. However, Celine quickly snapped Goupy up to be her chef at her Jupiter, Florida, estate.

Trump and his Republican campaign now face a dramatically different race than the one just three weeks ago, before United States President Joe Biden abandoned his bid. While they acknowledge polls have tightened with Harris as the Democratic nominee, they maintain that the fundamentals of the race have not changed, with voters deeply sour over the direction of the country, and particularly the economy. “What has happened is we are witnessing a kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality for a couple of weeks,” Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio told reporters during a briefing in West Palm Beach of the current state of the race. It was a message echoed by Trump during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club. “The honeymoon period’s gonna end,” he insisted while minimising the size of the crowds Harris has been drawing and lashing out at his new opponent. “Let me tell you: We have the enthusiasm.”","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-campaign-projects-confidence-looks-to-young-male-voters-for-an-edge-on-harris/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P19-AP-TRUMP_11082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 22:15:10","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":253845596,"title":"Donald Trump's campaign says its emails were hacked","text":"Former President Donald Trump's presidential campaign said on Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.

A day after Algeria's Imane Khelif clinched gold at 66kg, Lin claimed the 57kg crown with a unanimous points decision win over Poland's Julia Szeremeta at Roland Garros. It was Taiwan's second gold of the Games and Lin bowed to all four sides of the arena, before kneeling down and banging the canvas with her fists. Lin and Khelif have been under intense scrutiny for much of the past two weeks in a furore that has drawn fire from the likes of Donald Trump and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. Both boxers were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility testing, with Lin stripped of her bronze, only to be cleared to compete in the French capital. Lin, who like Khelif competed without controversy at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, was cheered into the 15,000-seated Court Philippe-Chatrier and again when her name was read out. The 28-year-old had won all three of her bouts by unanimous points to reach the final against the 20-year-old Szeremeta. The Taiwanese hared into the ring and enjoyed a height advantage of 10 centimetres over the Pole, Lin using her superior reach and thrusting jab from the first bell. Lin momentarily had the more compact Pole backed onto the ropes with a flurry of punches with a minute left of the first round to go ahead on all five judges' scorecards. The second round was more of a brawl but Lin maintained her composure and her advantage, before sealing the deal in the third and final round, although the Pole refused to go quietly. Lin and Khelif were thrown out of last year's world championships, which was run by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA), but were cleared by the IOC to compete in Paris. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has overseen the sport at the Games because of concerns over the IBA's running of boxing, including questions over its finances, ethics and judging of bouts. The IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference this week that Khelif and Lin had undergone \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\". The IOC has leapt to the defense of both boxers, with president Thomas Bach saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that. Neither is known to identify as transgender. Both fighters have enjoyed strong support back home and been well-received by spectators in Paris.

Trump spokesman Steven Cheung made the announcement following report from Politico that said the outlet had received anonymous emails that included documents from inside Trump’s campaign operation. The campaign cited the report from Microsoft on Friday that said a presidential campaign had been targeted with an email phishing attack in June, according to reports. “These documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States, intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process,” Cheung said in a statement. “On Friday, a new report from Microsoft found that Iranian hackers broke into the account of a ‘high ranking official’ on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trump’s selection of a vice presidential nominee,” he continued. “The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House,” he added. Cheung declined to say if there was further information to substantiate Iran’s involvement. He noted that the hack came “after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy.” Trump was wounded July 13 in an assassination attempt during a rally in the western Pennsylvania town. Politico reported it began receiving purported communications on July 22 from a “senior Trump campaign official” that included vetting documents related to Trump’s pick for Vice President, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The documents, which insiders confirmed to Politico are authentic, detailed Vance’s record and past statements and “potential vulnerabilities” and were dated from February. The emails were from an anonymous AOL account from a person who identified himself only as “Robert.” When asked how he came into possession of the sensitive materials, he gave an ominous response. “I suggest you don’t be curious about where I got them from. Any answer to this question, will compromise me and also legally restricts you from publishing them,” Politico reported. US intelligence has reportedly found increasing evidence that Iran has been working on retaliation plots against Trump related to the 2020 assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the elite Quds Force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Trump maintained Soleimani was the architect of attacks on US troops in the Middle East that resulted in hundreds of casualties. Iran has denied the allegations that it is engaging in online efforts to interfere in the election..

(AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris drew on her prosecutorial background to make her first expansive pitch on immigration to border-state voters as she and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, attracted thousands to a campaign rally in Arizona during their tour of battleground states. Harris, the former attorney general of California, reminded the crowd that she, as a law enforcement official, targeted transnational gangs, drug cartels and smugglers. “I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” Harris said in front of a crowd of more than 15,000 in Glendale, a suburb of Phoenix. “So I know what I’m talking about.” Harris promoted a border security bill that a bipartisan group of senators negotiated earlier this year, which Republican lawmakers ultimately opposed en masse at Republican nominee Donald Trump’s behest. “Donald Trump does not want to fix this problem,” Harris said. “Be clear about that: He has no interest or desire to actually fix the problem. He talks a big game about border security, but he does not walk the walk.” Her effort to address immigration — a political liability that has dogged Harris for most of her vice presidency — head-on in the critical battleground state is part of a broader push from her campaign to make gains in Sun Belt states that had become increasingly out of reach with Joe Biden at the top of the ticket. Trump and his allies, who had long hammered Biden over the influx of migrants during his term, are now shifting their attacks to Harris. Kari Lake, who is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego for the open Senate seat in Arizona, bashes Gallego in a recent ad for supporting Biden’s and Harris’ “radical border agenda,” featuring repeated clips of the vice president chortling. “It’s very easy for us to segue and switch our sights and focus on her,” said Dave Smith, Pima County’s Republican party chairman. But Harris has been courting the state’s fast-growing Latino population and released a new ad of her own, highlighting how Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, rose to the highest echelons of American politics. And, as she has done in other campaign stops, Harris during the rally infused the theme of “freedom” throughout her remarks, especially as it came to voting rights, gun safety, LBGT rights and access to abortion. “Arizona, ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom,” Harris said, who had walked out on the stage as Beyonce’s “Freedom” blared throughout Desert Diamond Arena. Harris’ message on safety and gun restrictions resonated with Jen Duran, a 37-year-old mother and independent voter. “I have an elementary school daughter who has been going to this school since she was 4, and today we got a notification that there was a lockdown drill,” Duran said. “So safety for our kids is really important.” Phyllis Zeno, a 65-year-old grandmother from Maricopa, said she was thrilled to hear Harris’ message of unity and her policy positions, especially on affordable health care and reproductive rights. “Her message to me, it wasn’t just hope, but renewed faith in democracy, that we can do this,” Zeno said. Arizona is represented by Democrat Mark Kelly in the U.S. Senate, who has won two tough races in the politically divided states and whom Harris passed over as a running mate this week. In choosing Walz over Kelly, Harris may have lost the chance to win over people like Gonzalo Leyva, a 49-year-old landscaper in Phoenix. Leyva plans to vote for Trump but says he would have backed a Harris-Kelly ticket. “I prefer Kelly like 100 times,” said Leyva, a lifelong Democrat who became an independent at the beginning of Trump’s term in office. “I don’t think he’s that extreme like the other guys.” In Arizona, every vote will be critical. The state is no stranger to nail-biter races, including in 2020 when Biden bested Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes. Both parties are bracing for a similar photo finish this year. Harris acknowledged how tough the race will be as she and Walz toured a campaign office in North Phoenix Friday afternoon and thanked volunteers, who were making signs with sayings such as “This Mamala is Voting for Kamala” and “Kamala and the Coach.” (Walz has been a high school football coach.) She also emphasized it during the rally. “As exciting as this is, we cannot lose sight of a really important fact: We are definitely running as the underdog,” Harris said. Democrats are confident Harris is in solid shape in the state even without Kelly on the ticket. The senator plans to remain a strong advocate for Harris and is already mentioned for possible Cabinet posts or other prominent roles should the vice president ascend to the Oval Office. “What this is about is who works harder. That’s it,” Kelly said at the rally. “It is as simple as that.” Arizona is something of a magnet for Midwesterners seeking to escape the cold. So, several observers say, Walz may still play well there. The governor himself noted that during his opening remarks for Harris, saying: “I’m like a damn snowman, I’m melting here.” Scott Snyder, who moved to Phoenix three years ago from Detroit, wasn’t too familiar with Kelly’s background or his politics, but said Harris made the right choice with Walz. “He reminds me a lot of my dad,” said Snyder, an electrician. “You see pictures of him out there coaching high school football. That’s something that resonates with me. You see him out there duck hunting. Same thing. That’s fairly common in Michigan, where I’m from.” Arizona was reliably Republican until Trump’s combative approach to politics went national. In 2016, Trump won Arizona, then quickly started feuding with the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a political icon in the state. That sparked a steady exodus of educated, moderate Republicans from the GOP and toward Democrats in top-of-the-ticket contests. In 2018, Democrats won an open Senate race in the state, foreshadowing Kelly’s and Biden’s wins in 2020. In 2022, Kelly won again, and Democrats swept the top three statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating Republican candidates who hewed to Trump’s style and his lies about fraud costing him the 2020 presidential election. Chuck Coughlin, a Republican strategist and former McCain staffer, said the same voters who tipped the state to Democrats in the past few cycles remain lukewarm, at best, on Trump. “Trump’s not doing anything to embrace that segment of the electorate,” he said. Meanwhile, there was a fresh reminder of yet another liability for Harris when she was interrupted by Gaza protesters. Harris said she has been clear that “now is the time to get a cease-fire deal” to end fighting between Israel and Hamas that has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Gaza. She stressed that she and Biden “are working around the clock every day to get that cease-fire deal done and bring the hostages home.” Harris added, “I respect your voices, but we are here to now talk about this race in 2024.” She responded differently earlier this week when Gaza protesters interrupted her during a Detroit-area rally.

The polls of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College showed Democratic presidential candidate Harris leading her Republican rival Trump by an identical 50 percent to 46 percent margin in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Under the U.S. electoral college voting system, those three populous Midwestern states are considered key to victory for either party. Harris's apparent lead is within the polls' average margin of error of 4.5 points. Nevertheless, the polls show a shift compared to previous surveys in those states which for nearly a year had shown Trump either tied with or slightly leading Democratic President Joe Biden. Biden dropped out of the White House race last month and endorsed Harris instead. The polling also showed that voters still prefer Trump on the key issues of the economy and immigration, though Harris had a 24-point advantage when voters were asked whom they trust on the question of abortion. The Trump campaign pushed back against the new polls, questioning their methodology and suggesting they were released \"with the clear intent and purpose of depressing support for President Trump.\" Much can change in the nearly three months before the November 5 election. Democrats, in any case, have taken heart in the surge of enthusiasm that has greeted Harris's candidacy, with many expressing relief after 81-year-old Biden stepped aside. Her announcement Tuesday of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate also appears to have energized Democrats. The Harris-Walz surge helped cut short a rise in support for Trump that followed the July 13 attempt on his life and the Republicans' successful national convention last month. But Harris has enjoyed an even bigger bump in favorability -- up 10 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania in just a month, the Times/Siena polling found. Voters said they saw her as more intelligent than Trump and having a better temperament to govern. Trump, his running mate J.D. Vance and other Republicans have tried an array of attacks meant to weaken Harris -- with Trump even questioning her racial identity. But the new polls show Democrats strongly supporting the younger and more vigorous Harris who, with Walz, has been campaigning at a furious pace this week in swing states. Among Democrats, voter satisfaction with their choice of candidates has shot up by 27 points in the three Midwestern states since May, the polls found. Three months ago, it was Republicans who expressed a higher level of satisfaction. The surveys were conducted between August 5 and 9, with at least 600 voters in each state. © 2024 AFP","summary":"Kamala Harris now leads Donald Trump in three crucial battleground states, according to new polls published Saturday, apparently eroding the advantage the former president has enjoyed there over…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/new-polls-give-harris-a-lead-over-trump-in-three-key-states","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/a5/2b/ef316d21c3c234f2857c4fae7ff115b1b372/a52bef316d21c3c234f2857c4fae7ff115b1b372/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 21:59:14","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":253843220,"title":"Trump campaign accuses Iran of hacking its emails","text":"Former President Donald Trump's presidential campaign said Saturday (Aug 10) that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents.

Emanuel, known for his tough stance on China, who has played an active role in deepening Washington-Tokyo ties, is considering leaving Japan before or after Thanksgiving on Nov 28, the U.S. sources said, adding he is hoping to be part of the transition if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidential election. If Donald Trump, a former president and the Republican nominee, wins the Nov 5 election, he will undoubtedly name a new ambassador to Japan. The sources said Emmanuel, 64, has no interest in staying in the post until the next envoy is selected as he wants to seek a new post in a Harris administration. U.S. online news site Axios recently reported that Emmanuel could be one of the candidates for Harris' national security adviser position. The ambassador arrived in Japan in January 2022, filling the post that had been vacant since his predecessor, William Hagerty, resigned in July 2019 to run for the Senate. Even before arriving in the Japanese capital, Emanuel suggested that an essential part of his job would entail countering China. Emanuel had indicated he would serve the post only during President Joe Biden's first term, saying the United States' posture for the next 30 years would be determined by what it could build in partnership with Japan over the next three years. From 2009 to 2010, Emanuel was chief of staff to President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president. Emmanuel served as Chicago's mayor for two terms from 2011 to 2019 and was a member of the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009. Biden abandoned his reelection bid last month, and Harris became the Democratic Party's nominee for president about a week ago. The 81-year-old president bowed out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21, following weeks of intraparty fighting over his fitness to serve another term and calls for him to pass the baton to a younger generation. In state primaries and caucuses earlier this year, Biden won enough delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination. However, pressure for the incumbent to exit the race quickly intensified after he delivered a shaky performance in a televised debate against Trump in late June. Harris, who is Black and Asian American, would be the first female U.S. president, as well as the first woman of color to hold the office. She has narrowed or erased Trump's lead in a number of national polls and appears to be more formidable than Biden in key battleground states. © KYODO","summary":"U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel has told people around him of his intention to leave his post in November, government sources said.\nEmanuel, known for his tough…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/politics/update1-u.s.-ambassador-to-japan-planning-to-leave-post-in-november","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/b6/8a/077171d3f34def294db883e0ecb15b1c59c5/AP24222186452684/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 21:49:08","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.115},{"id":253844432,"title":"Trump is putting mass deportations at the heart of his campaign. Some Republicans are worried","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — “Mass Deportation Now!” declared the signs at the Republican National Convention, giving a full embrace to Donald Trump’s pledge to expel millions of migrants in the largest deportation program in American history. Some Republicans aren’t quite ready for that. Lauren B. Peña, a Republican activist from Texas, said that hearing Trump’s calls for mass deportations, as well as terms like “illegals” and “invasion” thrown around at the convention, made her feel uncomfortable. Like some Republicans in Congress who have advanced balanced approaches to immigration, she hopes Trump is just blustering. “He’s not meaning to go and deport every family that crosses the border, he means deport the criminals and the sex offenders,” Peña said. But Trump and his advisers have other plans. He is putting immigration at the heart of his campaign to retake the White House and pushing the Republican Party towards a bellicose strategy that hearkens back to the 1950s when former President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched a deportation policy known by a racial slur — “Operation Wetback.” Trump, when pressed for specifics on his plan in an interview with Time Magazine this year, suggested he would use the National Guard, and possibly even the military, to target between 15 million and 20 million people — though the government estimated in 2022 there were 11 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal permission. His plans have raised the stakes of this year’s election beyond fortifying the southern border, a longtime conservative priority, to the question of whether America should make a fundamental change in its approach to immigration. After the southern border saw a historic number of crossings during the Biden administration, Democrats have also moved rightward on the issue, often leading with promises of border security before talking about relief for the immigrants who are already in the country. And as the November election approaches, both parties are trying to reach voters like Peña, 33. Latino voters could be pivotal in many swing states. Trump won 35% of Hispanic voters in 2020, according to AP VoteCast, and support for stronger border enforcement measures has grown among Hispanic voters. But an AP analysis of two consecutive polls conducted in June by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that about half of Hispanic Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump. Still, Peña, who described herself as a multiracial Hispanic person, has become a new and enthusiastic recruit for the GOP. She was drawn to Trump after seeing people debilitated by drugs in the public housing complex where she lives in Austin. She feels that government programs have failed low-income people and that the recent migration surge has put a pinch on public assistance like food stamps. But Peña said she also feels concern when her fellow Republicans discuss ideas like barring children who don’t have permanent legal status from public schooling. “Being Hispanic, it’s a difficult topic,” she said. “I feel like we need to give these people a chance.” Still, GOP lawmakers have largely embraced Trump’s plans. “It’s needed,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a July interview at the conservative Hudson Institute. Some, however, have shown tacit skepticism by suggesting more modest goals. Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, pointed to over 1 million people who have already received a final order of removal from an immigration judge and said, “There’s a difference between those that are in the process right now and those that are finished with the process.” Lankford, who negotiated a bipartisan border package that Trump helped defeat earlier this year, added that it would be a “huge” task both logistically and financially just to target that group. Other Republicans, including Floridians Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, suggested Trump in the White House would prioritize migrants with criminal backgrounds. Indeed, Trump entered office in 2016 with similar promises of mass deportation but only succeeded in deporting about 1.5 million people. This time, though, there’s a plan. Trump has worked closely with Stephen Miller, a former top aide who is expected to take a senior role in the White House if Trump wins. Miller describes a Trump administration that will work with “utter determination” to accomplish two goals: “Seal the border. Deport all the illegals.” To accomplish that, Trump would revive travel bans from countries deemed undesirable, such as majority-Muslim countries. He would launch a sweeping operation by deputizing the National Guard to round up immigrants, hold them in massive camps and put them on deportation flights before they could make legal appeals. Beyond that, Trump has also pledged to end birthright citizenship — a 125-year-old right in the U.S. And several of his top advisers have laid out a sweeping policy vision through the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 that would choke off other forms of legal migration. The Trump administration, under those plans, could also grind to a halt temporary programs for over 1 million migrants, including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Ukrainians and Afghans who fled recent conflicts as well as others who receive temporary protection due to unrest in their home country. The policies would have far-reaching disruptions in major industries like housing and agriculture, including in key battleground states. “If the 75,000-plus immigrants who perform the hardest of work in Wisconsin’s dairy and agriculture were gone tomorrow, the state economy would tank,” said Jorge Franco, the CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Wisconsin. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Florida Republican who has pushed legislation that would allow a path to citizenship for longtime residents, argued that large-scale deportations were now necessary because of recent surges in border crossings under President Joe Biden. But she also hoped that Trump could see the difference between recent arrivals and longtime residents. “There is a group of congresspeople that will make sure that the new administration understands it because there’s another aspect: the business community,” she said. “The developers in construction … and the farmers, what are they going to say? They need hands.” Meanwhile, Democrats feel that Trump’s threats are now motivating Latino voters. “The mass deportation put a lot of people on high alert,” said María Teresa Kumar, the CEO of Voto Latino, a leading voter registration organization that is backing Democrat Kamala Harris. Like many other groups aligned with Harris, Voto Latino has seen an outpouring of interest since she rose to the top of the Democratic ticket. Kumar said the organization has registered nearly 36,000 voters in the weeks since Biden left the race — almost matching its tally from the first six months of the year. In a heavily Latino House district on the southern tip of Texas, Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez said voters want to see better management of the border, but at the same time, many also have friends or family members who don’t have their immigration documentation in order. “Much more could be done, in terms of good policy, that would help control surges at the border,” Gonzalez said. “But mass deportation, it just gives people heartburn.” (Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

K. Rowling.Both boxers were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility testing, with Lin stripped of her bronze, only to be cleared to compete in the French capital.On Saturday Lin, who like Khelif competed without controversy at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, was cheered into the 15,000-seated Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros and again when her name was read out.The Taiwanese hared into the ring and enjoyed a height advantage of 10 centimetres over Szeremeta, Lin using her superior reach and thrusting jab from the opening bell.Lin momentarily had the more compact Pole backed onto the ropes with a flurry of punches with a minute left of the first round to go ahead on all five judges' scorecards.The second round was more of a brawl but Lin kept her cool and her advantage, before sealing the deal in the third and final round, although the 20-year-old Pole refused to go quietly.\"I have had several years of struggle and heartbreak,\" said Lin.\"But my dreams have finally come true.\"Lin and Khelif were thrown out of last year's world championships, which was run by the Russian-led International Boxing Association (IBA), but were cleared by the IOC to compete in Paris.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has overseen the sport at the Games because of concerns over the IBA's running of boxing, including questions over its finances, ethics and judging of bouts.The IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference this week that Khelif and Lin had undergone \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\".The IOC has leapt to the defence of both boxers, with president Thomas Bach saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.

Harris “picked a radical left man that … has positions that … it’s just not even possible to believe that they exist,” Trump said. “He’s going for things that nobody’s ever even heard of, heavy into the transgender world, heavy into lots of different worlds.” The transportation secretary called that comment “another example of Trump’s inability to talk about what he is actually going to do to make anyone’s lives better.” “What Tim Walz focused on and focuses on as governor is just that,” Buttigieg said. “You look at the achievements in Minnesota, and you don’t have to be a Democrat or a progressive to be, I think, really impressed with what he’s done.” Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, listed examples of bills Walz signed during the 2023 Minnesota legislative session, including those that codified free school meals and paid family leave, and called the governor a “pretty commonsensical, middle-of-the-road Democrat.” “This is a playbook that is as unimaginative as it is unconvincing ‘cause this is what Republicans say about literally any Democrat running against literally any Republican,” Buttigieg said. “They always say that they’re too far left. It could be Joe Manchin running for president and they’d say he’s too far left, but it’s also pretty mushy and lazy for Donald Trump’s best attack to be, what was it, ‘He’s heavily into lots of different worlds’? You’d think he’d at least be able to point to a few more specifics.” The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said he gets the feeling that Trump’s “heart isn’t in this anymore,” to which CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins asked him if he thought the former president was a different candidate than he was during his past two bids for the White House. “Yeah, I mean you can just tell that he’s lost a step,” Buttigieg said. “He’s getting mushier, fuzzier, more confused,” referring to Trump’s claim that he “went down in a helicopter” with Willie Brown, which the former San Francisco mayor and ex-boyfriend of Vice President Kamala Harris rejected. “It does raise some real concerns about what’s happened to Donald Trump over the years, right?” Buttigieg said. “Is this a symptom of something, is he struggling to maintain a grip on reality or to tell the difference between dreams and what is real, or, best-case scenario, he’s just lying again.” Trump, 78, has come under more scrutiny over his mental acuity since President Joe Biden, 81, dropped out of the race after dealing with his own cognitive concerns. With Harris, 59, now the Democratic presidential nominee instead of her boss, the former president is the oldest major-party nominee. Harris and Trump have agreed to a Sept. 10 debate hosted by ABC News, which was originally scheduled with Biden as the Democratic participant. The June debate between the last two presidents catalyzed Biden’s exit from the race, and Trump appeared skeptical about going through with the agreement after Harris ascended to the top of the ticket. The former president committed to the original plan Thursday, additionally proposing one debate on either side of that date, to which Harris’s campaign has not agreed.","summary":"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wondered Friday if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s heart was in the 2024 campaign anymore, calling his attacks on Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz “pretty mushy and lazy.” Buttigieg, whose name was also speculated to be in the Democratic vice presidential conversation, appeared on CNN to discuss a range of [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3117667/buttigieg-blasts-trump-lazy-campaign-attacks/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ap-pete-buttigieg-press-conference-073024.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-10 21:41:00","author":"Robert Stewart","authors":["Robert Stewart"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":253842206,"title":"Celine Dion slams Trump campaign for ‘unauthorized usage’ of ‘Titanic’ song","text":"Canadian singer Celine Dion on Saturday bashed former President Donald Trump for using her song \"My Heart Will Go On\" at his Montana campaign rally without her permission or endorsement. \"In no way is this use authorized, and Celine Dion does not endorse this or any similar use,\" the singer's management team said in a statement, which she posted to her X account. \"...And really, THAT song?\" Dion's management team quipped, spurring mocking social media posts about the Trump campaign using music from a movie about a sinking ship.
