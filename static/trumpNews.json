A lot has happened since then, not least of which was his political comeback and triumphant return to the White House. On Friday, hours after he touched down from his whirlwind trip to Asia, Mr. Trump agreed to sit down with us for a wide-ranging conversation. It was exactly one year to the day since he sued Paramount, the parent company of CBS, alleging that 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with his opponent, Kamala Harris. Paramount settled that lawsuit. The settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing. In our nearly 90 minute conversation this past week, we spoke with Mr. Trump about the country and the world. We met with the president at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, on the 31st day of the government shutdown.Norah O'Donnell: We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history.President Donald Trump: Democrats' fault.Norah O'Donnell: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown?President Trump: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, \"Give us an extension, we'll work it out.\" They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, \"Let's vote.\"Senate Democrats say they will vote to reopen the government if Republicans agree to extend subsidies for over 20 million Americans who use Obamacare for their health insurance.President Trump: Obamacare is terrible. It's bad health care at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. Norah O'Donnell: But if ending the government shutdown—President Trump: —they have to let the country open, and I'll sit down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country— and you know what they have to do—Norah O'Donnell: So your plan—President Trump: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of 'em.Norah O'Donnell: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote to end the shutdown.President Trump: Correct, very simple. Norah O'Donnell: And that you will put forward a health care plan? President Trump: No. We will work on fixing the bad health care that we have. Right now, we have terrible health care and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people.Norah O'Donnell: But Mr. President, with all due respect—President Trump: The people are paying—Norah O'Donnell: —you've been talking about fixing the health care since 2015—President Trump: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right.Norah O'Donnell: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it.President Trump: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great health care. That was in 2017, when Senate Republicans failed by one vote to partially repeal Obamacare.President Trump: We can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better health care. And I'd be—Norah O'Donnell: But where is that plan?President Trump: —willing to work with the Democrats—Norah O'Donnell: But where is that plan?President Trump: —on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not-Norah O'Donnell: Can I just—President Trump: —one Republican would ever do that.Norah O'Donnell: My understanding is, if those health care subsidies are not extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people will see their health care premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those—President Trump: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah. Norah O'Donnell: You have helped end these government shutdowns in the past when it came about—President Trump: I did.Norah O'Donnell: And you did it by bringing back—President Trump: I'm very good at it, but I'm not going to do it by—Norah O'Donnell: You brought members of Congress to— President Trump: —I'm not going to do it by extortion—Norah O'Donnell: —to the White House.President Trump: I'm not going to do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The - there's something wrong with these peopleNorah O'Donnell: So then what happens on November 15th—President Trump: Schumer— Schumer is a basket case.Norah O'Donnell: —when the troops don't get a paycheck?President Trump: Schumer is a basket case. And he has nothing to lose. He's become— I just left Japan. He's become a kaz— kamikaze pilot.Norah O'Donnell: Sounds like it's not going to get solved, the shutdown.President Trump: It's going to get solved, yeah. Oh, it's going to get solved.Norah O'Donnell: How?President Trump: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're going to have to vote.Norah O'Donnell: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate? President Trump: I think they have to. And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster.But to do that, he'd need Senate Majority Leader John Thune to change Senate rules.Norah O'Donnell: Did you see John Thune said today they're not going to do that—President Trump: I know John doesn't— well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not going to lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what?Norah O'Donnell: So you think John—President Trump: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point.Norah O'Donnell: He j— he said today he wasn't going to do it.President Trump: Well, that's too bad.So far, the shutdown hasn't spooked the stock market, which hit record highs this past week. President Trump: Perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. We're doing really wellNorah O'Donnell: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President—President Trump: The smart people definitely—Norah O'Donnell: —on that point, though?President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market—President Trump: It does. Oh, it does, it does.Norah O'Donnell: But there have been— grocery prices are up—President Trump: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago.Norah O'Donnell: But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market—President Trump: Sure. But— but—Norah O'Donnell: —they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation—President Trump: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly.Norah O'Donnell: On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is going to hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at—President Trump: Well, no.Norah O'Donnell: —the Supreme Court right now.President Trump: Very close rulings, yeah.Norah O'Donnell: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs?President Trump: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that — and this is millions and millions of people — that we've ever had 401(k)s. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years. Norah O'Donnell: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through more of these topics.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: Immigration. You campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border—President Trump: Did a great job, don't you think?Norah O'Donnell: —and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far?President Trump: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the— by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. Norah O'Donnell: You're OK with those tactics?President Trump: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Norah O'Donnell: Well, you promised in your campaign that you were going to deport the worst of the worst, violent criminals—President Trump: And I know we're doin' that—Norah O'Donnell: —rapists.President Trump: Well, that's what we're doing—Norah O'Donnell: But a lot of the people that your administration has arrested and deported aren't violent criminals. Landscapers, nannies, construction workers—President Trump: Oh, no, no, landscapers who are criminals—Norah O'Donnell: —farmworkers.President Trump: Now, look, look.Norah O'Donnell: The family of U.S. service members—President Trump: I need landscapers and I need farmers more than anybody, OK.Norah O'Donnell: Is it your intent to deport people who do not have a criminal record?President Trump: We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be you came into the country illegally, you're going to go out. However, you've also seen, you're going to go out. We're going to work with you, and you're going to come back into our country legally. Norah O'Donnell: When will you declare mission accomplished on immigration?President Trump: Well, it takes a long time, because, you know, probably I say 25 million people were let into our country. A lotta people say it was 10 million people. But whether it was 10 or— I believe I'm much closer to the right number. Of the 25, many of them should not be here. But we're— we're cleaning up our cities. You know, I campaigned on crime, but I've done a much better job on crime than I thought. You know, the crime numbers are way down, even though we have a lot more people in our country that really shouldn't be here. And many of them are stone-cold hard criminals.The president has ordered the National Guard to five cities: Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Portland, Chicago and Memphis. Norah O'Donnell: This past Tuesday, while speaking to American troops in Japan, you talked about U.S. cities that are having trouble with crime. And you said, \"If we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard.\" What does that mean, send more than the National Guard?President Trump: Well, if you had to send in the Army or if you had to send in the Marines, I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know, you have a thing called the Insurrection Act. You know that, right?Norah O'Donnell: Uh-huhPresident Trump: Do you know that I could use that immediately and no judge can even challenge you on that. But I haven't chosen to do it because I haven't felt we need it. Norah O'Donnell: So you're going to send the military into American cities?President Trump: Well, if I wanted to I could, if I want to use the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act has been used routinely by presidents. And if I needed it, that would mean I could bring in the Army, the Marines, I could bring in whoever I want. But I haven't chosen to use it. I hope you give me credit for that.Norah O'Donnell: I want to ask you about— another matter. James Comey, John Bolton, Letitia James were all recently indicted. There is a pattern to these names. They're all public figures who have publicly denounced you. Is it political retribution?President Trump: You know what? You know who got indicted, the man you're lookin' at. I got indicted, and I was innocent. And here I am, because I was able to beat all of the nonsense that was thrown at me. And yet, when you go after a dirty cop like Comey or a guy like Bolton, who I hear has, I don't know anything about it, I hear he took records all over the place, who knows. Letitia James is a terrible, dishonest person, in my opinion. Norah O'Donnell: Did you instruct the Department of Justice to go after them?President Trump: No, and not in any way, shape or form. No. You don't have to instruct 'em because they were so dirty, they were so crooked, they were so corrupt that the honest people we have, Pam Bondi's doing a very good job. Kash Patel's doing a very good job. The honest people that we have go after 'em automaticallyBut in a Truth Social post from September addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi, President Trump endorsed the idea that former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, were, quote, \"guilty as hell,\" and wrote, quote, \" justice must be served, now!!!.\" Five days later, James Comey was indicted. He pled not guilty — and so did Letitia James and President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton.Norah O'Donnell: Is this retribution on your part?President Trump: No, it's the opposite. I think I've been very mild-mannered. You're looking at a man who was indicted many times, and I had to beat the rap. Otherwise I couldn't have run for president. They tried to get me not to run for president by going after me and by indicting me. So far this year, the president has pardoned or shortened the sentences of more than 1,600 people. The latest pardon was for a cryptocurrency tycoon who is known as C.Z. The company C.Z. founded, Binance, helped boost the profile of the Trump family's crypto firm World Liberty Financial.Norah O'Donnell: He pled guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering laws.President Trump: Right.Norah O'Donnell: The government at the time said that C.Z. had caused \"significant harm to U.S. national security\", essentially by allowing terrorist groups like Hamas to move millions of dollars around. Why did you pardon him?President Trump: OK, are you ready? I don't know who he is. I know he got a four-month sentence or something like that. And I heard it was a Biden witch hunt.Norah O'Donnell: In 2025 his crypto exchange, Binance, helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. And then you pardoned C.Z. How do you address the appearance of pay for play?President Trump: Well, here's the thing, I know nothing about it because I'm too busy doing the other—Norah O'Donnell: But he got a pardon—President Trump: I can only tell you that—Norah O'Donnell: He got a pardon—President Trump: No, I can only tell you this. My sons are into it. I'm glad they are, because it's probably a great industry, crypto. I think it's good. You know, they're running a business, they're not in government.World Liberty Financial has denied any involvement in the pardon.With state and local elections coming up Tuesday, we asked the president about the highly anticipated mayoral race that includes former NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani.Norah O'Donnell: Zohran Mamdani, 34-year-old democratic socialist. He's the front runner—President Trump: Communist, not socialist. Communist. He's far…Norah O'Donnell: Some…President Trump: He's far worse than a socialist.Norah O'Donnell: Some people have compared him to a left-wing version of you, charismatic, breaking the old rules. What do you think about that?President Trump: Well, I think I'm much better looking person than him, right?Norah O'Donnell: What if Mamdani becomes mayor?President Trump: It's going to be hard for me as the president to give a lot of money to New York. Because if you have a communist running New York, all you're doing is wasting the money you're sending there. So I don't know that he's won, and I'm not a fan of Cuomo one way or another, but if it's going to be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I'm going to pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you.When we sat down with President Trump on Friday at Mar-a-Lago, he had just returned from a high-stakes meeting with China's President Xi Jinping, which culminated with a temporary truce in the trade war between the two countries. But before the meeting even began, Mr. Trump made news — as he often does — with a social media post.Norah O'Donnell: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, \"Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons–President Trump: That's right.Norah O'Donnell: —immediately.\"President Trump: Yeah—Norah O'Donnell: What did you mean? President Trump: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. And I think we should do something about denuclearization. And I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but—Norah O'Donnell: So why do we need to test– our nuclear weapons?President Trump: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to— and the reason I'm saying— testing is because Russia announced that they were going to be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I want to be— I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test. Norah O'Donnell: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing—President Trump: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.Norah O'Donnell: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not—President Trump: Well, Russia's— no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons—Norah O'Donnell: So my understanding–President Trump: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it.Norah O'Donnell: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the— delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w— not with nuclear warheads—President Trump: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report— they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do. However, this week the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM — the admiral who would be in charge of nuclear weapons — was asked about this very issue on Capitol Hill. He said neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.Norah O'Donnell: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan?President Trump: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that.Norah O'Donnell: Why not say it—President Trump: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Norah O'Donnell: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, \"He understands,\" why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that—President Trump: Well—President Trump: —I don't want to give away— I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's going to happen if something happens. The other side knows, but— I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's going to happen. And— he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, \"We would never do anything while President Trump is president,\" because they know the consequences.At the top of the agenda for President Trump and President Xi was a one-year trade deal that, for now, averts the escalating tension between the two economic superpowers. Mr. Trump told us that in exchange for lower tariffs, China agreed to sell the U.S. its valuable rare earth minerals – and to resume buying American agricultural products.Norah O'Donnell: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans.President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones, to build submarines.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: What was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiator—President Trump: Well, when you say hurting—Norah O'Donnell: —is President Xi—President Trump: —it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because— I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, \"You know, we have to fight back.\" And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and— and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years. Other countries haven't. They use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have— hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting— maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately. I said, \"Look, if you don't open up, then what we're going to do is we're going to impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying.\" Norah O'Donnell: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China—President Trump: Yep.Norah O'Donnell: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years.President Trump: Sure.Norah O'Donnell: They play the long game, including on our own soil.President Trump: We play the long game too.Norah O'Donnell: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China?President Trump: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And— we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's— I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just— knocking them out– Norah O'Donnell: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping?President Trump: Both tough. Both smart. Both— look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not— they're not walking in saying, \"Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice.\" These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders.Norah O'Donnell: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in Alaska. But there's been—President Trump: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody.Norah O'Donnell: OK. But is— but there's been no ceasefire—President Trump: I think I made— yes, there isn't—Norah O'Donnell: What's— is he ignoring you?President Trump: —because he thinks— because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. Norah O'Donnell: So why won't Putin end this war?President Trump: —that was— but— but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war.As the bloodiest land war in Europe since WWII continues…President Trump: But I brought, just a little list of— look at this, wars. President Trump wanted to make sure we saw the list of eight international conflicts he says he's been able to end since returning to office.Norah O'Donnell: I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president.President Trump: Well, I think I did—Norah O'Donnell: What—President Trump: —pretty good. I— I solved— those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I—Norah O'Donnell: When—President Trump: —you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, \"If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not going to be able to do business with the United—Norah O'Donnell: So why isn't that— why isn't that working with Putin?President Trump: Uhh, it is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of— foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. The commander-in-chief has directed the U.S. military to destroy at least nine vessels in the waters off Venezuela, killing more than three dozen alleged drug smugglers. U.S. lawmakers, including at least four Republicans, have questioned the strikes' legality.In the meantime, F-35 fighter jets, roughly 10,000 U.S. servicemembers, and multiple warships are in the Caribbean.Norah O'Donnell: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela?President Trump: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs— they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons— they emptied their prisons into our company— country. They also— if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums— into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. Norah O'Donnell: But I just want to talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to \"60 Minutes\" as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping—President Trump: Well, I don't think so. Look—Norah O'Donnell: Is it about— let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro? President Trump: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries—Norah O'Donnell: We don't need to blow up boats in order to deal—President Trump: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, OK? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero— think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border. Norah O'Donnell: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered? President Trump: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.Norah O'Donnell: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true?President Trump: I don't tell you that. I mean— I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I— you know, I wouldn't—Norah O'Donnell: Why would we do it?President Trump: —I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But— because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm going to strike.Norah O'Donnell: Let's talk about Israel — you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza.President Trump: I did.Norah O'Donnell: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major—President Trump: It's not fragile. It's a very solid— you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're going to be taken out immediately. They're know that—Norah O'Donnell: How do you get Hamas to disarm?President Trump: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be— they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are going to be tough. Norah O'Donnell: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state?President Trump: Yeah, he's— he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I— I did a great job in pushing— he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that— has never been pushed before, actually. That's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should— you know, we'll— we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair. Um – I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped— you know, I— we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped. President Trump told us he expects to expand the Abraham Accords, the historic agreement struck during Mr. Trump's first term, that normalized relations between Israel and some Arab states.Norah O'Donnell: I wanted to ask you about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House—President Trump: That's right.Norah O'Donnell: —this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that?President Trump: No. I think he's going to join. I— I think— we will have a solution. I don't know if it's going to be two-state. That's going to be up to Israel and other people, and me. But— look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is—Norah O'Donnell: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran—President Trump: Do you want to know— do you want to know— they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you want to know that— the pilots, I invited them to the White House—Norah O'Donnell: I saw that.President Trump: —'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines. Personally I can think of other things I'd rather do. These guys are very brave people. I mean, they're real American heroes. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, \"Sir for 22 years we've been practicing this route… three times a year every year for 22 years, and you were the only president that let us do our job.\" As our time with the president was winding down, we asked him whether he'll try to stay in his job beyond 2028.Norah O'Donnell: There's been a lotta talk about 2028 and who will be at the top of the—President Trump: Yeah.Norah O'Donnell: —Republican ticket. Can you set the record straight? You're not going to try and run for a third term?President Trump: Well I don't even think about it. I will tell you, a lotta people want me to run. But the difference between us and the Democrats is we really do have a strong bench. I don't want to use names, because it's, you know, inappropriate. But it's too early. 3 and ¼ years –Norah O'Donnell: But people do like when you start talking about whether you like J.D. Vance or Secretary Rubio—President Trump: I do like J.D. Vance. I like—Norah O'Donnell: Or secretary—President Trump: —Marco Rubio. I like— I like so many people. We have an unbelievable bench. Norah O'Donnell: Mr. President, can I also ask you, we're now at the end of your first year.President Trump: Yeah. Norah O'Donnell: Of this second term. What do you hope to accomplish in the next three years?President Trump: I hope I can have the same year that we had. Look, we have been acknowledged to have the greatest nine months. You know, it's nine months. The greatest nine months in the history of the presidency. So if I can keep that going I'll be very happy. Produced by Andy Court and Keith Sharman.

Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, FL, and this is a transcript of that conversation. They started by discussing the president's recent meeting with China's President Xi Jinping.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, first of all, we get along great, and we always really have. We had the COVID moment, which was not-- attractive as far as I was concerned. I wasn't so happy. But outside of that, we have always had a great relationship. He's a powerful man. He's a strong man, a very powerful leader.And-- we've always-- had the best of relationships, probably the best of-- I could-- I think I could speak for him, just about as good as it gets from his standpoint and from my standpoint. And having that is important because of the power of the two countries.NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you get out of this deal that you wanted?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I got sort of everything that we wanted. We got-- no rare earth threat. That's gone, completely gone. We have tremendous amounts of-- dollars pouring in-- 'cause we have-- very big tariffs, almost 50%. We never had anything in terms of tariffs, although I put tariffs on China, but Biden let it lapsed by the-- by the fact that he gave exemptions on almost everything, which was just ridiculous.But-- we have-- billions and billions of dollars coming in, and we have a very good relationship. I mean, we have-- a great relationship with a powerful country. And I've always felt if we can make deals that are good, it's better to get along with China than not, if you can't make the right kind of a deal than not, because, you know, China, along with many other countries (they're not alone in this), they've ripped us off from day one.They've ripped us so much. They've taken trillions of dollars out of our country. And now they're-- it's the opposite. I mean, we're doing very well with China, and hopefully they're gonna do very well with us. But I do think it's important that China and the U.S. get along, and we get along very well at the top.NORAH O'DONNELL: This trade war, though, was hurting Americans. I mean, our soybean farmers. China had stopped buying the soybeans.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: As you mentioned, they were-- China was withholding these rare earth materials that you need for everything from smartphones to-- to build submarines.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: What-- what was the crucial thing? I mean, how tough of a negotiatior--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, when you say hurting--NORAH O'DONNELL: --is President Xi--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --it was a temporary hurt. It was a hurt because-- I was takin' in a lot of money from China. We're doing very well against China. And all of a sudden they said, \"You know, we have to fight back.\" And so they used their powers. The power they have is rare earth because of the fact that they've been accumulating it and-- and really taking care of it for a period of 25, 30 years.Other countries haven't. Now we are. I mean, we have tremendous rare earth, and it's going to be-- you know, it's going to be-- it'll be a strength, but it won't really be a strength if everybody has it. Everyone's gonna have it pretty soon.And they were doing it-- on a singular basis. Now-- they use that against us, and we used other things against them. For instance, airplane parts. That's a big deal. They have-- hundreds of Boeing airplanes. We wouldn't give them parts. We were both acting-- maybe a little bit irrationally, but the big thing we had was tariffs ultimately.I said, \"Look, if you don't open up, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna impose a hundred percent tariff over and above what you're already paying.\" And as soon as I said that, they came to the table. We met in South Korea, as you saw, right? A lot of people watched.And-- we made a really good deal. And it was good for them also, I hope. I mean, I want 'em to be good for both sides, but-- we'll be takin' in hundreds of billions of dollars-- in the form of tariffs. You know, tariffs are incredible, because they really give us great national security.As an example-- when they pulled the rare earth on us and the rest of the world, if we didn't have tariffs to fight back, I-- I immediately instituted a 100% tariff over and above what they were already paying. And when I did that, they immediately came to the table. Without tariffs, we would not have had that privilege. We would have-- not have had that right. Tariffs give us national security and great wealth.NORAH O'DONNELL: You talked about those rare earth minerals. Of course--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: --I-- my understanding is about 90% of them come from China. That's their--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right now.NORAH O'DONNELL: Yeah--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But within a short period of time-- we'll have everything we need for ourselves. You know, we've instituted an emergency program, and we will have-- within a year from now to a year and a half, we'll have everything we need, no matter what kind of a threat is being--NORAH O'DONNELL: How? How do we do that?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because we've taken over. First of all, you saw the partnerships w-- we've established with Japan, with Australia, with U.K., w-- with just about everybody, frankly. And we're all doing it together. You know, this wasn't a threat against the United States. This was really a threat against the world. So the w-- whole world has come together, I think, at our behest. And rare earths, in-- within two years, rare earths will cea-- really cease to be a problem.NORAH O'DONNELL: The one thing that China wants but it doesn't have is the world's most advanced semiconductors.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right.NORAH O'DONNELL: That's what the United States has. Will you--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Chips in particular.NORAH O'DONNELL: Chips. That's right--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: Will you allow the chip maker, Nvidia, to sell their most advanced chips to China--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. No, we won't do that. But--NORAH O'DONNELL: It's not on the table at all?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --we will let them-- deal with Nvidia. Nvidia's the prime-- company in the world for that. And we will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced. The most advanced, we will not let anybody have them other than the United States.NORAH O'DONNELL: Because then they would win the AI race.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they wouldn't win it necessarily, but they would certainly have-- an equal advantage. Right now we're winning it because we're producing electricity like never before by allowing the companies to make their own electricity, which was my idea, which nobody, frankly, had thought of.These massive plants that are being built are building their own electric generating plants along with the plant itself. And that gives them all the electric they need without going to an old grid that's, you know, 150 years old. And-- they're makin' it-- themselves, and then they're selling back any excess electricity into the grid, so we benefit in all ways.But most importantly, it allows the c-- the companies to go immediately forward. We're getting-- approvals done in two and three weeks. It used to take 20 years. And we are leading the AI race right now by a lot. We are leading it by numbers that people have no idea. It's been-- it's been really great. We've been very, very far-reaching for it-- th-- look, that's the new internet. That's the new everything all put together. The AI race is a big deal.NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, you just negotiated this one-year trade deal with China--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yep.NORAH O'DONNELL: But as you know, the Chinese, they think in a hundred years.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: They play the long game, including on our own soil.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We play the long game too.NORAH O'DONNELL: Our own intelligence agencies say the Chinese have infiltrated parts of the American power grid and our water systems. They steal American intellectual property and Americans' personal information. They bought American farmland. How big of a threat is China?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them too. Many of the things that you say, we do to them. Look, this is a very competitive world, especially when it comes to China and the U.S. And-- we're always watching them, and they're always watching us. In the meantime, I think we get along very well, and I think it's-- I think we can be bigger, better, and stronger by working with them as opposed to just-- knocking them out--NORAH O'DONNELL: Hmm.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --of the economy. They can produce things that we don't want to produce because it's not really worth our while-- making-- undergarments, makin' this-- you know, certain things. We don't want to do that, and we can buy them inexpensively from other places in the world while we can lead the world in AI, and chips, and lots of other things.Within-- two years from now, we'll have 40% or 50% of the chip market. What's happening here, the biggest companies are leaving Taiwan. They're coming into the United States because of tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs, they wouldn't be doing it because--NORAH O'DONNELL: In how many years? You think we'll be producing--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think in two years, we'll start opening up plants and we'll have a very substantial portion of the chip market. Right now we have almost none. We should have had a hundred percent. If we had par-- if we had presidents that knew anything about business or knew what they were doing, because, frankly, they didn't.We lost 50% of our automobile business. It's all coming back. We lost a hundred percent of the chip-- you know, it used to be all Intel and other companies. And what happened is other countries came in, and they stole our chip business, and we didn't charge tariffs.If we would have charged let's say a 100% tariff, none of those companies would have left. But they all left. Now they're all coming back, Norah, because the only way they avoid the tariffs is to build in our country. If they build in our country, make their plant and make their product in our country, then it's a very simple thing. They-- they don't have any tariff to pay.NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And that's what they want to do. And so instead of charging somebody a 100% tariff and you can make your product outside, they come in, and they make-- and this is why we have $17 trillion being invested in the United States right now. By the time it-- it-- just to show you how big that is, it's the biggest in history by many times. No other country's been any-- seen anything like it.The Biden administration in four years did less than a trillion. We have 17 trillion-- more than $17 trillion right now, and I'm in my ninth month. By the time we finish up, I think we're gonna have over $20 trillion invested in the United States or to be invested in the United States--NORAH O'DONNELL: How will that trickle down to the average worker?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Because of jobs, because they're building plants. W-- we're bringing back the auto industry into our country. We lost 58% of the automobile manufacturing business to other countries. You know, we used to be the king of automobile and automobile manufacturing, and now we're not really the king anymore, you know?Within a year and a half, two years, we're gonna be the king again. We're gonna-- the-- the-- as an example, I was also in Japan, as you know, and South Korea. We had-- the biggest Japanese companies are investing billions of dollars in building auto plants in the United States.If I weren't elected-- if I weren't elected, we would be losing all of these jobs. We would be losing far more of the auto industry. We would be nowhere in chips. Our country would have been bankrupt, and we would have had a bigger welfare roll. They would have expanded welfare and forgotten about everything else.Now we're building a country that's gonna be so strong, I don't know if you saw the last numbers in terms of employment. They're all non-government jobs. Not just government. Government jobs are easy. I could-- I could immediately inc-- do anything I want with government jobs.I'd just say, \"We're gonna add up-- we're gonna add on a million government jobs,\" and you're gonna say, \"Oh, what wonderful numbers.\" They don't mean anything. We are building jobs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. But when all of these plants that are currently under construction and to be under construction, when they open, we're gonna have an economy like our country has never seen before, the strongest economy in the world.We're doing very well. By the way, the stock market just hit-- perfect timing for your show, just hit an all-time high. It's hit an all-time high 48 times during the course of my-- nine-month period. But just yesterday, the stock market hit an all-time high. We're doing really well, and everybody knows it--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's put it this way--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I-- can I ask you--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people know it.NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. Can I ask you, Mr. President--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The smart people definitely--NORAH O'DONNELL: --on that point, though?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: When the stock market is doing well, that doesn't affect everybody. Not everybody's invested in the stock market--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It does. Oh, it does, it does.NORAH O'DONNELL: But there have been-- grocery prices are up--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, 401(k)s. People have 401(k)s. Their 401(k)s are double what they were a year ago.NORAH O'DONNELL: Uh-huh. But for people that don't have 401(k)s, who are not invested in the stock market--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. But-- but--NORAH O'DONNELL: --they've seen their grocery prices go up, inflation--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're wrong. They went up under Biden. Right now they're going down. Other than beef, which we're working on, which we can solve very quickly. So the beef-- the ranchers have really taken a drubbing over a 30-year period. Because of what I've done, the ranchers have done well.But with that, the beef price went up a little bit. We're gonna get the beef price down very quickly. It'll be very nice, just like eggs. When I first took over, eggs were double, triple, quadruple what they were. This was because of Biden.All of these problems were caused by Biden, whether it's-- the people that came into our country through jails. I mean, they were released from jails. They were lease-- released from mental institutions into our country. These problems are caused by Biden. We had an open border. Now we have a border that's, as you know, absolutely shut other than--NORAH O'DONNELL: How--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --people are allowed to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.NORAH O'DONNELL: I do want to talk about immigration and some other-PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: --domestic issues. But just-- if we could stay on China for just a moment--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: One potential flash point with China, probably the potential flash point with China in the coming years, is over the issue of Taiwan. The Chinese military is encroaching on Taiwan's sea lanes, its airspace, its cyberspace. I know you have said that Xi Jinping wouldn't dare move militarily on Taiwan while you're in office. But what if he does? Would you order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You'll find out if it happens. And he understands the answer to that.NORAH O'DONNELL: Why not say it--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This never even came up yesterday, as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that. He never brought it up, because he understands it, and he understands it very well. Taiwan is a very interesting case. It's 69 miles away from China. We're 9,500 miles away. But that doesn't matter. He understands-- what will happen. He and I have spoken about it. But it was never even brought up during a two and a ha-- or two-and-a-half-hour meeting we had yesterday.NORAH O'DONNELL: Do you mind if I ask, when you say, \"He understands,\" why not communicate that publicly to the rest of us? What does he understand that--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I don't want to give away-- I can't give away my secrets. I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens. The other side knows, but-- I'm not somebody that tells you everything because you're askin' me a question. But they understand what's gonna happen. And-- he has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, \"We would never do anything while President Trump is president,\" because they know the consequences.NORAH O'DONNELL: Less than an hour before your meeting with President Xi, you posted on social media that you instructed the, quote, Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right.NORAH O'DONNELL: --immediately.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah--NORAH O'DONNELL: What did you mean?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. Russia's second. China's a very distant third, but they'll be even in five years. You know, they're makin' 'em rapidly, and I think we should do something about denuclearization, which is gonna be some-- and I did actually discuss that with both President Putin and President Xi. Denuclearization's a very big thing. We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot. They have some. They have quite a bit, but--NORAH O'DONNELL: So why do we need to test--NORAH O'DONNELL: --our nuclear weapons?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, because you have to see how they work. You know, you do have to-- and the reason I'm saying-- testing is because Russia announced that they were gonna be doing a test. If you notice, North Korea's testing constantly. Other countries are testing. We're the only country that doesn't test, and I wanna be-- I don't wanna be the only country that doesn't test.We have tremendous nuclear power that was given to us largely because when I was president (and I hated to do it, but you have to do it)-- I rebuilt the military during my first term. My first term was a tremendous success. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country.But my second term is blowing it away. It's blowing it away when you look at the numbers, the stock market, the jobs. Look at the job numbers, how good they've been. And, again, I have costs down. Remember, Biden gave me the worst inflation rate in the history of our country--NORAH O'DONNELL: I-- I w-- definitely want to talk about the economy, but I just want to make s-- sure we-- we button up this issue--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: --on nuclear weapons. And I want to clarify this--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.NORAH O'DONNELL: But the only country that's testing nuclear weapons is North Korea. China and Russia are not--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Russia's-- no, no. Russia's testing nuclear weapons--NORAH O'DONNELL: So my understanding--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And China's testing 'em too. You just don't know about it.NORAH O'DONNELL: That would be certainly very newsworthy. My understanding is what Russia did recently was test essentially the-- delivery systems for nuclear weapons, essentially missiles, which we can do that but w-- not with nuclear warheads-PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are gonna report-- they don't have reporters that gonna be writing about it. We do. No, we're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.NORAH O'DONNELL: Not nuclear weapons, is my understanding--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course they have--NORAH O'DONNELL: North Korea has, but not nuclear weapons--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they don't go and tell you about it. And, you know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They-- they test way under-- underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.You feel a little bit of a vibration. They test and we don't test. We have to test. And Russia did make-- a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China-- and China does test, and we're gonna test also.NORAH O'DONNELL: So we are going to--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Doesn't it sorta make sense? You know, you make-- you make nuclear weapons, and then you don't test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that--NORAH O'DONNELL: Apparently, we don't need to test our nuclear weapons, 'cause they're the best in the world, according to experts I've spoken with--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: According to me. We have the best, and I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period. And I hated to do it, because the destructive capability is something you don't even wanna talk about. But if other people are gonna have 'em, we're gonna have to have 'em.And if we have 'em, we have to test 'em, otherwise you don't really know how they're gonna work. And we don't wanna ever use them. And in the meantime, I've solved eight wars. I knocked out eight wars. I had eight wars-- I brought a little list for you if you'd like to see it-- but I took eight wars and stopped during an eight-month period, during eight months.Before the ninth month I stopped eight wars. The only one I haven't been successful yet in, and-- and that'll happen, is Russia Ukraine, which I thought actually would be the easiest one because I have a very good relationship with President Putin. But-- we are respected again as a country, and that's the way I've been able to stop the wars. I also stopped them because of trade.NORAH O'DONNELL: Who's tougher to deal with, Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Both tough. Both smart. Both-- look, they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. These are people you have to take very serious. They're not-- they're not walking in saying, \"Oh, isn't it a beautiful day? Look how beautiful. The sun is shining, it's so nice.\" These are serious people. These are people that are tough, smart leaders.NORAH O'DONNELL: And on that note, you talk about Ukraine, that being the one war that you are not able to solve. In August, I mean, you rolled out the red carpet for Vladimir Putin in-- Alaska. But there's been--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I roll out the red carpet for everybody.NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. But is-- but there's been no ceasefire--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I made-- yes, there isn't--NORAH O'DONNELL: What'sâis he ignoring you? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --because he thinks-- because I inherited a country where he thinks he's winning. That was a war that would've never happened if I was president. He even said that. That was a war that would've never happened. Joe Biden was the president.Joe Biden gave $350 billion to Ukraine, including a lot of weapons, a tremendous amount of weapons, which allowed them to fight, 'cause we make the best weapons in the world. You know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. They used a lotta those weapons in that war. We make the best weapons in the world. Now we make even better weapons. But that was--NORAH O'DONNELL: So why won't Putin end this war?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that was-- but-- but Norah, that was Joe Biden's war, not my war. I inherited that stupid war. That should not have been a war. That would've never happened if I were president. And by the way, for four years it didn't happen. There was never even a doubt.Then the election was rigged and stolen, and all of a sudden you see them forming up at the line. And now I come back and I'm gonna get that one solved too. But I brought, I mean, just a little list of-- of-- look at this, wars. How many did I solve?Cambodia-- this is Cambodia Thailand. Kosovo Serbia. Congo-- the Congo and Rwanda. Pakistan and India, that was gonna be a beauty. They shot down seven planes. Israel and Iran, you've heard about that one? Egypt and Ethiopia, that's another beauty. Ethiopia built a big-- dam where there's no water going to the Nile. Armenia and Azerbaijan. And if you take a look, Israel and Hamas, which is a, you know, rough little situation, but it's gonna be--NORAH O'DONNELL: I do wanna talk about-- I mean, you have branded yourself the peace president.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think I did--NORAH O'DONNELL: What--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --pretty good. I-- I solved-- those are eight of the nine wars I solved. I--NORAH O'DONNELL: When--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you know how I solved 'em? I said, in many cases, in 60% I said, \"If you don't stop fighting, I'm putting tariffs on both of your countries and you're not gonna be able to do business with the United--\"NORAH O'DONNELL: So why isn't that-- why isn't that working with Putin?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It is working with Putin, I think. I did different with him because we don't do very much business with Russia, for one thing, you know? He's not, like, somebody that buys a lot from us because of-- foolishness. And I think he'd like to be. I think he wants to come in and he wants to trade with us, and he wants to make a lotta money for Russia, and I think that's great. That's what I like--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you get it done in a couple months, do you think?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think we're gonna get it done, yeah. I think he really wants to do business with the U.S. But it did work with India, and it did work with-- Pakistan, and it did work with-- 60% of those countries. I can tell you, if it wasn't for tariffs and trade I wouldn't have been able to make the deals.But I stopped, as an example-- India does a lotta business with us. They were going to war. They were gonna have a nuclear war with Pakistan. The-- Prime Minister of Pakistan stood up the other day and he said, \"If Donald Trump didn't get involved, many millions of people would be dead right now.\" That was a bad war he was ready to start.NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Shot down airplanes all over the place. That really-- that was gonna be a bad war. And I told both of them, I said, \"If you guys don't work out a deal fast, you're not gonna do any business with the United States.\" And they do a lotta business with the United States. And they were both great leaders, and they worked out a deal, and they stopped the war. That would've been a bad war. It would've been a nuclear war.NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanna stay on the issue of foreign policy, and let's turn to our hemisphere. There have been at least eight boats in the Caribbean destroyed by the U.S. military--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Fortunately.NORAH O'DONNELL: And now the U.S.S. Gerald Ford, that is the world's largest aircraft carrier, on the way to the Caribbean. Are we going to war against Venezuela?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly, not only on drugs-- they've dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country that we didn't want, people from prisons-- they emptied their prisons into our compan-- country. They also-- if you take a look, they emptied their mental institutions and their insane asylums-- into the United States of America, 'cause Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country--NORAH O'DONNELL: But why is our aircraft carrier--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let me just finish.NORAH O'DONNELL: --going down there?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden was the worst president in the history of our country. We had the worst inflation, we had the worst of everything. But the worst thing he did was allow millions of people to come into our country that were many-- in many cases, criminals, murderers, 11,888 murderers were let into our country. Venezuela let a lot of those people in. But they were from all over the world. This isn't just Venezuela. They were from all over the world.NORAH O'DONNELL: We are gonna talk about--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And what he did to our country should never be forgotten. He had an open-border process, and people would come in, and I'm not discriminating against tattoos, but people would come in with tattoos all over their faces, and say, \"Come on in, come on in, come on in.\"They let people in that should've never been. Venezuela emptied their prisons into the United States of America. And every one of those boats that you see shot down-- and I agree, it's a terrible thing-- but every one of those boats kills 25,000 Americans. Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.NORAH O'DONNELL: We will talk about immigration in a moment, but I just wanna talk about the scale of the military operation around Venezuela, because it has been described to 60 Minutes as using a blowtorch to cook an egg. Is this about stopping--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't think so. Look--NORAH O'DONNELL: Is it about-- let me ask you, though. Is it about stopping narcotics? Or is this about getting rid of President Maduro?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, this is about many things. This is a country that allowed their prisons to be emptied into our country. To me, that would be almost number one, because we have other countries--NORAH O'DONNELL: Well we don't need to blow up boats in order to deal--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, Mexico has been very bad to us in terms of drugs, okay? Very bad. We have a closed border right now. You probably noticed that for five months in a row, they have zero-- think of this, zero people coming into our country through our southern border.And it was millions of people a year just a little more than a year ago. Millions of people a year walked into our country totally unchecked, unvetted. We had no idea who they were. And we're never gonna let that happen again. That's what made Biden the worst president, because you know what, inflation I've already taken care of. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country, and now we don't have inflation. It's at 2%. It's-- it's the perfect inflation.NORAH O'DONNELL: Aren't--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But what made him so bad-- well, the weaponization of law enforcement, all of that. Look, he was bad in every way. But the worst thing that he did is allow millions, and millions, and millions of people to pour into our country unvetted, unchecked. And they were criminals, they were murderers, they were drug dealers, they were people from jails, and people from mental institutions.NORAH O'DONNELL: You-- you have had success on immigration, I wanna talk about that in a minute. But on Venezuela--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Big success.NORAH O'DONNELL: On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro's days as president numbered?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't tell you that. I mean-- I'm not saying it's true or untrue, but I-- you know, I wouldn't--NORAH O'DONNELL: Why would we do it?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that. But-- because I don't talk to a reporter about whether or not I'm gonna strike. I'm not gonna-- you know, you're a wonderful reporter, you're very talented, but I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.NORAH O'DONNELL: Why do we need an aircraft carrier and all of group--strike group--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gotta be somewhere. It's a big one.NORAH O'DONNELL: I just think it-- it leads to the suggestion that the United States military is planning a larger operation involving Venezuela.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're not gonna allow countries from-- what-- you know, it's countries from all over the world coming in. You know, they come in from the Congo where we just settled that war. But it come-- they come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular-- has been bad. They have gangs-- Tren de Aragua, do you ever hear of it?NORAH O'DONNELL: Of course--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The most vicious gang anywhere in the world. They cut people's hands off if they call up the cops. You know, they call up the police and they said, \"Did you call the police?\" \"Yes, I did. You took my apartment, you live in my building, you took my apartment.\" They cut his hand off.NORAH O'DONNELL: I--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: \"Don't ever call the police again.\"NORAH O'DONNELL: I fully underst--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are animals. Wait a minute. And they came in from Venezuela. Worst gang-- probably the worst gang, most vicious gang in the world. And you know what I did? In Washington, D.C., we had a lot of 'em. We took care of business. They're gone.Washington, D.C., right now is a very safe place, as it should be. Washington, D.C., be-- before I got here was almost like a crime capital of the world. It's the capital of this country. To me, it's the capital of the world. You see the way they treat me.I go to Japan, I go to South Korea, I go to Chi-- any place I go, and you know what I call that? Respect for our country. They didn't treat Biden that way. When Biden went there-- first of all, he hardly went anywhere. Guy couldn't leave his bedroom. But they didn't treat Biden that way. They had no respect for Biden falling up the stairs going to an airplane three times. I mean, this is a man who should've never been president. This was a rigged election. And we--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --have to get back-- we have to get to the bottom of that also, because we don't want that to ever happen again. You see what's going on. We don't ever want that to happen again. Look what happened to our country by having Biden as the president.NORAH O'DONNELL: I--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our country went to hell. And if we--NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about Israel--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --had another couple of years, if Kamala had won the election, our country right now would be finished. It was a dead country, and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. We have the strongest stock market, we have everybody wants to come in. A year ago we were a dead country. Right now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Think of that. And I did that in nine months. And it's only gonna get better.NORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about Israel, as we're on foreign policy and talking about some of your successes. You got-- on Israel, you got the remaining Israeli hostages out of Gaza.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did.NORAH O'DONNELL: You arranged a ceasefire, however fragile that may be. Those are major--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's not fragile. It's a very solid-- you know, I mean, you hear about Hamas, but Hamas could be taken out immediately if they don't behave. They know that. If they don't behave they're gonna be taken out immediately. They know that--NORAH O'DONNELL: How do you get Hamas to disarm?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I want 'em to disarm, I'll get 'em to disarm very quickly. They'll be-- they'll be eliminated. They know that. Don't forget, you said I got the remaining hostages. I got all the hostages out. But I always said the last 10 or 20 are gonna be tough. But we were tough also, and they let 'em all out.NORAH O'DONNELL: You were tough--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And now, by the way, they're getting-- a lot of the bodies are coming out too. Did you know a lot of the parents-- this is very interesting-- were-- the people that lost their child, you know, mostly sons, but sons and daughters, they knew they were dead, in some cases.Do you know that they were as anxious or even more anxious of getting their child out, even though they knew it was a body that we were dealing with, than the people that had a living child-- a living, breathing child that they knew they were alive, if-- if barely, because the way they lived was so horrible.And-- you saw yesterday four more just came out. We're gonna get them out too. They're buried in many cases. They're buried under rubble. But we pretty much know where they were. But I didn't get just the 20 out. I got all of the hostages out.NORAH O'DONNELL: You pushed the Israeli Prime Minister to make this deal, to get a ceasefire, to apologize-- to Qatar. Can you push Bibi Netanyahu to recognize a Palestinian state?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, he's-- he's fine. He's fine. Look, he's a wartime prime minister. I worked very well with him. Yeah, I mean, I had to push him a little bit one way or the other. I think I-- I did a great job in pushing-- he's a very talented guy. He's a guy that-- has never been pushed before, actually.And that's the kind-- that's the kind of person you needed in Israel at the time. It was very important. I don't think they treat him very well. He's under trial for some things, and I don't think they treat him very well. I think it should-- you know, we'll-- we'll be involved in that to help him out a little bit, because I think it's very unfair.But he's a wartime prime minister. I did, I pushed him. I didn't like certain things that he did, and you saw what I did about that. I also stopped-- you know, I-- we knocked the hell out of Iran, and then it was time to stop, and we stopped.Iran wants to make a deal. They don't say that, and they probably shouldn't say-- no good deal maker would. But Iran very much wants to make a deal. The key to Middle East peace-- I made Middle East peace. For 3,000 years they couldn't do it.I did it. And I did it with some very good partners in Israel. But the key to the Middle East peace was knocking the hell out of their potential-- nuclear. When we, with those beautiful B-2 bombers-- we just ordered 20 brand new ones, the newest and the greatest-- but with those beautiful B-2 bombers, when they went in there and they blew the hell out of that, you know, potential nuclear weapons site-- there were two of 'em, actually.And every single missile hit every single air shaft. You know, they had to go down an air shaft. Every single one of 'em hit their target. And I remember fake news CNN said, \"Well, maybe it wasn't as powerful or as good as we thought.\"No, it was much-- turned out it was actually better. You know the Atomic Energy Agency said the hit was even stronger than anyone ever thought possible. And those pilots did a great job. What they were able to do-- and those machines. But it wasn't only them.They were surrounded by F-22s and F-16s. They were surrounded by F-35s. They were-- do you know we had 52 tanker planes, loading 'em up with jet fuel, because it was a long flight. They flied-- they flew for 37 hours. Of course, I flew for thirty-- 42 hours over the last three days, so I know how they feel. But they flew--NORAH O'DONNELL: Except there's a bathroom on Air Force One--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --but they were sitting in one seat. I was-- I was able to walk around a little bit. But yeah, they said 42 hours. I've been in the air for 42 hours over a few days-- and that was fine, because we took in trillions of dollars into our country.And we also-- you know what's interesting, Japan took tremendous advantage of us over the years. You know, they sold cars to us, we couldn't sell cars to them. They made a fortune, we didn't make anything, we lost money. But it's the exact opposite now.But you know what? They like us more now than they used to because they respect us now. They didn't used to respect us, and they have great respect for us, all of 'em. Every country has-- including China. China now has great respect for us.They didn't have respect for us when they had Biden and when they had Obama. Obama was a terrible president. Nobody wants to talk about it because they wanna be politically correct. I don't care. He was a terrible president. Our country was-- it really started a very bad downward spiral. Then I stopped it, then we had a rigged election, and then-- what-- what Biden did to our country should never, ever be forgotten.NORAH O'DONNELL: We're still on-- on foreign policy, so I just have another question--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I'm with-- I'm on all policy.NORAH O'DONNELL: I know you are--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not talking about foreign-- no, no. I'm talking about everything.NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, I just wanna--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm talking about economy, I'm talking about everything--NORAH O'DONNELL: I wanted to ask you about the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is coming to the White House--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right.NORAH O'DONNELL: --this month. He has said they won't join the Abraham Accords without a two-state solution. Do you believe that?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think he's gonna join. I-- I think-- we will have a solution. I don't know if it's gonna be two-state. That's gonna be up to Israel and other people, and me. But-- look, the main thing is you could've never had any kind of a deal if you had a nuclear Iran. And you essentially had a nuclear Iran. And I blasted the hell out of 'em, and no president is--NORAH O'DONNELL: Are you convinced they have no nuclear capability right now in Iran?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do you wanna know-- do you wanna know-- they have no nuclear capability, no. Do you wanna know that-- the pilots, I invited them to the White House--NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --'cause they were very brave. I mean, I wouldn't have wanted to do it, you know, getting in a plane, and they know you're coming, and you're going right into Iran airspace. And, you know, they're very experts, and you're flying in with machines, these big, fantastic, unbelievable, beautiful wings that carry massive 100,000-pound bombs, and you don't-- I personally-- I can think of other things I'd rather do.These guys are very brave people. They're-- they were beautiful-looking people. They were-- they're real-- I mean, they're real American heroes, and I thought they deserved to be invited. And I invited 'em to the White House, the Oval Office, including the mechanics and the people behind the scenes, I invited--NORAH O'DONNELL: I saw that.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a lot of 'em. And they told me something I didn't know. They said, \"Sir, for 22 years we've been practicing this route. Our predecessors,\" obviously, before them-- but \"our predecessors and ourselves, for 22 years we've been practicing this hit, three times a year, every year, for 22 years. And you were the only president that let us do our job.\"I said, \"Let me ask you. Is this a job you wanted to do?\" \"Yes, sir, 'cause it was the right thing.\" These are really brave people. These are really amazing people, and talented people. When you can hit at midnight with no moon, with no vision, every single air shaft, where that bomb went deep into that mountain and exploded and beat the hell out of it, I'll tell you what, they deserve to come to the White House. I gave 'em all a medal. They deserve to come to the White House. And it was a pleasure to meet 'em. These are great people. We have great people in this country.NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, we've talked about foreign policy, now let's focus on issues here at home--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: --some of that you have already mentioned. We are now approaching the longest shutdown in American history.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Democrats' fault.NORAH O'DONNELL: Under your presidency, we're talking about more than a million federal workers who are not getting a paycheck, including our air traffic controllers. You see there's traffic snarls out at the airports now. This weekend food aid for more than 42 million Americans is set to expire. What are you doing as president to end the shutdown?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, what we're doing is we keep voting. I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it. You know, they've never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, \"Give us an extension, we'll work it out.\"They don't wanna give us an extension because they used to think it was good for him, but the polls are turning around because-- not turning around. I just saw a poll where they're down 20-25%. What's happening is the people understand they're losing so much, they call it Trump derangement syndrome. They are losing so much that they don't know what to do. They've lost their way. They've become crazed lunatics. And all they have to do, Norah, is say, \"Let's vote.\" And you can open the-- the economy could open up during our interview--NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do, though--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Maybe it did.NORAH O'DONNELL: Is there something you can do--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All I can do--NORAH O'DONNELL: --to bring this to an end?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is give the facts. Here's what I can't do. I can't give them $1.5 trillion so that they can give welfare to people that came into our country illegally. So that prisoners, and that people from mental institutions, and people that are drug dealers get vast amounts of money for healthcare. That I can't do--NORAH O'DONNELL: So my under--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: What I can do is I can continue to run a great country. We have the best economy we've ever had. I can continue to do that. What they should do-- look, this started a long time ago. I always said-- and you know I've been very consistent-- Obamacare is terrible.It's bad healthcare at far too high a price. We should fix that. We should fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats. All they have to do is let the country open and we'll fix it. But, you know, people are gonna get an 18-19% increase in Obamacare. It was a faulty program, it should've never been approved. But it was approved.NORAH O'DONNELL: So now that we're in--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we fix it it'll be-- one of the greatest achievements. But--NORAH O'DONNELL: But if ending the government shutdown--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --they have to let the country open, and I'll down with the Democrats, and we'll fix it. But they have to let the country-- and you know what they have to do--NORAH O'DONNELL: So your plan--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: All they have to do is raise five hands. We don't need all of ''em.NORAH O'DONNELL: But so you're saying your plan is to tell the Democrats to vote the-- to end the shutdown.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Correct, very simple.NORAH O'DONNELL: And that you will put forward a healthcare plan?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. We will work on fixing the bad healthcare that we have. Right now, we have terrible healthcare and too expensive for the people, not for the government, for the people.NORAH O'DONNELL: But Mr. President, with all due respect--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The people are paying--NORAH O'DONNELL: --you've been talking about fixing the healthcare insurance plan since 2015--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure. And you can't do it because of the Democrats. That's right.NORAH O'DONNELL: Since 2015, you said you'd fix it.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been talking about it for a long time. We almost did it. We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. We were one vote short. And coupla Senators that we currently have made the mistake, and they-- they made a big mistake. John McCain made a mistake, frankly.We were one vote short. We woulda had great healthcare. And I've been saying ever since, \"We can fix it. It's too expen--\" it's got two things. It's too expensive, and it's lousy healthcare. It's too expensive for the people. They're gonna get a very big increase this year. And it's because--NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, they're gonna get an increase if they don't-- if you don't extend the subsidies.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. But the subsidies is part of it. We're supposed to spend trillions of dollars to take care of something that-- that is defective. What I'm saying is, we can make it much less expensive for people and give them much better healthcare. And I'd be--NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --willing to work with the Democrats--NORAH O'DONNELL: But where is that plan?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --on it. The problem is, they want to give money to prisoners, to drug dealers, to all these millions of people that were allowed to come in with an open border from Biden. And nobody can do that. Not--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --one Republican would ever do that.NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I just button that up? Because the extension of these Obamacare subsidies, if they are not extended is that's what the Democrats are pushing for. I know you understand that. Tens of millions of Americans will see their monthly payments double.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. It's going to double--NORAH O'DONNELL: That's a lot.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --anyway. It's gonna double anyway--NORAH O'DONNELL: My understanding is, it's just the...but can I-- may I just-- my understanding is, if those healthcare subsidies are not expan-- extended, premiums will double for many of the people that are on it. And I was looking into it. Three quarters of these people that will see their healthcare premiums double live in states where you won in the last election. I mean, even here in Florida has the highest number of residents on Obamacare in the country. If those--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I'm saying we can fix it, Norah.NORAH O'DONNELL: But if the subsidies are not extended, they're not gonna be able to afford health insurance--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look. It was a defective plan put into line by Barack Hussein Obama, who was a lousy president, not nearly as bad as Biden, by the way, who by the way is building a museum that's, like, four times over budget. It'll never open, built in a neighborhood that-- you know, it's just not gonna work. The neighborhood doesn't even want 'em.NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And it's a disaster. The same guy that did his museum, which is a total catastrophe, came up with a bad healthcare plan. And for the sake of one vote, we would have had, you know, it's so sad thinking back--NORAH O'DONNELL: But how-- I guess the question is-- I hear you.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If we had the vote, that one vote, we would have great healthcare at a much lower cost, and that's what I want. But I don't want to give $1.5 trillion to prisoners and drug dealers and-- and the people that-- that came into our country from mental institutions. What they allowed to come into our country, and we're getting 'em out, but what they allowed to come into our country, Norah, is horrible. So--NORAH O'DONNELL: I just--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --ready?NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We can make it good.NORAH O'DONNELL: I don't want to get into a back-- too much of a back and forth on this--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, but here's all I have to do. Open up the country. Open up the country.NORAH O'DONNELL: You mean, end the shutdown--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We only need five of the-- of their votes. We only need five votes, and already a couple of Democrats, a few Democrats are already voting. They want to open up. And we'll fix all of those problems.NORAH O'DONNELL: You're st--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Those problems are much easier than what I just did with solving all these wars.NORAH O'DONNELL: Last question--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had-- wait a minute, we had nine wars on our planet. I solved eight of 'em. I have one to go, Russia-Ukraine. I thought that was gonna be one of the easier ones but it's not because Putin is tougher than people thought--NORAH O'DONNELL: You have-- you-- you have helped these government shutdowns in the past when it came about--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I did.NORAH O'DONNELL: And you did it by bringing back--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm very good at it, but I'm not gonna do it by--NORAH O'DONNELL: You brought members of Congress to--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --I'm not gonna do it by extortion--NORAH O'DONNELL: --to the White House.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not gonna do it by being extorted by the Democrats who have lost their way. The-- there's something wrong with these people.NORAH O'DONNELL: So then what happens on November 15th--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer-- Schumer is a basket case.NORAH O'DONNELL: --when the troops don't get a paycheck?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Schumer is a basket case. He's gonna be defeated in the next election by a vast number of people. And he has nothing to lose. He's become-- I just left Japan. He's become a kaz-- kamikaze pilot. This guy--NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like-- it sounds like this is not gonna get solved--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --is, this guy is a kamikaze. He would rather see the country fail than have Trump and the Republicans do well. But the people don't want that--NORAH O'DONNELL: It's, I know, I hear you. It sounds like--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So we have a record-setting country right now, and we're not gonna be extorted by a man who's grossly incompetent, who-- who is gonna be defeated by any one of five different candidates. We're not gonna let that happen--NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like this is not gonna get solved.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it?NORAH O'DONNELL: It sounds like it's not gonna get solved, the shutdown.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's gonna get solved, yeah. Oh, it's gonna get solved.NORAH O'DONNELL: How?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll get it solved. Eventually, they're gonna have to vote.NORAH O'DONNELL: You're saying the Democrats will capitulate?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think they have to. I mean, look, I-- I use the word kamikaze, not freely. I don't like to have to use that word. They are kamikazes, but there are gonna be four or five Democrats that come. We need five. They're gonna come and vote.NORAH O'DONNELL: That's--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if they don't vote, that's their problem. Now, I happen to agree to something else. I think we should do the nuclear option. This is a totally different nuclear, by the way. It's called ending the filibuster.NORAH O'DONNELL: Did you see John Thune said today they're not gonna do that--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know John doesn't-- well, John and a few others. But, you know what? The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We're not gonna lose power. The theory is, oh, then we'll do it, but then when they get into power someday they'll do it. That's true. But you know what?NORAH O'DONNELL: So you think John--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're here right now. No, I like John Thune. I think he's terrific, but I disagree with him on this point.NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't-- I don't even know-- actually, I don't even know his attitude on the filibuster, but I think we should do it--NORAH O'DONNELL: He j-- he said today he wasn't gonna do it.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, that's too bad. You know, I mean, I think we're much better off. 'Cause here's the problem. The Democrats will do it in the first week in office. The Democrats, and I told that to John. The de-- and I get along with him great. We've had a great relationship--NORAH O'DONNELL: Yes.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I also know there are other Republicans that feel the other way. And I understand that too, but they're wrong. The Democrats will do it. If they get into power and someday I guess they will. Who knows? It's hard to believe when they have men in women's sports, open borders, open everything, a transgender for everyone. The Democrats will do it in their first day in office, and the only reason they didn't do it is because of Sinema and because of a man named Joe Manchin from West Virginia--NORAH O'DONNELL: Senator Kyrsten Sinema--.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --good man. And they disagreed with it. Now wait. Had they approved it, I think just one of 'em, had they been able to get those votes, you would have had the nuclear option used. You would have had the filibuster ended, and the Democrats would have used it.So I say to the Republicans that want to be, you know, all like, \"Oh, well, we-- you know, we're above all that,\" the Democrats will do it. See, the Republicans have much better policy. We have smart policy. We have great policy. That's how we win. The Democrats are vicious. They're vicious. They have horrible policy, but they are the most vicious human beings on Earth. They are people that weaponize government. They do a lotta bad things. But--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --the good thing is, from our standpoint, from the standpoint of winning is, they have the worst policy of-- it's hard to believe. Think of it. Open borders, men playing in women's sports, transgender for everybody. I mean, I could go point-- these are not 80:20--NORAH O'DONNELL: Can I ask you about the economy--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --these are 99:1 issues. And they don't change. I just watched this morning a show where--NORAH O'DONNELL: Mr. President, can I ask you about the-- the economy--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, just-- just one thing. I watched a show this morning where a very well-known Democrat Congressman was fighting like hell for men playing in women's sports. They don't change it--NORAH O'DONNELL: Who was that?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell. You'll be able to check it. Just check your local TV.NORAH O'DONNELL: Okay. On the economy, the signature part of your economic plan is tariffs. The Supreme Court is gonna hear arguments this week on whether you have the authority to impose these sweeping tariffs without Congressional approval. The lower courts have ruled against you. That's why it's at--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, no.NORAH O'DONNELL: --the Supreme Court right now.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Very close rulings, yeah.NORAH O'DONNELL: What happens to your economic plan if the Supreme Court invalidates your tariffs?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think our country will be immeasurably hurt. I think our economy will go to hell. Look, because of tariffs, we have the highest stock market we've ever had. Because of tariffs, 401(k)s at the highest level that-- and this is millions and millions of people that we've ever had 401(k)s.Because of tariffs, I've ended six of the eight wars that I've ended, and it'll end up being used also for the last war in a different way. Because of tariffs and the economy, but because of tariffs, we have a great economy. Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again. Because of tariffs, tremendously good things happened. Because of tariffs, our country is respected again. Because of tariffs, a president--NORAH O'DONNELL: So what if the Supreme--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --wait a minute. Because of tariffs, President Xi allowed us to win every single point. He bought billions and billions of dollars of-- of our soybeans, of our everyth-- it was the money they're spending. When I came out, did you see what happened with the farmers? They're having rallies for Trump right now because of tariffs.Because it gives us national security. If we didn't have tariffs, and remember this. Tariffs are used against us. Let me talk about that lawsuit. That lawsuit against us was instituted and backed by foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years.They don't want it because they were rippin' us off for years. And if we lose that lawsuit, they'll continue to rip us off and you're not gonna end up with a country. I think it's the most important subject discussed by the Supreme Court in 100 years.If they don't-- if they take away the power of tariffs from us, and it has to be quick and nimble, you can't have Congress, well, hundreds of people have to look. They can't even agree to continue a country. You can't have Congress here. This has to be quick and nimble. As an example--NORAH O'DONNELL: Well, you just-- finish that sentence. You said, \"If they take away my power to do tariffs,\" what?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It would be a very sad day for the United States of America. We're making a lot of money. We're respected again all over the world. We have great national security. Let me give you an example. With China, they were, you know, very strongly threatening us frankly with the rare earths.And then I said, \"Well, if you're gonna play that card, I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on over and above what you're already paying,\" which was 55%, which was very high. A lotta money coming in, tremendous money like we've never seen. \"I'm gonna put a 100% tariff on everything over and above.\"And you know what happened? We got a phone call 20 minutes later. \"We'd like to talk.\" If they take away the right to tariff, if they-- if-- if we're forced to use Congress to approve, they can't approve anything. They would be sitting around for years debating whether or not we should use tariffs. If they take--NORAH O'DONNELL: You want that power. You want that executive power.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You need it to ru-- to protect our country. This is a national secure-- tariffs are national security. If you take away the right to tariff, and remember this.NORAH O'DONNELL: And--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Tariffs have been used against us.NORAH O'DONNELL: Can you just answer that question that tariffs have led to inflation? They have led to an increase in cost of living for most Americans--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They haven't led to inflation. We have no inflation. We have no inflation. Biden had inflation, and he didn't have tariffs. He didn't use tariffs.NORAH O'DONNELL: For the average American--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know why he didn't use 'em? 'Cause he's not smart enough to use 'em.NORAH O'DONNELL: But the companies say they passed on more than 30% of these costs to the American consumer off the tariffs--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay, ready, are you ready?NORAH O'DONNELL: Somebody has to pay for it.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. You have to pay, but we don't have any inflation. Inflation is the que-- is the real test of paying. Everybody said, \"Oh, if you do tariffs, you're gonna have inflation.\" So Biden had the highest inflation in the history of our country by far, okay. No tariffs.I have very modest tariffs compared. Let me tell you. These tariffs ultimately are so good that at some point when they're used properly, and I use them more properly than anybody's ever even dreamt possible, think of it. We become rich. We're taking in trillions of dollars.And I have no inflation. And I have total national security. When I put the 100% tariff on China over and above what they were already paying, which was about 55%, so 155%, they came to the table immediately and they made a deal with us that was a very fair deal. That's called national security. And then I didn't make 'em pay the 100%. That would have been instituted. That would have come to fore on November 1st. Norah, Norah, listen to me--NORAH O'DONNELL: I know our time with you is limited. I hear you.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I didn't have the power of tariff, we would be-- we would be like a subject nation. We'd be subject to everyone else. Everybody uses tariffs on us. If I wasn't allowed to use tariffs on them, we would be a third rate-- we would be a third world nation.NORAH O'DONNELL: I know your time is limited, so I do want to make sure I get through another-- more of these topics.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.NORAH O'DONNELL: Immigration. I mean, you campaigned on immigration. You largely won the election on a promise to close the border--PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did great job, don't you think?NORAH O'DONNELL: --and you succeeded on that. Illegal crossings at the Southern border are at a 55-year low. Want to ask you about this. More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ICE tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows. Have some of these raids gone too far?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the-- by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama. We've been held--NORAH O'DONNELL: You're okay with those tactics?PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, because you have to get the people out. You know, you have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown outta their countries because they were, you know, criminals. Many of them are people from jails and prisons. Many of them are people from frankly mental institutions.

The move follows a meeting earlier this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping — their first face-to-face meet since Trump began his second term — which both sides described as a step toward stabilising economic relations between the world’s two largest economies. According to a White House fact sheet released on Saturday that has been cited by Bloomberg, Beijing will issue general export licences for rare earth elements such as gallium, germanium, graphite, antimony and other critical minerals \"for the benefit of US end users and their suppliers around the world.\" The measure effectively lifts restrictions China had imposed in April 2025 and October 2022, and halts more stringent controls announced in October 2025 for at least one year. Also Read: Trump Rates Xi Jinping 12/10 After Marathon 100-Minute Meeting In South Korea Under the same framework, China will end antitrust and anti-dumping investigations into American semiconductor firms — including Nvidia and Qualcomm — which had faced scrutiny under Chinese regulators, a senior US official confirmed. US Pauses Tariffs In return, the US has agreed to delay several tariffs planned under Trump’s \"reciprocal trade\" policy. Washington will suspend the introduction of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and extend certain Section 301 tariff exemptions, which had been due to expire on November 29, 2025, until November 10, 2026. The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, told Fox News Sunday that while the agreement was a positive development, Washington and its allies should remain cautious. \"This is a problem that has been with us for several decades,\" Mr Bessent said. \"The Chinese have cornered the market, and unfortunately, at times, they’ve proved to be unreliable partners.\" He added that he hoped \"we can depend on them to be more reliable partners\" following the implementation of the accord. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement that Beijing \"stands ready to work with the US to act on the important common understandings between the two presidents, and continuously shorten the list of problems and lengthen the list of cooperation through dialogue and consultation.\" As part of the agreement, China will pause new restrictions on rare-earth magnets — a critical material for electric vehicles and defence technologies — while the US will scale back an expansion of trade curbs targeting Chinese technology companies. China had previously used its dominance in rare earth processing as leverage, threatening to limit supplies to the US and its allies. The deal also includes agricultural and energy measures. China will resume large-scale purchases of US soybeans — 12 million metric tonnes this season and at least 25 million tonnes annually for the next three years. In exchange, the US will halve its tariff on fentanyl-related products from 20% to 10%. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday that the remaining tariff could be lifted entirely if China maintains its crackdown on exports of fentanyl and the chemicals used to produce it. \"As soon as we see that, we’ll get rid of the other 10%,\" he said.

The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017.\n\nThe other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to – to put it delicately – interact with the work.\n\nThe Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.\n\nIn 2019 it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days it had been stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled.\n\nTwo men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.\n\nGalperin is unwilling to speculate on how much “America” could sell for. \n\nHe notes that Cattelan’s duct-taped banana posed questions about “how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.\n\n“‘America’ is in many ways the complete inverse of that.

Kennedy Jr. have stepped forward to support Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, who recently revealed his battle with prostate cancer and that his health is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nAdams, who disclosed his diagnosis in March following a similar announcement by former President Joe Biden, has been approved for a new treatment involving Pluvicto, an FDA-approved drug that he hopes will extend his life.\n\nUnfortunately, Adams has encountered difficulties with his healthcare provider, Kaiser of Northern California, which he claims has failed to schedule his crucial IV appointment, leaving him unable to reschedule.\n\nExpressing his concern, Adams stated, “I am declining fast,” but noted that while Pluvicto is not a cure, it has shown promising results for many patients.\n\nThe 68-year-old cartoonist has turned to social media to seek assistance from Donald Trump, emphasizing his long-standing support for the former president.\n\nAdams shared his plan, saying, “I will ask President Trump if he can get Kaiser of Northern California to respond and schedule it for Monday. That will give me a fighting chance to stick around on this planet a little bit longer.”\n\nThe president has immediately responded, writing to Truth Social on Sunday: ‘On it!’ \n\nKennedy replied to Adams’ tweet himself: ‘Scott. How do I reach you? The President wants to help.’\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff also sprung into action, writing: ‘No need till [sic] wait until Monday – @realDonaldTrump, @RobertKennedyJr, and @DrOz are all tracking now, Scott.’ \n\nAdams has yet to comment further.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the White House for comment. \n\nAdams announced the shock diagnosis in a Rumble stream in March as he said, like Biden, he has prostate cancer ‘that has also spread to my bones.’ \n\nThe comic strip icon heartbreakingly revealed that doctors have told him he does not have long to live, and he ‘expects to be checking out sometime this summer.’ \n\nAdams had kept his cancer battle quiet, and although he did not say when he was diagnosed with the disease, he said he has ‘had it longer than (Biden) has had it.’ \n\n‘Well, longer than he’s admitted to having it,’ he added. \n\nThe quip about when Biden was diagnosed with his stage 4 cancer comes as medical experts quickly questioned how the former president’s condition was able to progress so severely without it being previously detected. \n\nTributes poured in for Adams after he announced his shock cancer diagnosis. \n\nConservative commentator Robby Starbuck urged his followers to ‘lift him up in prayer’ as he shared his surprise at Adams’ short prognosis. \n\n‘Scott Adams is a rare man who impacted so many people that he will never really know the gravity of it,’ he wrote. \n\n‘As he says here, his life expectancy is not likely to go past this summer but I hope it brings (him) some peace to know he’ll live on through those of us he impacted. \n\n‘Everyone please lift him up in prayer and tell him now while he’s alive just how meaningful he’s been to your life. Don’t wait until he passes to do that.’ \n\nAdams’ much-loved ‘Dilbert’ comics have been in circulation since 1989 and frequently pokes fun at office culture.\n\nHowever, in recent years, he’s been taken to task by outraged liberals over his conservative views. \n\nIn 2023, Penguin Random House dropped Adams’s self-help book following a racist rant in which he branded black people a ‘hate group.’\n\nAdams’s new book Reframe Your Brain was set to be published in September by Portfolio — the business imprint of Penguin Random House, but on Monday the embattled cartoonist tweeted: ‘My publisher for non-Dilbert books has canceled my upcoming book and the entire backlist.’\n\n‘My book agent canceled me too,’ he noted.\n\nAdams lamented the loss of his book publisher online, while claiming he still has ‘not seen any disagreement about my point of view.’\n\nHe has previously published books like Loserthink: How Untrained Brains Are Ruining America and How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big.\n\nLater that year, Dilbert was canned by 77 newspapers after its creator Scott Adams started incorporating anti-woke plotlines, including a black character who identifies as white. \n\nAdams is believed to be worth nearly $70million – a fortune he amassed thanks to the popularity of his characters, as well as his non-Dilbert related works. \n\nHis satirical strips feature in newspapers across 57 countries, and in 19 languages – and there are over 20 million Dilbert books and calendars in print.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump and Robert F.

Critics, including some US lawmakers and international legal experts, question the strikes' legality and the lack of transparency regarding the targets and evidence of drug trafficking.

What began with a post by Senator Ted Cruz on X accusing the Nigerian government of anti-Christian violence has escalated into a direct confrontation between the two presidents. President Donald Trump’s administration has designated Nigeria a *‘Country of Particular Concern’* under U.S. religious freedom law, alleging systematic persecution of Christians by Islamist extremists. Within days, he warned that U.S. aid could be halted and said he had instructed the Pentagon to prepare possible military action if Nigeria fails to stop the violence. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu publicly rejected the designation, saying it *‘does not reflect our national reality,’* and stressed that Nigeria protects freedom of worship and remains committed to religious tolerance. This moment requires diplomacy, not bravado, on both sides. Tinubu must engage Trump directly — not out of weakness, but in both nations’ interest.\n\nA Yoruba Lens on Diplomacy\n\nAs an Oyo-born Yoruba man, I draw from a political tradition older than most European monarchies. In the Oyo Empire, the seven Oyo Mèsì — the kingmakers — did not award the throne by simple birthright. They weighed consultation, counsel, and the character and relationships of each prince. They also understood that every ruler carries ‘the good, the bad, and the ugly,’ so the king-elect was subjected to spiritual scrutiny by dedicated Ifá priests to guard against abuses and calamities. The system built checks and balances: if a king became tyrannical, the Oyo Mèsì could compel him to abdicate — even to take his own life. This is a culture of diplomacy, consultation, and accountability — not the blind hereditary absolutism seen elsewhere. Tinubu stands in that lineage. Nigeria does not need a shouting match with Washington. It needs disciplined, structured engagement.\n\nNigeria’s Legacy of Global Diplomacy and Cooperation: Nigeria has a long record of responsible engagement in world affairs. Nigerian troops led West Africa’s ECOMOG missions in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the 1990s. Our forces have served in United Nations peacekeeping, including Darfur and the Congo. Nigeria backed decolonisation across the continent and stood firmly against apartheid in South Africa. More recently, Nigeria has partnered with Western nations on counter-terrorism and maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea. Our ties with the United States are just as deep. Washington recognised Nigeria on our Independence Day in 1960. Programs like PEPFAR and USAID have supported health and governance. The African Growth and Opportunity Act opened U.S. markets to Nigerian exports. And Nigerian professionals in America strengthen the U.S. economy every day. Yet Nigeria now faces Boko Haram, an Islamist insurgency active since 2009 that has murdered both Christians and Muslims, displaced millions, and torn communities apart. Under late President Muhammadu Buhari, the United States — particularly under President Trump — approved the sale of A-29 Super Tucano aircraft to support Nigeria’s fight against these extremists. That cooperation should not end; it should deepen.\n\nThe US role: the moral duty: The United States has clear interests in Nigeria: energy, trade, regional stability, and counter-terrorism. There is also a moral claim. When extremist groups massacre civilians — including Christians — Americans feel an obligation to respond. By naming Nigeria a ‘Country of Particular Concern’ and threatening action, the Trump administration is signaling urgency. Whether one agrees with that framing or not, it cannot be ignored. The roots of Boko Haram are not only Nigerian. The 2011 NATO-led intervention in Libya shattered an already fragile region and flooded the Sahel with weapons and fighters. Even former President Barack Obama later said that failing to plan for ‘the day after’ in Libya was his ‘worst mistake.’ The rise of jihadist networks across West Africa — including Boko Haram — is part of that legacy. The United States therefore has not only a strategic interest but a moral duty to help stabilize the region. But that duty must be carried out with Nigeria, not imposed on Nigeria.\n\nWhat needs to be done – A strategic way forward: President Tinubu must now reopen diplomatic channels. He should immediately appoint a credible ambassador to Washington to restore Nigeria’s voice and give the White House, State Department, Congress, and U.S. religious freedom advocates a direct line. The non-appointment of ambassadors to the Nigerian embassies across the world for the past two years is a Tinubu’s government’s poor understanding of international relations. This is robbing Nigeria of necessary behind-the-scenes diplomatic engagements that would have resolved issues like this before it gets to this level of confrontation. He himself should visit the White House. Such a visit would signal seriousness, mutual respect, and readiness to work through differences at the highest level. Nigeria and the United States should also agree on a disciplined security framework: deeper intelligence-sharing, coordinated pressure on Boko Haram and other violent groups in the Sahel, and honest discussion of where U.S. support can help. Tinubu should make clear that Nigeria seeks partnership, not supervision. At home, just as the Oyo Mèsì sought wisdom before enthroning a king, Tinubu should convene religious leaders, traditional rulers, civil society, and the military to present one Nigerian voice. Nigeria must be able to show U.S. officials real steps: protection of worshippers, prosecution of bandits and insurgents, and measurable progress.\n\nWhy diplomacy now matters\n\nThe Trump administration’s public threat of military action is unprecedented in Nigeria–U.S. relations. An intervention without coordination would be disastrous for both countries. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and its largest economy. It is not a failed state. If the 2011 intervention in Libya unleashed chaos, a heavy-handed approach to Nigeria could produce something far worse. For the United States, bypassing diplomacy would damage decades of partnership, raise dangerous questions about sovereignty, and ignite anti-American anger across Africa. Diplomacy is the only responsible path. But diplomacy is a two-way street. President Trump must choose restraint over escalation. His administration should channel America’s moral voice toward partnership, not punishment — toward cooperation, not coercion. A phone call, a meeting, or a joint envoy on religious freedom would do more for both nations than threats of war.\n\nFor his part, President Tinubu also has an urgent window to show that Nigeria is not defiant for its own sake, but engaged on equal terms. He should appoint an ambassador, go to the White House, and set up a serious Nigeria–U.S. channel on security and religious freedom. If both men act now, Nigeria and America can renew a friendship that has served both nations for decades. The way forward is dialogue, trust, and cooperation — not ultimatums and not invasion. Both nations still have a chance to choose partnership over extremism. God bless Nigeria and the United States.\n\n• Salako, Ph.D., writes from Texas, USA.","summary":"AS a Nigerian American, I believe that the recent altercation between Nigeria and the United States is deeply worrying.

He swears, for the third time, to 'protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'\n\nIf some in the MAGAsphere are to be believed, then this scenario is not only feasible - it's going to happen.\n\nHowever, behind the scenes a vicious war has broken out between the so-called '28ers' - those trying to circumvent the Constitution to keep the president in office - and others who believe there is no route to a third term, and that MAGA can successfully move on without its enigmatic founder at the helm.\n\nNow, it appears there may be a victor in the internecine struggle and, in a blow to the '28ers', the president himself has appeared to publicly accept there is not a path, although he has not quite ruled it out completely.\n\nChief among the '28ers' publicly pushing for a third term has been Steve Bannon, who served as Trump's chief strategist at the start of his first term.\n\nLast month, Bannon lit up the debate when he told The Economist there was a 'plan' and that Trump would be president in 2028.\n\nAlthough he did not reveal details, he did drop one potential hint for how it could happen.\n\n'The only way President Trump wins in 2028 and continues to serve in office is by the will of the American people,' Bannon said. 'And the will of the the American people is what the Constitution embodies, so I believe we'll be in good hands there.'\n\nIt is speculation, of course, but it does raise the question of whether Trump could simply run and win.\n\nIf he did, according to constitutional experts, his opponents would file a lawsuit and it would ultimately be up to the Supreme Court - which has a 6-3 conservative majority - to uphold the 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms.\n\nIn doing so, it could be argued by Trump that the court would be blocking the will of the people as freely expressed at the ballot box.\n\nAnother similar scenario could see Trump run as an independent candidate, leading to a three-way split in the presidential vote and no candidate securing a needed majority of 270 in the Electoral College.\n\nIn that case, it would be up to the House of Representatives to decide the presidency, with each state delegation getting one vote.\n\nAccording to at least one constitutional expert the Daily Mail spoke to, it could be argued that the 22nd Amendment does not apply in such circumstances because Trump would be chosen by the House, rather than 'elected' for a third time.\n\nIn any case, Trump appeared to squash 'third term' chatter last week.\n\nHe did so on Air Force One last Monday, as he himself was squashed between two cabinet members in a doorway somewhere over the Sea of Japan.\n\n'I don't want to talk about that,' he said when a reporter asked about a third term, displaying an unusual reluctance to discuss the subject.\n\n'If you read it [the Constitution], it's pretty clear, I'm not allowed to run. It's too bad,' he said. 'But we have a lot of great people.'\n\nHe then named Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nFor many observers, that appeared to be that. But inside Trump circles, those skeptical of a third term have now brought the knives out for Bannon.\n\n'Trump has lost his patience with Bannon. He's among an irritable group who claim to speak for and to the President more than they actually do,' one source close to Trump claimed. \n\n'Bannon likes people to think of him as the voice of MAGA - but there's only one voice of MAGA: Donald Trump. Talk of 2028 doesn't helping Trump, it only helps Bannon - it means that instead of three more years of airtime, Bannon gets seven more years of attention.' \n\nA source close to Bannon denied those claims as 'totally false.'\n\n'Whoever's saying that just has an agenda against him [Trump], and probably their own selfish agenda for 2028, or the direction of the Republican Party, and wants to move it into a less MAGA place,' the source said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. \n\nNonetheless, this is a prime example of how heated feelings have become on the subject of a third term. \n\nFor those on both sides of the 'Trump 2028' fence, the key question has always been where Trump himself stand.\n\nIndeed, there is one theory that all along the notion was simply a giant exercise in trolling.\n\nAs a political tactic it has served three valuable purposes for the president.\n\nFirst, it has helped stave off the 'lame duck' status that afflicts all second-term presidents.\n\nSecond, it has allowed him to change the national conversation in times when he is being heavily criticized. It has been noticeable how Trump, a master media manipulator, has tended to comment on the subject when he has been being pilloried about something else.\n\nAnd third, it has been a fruitful way of triggering Democratic opponents, which has been a source of much amusement to the president and his coterie.\n\nOn top of that, red 'Trump 2028' hats are selling well too.\n\nAides who believe Trump never had any real intention of seeking a third term point out that he would be aged 86 by the end of it, and that the last thing he wants is to become an aging figure of ridicule like Joe Biden.\n\nBut the pull of the White House is strong and Trump's mind could change the closer he gets to leaving.\n\nIndeed, while flying over the Sea of Japan, Trump left the door slightly ajar.\n\nHe said: 'I would love to do it. I have the best [polling] numbers ever. Am I not ruling it out? You’ll have to tell me.'\n\nThe text of the 22nd Amendment is very clear. It states the following: 'No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.'\n\nIt was ratified in 1951 and was a direct response to Franklin Delano Roosevelt having been elected four times - on the third and fourth occasions during war time.\n\nUntil recently, the likeliest way for Trump to circumvent that was the so-called 'VP route.'\n\nThat would see him run as vice president, with a loyal acolyte at the top of the ticket who would resign the day after the election, allowing Trump to succeed to the presidency.\n\nIt has been argued that the 12th Amendment would still prevent Trump from standing as vice president.\n\nThat amendment says: 'No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice President of the United States.'\n\nBut the 12th Amendment was ratified in 1804, more than a century before the 22nd.\n\nIt could therefore be argued that the 12th Amendment was originally intended simply to ensure for a vice president the same eligibility that was already laid down for a president - that they be a natural-born citizen and at least 35-years-old.\n\nHowever, this week Trump specifically ruled out the 'VP route,' calling it 'too cute' and suggesting voters would not like it.\n\n'It is interesting that he [Bannon] is so confident and Mr Trump is perhaps unusually coy. So I don't know what to make of that,' constitutional expert Professor Bruce Peabody told the Daily Mail.\n\n'We don't know what kind of ships they have, political or otherwise, but surely, there's enough kind of tether there that Bannon is not operating in a total vacuum. He must have some connections to some folks that have Trump's ear, at the very least.\n\n'I guess, whatever else Steve Bannon is thinking, it's useful to have the president with kind of his full political juice flowing. This is a specter hanging over the Republican Party, never mind the Democratic Party, and it makes Mr Trump relevant. That's a smart move. There's some tradition of presidents losing steam in their second term, almost shortly after Inauguration Day, so it would be a smart way to to keep that relevance and tension. I would be surprised if this is the last word we hear on this issue.'\n\nProfessor Peabody said one other potential method could involve changing the Succession Act of 1947, which establishes the order of presidential succession through the Vice President, the House Speaker and the cabinet.\n\n'It's not crazy to say that a Congress might consider revising such a law to include twice elected presidents,' he said. 'Arguably, those individuals have more experience to deal with a crisis.\n\n'You wouldn't have to have an agreement in advance that the president and vice president resign, but you can imagine a scenario where they don't do well, they're not popular, and then they decide to resign, or he's simply on the kind of back burn.'\n\nIf Trump simply ran and won, there would be a possibility to argue before the Supreme Court that the 22nd Amendment was invalid.\n\nThe process for amendments is covered in Article V of the Constitution, which reads: 'The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution.'\n\nIt does not specify whether that is two-thirds of those voting, or two-thirds of all members of Congress.\n\nWhen the Senate passed the proposal for the 22nd Amendment in 1947 it did so 59-23, which was two-thirds of those voting, but not two-thirds of all senators.\n\nHowever, Professor Peabody said that would be unlikely to sway the Supreme Court.\n\n'You could argue it. [But] there's nothing in the Senate rules or the Constitution that stipulates that that number be based on the full membership rather than a quorum.\n\n'The other obvious peril of that line of thinking is it would jeopardize much of the 16 amendments since then, so I don't think that's likely to win.'\n\nOverturning the 22nd Amendment in Congress is widely regarded as impossible because it would require a new amendment backed by two-thirds of the House and Senate, and three quarters of state legislatures.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, himself a constitutional lawyer, said he had spoken about it to Trump.\n\n'I don’t see a way to amend the Constitution, because it takes about 10 years to do that, So, I don’t see the path for that,' he said.\n\n'It’s been a great run but I think the president knows, and he and I have talked about, the constrictions of the Constitution, as much as so many of the American people lament that.'\n\nRegardless, Trump would be far from the first president to take umbrage with the two-term limit.\n\nThe framers did not include a limit in the original Constitution, and Alexander Hamilton and James Madison thought that the President should serve for life.\n\nShortly after the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, President Dwight Eisenhower objected to it, saying the electorate 'ought to be able to choose for its President anybody that it wants, regardless of the number of terms he has served.'\n\nHe even raised the possibility of running as Vice President in 1960, and then reassuming office for a third time himself.\n\nEisenhower said: 'The only thing I know about the presidency the next time is this: I can't run. But someone has raised the question that were I invited, could I constitutionally run for Vice President.'\n\nHe later said the Justice Department had looked into it and concluded it would be 'absolutely legal for me to do so,' although in the end he did not do it.\n\nLater, President Ronald Reagan called the 22nd Amendment 'ridiculous' and suggested it 'interfered with the democratic rights of the people.'\n\nHe said: 'Two times isn't necessarily enough time to get all you want done, done. I still had things to do when I left.'\n\nBill Clinton, who was only 54 when he left office after two terms, in 2001, has said he wanted to run a third time, and believes he would have won.\n\nHe has argued for presidents to only be limited to two consecutive terms, and be allowed to serve further non-consecutive ones.\n\nOne of those convinced that the prospect of Trump seeking a third term is real, is Bill's wife Hillary Clinton.\n\n'Listen to what Trump says,' she said recently. 'He has people right now in these right-wing think tanks trying to figure out how to make it happen. I think you have to take all of it seriously.'\n\nShe went on to suggest that maybe Democrats should go all-in on the idea too.\n\n'The best response might be for Barack [Obama] and Bill to run too. I mean, OK, take your choice. What do you want for a third term, people? If this is where we’re heading, we're going to break the Constitution, give people a choice.","summary":"It's January 20, 2029 and an 82-year-old man, supported by his glamorous decades-younger wife, steps up to take the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15244097/trump-steve-bannon-2028-term.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/02/22/103530781-0-image-a-26_1762121015206.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/29/5070466154193858795/1024x576_MP4_5070466154193858795.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:54:56","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":375127024,"title":"Oil extends gains after OPEC+ pauses Q1 output hikes - TradingView","text":"By Florence Tan\n\n Oil prices climbed in early Asian trade on Monday after OPEC+ decided to hold off production hikes in the first quarter of next year, easing rising fears of a supply glut.\n\nBrent crude futures BRN1! rose 47 cents, or 0.73%, to $65.24 a barrel by 2336 GMT after closing 7 cents higher on Friday.

The company's dominant position in making graphics processing units (GPUs) to power data centers and run high-level artificial intelligence (AI) programs allowed Nvidia to become the biggest company in the world by market cap.\n\nNvidia stock is up 1,390% in the last three years alone. An investment of $10,000 in October 2022 would have given you a balance of $148,800 today. \n\nI expect Nvidia to continue to do well, but it's going to face pressure. Competitor Advanced Micro Devices is pushing to get market share in the GPU market as well. It just signed a deal with OpenAI to provide several generations' worth of GPUs. Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla are all working on in-house chips of their own. And Chinese companies are working on their own chips.\n\nSo, while Nvidia has more than a 90% market share in the GPU market today, that may not be the case for long. But I see another company that I think has a great chance to outperform Nvidia over the next three years. And it's not a Nvidia competitor. It's a partner.\n\nThe company that could outpace Nvidia\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 0.92%) holds a place similar to Nvidia -- it is the leading fabricator for semiconductor chips. Essentially, Nvidia and its competitors design GPUs and other products, and TSMC builds them. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, calls TSMC's fabrication process \"magic.\" \n\nTSMC produced more than 11,800 different products in 2024, using 288 separate processes. Sixty percent of the company's revenue comes from making 3 nanometer (nm) and 5 nm chips, which are essential to semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductor makers, like Nvidia and AMD, value smaller and smaller circuits because the more a company can put on a chip, the more powerful it is. TSMC is one of only a handful of fabricators making 3 nm chips at scale, and it's planning to mass-produce 2 nm chips this year. \n\nStatista reports that TSMC has about 70% of the semiconductor fabrication market today. And the best part? That will likely not change substantially. TSMC makes Nvidia chips, but they also make chips for AMD, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Qualcomm, among others.\n\nSo, no matter what company bites into Nvidia's dominant market share, they will likely be coming to TSMC to fabricate the chips.\n\nTrade issues and other barriers\n\nThere's been a lot of talk this year about trade barriers, tariffs, and other headwinds that can potentially damage the semiconductor market. President Donald Trump, like his predecessor, has been firm on wanting to encourage semiconductor development and fabrication in the U.S. If you remember, it was during the Biden administration that Congress passed the CHIPS act to spur development on U.S. soil. \n\nThat's why its significant that TSMC is diversifying its fabrication locations, investing $165 billion into adding capacity in Arizona where it's currently making Nvidia Blackwell chips. TSMC is building six fabrication plants in the north Phoenix area.\n\nFabricating chips in the U.S. will be important as U.S. companies look for ways to avoid tariffs -- and White House difficulties -- by manufacturing chips on U.S. soil. CEO C.C. Wei said in October the company will continue to invest in Taiwan but would speed up its production expansion and technology upgrades on U.S. soil. \n\nTSMC's dynamic growth bodes well for the next three years.\n\nAnother reason I like TSMC stock: Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue is already on a sharp upswing, holding steady at 36% year-over-year growth.\n\nSource: TSMC. Revenue converted from New Taiwan dollars. \n\nThe company is consistently hitting $10 billion per month in revenue, and issued guidance for the fourth quarter to bring in $32.2 billion to $33.4 billion in revenue, with an operating margin of about 50%. \n\nThose are dynamic numbers -- and I have a lot of confidence that they will continue. So does Wall Street, as TSMC's revenue estimates have steadily risen through the year. Next year's revenue is expected to be more than $147 billion.\n\nTSM Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nIf you're looking for a company that can beat Nvidia for the next three years, look to the company that's making their chips -- as well as their competitors'. That's TSMC.","summary":"Competition could cut into Nvidia's revenue in the next few years.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/02/is-this-the-only-stock-that-will-outperform-nvidia/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/839369/gettyimages-1412860060.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:52:00","author":"Patrick Sanders","authors":["Patrick Sanders"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.04},{"id":375117884,"title":"Trump says US immigration raids ‘haven’t gone far enough’","text":"Aggressive US immigration raids which have sparked protests and allegations of rights violations have not gone far enough, US President Donald Trump said in a CBS interview released on Sunday.\nTrump was interviewed on Friday by CBS’ 60 Minutes programme, his first meeting with the broadcaster since it agreed to a US$16 million settlement with him.\nThe Republican president had sued the Paramount-owned organisation over a 2024 pre-election interview with his Democratic opponent, former vice-president Kamala Harris.\nAsked by interviewer Norah O’Donnell if raids conducted by his US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have “gone too far”, the 79-year-old president replied: “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”\nHe claimed “liberal judges” appointed by Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had “held back” immigration operations, according to the interview extract posted on social media.\n\nO’Donnell noted documented instances of ICE agents tackling suspected immigrants, deploying tear gas in neighbourhoods and smashing open car windows.\n“You’re OK with those tactics?” she asked.\n“Yeah, because you have to get the people out,” Trump said.\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has pushed for a massive wave of deportations, a hallmark of his 2024 presidential campaign.\nProtests sparked by increased ICE raids have caused unrest across the country, particularly in Democratic-led cities where Trump’s administration has launched “surges” of agents.\nTrump has sought to deploy National Guard troops to back up the agents and protect immigration facilities in the cities, sparking lawsuits from local officials claiming he has overstepped his authority.\nHis administration has deployed troops in Los Angeles, while similar efforts in Portland and Chicago have been temporarily blocked by federal courts.","summary":"Aggressive US immigration raids which have sparked protests and allegations of rights violations have not gone far enough, US President Donald Trump said in a CBS interview released on Sunday.\nTrump was interviewed on Friday by CBS’ 60 Minutes programme, his first meeting with the broadcaster since it agreed to a US$16 million settlement with him.\nThe Republican president had sued the Paramount-owned organisation over a 2024 pre-election interview with his Democratic opponent, former...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3331262/trump-says-us-immigration-raids-havent-gone-far-enough","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/03/f4b29cee-5c7a-43b1-ae7f-d317625654d3_8f171693.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:49:39","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":375119688,"title":"Donald Trump is Asked if Zohran Mamdani is Left-Wing Version of Him.

During an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, he also renewed his criticism of Mamdani, describing him as a \"communist\". When asked by anchor Norah O'Donnell about Mamdani's self-declared socialist identity, Trump interrupted to correct her. \"Communist, not a socialist — he's far worse than a socialist,\" he said. Pressed on comparisons that some have drawn between him and Mamdani — describing the New York politician as a \"left-wing version\" of himself — Trump replied: \"Well, I think I'm a much better-looking person.\" The comments come just a day before voters head to the polls for the New York City mayoral election, scheduled for Tuesday, November 4. Trump has been a vocal critic of Mamdani since he defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June. In earlier remarks on his social media platform Truth Social, the president labelled Mamdani a \"100% Communist Lunatic\" and mocked his appearance. \"He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he's not very smart, he's got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him,\" Trump wrote. Zohran Mamdani, the son of Indian-American filmmaker Mira Nair and Ugandan-Indian scholar Mahmood Mamdani, is on track to become the first Muslim mayor in US history if elected. His campaign has highlighted his Muslim identity and has resonated strongly with younger and progressive voters across the city.

Republicans say they won't negotiate until the government is reopened.\n\nWith the two parties at a standstill, the shutdown, now in its 33rd day, appears likely become the longest in history. The previous record was set in 2019, when Mr. Trump demanded that Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nMr. Trump's push on the filibuster could prove a distraction for Mr. Thune and Republican senators who have opted instead to stay the course as the consequences of the shutdown have become more acute, including more missed paychecks for air traffic controllers and other government workers and uncertainty over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme (SNAP).\n\nRepublicans are hoping that at least some Democrats will eventually give them the votes they need as they hold repeated votes on a bill to reopen the government.\n\nDemocrats have held together so far, but some moderates have been in talks with rank-and-file Republicans about potential compromises that could guarantee votes on health care in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans need five additional Democrats to pass their bill.\n\n“We need five with a backbone to say we care more about the lives of the American people than about gaining some political leverage,” Mr. Thune said on the Senate floor as the Senate left Washington for the weekend on Thursday.\n\nVirginia Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said on ABC's “This Week” on Sunday that there is a group of people talking about \"a path to fix the health care debacle” and a commitment from Republicans not to fire more federal workers. But it's still unclear if those talks could produce a meaningful compromise.\n\nThe coming week could also be crucial for Democrats as the open enrollment period for health care marketplaces governed by the Affordable Care Act opened Nov 1 and people are already starting to see spikes in premium costs for the next year, meaning it may be too late to make immediate changes.\n\nDemocrats are also watching the results of gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday.\n\nAs Democrats have pushed Mr. Trump and Republicans to negotiate, Mr. Trump has showed little interest in doing so. He immediately called for an end to the Senate filibuster after a trip to Asia while the government was shut down.\n\nMs. Leavitt said Sunday that the President spoke to both Mr. Thune and Mr. Johnson about the filibuster. But a spokesman for Mr. Thune said on Friday that his position hasn't changed, and Mr. Johnson said on Sunday that Republicans traditionally have resisted calling for an end to the filibuster because it protects them from “the worst impulses of the far-left Democrat Party”.\n\nMr. Trump's call to end it “is a reflection of all of our desperation,” Mr. Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday”.\n\nMr. Trump has spent much of the shutdown mocking Democrats, posting videos of House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in a Mexican sombrero. The White House website has a satirical “My Space” page for Democrats, a parody based on the social media site that was popular in the early 2000s. “We just love playing politics with people's livelihoods,” the page reads.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly said that they need Mr. Trump to weigh in. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said that he hopes the shutdown could end “this week” because Mr. Trump is back in Washington.\n\nRepublicans “can't move on anything without a Trump sign off,” Mr. Warner said on “Face the Nation” on CBS.\n\nThe 35-day shutdown that lasted from December 2018 to January 2019 ended when Mr. Trump retreated from his demands over a border wall. That came amid intensifying delays at the nation's airports and multiple missed paydays for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on “This Week” that there have already been delays at several airports as air traffic controllers aren't getting paid “and it's only going to get worse”.\n\nMany of the workers are “confronted with a decision,” he said. “Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions.” \n\n“I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make,” Mr. Duffy said.\n\nAlso in the crossfire are the 42 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits. The Department of Agriculture planned to withhold $8 billion needed for payments to the food program starting on Saturday until two federal judges ordered the administration to fund it.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Jeffries accused Mr. Trump and Republicans of attempting to “weaponise hunger”.\n\nHe said the administration has managed to find ways for funding other priorities during the shutdown, but is slow-walking pushing out SNAP benefits despite the court orders.\n\n“But somehow they can't find money to make sure that Americans don't go hungry,” Mr. Jeffries said in an appearance on CNN's “State of the Union”.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his own CNN appearance on Sunday, said the administration continues to await direction from the courts.\n\n“The best way for SNAP benefits to get paid is for Democrats — for five Democrats to cross the aisle and reopen the government,” Mr. Bessent said.","summary":"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Sunday that Mr. Trump has spoken to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson as he has publicly and repeatedly pushed for an end to the Senate filibuster","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/shutdown-stalemate-set-to-drag-into-6th-week-as-trump-pushes-republicans-to-change-senate-rules/article70234150.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/7z8r3d/article70234152.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_25134.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:25:16","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":375115838,"title":"Trump says US immigration raids 'haven't gone far enough'","text":"UNITED STATES: Aggressive US immigration raids, which have sparked protests and allegations of rights violations, have not gone far enough, President Donald Trump said in a CBS interview released Sunday (Nov 2).\n\nTrump was interviewed Friday by CBS's \"60 Minutes\" program, his first sit-down with the broadcaster since it agreed to a US$16 million settlement with him.\n\nThe Republican president had sued the Paramount-owned organisation over a 2024 pre-election interview with his Democratic opponent, former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nAsked by interviewer Norah O'Donnell if raids conducted by his Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have \"gone too far\", the 79-year-old president replied: \"I think they haven't gone far enough.\"\n\nHe claimed \"liberal judges\" appointed by Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had \"held back\" immigration operations, according to the interview extract posted on X.\n\nO'Donnell noted documented instances of ICE agents tackling suspected immigrants, deploying tear gas in neighbourhoods and smashing open car windows.\n\n\"You're okay with those tactics?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yeah, because you have to get the people out,\" Trump said.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-president-donald-trump-us-immigration-raids-ice-havent-gone-far-enough-5441176","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--1xQaBp1u--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/Trump_03405.jpg?itok=LCwgrKiK","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:23:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"SG","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":375118876,"title":"Trump says he will not attend Supreme Court's oral tariff arguments - TradingView","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will not attend the Supreme Court's upcoming oral arguments concerning the legality of his global tariffs.\n\nTrump told reporters on Air Force One that he does not \"want to do anything to deflect the importance\" of the decision.

This letter suggested that the emails linked to the laptop were part of a Russian misinformation campaign.\n\nSpeciale shared the intense moment on the social media platform X, stating that it took place on Thursday following a conference.\n\nIn the video, Speciale is seen holding a beer while approaching Brennan to discuss the letter. However, before Speciale could fully express his thoughts, Brennan’s demeanor quickly turned confrontational.\n\n“You misrepresented that,” Brennan asserted, pointing a finger at Speciale’s chest.\n\nHe clarified, “We never called it disinformation; we identified it as Russian influence operations, which is their playbook. There’s a significant difference,” he added, as onlookers stood by, clearly taken aback by the intensity of the exchange.\n\nThe national security consultant then tried to push back, but before he could, Brennan walked away and said: ‘I’m not going to waste my time with you.’ \n\nBrennan’s response went against the exact wording in the letter that stated the former president’s son’s email had ‘all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.’\n\nThe video quickly sparked reaction from online users as many applauded Speciale for getting under the liberal’s skin. \n\n‘Great job Thomas. Boy, you had him pissed,’ one wrote. \n\n‘Well done, sir. Very nicely done,’ said another as someone else chimed in: ‘Brennan falling apart is the best thing I’ve seen today.’ \n\nOthers said that Brennan’s reaction was all the American people needed to see, as one commented: ‘Can you say guilty AF.’\n\n‘The walls are closing in on this criminal,’ another wrote. \n\nBiden’s emails, which were first reported by the New York Post and independently verified by the Daily Mail, were leaked in October 2020.\n\nThey showed that older Biden, who was a presidential candidate at the time, had close ties to his son’s business deals with an energy company in Ukraine. \n\nThe former president then ‘pressured’ government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor that was investigating the company, per the Post. \n\nControversy soon followed the reveal of the emails as national security officials claimed what was on the laptop was Russian disinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDocuments on the laptop, which was originally discovered at a Delaware tech repair shop, showed Hunter was paid a $1 million retainer in 2017 to represent his business partner Patrick Ho, who was being prosecuted by the US government, and that CEFC wired the Biden family a total of $5 million.\n\nOne startling email even indicated the president could have been involved in Hunter’s business dealings with the Chinese. \n\nNearly 9,000 photos from the device also showed the First Son taking drugs and having sex with prostitutes. \n\nThe images were dated between 2008 and 2019. Some have geographic coordinates attached, showing Hunter took photos in Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas, Kosovo, the Dominican Republic, western China, London, Paris, Rome, Belgrade and across the US.\n\nSome of the ex-intelligence officials who signed the memo have since claimed they were actively being paid by the CIA on a contract basis when they signed the letter.\n\nThose officials were stripped of their security clearances in March by President Trump. \n\nAccording to a report, high-ranking CIA officials were made aware of the letter before its publishing and some raised concerns about the political nature of the letter.\n\nBiden also claimed there was an effort to ‘break Hunter’ and destroy what he said was five-and-a-half years of sobriety. \n\nJust last month the House Judiciary Committee referred Brennan for criminal prosecution for making ‘numerous willfully and intentionally false statements’ to Congress.\n\nAccording to the committee, Brennan lied on several occasions when testifying in May 2023. \n\nJim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, claims Brennan misled lawmakers about the infamous Steele dossier — a series of controversial and largely unverified memos by former British spy Christopher Steele that accused Donald Trump of colluding with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nThe dossier, funded by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee via Washington research firm Fusion GPS, alleged ties between Trump’s campaign and Russian operatives, including salacious blackmail claims, sparking significant controversy.\n\nThe referral to the DOJ does not mean that Brennan has been charged with any crime. He has not yet commented on the development.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJohn Brennan, the former director of the CIA, was recently seen in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ex-CIA Director Criticizes Handling of Hunter Biden Laptop Issue first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/ex-cia-director-criticizes-handling-of-hunter-biden-laptop-issue/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Former-CIA-director-lashes-out-about-Hunter-Bidens-laptop.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:10:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":375118488,"title":"President Trump slams “Late Night”'s Seth Meyers, says host mocking him on show is 'probably illegal'","text":"President Donald Trump has set his sights on another late night host after trying and failing to drive Jimmy Kimmel off the air.\n\n The 45th and now 47th president of the United States spent Saturday issuing various proclamations and provocations from his page on Truth Social, the X alternative Trump founded in 2021. Alongside Democratic Congressional representative Ilhan Omar, the Democratic party itself, and the government of Nigeria, Trump singled out Seth Meyers for criticism.\n\n \"Seth Meyers of NBC may be the least talented person to 'perform' live in the history of television. In fact, he may be the WORST to perform, live or otherwise,\" Trump began his post, incorrectly stating that the pre-taped Late Night with Seth Meyers is regularly broadcast live.\n\n Trump continued, \"I watched his show the other night for the first time in years.

Coyote.\"\n\n Trump's retaliative criticism of Meyers carries more weight in light of the hammer his administration recently brought down on Meyers' late-night colleague Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n The president celebrated when CBS canceled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in July, promising action against Jimmy Kimmel Live! that he shortly made good on.\n\n Following a comment about the Republican response to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September, ABC pulled Live! from the airwaves for six days after immediate backlash from affiliate groups like Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcasting Group.\n\n The suspension was advocated by Trump's FCC chair, Brendan Carr, and celebrated again by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social at the time, \"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible.\"\n\n Jimmy Kimmel Live! is currently back on the air and enjoyed a decade-high ratings spike after the suspension.","summary":"The president took particular issue with Meyers' criticism of his support for steam catapults on aircraft carriers in a recent segment.","url":"https://ew.com/trump-slams-seth-meyers-says-host-mocking-him-is-probably-illegal-11841830","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/zMkHy_ysnXnLBdlQQ27YKuP3_oo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Donald-Trump-Seth-Meyers-110225-3c724eb218f0462e8de7e626d2948991.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 23:05:47","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.214},{"id":375113088,"title":"Donald Trump warns Xi of \"consequences\" if China invades Taiwan","text":"Washington [US], November 3 (ANI): US President Donald Trump said that China “knows the consequences” if it attacks Taiwan, asserting that Chinese President Xi Jinping understands the situation “very well.”Trump made the remarks in an interview with CBS following his meeting with Xi.Trump said, “You’ll find out if it happens, and he understands the answer to that. This never even came up yesterday as a subject. He never brought it up. People were a little surprised that he never brought it up because he understands it, and he understands it very well.”Trump declined to reveal his strategy on a potential Taiwan conflict and insisted China “understands what will happen” if it attempts any aggression. He added, “I can’t give away my secrets. I don’t want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what’s going to happen if something happens. The other side knows, but I’m not somebody that tells you everything because you’re asking me a question, but they understand what’s going to happen.”Trump said Chinese officials avoided acting against Taiwan during his presidency claiming they knew the “consequences.”Trump further stated, “He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, we would never do anything while President Trump is president because they know the consequences.”US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth expressed grave concern over China’s growing military assertiveness around Taiwan and in the South China Sea during his first face-to-face meeting with China’s Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun in Malaysia on October 31.The meeting, held alongside a summit of Southeast Asian defence chiefs, followed a day after Trump’s talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, as reported by The Epoch Times.According to The Epoch Times, Hegseth stated on X that he underscored the “importance of maintaining a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific,” emphasising America’s concerns about China’s increasing activities that threaten Taiwan and regional allies.The Pentagon chief reiterated that while Washington does not seek confrontation, it “will continue to firmly defend its interests” and maintain sufficient military presence to ensure regional stability.During the meeting, Admiral Dong Jun repeated the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) long-held position on Taiwan, demanding that the United States act “cautiously” on issues related to the island. He urged Washington to adopt a stance that “firmly opposes Taiwan independence.”Although the CCP has never governed Taiwan, it continues to claim the self-ruled democracy as part of its territory and has not ruled out using military force to seize control.Over recent years, China has intensified its coercive tactics, conducting extensive military drills, sending warplanes near Taiwan’s airspace almost daily, and heightening fears of a possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, as highlighted by The Epoch Times.US intelligence assessments indicate that Xi Jinping has directed the Chinese military to prepare for a potential invasion by 2027.During his visit to Tokyo earlier this week, Hegseth warned that Beijing’s rapid military build-up represents a “real and urgent threat” to the Indo-Pacific.Praising Japan’s decision to strengthen its defence capabilities, he emphasised that the US-Japan alliance remains essential to deterring Chinese aggression and safeguarding peace across the region, as reported by The Epoch Times.

Vice President J.D. Vance said it was important to ensure that “this nuclear arsenal we have actually functions properly.” The US stopped conducting nuclear explosions in 1992 under a Congress-mandated moratorium.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Thursday that resuming nuclear tests could take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

But Jost's comments about the event sparked controversy.\n\n\"My favorite part, though, was when Trump and Melania made a grand entrance to this song, Michael Jackson's 'Thriller,'\" Jost said during Weekend Update. \"Just the perfect soundtrack to lure kids to a famous mansion,\" he added, referencing Jackson's Neverland Ranch, where the pop star faced long-standing accusations of child sexual abuse.\n\nJackson, who died in 2009, always maintained his innocence and was acquitted of all charges in 2005.\n\nJost continued to mock Trump's interactions with children at the event. \"President Trump and the first lady hosted a trick-or-treat event at what's left of the White House,\" he joked, echoing earlier SNL skits about Trump's supposed remodeling projects. \"This is one of my favorite things that the president does because it is so clear that he never trick-or-treated once in his life.\"SNL SegmentThe comedian aired a clip showing Trump playfully greeting a child dressed as DJ Marshmello before once again placing a candy bar on their head — a callback to his identical 2019 stunt involving a kid dressed as a Minion from Despicable Me.\n\n\"Just put it in the bag!

Even the kid is like, 'This is not right,'\" Jost quipped. \"It's kind of an embodiment of his entire presidency — just a violation of norms that no other president or person has ever conceived of.

Many waited more than an hour to drop off bags of groceries, and some offered up extra space in their vehicles so others could leave the line early while still donating.\n\nTwo dozen locations had already been picked — pantries, schools, parishes, free fridges and others across Niles, Skokie, Evanston and the Rogers Park neighborhood — but they were starting to fill, so other organizations were contacted to arrange pick-up. More than 100 people had also arrived in search of resources, and they left with bags of fresh produce, eggs and more.\n\n“This is beyond anyone’s wildest imagination in the best possible way,” Kahan said. “It’s overwhelmingly amazing, and we just want to make sure we get food to people who need it the most.”\n\nSince Saturday, nearly 2 million Illinois residents — 42 million nationwide — have been without Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits as the government shutdown continues, though two federal judges separately ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must pay for November’s SNAP benefits using contingency funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has until Monday to decide whether it will fully or partially fund the food assistance program. President Donald Trump said he would but wanted more legal direction from the court, which won’t happen until Monday, so it wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that SNAP recipients use to buy groceries could be reloaded, as it can take as long as 14 days.\n\nThe supply drive came as federal immigration agents continued to loom over Chicago-area residents through the Halloween weekend, detaining at least five people on Friday as they fired pepper balls and tackled people to the ground in several North Side neighborhoods and suburbs, including Evanston. \n\n“Coming together is the solution always, and after having our community completely traumatized, this is extremely healing work to be doing, and we’re not only healing ourselves, but feeding our community,” Kahan said.\n\nEvanston residents Valerie Cronkhite and her husband Travis arrived with a wagon full of “baby stuff” and their daughter Cora, though they soon found themselves volunteering as donors were recruited to help handle an ever-increasing haul of supplies.\n\nThey had just come from the local Valli Produce where they said shelves were quickly emptying as people cleared them to make donations. “Evanston always shows up,” she said, but this was “insane.”\n\nThey had been at a Saturday night vigil put on by the city in the wake of federal agents and helicopters descending on the community, as videos circulated of agents punching a handcuffed man in the head and threatening to arrest a woman in her car.\n\n“This is a small, small way to help. There’s a lot more we can do,” Valerie Cronkhite said. “There’s so many battles we’re fighting right now. … The reality is this is gonna be a long fight, and we all need to be in it.”\n\nFood assistance was the main draw, but the event overall served to build community and continue to expand mutual-aid networks throughout the city and suburbs. Know-your-rights cards and whistles were being passed out along with food and toiletries.\n\nMariah Fouche, a Niles resident who grew up in Rogers Park, got in touch with the organizers through rapid response networks working near her Logan Square shop Monarch Thrift Store, which has also been taking in food donations for Chicago Hope Food Pantry, as well as others nearby. Despite it being her day off, and having worked for other supply drives in recent days, she showed up to help the community she grew up in and to meet others who were doing the same work.\n\n“It isn’t strenuous to me,” Fouche said. “This is joy.”\n\nShe suggested involving one’s kids and friends in mutual-aid events going forward as a social way to get people involved.\n\n“Whether it’s your neighbor being abducted or your neighbor that doesn’t have access to food, it’s still going to impact your community, but people showing up here keeps us safe,” Fouche said. “There’s mutual-aid events like this going every weekend going forward. There’s no reason anyone should be bored right now. … We need to stand up and do what we can for each other because no one is coming to save us.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/11/02/chicago-snap-evanston-food-drive","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e888379/2147483647/strip/false/crop/8192x5464+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F33%2Faa%2F385817ab4fdbb51bd6a13bd77df0%2Fevfoo","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 22:39:02","author":"Violet Miller","authors":["Violet Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":375110412,"title":"Indicators Point to Possible Imminent Financial Downturn in America","text":"Across the United States, warning indicators are emerging throughout the economy, placing increased strain on everyday Americans.\n\nIn just the past week, significant layoffs have swept through major corporations such as Amazon, UPS, and General Motors, impacting tens of thousands of workers.\n\nIn Las Vegas, a leading casino and resort operator, known for managing hotels like Caesars Palace, disclosed that 90,000 hotel rooms remained unoccupied this summer as Americans avoided costly vacations.\n\nAdding to the economic concerns, the price of gold, which had soared to record levels earlier in October, is now experiencing a sharp decline. Analysts are cautioning about a potential ‘mini-bust’ looming on the horizon.\n\nFurther compounding these issues, recent data indicates that 15 percent of homebuying contracts were canceled in September, stoking fears of a real estate crash reminiscent of 2008.\n\nAmidst these troubling signs, the stock market is reaching all-time highs, while major technology firms and big banks are reporting robust earnings, painting a complex picture of the current economic landscape.\n\nBut experts are warning that we are seeing a ‘K-shaped’ economy — so called because, like the letter K, some people and industries shoot upwards while others fall behind.\n\nHere, the Daily Mail breaks down the signs that the US economy is careering towards a downturn. \n\nThe US job market has slowed to its weakest pace since the pandemic-era recovery, with billion-dollar corporations like Meta, Amazon, Walmart and Microsoft cutting staff, freezing hires or automating away roles altogether.\n\nNow, roughly 7.4 million Americans are unemployed, according to the most recent federal jobs numbers.\n\nBut there are several reasons for the job losses. \n\nCompanies are slashing back after over-hiring following the pandemic and firms are increasingly turning to Artificial Intelligence to replace workers. Interest rates also remain elevated, making investment in workers more expensive. \n\nIn particular, these job cuts are hurting tech workers at the start of their careers, analysts told the Daily Mail.\n\nLaura Gassner Otting, a former non-profit CEO and White House advisor, called the lack of beginner tech roles a ‘vanishing first rung.’\n\n‘AI and automation are eliminating many entry-level roles,’ she said. ‘For young professionals, it means being locked out before they can even prove themselves.’\n\nWomen, she noted, have been the hardest hit by the hiring changes, slowing down their promotion prospects and earnings potential.\n\nChelsea Walker, a 42-year-old HR specialist, has been out of a job for over a year after being laid off from TikTok and has applied for over 1,000 roles.\n\n‘I am not in control of my future,’ she told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘My home is at stake right now, and my prospects are extremely thin. I worry day and night about what I am getting ready to lose.’ \n\nMeanwhile, Americans are struggling to keep up with ballooning car payments.\n\nSince 2019, the average price to drive a new set of wheels off a car lot has risen 30 percent to $50,000. To finance cars, American shoppers are putting an average of $6,000 down, spending more than $750 a month, and financing at interest rates above six percent.\n\nAdditionally, drivers owe $1.66 trillion in auto loans, the second-largest debt load in the American economy after housing mortgages.\n\n‘Families are in an economic pressure cooker,’ said Erin Witte, the director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America.\n\n‘It looks alarmingly similar to trends that were apparent before the Great Recession.’\n\nLast year, a record number of vehicle owners fell into delinquency, defaulted or had their cars repossessed. 1.73 million cars were seized in 2024. That number is expected to rise this year, with September seeing a 16 percent increase in repossessions over 2024.\n\nAnd independent analysts do not see a cheap car savior on the horizon for 2026.\n\n‘2026 is one of the more uncertain years to forecast I’ve seen,’ Ed Whiston, an automotive analyst at Morningstar, told the Daily Mail.\n\nHe said some buyers could return to dealerships if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, but tariffs will likely keep prices elevated, locking out many middle- and working-class consumers.\n\n‘Maybe those cancel each other out, maybe consumers really freak out and things collapse,’ he added. ‘It’s really hard to say for sure.’\n\nBig tech and artificial intelligence stocks are seeing a stratospheric rise, even as the rest of the market remains fairly flat. \n\nLast week, chip maker Nvidia became the first company in history to hit $5 trillion in value — up more than 50 percent in a year. \n\nBut experts are warning that this huge boom could lead to a monumental bust, with devastating consequences for the US economy.\n\nSome have compared AI stock gain to the dot-com bubble, when internet-based companies saw a huge growth in the late 1990s before crashing in the early 2000s. \n\n‘We think the risk of a downturn in the tech sector is lower than at the height of the 2000 dotcom bubble, but it’s far from negligible,’ said Oxford Economics lead economist Adam Slater.\n\n‘A particular concern is that the predictions of very large and sustained productivity gains from AI may not materialize.’\n\nHowever Wall Street legend Steve Eisman told the Daily Mail there is a key difference between the market now and then.\n\nThe investor, who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash, said that in the 1990s very young companies that had no revenue were spending borrowed money. \n\n‘They overspent and the returns weren’t there, and many of them went bankrupt. And then those that survived eventually thrived.’\n\nThis time around, is ‘healthy,’ Eisman said, as the money being spent on AI is being spent out of companies’ cash flow.\n\nFor centuries, gold has shone brightest in dark times — a refuge when paper money weakens and faith in governments falters. \n\nIt spiked after the oil shocks of the 1970s, again during the 2008 financial crash, and once more in 2020 as markets panicked about Covid. That history is why its recent rollercoaster run has economists worried.\n\nAfter soaring to an all-time high above $4,350 an ounce on October 20, gold prices suffered a spectacular crash the next day, tumbling nearly six percent in their biggest one-day drop since 2013.\n\nIt was a brutal end to one of the most frenzied rallies in years. The precious metal had surged more than 50 percent in 2025, driven by fears over inflation, political gridlock and global instability.\n\nBut the rally is not over. After dipping below the significant $4,000 milestone last week, it rebounded. \n\nEven ordinary Americans joined in — snapping up mini-bars at Costco and trading gold on apps that once catered to meme-stock mania.\n\nBut as Wall Street’s major indexes hit record highs, the picture has become confusing. In normal times, gold spikes when everything else is falling. Today, it is rising — and falling — alongside booming tech stocks and record corporate profits.\n\n‘Gold is flashing a warning that fear is still lurking beneath the surface,’ said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation. ‘Investors are hedging against a downturn even as the stock market pretends nothing’s wrong.’\n\nWhatever comes next, the gold rush of 2025 is more than just a trading story. It is a mood indicator — proof that while America’s markets may look unstoppable, many investors are quietly preparing for the storm they suspect is coming. \n\nRetirement and 401(k)s\n\nThere are two distinct narratives when it comes to how much Americans are saving for retirement, experts warn.\n\n‘The retirement prospects for those who are employed have likely improved over the last few years,’ Robert Brokamp, senior retirement advisor at the Motley Fool, told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘The S&P 500 has returned almost 23 percent per year since October of 2022, and 401(k) participation and contribution rates are at all-time highs.’\n\nBut this is an example of the K-shaped economy, he said. \n\n‘Some people’s net worths are skyrocketing, while others are seeing their prospects plummet.’\n\nMore people are also taking hardship withdrawals and emergency loans from their 401(k) accounts as they grow increasingly desperate – meaning they are taking money out of their retirement plan for an ‘immediate and heavy financial need.’ This is usually not recommended unless it is crucial, as it cuts down on the amount of money that is able to grow with interest in the account over time.\n\nAccording to a survey of small business leaders by retirement plan provider Human Interest, in July, 24 percent said they had seen an increase in 401(k) loan requests and withdrawals. \n\nAn unofficial yet heartbreakingly reliable indicator of an impending recession is a spike in owners giving up their pets.\n\nWhen the economy worsens — with higher living costs, inflation or job losses — pet owners increasingly find themselves unable to afford food, veterinary care or housing that allows pets. As a result, more people surrender or abandon their animals.\n\n‘We’re seeing surrender rates at very high levels. In measurable terms, shelter inventory capacity has increased five to ten percent over the past year,’ Ryan Howard, founder and CEO of AI pet adoption network Buddy, told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘Many rescues are at or over capacity, and in kill states like Texas, euthanasia rates are at record highs.’\n\nShelters and rescues track intake volumes closely. Rising shelter inventories — such as the increase reported over the past year — correlate strongly with broader economic stress. These surges mirror patterns seen during past downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nPet abandonment and euthanasia rates are highest in lower-income, rural regions, where economic vulnerability is greater. Urban areas with better-funded animal control systems show less strain, even during downturns.\n\n‘We’re seeing it everywhere, but it’s worse in rural areas where incomes are lower,’ said Howard.\n\nWhen people can no longer afford to care for their pets — often among their most emotionally valued family members — it’s a strong sign that household finances, and the broader economy, are under pressure.\n\nCredit cards\n\nCredit card balances are ballooning, with total credit card balances at $1.09 trillion, according to TransUnion, and average debt per borrower is at a record $6,473.\n\nThose figures are up 33 percent and 23 percent, respectively, over the past three years. \n\n‘That sounds very negative, but it’s not all bad,’ said Ted Rossman, senior analyst at Bankrate. \n\n‘The household debt-to-income ratio is pretty low on a historical basis. Honestly, we would expect credit card balances to grow over time (at least in the aggregate) because people are using more cards and less cash.’\n\nThe population is also growing, the economy is growing and payments are becoming more digital, he said. \n\n‘Of course, there’s a huge difference between someone who’s using credit cards for rewards and convenience versus someone who’s truly carrying debt — and paying interest — from month to month.’\n\nAccording to Rossman, about half of credit cardholders pay bills in full each month and about half carry debt from month to month.\n\nCredit scores \n\nMeanwhile, the average American’s credit score has also taken its biggest hit this year in decades. \n\nThe average FICO score in the US has dropped to 715 from 717 — the largest one-year drop since the Great Recession, according to data from the credit-rating giant. \n\nThe drop may sound insignificant, but experts warn that it is a red flag for the state of the economy. \n\nMeanwhile, missed federal student loan payments are now being reported on credit files after being paused during the pandemic.\n\n‘This is really driving the increase in severe delinquencies,’ Tommy Lee, senior director of scores and predictive analytics at FICO, said.\n\nLow credit scores make it difficult for people to qualify for financial products, including credit cards and mortgages. \n\nRossman said that a relatively low unemployment rate and relatively strong wage growth are helping Americans’ finances, but many people are being left behind. \n\n‘Sadly, many are struggling, although those individual struggles are masked in the overall data by the fact that many others are doing quite well,’ he told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘This relates to broader themes like income inequality and the K-shaped economy, which is when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.’\n\nForeclosures \n\nThe real estate market is also flashing warning signs that an economic crash is coming. \n\nForeclosures are a sign of economic trouble that is worsening, and from 2024 to 2025 there has been a dramatic rise in foreclosure filings across the US.\n\nIn July through September 2025 alone there were a total of 101,513 properties with foreclosure filings, a 17 percent jump from the same period in 2024.\n\nForeclosure is when a bank or lender takes back a home because the owner has fallen behind on their required mortgage payments.\n\nFlorida-based realtor Jeff Lichtenstein blamed President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which he said have made everything more expensive and have ‘become the consumer’s problem.’\n\n‘Because of the tariffs, the middle class and upper middle class are feeling the pinch too. With the cost of goods out there, many people are now underwater and can’t pay the mortgage,’ he told the Daily Mail. \n\nCanceled contracts \n\nBuyers are also increasingly pulling out of deals at the last minute. \n\nIn September, 15 percent of buyers cancelled agreements, according to a report from Redfin. That is the equivalent of just over 53,000 agreements nationwide that were abruptly pulled as prospective buyers got jitters or panicked that a recession could be on the horizon. \n\nThere is also a huge surplus of homes on the market, so buyers are using that imbalance to wield more negotiating leverage. They are asking for massive price cuts and other concessions such as repairs being paid for by sellers.\n\n‘I’m seeing a lot of buyer’s remorse,’ said Jo Chavez, a Redfin Premier agent in Kansas City. \n\n‘Buyers make an offer, then they start worrying they could have found a better deal or a better home because there are more home sellers than buyers in the market. \n\n‘Some other buyers are backing out because they’re concerned about job security.’\n\nListings flooding the market \n\nStreets lined with for sale signs are another indicator of economic troubles across the US.\n\nThere is a huge influx of homes on the market, many of which are simply not selling. In fact, homes are lingering on the market longer in 44 out of 50 major US metros, according to Realtor.com analysis. \n\nThe average home spent a 60 days on the market in August, a week more than the same time last year. \n\nBuyers are hesitant, held back by soaring mortgage rates and wider fears of a financial downturn. \n\nAccording to Lichtenstein, mortgage rates need to come down considerably from their current level in order for the housing market to get moving. As of October 30, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage averaged 6.17 percent. \n\n‘A rate of five percent would be the magic number right now,’ he said. \n\nNearly half of the biggest cities in the US are now seeing home prices fall — cutting into a key source of wealth for average Americans.\n\nAccording to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller index, of the 20 major metros that it tracks, nine recorded price declines in August. \n\n‘For the fourth straight month, home values have lost ground to inflation, meaning homeowners are seeing their real wealth decline even as nominal prices inch higher,’ said Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAcross the United States, warning indicators are emerging throughout the economy, placing&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Indicators Point to Possible Imminent Financial Downturn in America first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/indicators-point-to-possible-imminent-financial-downturn-in-america/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/All-the-signs-of-an-imminent-financial-crash-in-America.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 22:36:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":375121252,"title":"Trump: ICE Raids 'Haven't Gone Far Enough'","text":"On Sunday, CBS released a preview clip of President Donald Trump’s interview, scheduled to air later on “60 Minutes,” in which he discussed his immigration policy.\n\nTrump, who campaigned on immigration and closing the border, said he believes the tactics Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are using on the streets of cities like Chicago and Los Angeles “haven’t gone far enough” to remove people who are in the country illegally.\n\nHost Norah O’Donnell said, “More recently, Americans have been watching videos of ice tackling a young mother, tear gas being used in a Chicago residential neighborhood, and the smashing of car windows.”\n\nTrump said, “Um hum.”\n\nShe asked, “Have some of these raids gone too far?”\n\nTrump said, “No, I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama.”\n\nO’Donnell said, “You are OK with those tactics?”\n\nTrump said, “Yeah, because you have to get the people out.”\n\n Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN","summary":"On Sunday, CBS released a preview clip of President Donald Trump's interview, scheduled to air later on \"60 Minutes,\" in which he discussed his immigration policy.\n\n\nThe post Trump: ICE Raids &#8216;Haven&#8217;t Gone Far Enough&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2025/11/02/trump-ice-raids-havent-gone-far-enough/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/trump467820-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 22:35:06","author":"Pam Key","authors":["Pam Key"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":375109732,"title":"Company Offers Non-Lethal Self-Defense Option to Schools, Houses of Worship","text":"One company is looking to get its non-lethal self-defense device, the “Byrna,” into schools and house of worship as a means of increasing safety and deterring potential shootings.\n\n“In most cases, if somebody pulls out a Byrna to stop an assailant, they don’t even need to fire a projectile,” Bryan Ganz, CEO of Indiana-based Byrna Technologies, told Newsweek in an interview. “Just indicating that they’re prepared to defend themselves is generally sufficient.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nSchool shootings have risen virtually year-over-year, hitting a peak of around 351 shootings in 2023, and around 336 in 2024, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database. This year, so far, has seen 208 incidents, including the shooting at the Annunciation Catholic Church school in Minnesota in August where two children were killed and over 30 people were injured.\n\nIn the past, some officials, including President Donald Trump, have suggested arming teachers with guns as a deterrent, which has raised concerns. More recently, Trump and his allies have suggested a number of restrictions on ownership, such as banning transgendered individuals from owning guns, which the National Rifle Association (NRA) has staunchly opposed.\n\nThe Supreme Court is also set to hear arguments about a strict Hawaii gun law that bans guns on private property unless owners explicitly permit them.\n\nA range of Byrna gun products from Byrna Technologies. (Photo courtesy of Byrna Technologies)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nGanz, a proud Second Amendment supporter, got the idea for the device after avoiding a potentially dangerous road rage incident during which he had considered using his lethal firearm.\n\n“I could see he had gotten out of his car and he…had nothing in his hand, so I got out of the car without my gun and honestly, nothing good happened: This guy rushed me and he threw me to the ground. Fortunately, the only thing he really hurt was my pride, but it was such a lesson for me because it showed me that if I wasn’t willing to use my firearm…it was of no value,” Ganz explained.\n\nHe added: “Given my background, I really wanted to use this as an opportunity to transition to making a non-lethal personal security device, and that was really the inception of the Byrna.”\n\nThe device, which comes in a number of colors but does resemble a firearm, is designed to operate “somewhat similar to a firearm…on a completely different mechanism.”\n\nThe Byrna uses a CO2-fired launcher, similar to a paintball or T-shirt gun, to launch one of two non-lethal projectiles: A high-grade polymer, essentially plastic, that aims to stop someone through “pain compliance”; and the more commonly used pepper-spray ball that has an effect that can last for 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n“When it hits somebody, it explodes and it creates a cloud of this powder, and the powder gets on people’s skin, it gets to their eyes, into the respiratory system, and the effect is that their skin is immediately on fire,” Ganz said.\n\n“I mean, you really feel like you’re burning: Your eyes close involuntarily; we refer to it as temporary blindness and you’re in respiratory distress, so what happens is most people will drop whatever they’re holding,” he continued. “They’ll try to grab their eyes because their eyes are stinging terribly, and they’ll get down on their hands and knees…it is extremely effective at stopping an assailant.”\n\nIndividuals practice using the Byrna non-lethal weapons.

You really need to be five, seven feet away from somebody,” Ganz said.\n\nThe weapon has already made some great strides in public perception, with the company highlighting a Harvard-Stanford study that features the company’s device as “the exclusive product used to measure shift in gun-owner attitudes toward non-lethal personal defense.”\n\nThe concern that arises, however, is the fact that in certain colorings, the Byrna resembles a gun and lacks the orange tip used to distinguish toy guns from real firearms.\n\nGanz acknowledged the lack of visual clues distinguishing it from a lethal firearm but said that it’s because the Byrna products are intended to be weapons and “not a toy.”\n\nManufacturing and assembly of Byrna weapon products. \n(Photo courtesy of Byrna Technologies via Facebook)\n\n“We do make it in less lethal orange and safety yellow,” he said, but also revealed that the company sells some of its products to law enforcement, who will buy those more obvious colors – but the black color, which is less distinguishable from a lethal gun, is the most popular c...","summary":"Byrna Technologies aims to provide a non-lethal alternative for self-defense as shootings continue to rise in the U.S.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/company-offers-non-lethal-self-defense-option-to-schools-houses-of-worship-10979170","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/516926812_1428878641963663_4210471649456790556_n.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-02 22:21:36","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":375107056,"title":"BIHAR BATTLE: PM being ‘controlled’ by Adani, Ambani: Rahul","text":"Continuing his tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said, “Modi is not only scared of US President Donald Trump, but is also being remote-controlled by Ambani and Adani.” He said this while addressing public meetings in Begusarai and Khagaria.“The government does not have land for you here, but has a lot of land for Adani and Ambani,” he added while referring to the allotment of 1,200 acres to the Adani Group for building a thermal plant.The Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha alleged that the PM would do anything to woo voters, but would stop visiting Bihar after the elections and do nothing for the state. “When he has not given you any health or education facility, why should you vote for him?” Rahul asked the public.Promising to build a world-class university if the Mahagathbandhan bloc comes to power, Rahul said, “There was a time when people from abroad came here to study at Nalanda University. Today, if you ask anyone about universities in Bihar, they will probably refer to paper leak cases to describe the status of education in the state.”The former Congress president stressed unemployment was the real problem for youngsters. “Modi is asking the youth to use social media so that he can divert their attention from the real issues. The day people realise that Modi and Adani are working in collusion, both of them will be forced to shut their shops,” he said.He further appealed to the youth to not waste their time on social media. “After the Mahagathbandhan comes to power, we will focus on providing jobs,” he added.Reiterating the vote theft charge, Rahul said, “The RSS and the BJP had rigged polls to form governments in Maharashtra, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Now, they have struck down names of supporters of the opposition parties from the voters list in Bihar.”Later in the day, Rahul and VIP founder Mukesh Sahani went to a pond for fishing. Besides taking a boat ride, Rahul also jumped into the pond. He also went to the house of a local resident, Mahendra Saw, and interacted with his family. Apart from Mukesh Sahani, Kanhaiya Kumar and Congress candidate from Begusarai Amita Bhushan also accompanied the LoP.","summary":"Rahul Gandhi criticized PM Modi, alleging he is controlled by Ambani and Adani and fears Trump.
