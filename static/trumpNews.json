(KDKA) — Former President Donald Trump held a rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, where, almost three months ago, he was nearly assassinated. Appearing with him for the first time on the campaign trail was billionaire Elon Musk. \n\n“Tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America,” Trump said during his opening remarks at the Butler Farm Show grounds.\n\n“For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper’s perch not so far away,” Trump said. “But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close.” \n\nHe also praised the “men and women of the U.S. Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine without even a thought for their own lives.” \n\n“There was not even a moment of doubt in their minds,” Trump added. \n\nTrump also paid tribute to firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the July 13 assassination attempt. Comperatore’s widow and daughters were in attendance Saturday. \n\n“I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief,” Trump told the Comperatore family. “…Our hearts, for as long as we live, everybody in this stadium, and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we think about Corey, we think about him a lot.” \n\nHe asked the crowd to join him in a moment of silence in Comperatore’s memory prior to the playing of “Ave Maria.” \n\nMusk, donning a MAGA hat, later appeared on stage with Trump, calling the November election “the most important of our lifetime.” \n\nThe Tesla founder repeated several common Republican talking points, alleging that Democrats want to “take away freedom of speech” and “the right to bear arms,” and claiming that Trump “must win to preserve the Constitution, to preserve democracy in America.” \n\n“This election could be decided by 1,000 votes, 500 votes,” Musk said.\n\nPrior to Trump’s address, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also spoke. As he has before, Vance claimed, without evidence, that it was Democratic rhetoric that led to the assassination attempt in Butler, as well as the apparent assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, saying “it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him.”\n\n“And with all the hatred they have spewed at President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him,” Vance told the crowd. “And that’s exactly what happened, not just here in Butler, Pennsylvania, but just a few weeks later in Florida, three weeks ago, while these guys still go out there and attacking him as a threat to democracy.” \n\nTrump’s son, Eric Trump, and his wife, Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also addressed the crowd.\n\n“Donald Trump was made for such a time as this,” Lara Trump said. \n\nSecurity for this Trump rally is different \n\nOn July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear, firefighter Corey Comperatore was killed and two others were injured when Thomas Crooks opened fire from the top of a nearby building.\n\nAccording to the guest list, rally attendees included one of the men who was injured at the July 13 rally, along with Malphine Fogel, the mother of Marc Fogel, a Pennsylvania native imprisoned in Russia. \n\nButler County Commissioner Leslie Osche said the Butler County Emergency Services Agency was a unified communications bridge between the U.S. Secret Service, state and local police, fire, and EMS. \n\nUnlike the first rally on July 13, there was one command post. In that post, one person from all law enforcement and emergency services agencies worked the rally. \n\nDuring the first rally, three separate radio systems created communication delays. On Saturday, there was one for state and local police and one for the Secret Service. A Secret Service agent was also embedded with each state and local team.\n\nGoldinger told KDKA-TV earlier this week that the snipers posted inside the AGR building where Crooks fired from have been asked to help again. Law enforcement will also be on top of the AGR building. \n\nMan who was behind Trump during shooting says he’ll be back\n\nOne person who was expected to be in the crowd was a man who was sitting behind Trump when the former president was grazed by the bullet.\n\nChesher said he witnessed the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n“It’s been a couple of months but I’m still processing what happened that day. The emotions are all over the place,” Chesher said. \n\n“We’re forever connected to President Trump now,” Chesher said. \n\nNot far away from Chesher, others were struck, including Comperatore, who died as a result of being hit by a bullet meant Trump.\n\nChesher said he believes there will be “a spiritual positivity” at the rally on Saturday. Chesher also said he believes he will be sitting behind Trump again on Saturday.\n\nAs for being worried about more violence, given what occurred, Chesher believes Saturday’s event will be a safe one.\n\n“He said it should be the most secure event. In my heart, I believe it will be the most secure event. I think God’s on our side though,” Chesher said. \n\n Chesher said he’s hoping to talk to the former president, and regardless, he hopes the event is peaceful.\n\nConstruction could cause traffic issues\n\nWith construction on Route 68, traffic could be an issue. Cars were backing up on Friday. Route 68 is one of the ways into the Butler Farm Show grounds, and Meridian Road on the other side is partially closed.\n\n“It’s going to be difficult travel tomorrow getting here to where you gotta park,” Butler County DA Richard Goldinger said.\n\nGoldinger said local police will be assisting with traffic. State police will help. With construction near the farm show complex, Goldinger said to be patient and follow the officers’ and troopers’ instructions.\n\n“Follow their orders. Don’t drive in closed lanes or anything like that. We want everybody to be safe,” Goldinger said.\n\nWhile there is parking at the farm show, some nearby lots were selling spaces. One right next to the grounds was selling spots for $20. Some people were already paying to park on Friday. The property owner says they could fit about 400 cars and will have four to five people out getting the money and cars into the lot. \n\nThe district attorney was calling on people to have patience and plan on Saturday being a longer day out. The traffic between people, politicians and other celebrities is expected to slow down the flow of everything.\n\n“It doesn’t change the fact that this road is under construction so it’s going to be slow travel,” Goldinger said.","summary":"BUTLER, Pa.

He began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with “God Bless the USA,” frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.\n\n“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,” Trump said. “And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We’ve bled.”\n\nTrump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang “Ave Maria” after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster” and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.” There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nOne of the most anticipated guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a “great gentleman” and said he “saved free speech.”\n\n“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,” said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. “This is a must-win situation.”\n\nMusk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has embraced conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while severely criticizing Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of language is “inflammatory.”\n\n“You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’” said Vance, who was chosen as his vice presidential nominee less than two days later. “Now I believe it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.”\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. A massive crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue’s edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday.\n\nMuch of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.\n\nTrump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.\n\nThe building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump.\n\nHow Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive.\n\nButler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that “everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.”\n\nMike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service, was deploying ”quadruple the assets” it did in July. The agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nButler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county’s 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else.\n\nChris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, “I was afraid” — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out.\n\nHeightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee’s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs.\n\nOther townspeople were divided over the value of Trump’s return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump’s last visit fanned political tensions in the city.\n\n“Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don’t want to see him reelected,” she said.\n\nTerri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. “I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That’s what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,” she said.\n\nShe said she was not worried about her own safety.\n\n“Honesty, I believe God’s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we’re rooting for him.”\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump campaign wanted to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump goes back to the location in Pennsylvania where an assassination attempt took place to hold a significant rally in a crucial swing state. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-goes-back-to-the-location-in-pennsylvania-where-an-assassination-attempt-took-place-to-hold-a-significant-rally-in-a-crucial-swing-state/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1728173603_rewrite-this-title-Trump-returns-to-site-of-Pennsylvania-assassination.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:14:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.193},{"id":258616760,"title":"After the deluge, the lies: Misinformation and hoaxes about Helene cloud the recovery","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The facts emerging from Hurricane Helene’s destruction are heartrending: Businesses and homes destroyed, whole communities nearly wiped out, hundreds of lives lost, hundreds of people missing.\n\nYet this devastation and despair is not enough for the extremist groups, disinformation agents, hucksters and politicians who are exploiting the disaster to spread false claims and conspiracy theories about it and the government’s response.\n\nAccording to former President Donald Trump, the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. Far-right extremist groups warn on social media that officials plan to bulldoze affected communities and seize the land from residents. A tale straight from science fiction asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nThe claims, according to experts and local officials dealing with disaster response, say less about the reality of the widespread damage from Helene than they do about America’s fractured politics and the fear and distrust shadowing an election year marked by assassination attempts and escalating global tension.\n\nDebunking conspiracy theories takes time away from recovery efforts\n\nAs rescue work continues and authorities try to separate fact from fiction, the conspiracy theories are not helping. Elected leaders from both parties have had to set the record straight and urge people not to give into fear and rumor.\n\n“If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great,” posted Glenn Jacobs, the retired professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Jacobs’ post was intended to rebut rumors that workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were seizing relief supplies from private citizens.\n\nMany of the conspiracy theories focus on hard-hit North Carolina, a state key to winning the White House. Rumors circulated that FEMA was raiding storm donations and withholding body bags, forcing local hospitals to stack the bodies of victims. One claim suggested federal authorities would condemn the entire town of Chimney Rock and prohibit resettlement in order to commandeer a valuable lithium mine nearby.\n\nFalse claims of blocked relief flights and aid withheld from Republicans\n\nElon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, posted that private relief flights to North Carolina were being blocked by the Federal Aviation Administration, a claim dismissed as false by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nDespite the tradition of Democrats and Republicans putting aside politics for disaster response, many conspiracy theories suggest Democrats such as President Joe Biden or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are intentionally withholding aid from Republicans. Trump has pushed the claim, as has North Carolina’s lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the embattled GOP nominee for governor.\n\n“They’re being treated very badly in the Republican areas,” Trump told Fox News, ignoring reports and photo and video evidence of recovery efforts underway throughout the region. “They’re not getting water, they’re not getting anything.”\n\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones endorsed Trump’s fact-free allegation. Jones, the founder of InfoWars, popularized the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children in 2012 was faked. “Exclusive: Victims of Hurricane Helene Confirm The Federal Government is Purposely Blocking Rescuers and Stealing Aid In an Attempt to Keep Deep Red Areas From Voting,” Jones posted Thursday on X.\n\nDisinformation campaigns by China and Russia amplify the misleading claims\n\nState-run media and disinformation campaigns run by China and Russia have amplified false and misleading claims about the response to the storm. Both countries have used social media and state news stories to criticize responses to past U.S. natural disasters, part of a larger effort to stoke division and distrust among Americans.\n\nState and local officials from both parties have condemned the conspiracy theories as rumors, saying the focus should be on recovery, not political division and hearsay. Responding to the hoaxes is taking up time that should go toward assisting victims, said North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican who urged his constituents not to give into hoaxes.\n\n“Friends can I ask a small favor?” Corbin posted Thursday on Facebook. “Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet… Please don’t let these crazy stories consume you.”\n\nAfter Robinson, the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor, posted that state officials had not prepared for the storm, a spokesman for the governor accused Robinson of mounting “an online disinformation campaign.” North Carolina officials say the response to Helene is the largest in state history, including thousands of members of the National Guard and other recovery workers, millions of meals, dozens of aircraft and more than 1,000 chainsaws.\n\nTrump has tried to tie the hurricane’s aftermath to immigration, a leading issue of his campaign. He falsely claimed that FEMA had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe agency’s funding for disaster aid is stretched, but that is because of the many parts of the country dealing with the effects of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. Disaster aid is funded separately from other Department of Homeland Security programs that support immigration-related spending.\n\nFar-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology\n\nBizarre stories proposing that the government used weather control technology to aim the hurricane at Republican voters quickly racked up millions of views on X and other platforms.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed the idea, posting Wednesday on X: “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”\n\nFar-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology — sometimes tinged with antisemitism — have spread after recent natural disasters, including a snowstorm in Texas and last year’s wildfire in Maui.\n\nExperts who study conspiracy theories say big events like disasters — or the Sept. 11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic — create perfect conditions for conspiracy theories to spread because large numbers of anxious people are eager to find explanations for shocking events.\n\nResponding to the volume of false claims about Helene, the Red Cross urged people to consult trustworthy sources of information and to think twice before reposting conspiracy theories.\n\n“Sharing rumors online without first vetting the source and verifying facts ultimately hurts people — people who have just lost their homes, neighborhoods, and, in some cases, loved ones,” the organization wrote in a public plea.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

The former president specifically targeted Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing her of neglecting her duties during the crisis.The death toll from Hurricane Helene has now reached a staggering 227 across six states, according to CNN's tally.The latest figure puts Helene as the second-deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in the past half-century, surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina, which claimed at least 1,833 lives in 2005.The impact of Helene has been particularly severe in North Carolina, where 113 deaths have been reported. South Carolina follows with 48 fatalities, while Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia have also suffered losses. The rising death toll has intensified scrutiny of the federal government's response to the disaster.As Politico reports, the timing and location of Hurricane Helene have thrust it into the spotlight of the upcoming presidential election. The storm's devastating impact on key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina has made it a pivotal issue in the race, with both campaigns acutely aware of the political implications.Trump has been quick to seize the narrative, visiting affected areas before President Biden and Vice President Harris. The former president and the Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp shook hands last Friday during a meeting to discuss further relief efforts in the state.With polls in Georgia showing an extremely tight 2024 race, Trump has since changed his tune on the governor, who he previously called \"disloyal,\" and thanked Kemp for his \"help and support\" in a recent Truth Social post.The Biden administration, meanwhile, has been working to counter claims of negligence following the storms. Vice President Harris visited Augusta, Georgia on Wednesday, October 3, meeting with those distributing aid and cleaning up after the storm.Newsweek contacted Trump and Harris' campaign via email on Saturday for comment.During her speech, Harris outlined the federal government's relief efforts, including immediate cash disbursements and longer-term emergency funding.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has been at the forefront of the relief efforts.According to a press release, the organization has already disbursed over $10 million in \"flexible and upfront\" assistance to the affected states. FEMA as shipped over 8.8 million meals, more than 7.4 million liters of water, 150 generators, and more than 225,000 tarps to the storm zone.Despite these efforts, more than 460,000 customers across five states remain without power more than a week after Helene made landfall. South Carolina leads with over 170,000 outages, followed closely by North Carolina with nearly 145,000 customers in the dark.Politico notes that the political impact of Hurricane Helene could be significant. In the 25 North Carolina counties designated for FEMA assistance, nearly one million votes were cast in 2020. In Georgia, close to 650,000 votes were cast in the more than 40 FEMA-designated counties.With both states currently showing Trump leading by only a single percentage point in polling averages, the government's response to Helene could sway the election outcome.","summary":"Trump calls Helene \"the worst Hurricane Response by a president and vice president since Katrina,\" as Harris defends federal aid efforts.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-hurricane-helene-kamala-harris-katrina-1964449","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488428/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:11:01","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":258616698,"title":"Musk Launches PAC to Back Candidates Focused on Secure Borders, Free Speech, Sensible Spending","text":"“This is the PAC that I created to support candidates who believe in the core values of America,” Musk wrote in a post on X on Oct. 5.\n\nAmerica PAC’s mission statement, posted on social media, outlines its focus areas: secure borders, safe cities, a fair justice system, self-protection, and free speech.

(AP) — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged ongoing federal support and praised the “heroes among us” as she visited North Carolina on Saturday in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, her second trip in four days to the disaster zone.\n\nThe vice president was in Charlotte one day after a visit to the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster.\n\nHarris opened her visit by attending a briefing with state and local officials, where she thanked “those who are in the room and those who are out there right now working around the clock.”\n\nShe promised federal assistance would continue to flow and added praise for the “strangers who are helping each other out, giving people shelter and food and friendship and fellowship.”\n\nDespite Trump’s claims that the federal response in the state has been “lousy,” Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said the state was “deeply grateful for the federal resources that we have. FEMA has been on the ground with us since the very beginning,” he said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAfter her briefing, Harris helped pack toiletries into aid kits at a distribution center, where she met Angelica Wind from hard-hit Asheville, who was there to volunteer with her daughter and a friend even though Wind said her own family was still without power and people were “just surviving.”\n\n“There’s a lot of resilience,” Wind told Harris, adding that, “We want to make sure people don’t forget about us.”\n\nHarris assured her the federal government was “here for the long haul.”\n\nMelissa Funderbunk told Harris about driving a truck carrying assistance to people in remote Morganton, “where people weren’t coming.”\n\n“You are the heroes among us,” Harris said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.\n\nThe two have been vocal and visible about the government’s willingness to help, and the administration’s efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.\n\nIn a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund “has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.” He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program.\n\nMore than 200 people have died. It’s the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.\n\nBut in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene’s aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.”\n\nDuring a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal government “doing a very bad job” in its storm response, with little relief in North Carolina in particular.

He warned “this will be the last election” if Trump doesn’t win and, clad in a black-on-black cap bearing the “Make America Great Again” slogan of Trump’s campaign, appeared to acknowledge the foreboding nature of his remarks.\n\n“As you can see I am not just MAGA — I am Dark MAGA,” he said.\n\nThe appearance marked the first time Musk joined one of Trump’s trademark rallies and represented the growing alliance between the two men in the final stretch of a competitive presidential election. Musk created a super PAC supporting the Republican nominee that has been spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts in the final months of the campaign. Trump has said he would tap Musk to lead a government efficiency commission if he regains the White House.\n\nTrump joined Musk in August for a rare public conversation on X, an overwhelmingly friendly chat that spanned more than two hours. In it, the former president largely focused on the July assassination attempt, illegal immigration and his plans to cut government regulations.\n\nBefore a massive crowd on Saturday, Musk sought to portray Trump as a champion of free speech, arguing that Democrats want “to take away your freedom of speech, they want to take away your right to bear arms, they want to take away your fight to vote, effectively.” Musk went on to criticize a California effort to ban voter ID requirements.\n\nSaturday’s rally took place at the same property where a gunman’s bullets grazed Trump’s right ear and killed his supporter, Corey Comperatore. The shooting left multiple others injured.\n\nSeveral members of Comperatore’s family, as well as other attendees and first responders from the July rally, returned to the site on Saturday.

The contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is super tight, both nationally and in the key states.\n\nSo, how much can we trust the polls?\n\nIt’s a question many are raising after they famously got it so wrong four years ago.\n\nThe American Association for Public Opinion Research called it the biggest polling miss in 40 years, showing Mr Biden’s lead over Mr Trump in the final two weeks of the campaign twice as large as it was when the votes were counted.\n\nIn 2012, pollsters significantly under-estimated Barack Obama’s lead over Mitt Romney. But, while Mr Trump’s 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton shocked many people, the error on the national polls was relatively small by comparison.\n\nOf course, all polls come with uncertainty, some inbuilt error, and they are only a snapshot of the current situation, not a prediction of the outcome on polling day.\n\nCrucially, though, there is evidence they also become a more reliable predictor of the outcome the closer we get to the election. It may seem obvious, but a year out from voting the polls are on average seven points different from the final tally for each candidate. By the last week of the campaign, this falls to less than three points.\n\nEvery day the polls tell us a little bit more about the result.\n\nSo, how should we read them?\n\nOne key thing to remember is the uncertainty around the estimated support for the candidates.\n\nUncertainty: ‘Margin of error’\n\nWhile pollsters publish a percentage figure for each, they also report a ‘margin of error’ to indicate the amount that support might vary.\n\nFor example, if a poll puts Mr Trump on 46% with a three-percentage point margin of error, it means that his support among the voting public should lie between 43% and 49%. If the same poll has Ms Harris on 49%, then her support should lie between 46% and 52%.\n\nAll this tells us is that the contest is close and either candidate could be leading.\n\nSimilar caution is required when looking at trackers using polling averages.\n\nYou might think that averaging the polls would reduce uncertainty, since random errors should cancel out. But some pollsters are consistently more accurate than others, while some may be systematically wrong in one direction. Adding them all together can reinforce those biases.\n\nRead more on the election:What exactly happens on the night of the US election?How does Donald Trump keep his support so strong?\n\nPredicting the turnout: Context matters\n\nWho votes in an election is also critical to the outcome but predicting that is a tough ask for pollsters. Roughly a third of eligible Americans do not cast a ballot in presidential elections, and it isn’t all the same people each time.\n\nContext matters. It can make people more or less likely to vote. For example, potential changes to abortion laws seems to have mobilised many Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe policies and performance of a candidate can also change the likelihood of more partisan voters to turnout.\n\nThe Electoral College: Why state contests can be crucial\n\nThe same considerations are needed when looking at state polls and arguably they are more crucial to determining which candidate is most likely to win the election.\n\nThe outcome of a presidential race is decided state by state, by the Electoral College, and the difference between that and the national vote has been growing.\n\nRead more: What is the Electoral College?\n\nIn 2000 and in 2016, the candidate with the most votes nationally lost the election because they didn’t win a combination of states that delivered the highest tally in the Electoral College.\n\nThis is why battleground state polls get so much attention and they are factored into the models of statisticians trying to forecast the outcome.\n\nOf course, they have the same uncertainty and potential flaws as national polls. And the bad news is their recent performance hasn’t been great.\n\nIn 2016 they suggested Ms Clinton would sweep the key states needed for a comfortable win in the Electoral College. In 2020, they fared even worse.\n\nSome states have proven particularly difficult to poll accurately. In 2016 and 2020, the biggest misses were in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\nThese, especially Pennsylvania, which of the group carries the most Electoral College votes, are all potentially decisive in 2024.\n\nSo, what can the polls tell us?\n\nThe answer is plenty if you are looking for a steer on how people feel about a certain candidate or policy.\n\nBut, if you’re trying to work out who’s ahead in the race to be president, then all you can confidently say is the contest is really close and could come down to a small number of votes in a few states.","summary":"Ask most party strategists, US pollsters or pundits and they&#8217;ll tell you the 2024 presidential election could be the closest in decades, if not a century.

Comperatore’s fire uniform, as it was during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, was prominently displayed for all to see.\n\n“This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, Corey Comperatore,” Trump said. “Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American patriots have showed.”\n\nChants of “Corey, Corey, Corey!” rippled through the crowd before it participated in a moment of silence to Ave Maria for Comperatore and the rallygoers who were injured during Trump’s first assassination attempt.\n\nTrump then returned to his Pennsylvania stump speech, promising, among other things, that his second administration would “frack like we’ve never fracked before.” Energy policy is a wedge issue in the Keystone State.\n\n“I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death,” Trump said. “Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing women’s sports? Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens?”\n\nTrump did not spare Democrats, alleging they have “slandered” him, “impeached” him, “indicted” him, tried to deny him ballot access, and “maybe even tried to kill [him].”\n\nOf Vice President Kamala Harris, he added, “She ruined San Francisco, she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America.”\n\nBillionaire businessman Elon Musk, who has been using his social media platform X to promote Trump and criticize President Joe Biden and now Harris, was in attendance and addressed the crowd, saying he had gone “Dark MAGA,” a reference to his black MAGA hat, and underscoring the importance of voting.\n\n“The true test of one’s character is how they behave under fire,” Musk said. “We had one president who couldn’t climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot.”\n\nTrump was introduced by singer Lee Greenwood, who sang the former president’s walk-up song “God Bless the USA” in person instead of over the sound system. Shortly afterward, one member of the crowd near the press pen needled “the globalist” media, claiming he would “take a bullet” for Trump.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Trump’s vice presidential nominee, was also part of the program, warmly welcomed to chants of “J.D., J.D., J.D.” Vance, fresh off of his vice presidential debate this week against Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), described Saturday as a “historic day” and one that the crowd would “remember forever.”\n\n“You heard the shots, you saw the blood, we all feared the worst,” Vance said.\n\nVance used the platform to blame Democrats for the raised political temperature, contending at least Trump was the democratically elected Republican presidential nominee as opposed to Harris, despite the vice president repeating that Trump is the “threat to democracy.”\n\n“Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy, what the hell have you done?” Vance asked of Harris. \n\nVance scrutinized Harris for her record of inaction as vice president, citing Hurricane Helene as the most recent instance.\n\nEric Trump, in his remarks, similarly undermined Harris for the Biden administration’s natural disaster response, particularly since battlegrounds North Carolina and Georgia have been devastated by the storm. His father had earlier compared Helene to former President George W. Bush‘s Katrina in 2005. \n\nEric Trump’s wife Lara, who is co-chair of the Republican National Committee, emphasized the importance of election integrity. Campaign staff and grassroots organizers were handing out cards with a voter fraud hotline number on it throughout the day.\n\nCrowds, some wearing their best Trump get-up, started gathering at Butler Family Farms long before the gates opened at 10 a.m., with people bringing picnic rugs and buying snacks at the food trucks parked on the grounds, creating a carnival-like atmosphere, irrespective of the tragedy that had prompted Trump’s return. Campaign staff distributed water, though medical assistance was required multiple times to tend to those who had overheated under the 70-plus Fahrenheit sun.\n\nOne month before the election, Trump and Harris are locked in a tight race for the White House. Although Harris has an edge in national polls, surveys of voters in the seven battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina reveal that the contest is too close to call. In the Keystone State, Trump and Harris are tied, according to RealClearPolitics‘s averages of the pair’s head-to-head polling.\n\nThe election is in a different place from when Trump emerged in the immediate confusion after Crooks fired his weapon with a bloodied face because the shooter had managed to graze the former president’s ear with a bullet. The then-undisputed front-runner had turned his head toward an illegal immigration numbers chart as Crooks pulled his trigger.\n\n“I love that chart,” Trump said on Saturday.\n\nBefore U.S. Secret Service agents surrounded Trump and rushed him from the stage and to safety, the former president instructed them to wait so he could get his shoe and raise his fist and shout, “Fight, fight, fight!” \n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe same chant would echo around the Republican National Convention days later, with convention attendees bandaging their own ears in a demonstration of solidarity with Trump, and in Butler again on Saturday.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in July amid public pressure over the Butler assassination attempt. Congress passed legislation last week to fund the federal government until Dec. 20, which included $231 million in additional money for the Secret Service, as an independent investigation is ongoing into that incident and a second assassination attempt last month in Florida.","summary":"BUTLER, Pennsylvania — Under a heavy security presence and from behind bullet-proof glass, former President Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, to honor the memory of a rallygoer who was killed three months ago by a bullet that barely missed him, but galvanized his base. &#8220;I return to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3178528/trump-revels-in-return-to-butler-with-musk/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/SS-Trump-rally-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-06 00:00:12","author":"Naomi Lim","authors":["Naomi Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.31},{"id":258615676,"title":"Elon Musk enthusiastically joins Trump on stage in Butler to reenact former president’s ‘fight, fight, fight’ moment following an assassination attempt","text":"Tesla boss Elon Musk jumped on stage with his fists in air as he joined Donald Trump on stage for the first time.\n\nIt came as Trump returned to the Butler Farm Show grounds where he survived an attempted assassination two months ago.\n\nMusk told the huge crowd: ‘America is the home of the brave and the true test of someone’s character is how they behave under fire.

This is no ordinary election,” he said. “President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America. This is a must win situation, must win.”\n\nThe Tesla CEO then launched into a rambling appeal to Americans, asking them to register to vote, and made the brazenly baseless claim that Democrats were going to eliminate elections in America. \n\n“Like, text people [to register to vote] now. Now. And then make sure they actually do vote,” he said.\n\n“If they don’t, this will be the last election,” he added. “That’s my prediction.” \n\nMusk does not have a background in politics. \n\nShortly after making that claim, Trump admitted that he had no idea what Musk’s satellite internet service, Starlink, was. \n\nTrump said he “called up Elon” to ask him to use Starlink to assist Americans affected by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, where internet and communication services suffered severe disruption. \n\n“Elon, could you do something about Starlink, whatever the hell that is, Elon?” Trump said. \n\nMusk’s hard right-wing turn wasn’t a surprise for most of his naysayers.\n\nCritics of Musk had suspected that his views were aligned with right-wing, cultural war politics for years. He often complained about the “woke mind virus” and the “matrix” — a term used primarily by right-wing figures looking to explain away social backlash to their actions and ideologies — in his X posts.\n\nMusk made his political leanings clear during this election cycle when he endorsed Trump for president on the same day the former president was nearly killed in Butler, and committed to give $45 million each month to the former president’s campaign, though he later walked back his offer.\n\nBut Muek has been a major donor in Republican circles for years. According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk has reportedly funneled approximately $60 million to groups affiliated with former Trump adviser Stephen Miller and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\n\nTwo people familiar with Musk’s donations told Reuters in October that he began contributing to Building America’s Future in 2022.\n\nThe admiration appears to be mutual between the men; Trump said he would appoint Musk to a task force with the mission of making “drastic” cuts to government spending.\n\n“I can’t wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,” Musk wrote on X. “This would unlock tremendous prosperity for America.”\n\nIn addition to his alleged donations and possible future position in a Trump task force, Musk has also given Trump and his allies a huge platform through X, formerly Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMusk has reshaped the platform by slashing attempts to stop disinformation and conspiracy theories and welcoming the return of previously banned users.\n\nShortly after Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox News, Musk struck up an agreement with the former Fox host to lead a show on his platform. Then, shortly after the assassination attempt on Trump, Musk hosted a glitchy interview with the former president on X, during which the men shared their mutual disdain for labor unions.","summary":"Musk falsely suggests Democrats want to strip away Americans’ First and Second Amendment rights","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/elon-musk-rallies-trump-pennsylvania-b2624509.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/05/23/SEI224588298.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5fv9HJAt-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:52:18","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":258615568,"title":"Donald Trump Brings Elon Musk To Butler Rally In Return To Shooting Site","text":"Trump took the stage from behind bulletproof glass and drew a laugh when he started his speech like this … “As I was saying.” He then pointed to the famous border-crossing chart he said helped save his life back in July when Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on him from a nearby rooftop.","summary":"Play video content Fox News Donald Trump&#8216;s joking about the failed attempt on his life as he returns to the scene of the crime &#8230; and he&#8217;s got Elon Musk with him this time.

This time, Trump was joined by X owner Elon Musk and vice presidential candidate JD Vance.\n“Welcome Back to Butler, Mr. President,” read a message in Trump’s walk-on video.\nWhen Trump started speaking, the same chart about illegal immigration he was referring to in the moments before the attempted assassination appeared on screen. “And as I was saying,” Trump said. He’d timed this moment so that it took place at precisely 6:11 pm, which was when he was shot in the ear on July 13. He also held a “moment of silence” honoring those who were injured or killed during the assassination attempt in July. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang Ave Maria, and people in the crowd removed their hats, wiped their eyes, and some even took a knee as Trump looked on solemnly.\n“Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows? Maybe even try to kill me,” said Trump, floating the conspiracy theory that the attempted assassination was orchestrated by his political opponents. “12 weeks ago we all took a bullet for America.”\nTrump later invited Musk on stage. The X owner walked on wearing a black blazer over a shirt saying “Occupy Mars” and a black MAGA hat. “As you can see, I’m not just MAGA,” said Musk. “I’m dark MAGA.” Dark MAGA is a memecoin, a type of cryptocurrency inspired by online trends. The valuation of Dark MAGA soared right around the time that Musk spoke.\nMusk repeatedly implored audience members and viewers to register to vote. “This election is the most important election of our lifetime,” said Musk. “This is no ordinary election.”\nHe wrapped up his brief speech with an ominous message: “Get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, drag them to register to vote,” he said. “If they don’t, this will be the last election. That’s my prediction.”\nMusk’s appearance at Saturday’s rally marked a major benchmark in his political evolution. Following the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, Musk posted on X that he had decided to “fully endorse” the former president, and shortly after announced the creation of a political action committee (PAC) to support Trump’s campaign. Musk initially said he would donate $45 million per month to the PAC, though he has since changed his tune. Musk also hosted Trump for a glitchy live conversation on X Spaces in August.\nMusk was previously an Obama, Clinton and Biden voter who donated to politicians on both sides of the aisle but touted himself as someone who generally tried to stay out of politics. At a 2015 Vanity Fair event, Musk said he hoped Trump wouldn’t clinch the Republican nomination for president because “that wouldn’t be good” and “would be a bit embarrassing.” He also told CNBC that he didn’t believe Trump had the “sort of character that reflects well on the United States” while voicing support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s policy platform. In 2017, Musk donated large sums to Republicans, signaling a possible right-ward shift in his political outlook. And in 2020, he bamboozled many of his fans with a cryptic Twitter post: “Take the Red Pill.”\nMusk is one of several right-wing tech billionaires who have thrown their support behind Trump. Billionaire Palantir founder Peter Thiel, is a longtime Trump supporter, and also helped fund Vance’s 2022 bid for his Ohio Senate seat. Before entering politics, Thiel was one of several Silicon Valley funders who backed Vance’s Ohio-based venture fund, Narya Capital. Vance and Thiel are also investors in the right-wing video sharing platform, Rumble.\nWhen Musk, who has described himself as a “free speech absolutist,” took over Twitter in 2022, he almost immediately fired the vast majority of the company’s trust and safety employees, the people who keep hate speech and mis- and disinformation off the platform. The following year, Musk slashed what remained of Twitter’s election integrity team, posting, “Oh you mean the “Election Integrity” Team that was undermining election integrity? Yeah, they’re gone.”\nHate speech on X increased under Musk and last year European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova said that of all the companies under EU scrutiny, X was “the platform with the largest ratio of mis- or disinformation posts.” Musk also reinstated the accounts of people who had been banned from the platform including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes.\nAfter Musk finished speaking, and Trump thanked him, rally attendees chanted his name.\nMoments later, Musk signed back onto X.\nHe immediately began sharing election conspiracies about election ballots sent to vacant addresses, before writing, “Make sure everyone you know & everyone you meet has registered to vote,” he wrote. “The fate of our civilization is at stake.”","summary":"“Get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, drag them to register to vote,” said Elon Musk at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. “If they don’t, this will be the last election.

He must win to preserve democracy in America,” Musk stressed to the audience.\n\nIn his brief remarks, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO took shots at President Biden and fellow Democrats while praising Trump, 78, from the same stage where the ex-president took a bullet to the ear when would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, opened fire on July 13.\n\n“You know, the true test of someone’s character is how they behave under fire.

At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he’ll emphasize that North Korea’s nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace. \n\n“At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP.\n\n“This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea’s reckless actions,” he said.\n\nConcerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked.\n\nMany foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won’t “cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.”\n\nThe Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim’s defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea’s first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010.\n\n“North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,” Yoon said.\n\nYoon didn’t elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea’s movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets.\n\nNorth Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan.\n\nSince his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea’s evolving nuclear threats. He’s also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon “a traitor” and ignored his calls for dialogue. \n\nThere are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump’s possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon’s approach on North Korea’s nuclear program.\n\nBut Yoon said that he’s confident that the “ironclad” South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.\n\n“There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,” Yoon said. “Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.”\n\nThe ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea’s formal name. \n\nYoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan’s new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon’s office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.\n\nYoon said he believes North Korea’s nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n“The North Korean regime’s past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,” Yoon said.\n\nAsked about North Korea’s repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea “will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand” if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn’t elaborate what specific steps his government is considering. \n\nBefore visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore. \n\nAt the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises.","summary":"South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/b9f2e91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7285x4098+0+381/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc3%2Fc9%2Fd56630013e6e15bc4bc674dd0909%2F16b2edb71318432f824c5932a4133245","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:37:00","author":"Hyung-Jin Kim","authors":["Hyung-Jin Kim"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":258615682,"title":"Carville predicts nearly all swing states will go to one candidate","text":"Speaking on CNN, Carville was asked, “If it’s the economy, stupid,” why Harris isn’t ahead in the presidential race after recent positive economic news, including declining inflation and a stronger-than-expected jobs report.\n\n“You know, she’s slightly ahead.

(AP) — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally with a massive crowd of supporters in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November’s election.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear. He began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.\n\nThe Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded him with “God Bless the USA,” frequently played at his rallies, and billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.\n\n“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward together,” he said. “And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together. We’ve bled.”\n\nTrump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.\n\nAt the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang “Ave Maria” after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.\n\nStanding behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster” and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of God.” There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.\n\nOne of the most expected guests of the evening was Musk, who climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the air after Trump introduced him as a “great gentleman” and said he “saved free speech.”\n\n“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,” said Musk, who endorsed Trump after the assassination attempt. “This is a must-win situation.”\n\nMusk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has pushed into conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, got on stage and reflected on the events that day while severely criticizing Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of language is “inflammatory.”\n\n“You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’” said Vance, who was chosen as his vice presidential nominee less than two days later. “Now I believe it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true miracle.”\n\nCrowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. A massive crowd packed bleachers, folding chairs and the expansive field stretching to the venue’s edges. Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers arrived Friday.\n\nMuch of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.\n\nTrump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.\n\nThe building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump.\n\nHow Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive.\n\nButler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that “everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.”\n\nMike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service, was deploying ”quadruple the assets” it did in July. The agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nButler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county’s 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else.\n\nChris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said, “I was afraid” — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out.\n\nHeightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee’s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs.\n\nOther townspeople were divided over the value of Trump’s return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump’s last visit fanned political tensions in the city.\n\n“Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don’t want to see him reelected,” she said.\n\nTerri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. “I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That’s what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,” she said.\n\nShe said she was not worried about her own safety.\n\n“Honesty, I believe God’s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we’re rooting for him.”\n\nBy Julie Carr Smyth, Jill Colvin and Adriana Gomez Licon Associated Press\n\nGomez Licon reported from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.","summary":"Donald Trump is rallying supporters at the same Pennsylvania grounds where a gunman tried to assassinate him in July setting aside what are now near-constant worries for his physical safety.","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2024/10/trump-returns-to-site-of-pennsylvania-assassination-attempt-for-a-major-swing-state-rally.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/QZHKOS66ZJET3IAMSV63SSY4EM.jpg?auth=3a8e8a5e12197762aa1fce704e355ca8b2016ca08f8bc6842c6e9d714cf2af8e&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:29:18","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":258615806,"title":"Trump returns to site of assassination attempt for major swing-state rally","text":"BUTLER, Pa. — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally with thousands of supporters in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November's election.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off back in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear.

Of July 13, he said, “I was afraid” — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him immediately after the shots rang out.\n\nHeightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican nominee’s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of concern over gas and oil industry jobs.\n\nOther townspeople were divided over the value of Trump's return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump's last visit fanned political tensions in the city.\n\n“Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don’t want to see him reelected,” she said.\n\nTerri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her 18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. “I just figure we need to not let fear control us. That’s what the other side wants is fear. If fear controls us, we lose,” she said.\n\nShe said she was not worried about her own safety.\n\n“Honesty, I believe God’s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we’re rooting for him.”","summary":"BUTLER, Pa. — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July, holding a sprawling rally with thousands of supporters in a critical swing state Trump hopes to return to his column in November's election.\n\n\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left off back in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear.

We got 32 days until the election,' Harris says.\n\nHowever, she then pauses while casting her eye across the crowd and appears to falter. \n\n'So 32 days, 32 days, Okay,' she continues. 'We got some business to do. We got some business to do. All right. 32 days and we know we will do it,' she adds before pausing as the crowd cheers.\n\n'And, and this is gonna be a very tight race until the very end. This is gonna be a very tight race until the very end. We are the underdog and we know we have some hard work ahead.' \n\nHer performance was trashed on social media, where viewers branded it 'humiliating'.\n\n'Kamala Harris is the embodiment of the Biden administration's incompetence,' one person said. \n\n'With a teleprompter malfunctioning, all we get is a robotic echo of “32 days.” This isn’t just a gaffe; it’s panic, and a glimpse into the chaotic leadership that will continue to undermine our nation.'\n\n'Look at her face when the teleprompter goes out. Like a deer in the headlights,' another added. \n\nHarris was visiting the union stronghold city in hopes of securing an endorsement from the firefighters' union but suffered another blow.\n\nBut by a slim margin, the International Association of Firefighters declined to back any candidate, a reminder of the Democratic nominee´s struggle to lock down the same support from organized labor that President Joe Biden won four years ago. \n\nThe vice president spoke after basketball legend Magic Johnson, who said 'nobody is going to outwork her,' and UAW President Shawn Fain, who described Trump as 'a scab.'\n\nThe leader of the Michigan firefighters union, Matthew Sahr, still showed up for Harris in Redford Township - although not to bestow the endorsement.\n\n'We could have chosen to stay away. But what kind of message would that send?' Sahr said.\n\n'The vice president is proud to have the support of organized labor, including firefighters across key battlegrounds like those who joined her in Michigan Friday,' said Harris campaign spokesman Brian Fallon.\n\n 'She is the only candidate in this race who always stands with workers and has fought to protect overtime pay, worker pensions, and the right to organize.'\n\n What unfolded nonetheless reflects the shifting loyalties in American politics as Harris vies with Trump for support among working-class voters who for years could be more solidly counted on to support Democrats.\n\nHarris didn't mince words when she spoke at the firehouse, saying Trump 'has been a union-buster his entire career' and would launch a 'full-on attack' against organized labor.\n\nHarris said Trump supports 'right-to-work' laws that often make it more difficult to unionize, and said he had weakened federal employees´ unions. While he was president, Trump used a series of 2018 executive orders designed to reduce those unions´ powers to collectively bargain.\n\nHe has expressed support for right-to-work since his initial run for president in 2016 - while also making comments more generally supportive of labor rights when speaking to union audiences since then.\n\nHarris also accused the former president of 'making the same empty promises to the people of Michigan that he did before, hoping you will forget how he let you down.'\n\nHer remarks followed U.S. dockworkers suspending their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy.\n\n A tentative agreement that has been hailed by Harris was reached to raise salaries, although other issues still need to be resolved.\n\n She also hit back at Trump's claims she would ban Americans from driving gas cars if elected.\n\n'I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,' Harris said. 'But here´s what I will do, I will invest in communities like Flint,' she said.\n\nHarris headed to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a visit by Republican Donald Trump","summary":"The Vice President was addressing crowds in Flint when her teleprompter appeared to malfunction and she was stuck repeating the phrase '32 days'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13928353/kamala-harris-michigan-rally-moment-teleprompter-glitch-flint.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/05/22/90500899-0-image-a-4_1728162429663.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:23:03","author":"Bethan Sexton For,Editor","authors":["Bethan Sexton For","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":258615376,"title":"Thomas Matthew Crooks fired a gun at Trump during his final Butler rally from a rooftop.

Vote vote vote!’\n\nMusk’s appearance at Trump’s rally in Butler was the first time he took the stage at a political rally. \n\nThe elusive billionaire was inspired to endorse Trump publicly after the failed assassination attempt of the former president.\n\nTrump praised Musk for donating Starlink systems to victims of hurricane Helene, joking he did not understand what the space satellite internet system was.\n\n‘I didn’t know what the hell Starlink was,’ Trump admitted.\n\nThe crowds shouted ‘Elon! Elon! Elon!’ In response\n\nUntil his arrival, the rally remained quite more sober as Trump paid tribute to Corey Comperatore, the man who was shot and killed the day of the shooting.\n\nAfter Trump called for a moment of silence, opera singer Christopher Macchio sang ‘Ave Maria’ and a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13. \n\nThe widow of Comperatore and their children also returned to the rally, seated with members of the Trump family.\n\nThe beloved Republican also named the other two victims who were shot and gravely wounded that day. \n\nOne had returned to the rally, Trump revealed, but one was in the hospital being treated.\n\nSupporters were jubilant upon seeing the president again and cheered joyously. \n\nAt one point, the former president had to pause the rally after a woman fainted, they shouted ‘we love Trump!’ and sang the National Anthem for about four minutes as she was attended to.\n\nAlthough the temperature in Butler is only in the high 60s, rallygoers have frequently collapsed at political rallies due to heatstroke this election season.\n\nEarlier, as Trump took the stage he said: ‘A very big thank you, we love Pennsylvania. And, as I was saying…’\n\nHe had on two big screens a chart on immigration that was there when he was shot three months ago,\n\nTrump said: ;I return to Butler to deliver a simple message.

A bell then tolled four times, once for each of the four victims, including Trump.\n“He did not stop our movement, he did not break our spirit,” Trump said of the shooter, who was shot and killed by security sharpshooters.\nThe crowd appeared to be in the tens of thousands, many wearing Trump regalia. Some chanted the “fight, fight, fight” slogan Trump used to rally his followers moments after he was shot.\n“We’re here to say, we can’t be intimidated, we can’t be stopped,” Ohio Republican Senator J.D. Vance, Trump’s vice-presidential running mate, told the crowd.\nVance rejected the argument from Vice-President Kamala Harris and other Democrats that Trump represents a threat to democracy.\n“Donald Trump took a bullet for democracy. What the hell have you done?” Vance said.\nTrump ally Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of social media platform X, was expected to appear on stage at the rally, his first time at a Trump campaign event since he endorsed the former president after the July 13 assassination attempt.\nTrump’s defiant and much-hyped return to Butler, Pennsylvania, came exactly one month before the November 5 presidential election, the outcome of which President Joe Biden suggested on Friday might not be peaceful.\n\nSecurity was noticeably tighter than at Trump’s July rally, with sniper squads positioned on several surrounding buildings, and a surveillance drone deployed overhead.\n“There’s a lot going on that’s unnerving,” said Heather Hughes, 43, who had travelled from New Castle in must-win Pennsylvania.\n“Do I think he’s safe? No, I think there’s going to be another attempt. But I think he’s going to make it through.”\nTrump was riding a clear poll lead after crushing Biden in a television debate in late June, and entered the Republican convention in Milwaukee as a political martyr.\nPictures of Trump with a blood-streaked face, pumping his fist and shouting “fight, fight, fight” as he was bundled away by Secret Service agents became defining images of the campaign.\nOn Saturday, many Trump supporters wore shirts emblazoned with assassination iconography, and some sported ear coverings recalling the bandage the former president wore after the shooting.\n\nMuch has changed since Trump’s last visit.\nBarely a week after the failed assassination bid, the presidential race was turned on its head when Biden dropped out and was replaced as the Democratic nominee by Harris.\nThe Harris campaign has clawed back the poll deficit – reversing it in some states – and the seismic events in Butler were largely overtaken.\nTrump’s rally appeared aimed at recovering momentum as a bruising campaign enters its final stretch.\nHarris on Saturday was in North Carolina meeting first responders and people hit by Hurricane Helene, which killed at least 220 as it ripped through the southeast.\nThe emergency response is “an example of the best we can do when we bring resources together at the federal, state and local level and tap into the kind of collegiality that produces results,” she told officials at a briefing.\nTrump has criticised the federal response, alleging without evidence that the Biden-Harris administration wrongly redirected relief funds to migrants.\n\nThe heavy security presence on Saturday highlighted persistent security fears, underscored when another attempt on Trump’s life was foiled last month.\nThe Secret Service has been pilloried for failing to secure the building where the Butler shooter managed to fire eight shots at Trump before being shot dead.\n“He said he’d come back to finish his speech, and to me [that takes] guts,” said Robert Dupain, 53, a local construction worker who was at the July rally.\nTrump and his campaign have turned on their head Democrats’ warnings about the former president representing a threat to democracy.\n“The Republicans aren’t violent … I think they [the Democrats] incite. They keep talking about Hitler and the end of democracy,” said retiree Glen Scheirer, who was with five relatives wearing identical “By the grace of God” T-shirts showing Trump after the shooting.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Butler incident, all sides urged a lowering of the political temperature.\nBut Trump quickly reverted to his signature inflammatory rhetoric and personal attacks, and has refused to commit to accepting the eventual result in November.\nHe has been indicted over the effort to subvert the 2020 election that culminated in his supporters storming the Capitol.\nAsked on Friday about the possibility of further election-related violence, Biden said he did not know if the vote would be peaceful.","summary":"Republican presidential candidate took the stage behind panes of bulletproof glass after an assassin’s bullet narrowly missed him in July.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3281246/trump-returns-site-failed-assassination-pennsylvania-campaign-rally","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/06/5ede14ca-7e69-485b-adce-f85edb59c871_7d3ef3a0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 23:06:51","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":258615244,"title":"Donald Trump Brings Elon Musk To Butler Rally In Return To Shooting Site","text":"Trump took the stage from behind bulletproof glass and drew a laugh when he started his speech like this ... \"As I was saying.\" He then pointed to the famous border-crossing chart he said helped save his life back in July when Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire on him from a nearby rooftop.","summary":"Donald Trump's joking about the failed attempt on his life as he returns to the scene of the crime ... and he's got Elon Musk with him this time.

I want to feel like I'm doing my part,' she said. \nThe 9 to 5 singer continued: 'I was heartbroken like everybody else, and just amazed and devastated by it.\n'All these people feel like my people.'\nLater, Dolly broke into song with the words 'Helene, Helene' to the tune of her famous hit, Jolene, during her remarks as she also issued a message of support to those who have had their lives devastated by the storm.\nShe said: 'I know it's easy for us to say, \"Oh, things are going to get better\" when things are still really bad. All we can say is that we are with you, that we love you, we hope that things get better real soon - and we're going to do our part to try and make that possible.'\nHurricane Helene has left 4.4 million people without power and at least 30 dead across four states as it battered Georgia and moved into the Carolinas early on Friday. \nThe storm has been downgraded to a tropical depression and is located about 125 miles southeast of Louisville, Kentucky, as of Friday afternoon.\nIt was updated to Category 4 earlier in the evening, and hit the Florida's Big Bend region just after 11pm with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph.\n\nThe country music legend confirmed during an event in her home state of Tennessee on Friday that the cash would come 'from my own bank account' (the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on October 2, 2024 in North Carolina)\n\nHurricane Helene has left 4.4 million people without power and at least 30 dead across four states as it battered Georgia and moved into the Carolinas early on Friday\nBut the damage extended hundreds of miles to the north, with flooding as far away as North Carolina, where a lake used in scenes from the movie Dirty Dancing overtopped a dam.\nAt least 15 people have died in Georgia and 17 in South Carolina due to the storm.\nHelene had already spurred warnings and several states of emergencies, not only Florida, but all the way to Georgia and the Carolinas.

Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith’s twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.\n\nThe devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.\n\n“As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,” said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nThe faith’s leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith’s 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.\n\nSome church members say the former president’s demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concerns about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent’s inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church’s teachings.\n\nTrump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.\n\nHarris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.\n\nOne of Harris’ greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.\n\nIt is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump’s brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump’s support for Israel.\n\n“He’s the lesser of two evils,” said Idos, 70. “The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that’s kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.”\n\nThe religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.\n\nSammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.\n\n“Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that’s not something I think I can stand by,” he said.\n\nUndecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.\n\nThe couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn’t really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.\n\n“The important thing about any general conference message is that it’s general and then we’re asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,” Jenna said. “People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives.”","summary":"Dallin H.

Kennedy Jr., amid split rumors.\n\nAs she made a quick stop at a Starbucks in Malibu, California on Friday, the 59-year-old actress’ left hand was completely bare of jewelry.\n\nFor her latest outing, the Curb Your Enthusiasm star wore a navy blue t-shirt, jeans and a pair of oversized black shades.\n\nDespite reports that she and RFK Jr., 70, have barely spoken over the past two weeks since reports surfaced of his alleged affair with journalist Olivia Nuzzi, Hines was spotted sitting in the passenger seat as he drove them around.\n\nShe wore a tense, unsmiling expression as she sat beside him in the car, and continued to look stern when she was seen heading down the sidewalk by herself. \n\nThe sighting comes after DailyMail.com revealed that close friends are expecting Hines to file for divorce amid the unfolding controversy.\n\nIn an exclusive interview, a Hines confidante said the television star, 59, was ‘blindsided’ by the scandal and had believed her husband’s philandering was a thing of the past.\n\n‘Cheryl found ten years of marriage with Bobby to be ‘spicier and a lot of laughs’,’ the source, a longtime friend, told DailyMail.com. \n\n‘She adored being a member of America’s royal family, and having the famous Kennedy name attached to hers, but now she’s thoroughly embarrassed and furious about his adulterous actions and they believe she wants out.’\n\nThe insider added: ‘Cheryl was always very aware that Bobby had a long history of womanizing. She herself had become very publicly involved with him when he was still married to his second wife, so his playing around wasn’t anything new to her. \n\n‘However, she firmly believed Bobby, in his seventh decade and with political aspirations, finally had his sex demons under control, and appeared settled down in their seemingly bucolic southern California domestic life.\n\n‘But she now feels totally blindsided and humiliated. His affair with that woman, Olivia Nuzzi, has wreaked-havoc on their marriage.\n\n‘If Cheryl has her way, Bobby be a three could be a three-time loser in marriage. She’s considering divorce because Bobby’s out-of-the-blue sexting affair with a woman four decades his junior has definitely curbed her enthusiasm about their tumultuous union.’\n\nLate last month, Nuzzi, 31, the Washington, D.C. star political correspondent for New York magazine, acknowledged having a sexting relationship with Kennedy, 70, while covering his campaign. \n\nKennedy, who suspended his independent bid for president and threw his support behind Donald Trump in August, claimed the two had only met once when Nuzzi interviewed him for the magazine. \n\nFriends told Page Six that Nuzzi disclosed they had enjoyed steamy FaceTime sessions, and the journalist was impressed by 70-year-old RFK Jr.’s ‘sexual stamina’.\n\nNuzzi has since stepped down from her job. \n\nHines would spark divorce rumors days later when she was snapped without her large diamond ring while leaving a Gucci-hosted afterparty during Milan Fashion Week on September 20. \n\nPhotos showed the actress was only wearing her wedding band and had ditched the second bigger ring that she had been pictured wearing a couple days earlier at the Emmy Awards. \n\nShe was recently seen again at a Paris Fashion Week event where she deliberately flashed the wedding band on her finger to photographers. \n\nMeanwhile, a close RFK Jr. ally says he was shocked when the story about the Kennedy-Olivia Nuzzi relationship became public earlier this month because Bobby was always boasting that he’d long ago quelled his addictions – drug and sex. \n\n‘But, clearly, he’s the same old Bobby, who I’ve known since college, in the days when his dorm room had girls lined up to have sex with him,’ the insider said. \n\n‘Bobby’s like a sexual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde – he’s been that way for decades — and when the opportunity arises with a woman – in his case, just about any woman — the monster side surfaces and controls his brain. I suspect that’s what happened once again when he got entangled in his online sexual relationship with Olivia.’\n\nAs a journalist and bestselling author who has covered the Kennedys for years, two of my thirteen books have been about the legendary family, and the most recent is the only biography of the troubled namesake of assassinated Senator Robert Kennedy, entitled, ‘RFK JR. and the Dark Side of the Dream.’\n\nAs part of my several years of research for the book, I probed Kennedy’s life – from his troubled teen years when his father was murdered and his mother, Ethel Skakel Kennedy, all but abandoned him, turning over his upbringing to a longtime gay family friend, to his years of drug addiction, including, but not limited to heroin, which he would score in Harlem. \n\n‘I had impulses,’ he said at the time, ‘then it turned into something else.’\n\nI looked into his three marriages. In two of them, his obsessive womanizing would play a role in the unions’ failing. And now it appears his third marriage, with Hines, is nearing an end because of the sexting affair.\n\nKennedy wed Hines in the storied Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, on August 2, 2014 – a little over two years after his second wife, Mary Richardson, mother of four of his six children, had hanged herself at age 52 in an old garage on Kennedy’s estate in bucolic and wealthy Mount Kisco, New York. \n\nBefore her tragic suicide Bobby had been interviewed for a story in Oprah Winfrey’s popular O Magazine, and he blatantly declared: ‘I think Mary would call me a pretty good husband.’\n\nBut that was far from true, given his womanizing, Mary Richardson was a very troubled and cuckolded spouse, according to numerous close sources.\n\nConfidantes of Mary told me that she became aware of his womanizing — a lot of affairs, some of them long-term – ‘and was furious’ – just like his next wife, Hines, is said to be years later.\n\nThe future presidential hopeful’s come-ons to females had become legend.\n\nWhen he was in Alcoholics Anonymous, he made a ‘sexual advance’ on another member. \n\nAt dinner parties, he was known to touch the legs and fondle female dinner guests seated on either side of him.\n\nAs one credible source revealed: ‘He would be at the dinner table and his hands would go all up their legs or skirts. The Kennedy aura, however, kept them from saying, ‘You’re an a**hole.’\n\nOn at least one occasion, Kennedy’s ‘inappropriate behavior,’ included strutting around with a towel wrapped around his waist, then dropped it, exposing his genitals to an innocent female.\n\nAt a private and posh gym and health club in Westchester County, New York, Bobby began building up his body , using an Arnold Schwarzenegger wannabe kind of guy’ as his trainer, and demanding the maximum amount of weight – eight hundred to a thousand pounds placed on the leg press machine. \n\nThen married to Mary Richardson, he was building his body to attract other women, and was successful, including with a fit blonde in her thirties – a married mother, according a longtime club source.\n\nBobby and the woman had a more intimate relationship outside the gym – they would ‘rendezvous’ in the club’s parking lot, the insider claimed.\n\nBobby infuriated his second wife, Mary, when he began holding meetings of members from a local branch of Tennessee-headquartered Sexaholics Anonymous, at the Kennedy family home in Mount Kisko. \n\nBut Mary ended the practice fearing it was dangerous having strange men with sexual addiction problems around the house, especially when the Kennedy children were there.\n\nMary once confided to a friend that Bobby had tried to lure her into a threesome, but she was sickened by the invitation and refused.\n\nAt one point, Bobby’s cell phone directory contained the first names and telephone numbers of more than forty women located all over the U.S., Canada, and even Paris.\n\nMoreover, he was said to have used the name ‘Robert Strong’ as an alias when he travelled, apparently to hide his famous Kennedy name from women he met on the road.\n\nWhile Mary Richardson was very much aware of Bobby’s womanizing, she was shocked when she learned from a confidante that her husband was having an affair with Cheryl Hines. \n\nMary claimed she had introduced Hines to Bobby at a charity event, although Bobby and Hines asserted their friend, the comedian Larry David, had made the introduction.\n\nDavid once made a prediction to Bobby after he tied the knot with Cheryl. He told him: ‘Nothing you will ever do will rattle her.’\n\nToday, Larry David, who played Hines quirky and neurotic Jewish husband on Curb Your Enthusiasm, may have to eat those words.\n\nAs a longtime confidant of Bobby’s once said: ‘Any woman who gets involved with Bobby does so with her eyes open… Any woman who thinks they’re going to change Bobby is misguided and has to understand what she’s getting into with him.\n\n‘You can hate it, you can make excuses for it, you can do whatever you want to do, it doesn’t change the fact that he has a long history of doing certain things. And if you think, Wow, I’ll be different, then you’re f**ked.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCheryl Hines was seen without her wedding ring on a coffee with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Robert F.

Semi-trailers have formed a perimeter around the fairgrounds so nobody outside can see in, a contrast to the summer's rally where spectators had a clear vantage point inside from outside the rally perimeter.\n\nAdditionally, the unmanned building that Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to scale and get a clear shot at Trump is now barely visible, with semi-trailers and a tall riser placed in between. Multiple counter snipers are making themselves very visible on the roof of every surrounding building.\n\nSaturday's rally is expected to feature extensive programming focused on remembering the events of July 13, as well as honoring the resiliency of the Butler community before the former president takes the stage to finish his speech from the summer.\n\nThe campaign is also dedicating several moments throughout the program to Corey Comperatore, the rallygoer who was killed while shielding his family. His firefighter uniform is in the stands of where he was sitting in July in memory of him.\n\nSeveral first responders spoke ahead of Trump, including the doctor who was attending Trump's rally and attempted to save Comperatore's life along with Sally Sherry, an ER nurse who helped treat Trump.\n\n\"The man that we all see on TV with the strong personality, who sometimes doesn't mince words, or who is seen as a wealthy, powerful businessman, was not the man that I stood beside that evening. What I saw was a man that in the aftermath of one of the most terrifying experiences of his life, showed resiliency,\" Sherry said.\n\n\"He showed strength and courage. He showed that his family was at the forefront. He was a husband, a father and a grandfather. He was compassionate and grateful,\" she continued.\n\nMany of the rally attendees ABC News spoke with on Saturday said they were here in July, clearly remembering the moment shots rang out in the midst of Trump's speech nearly three months ago.\n\nThey said the violence and tragedy that took place here on July 13 did not discourage them from coming back, instead the experience reinforced their support for Trump.\n\n\"There's an electricity that's here in this crowd,\" said Barry Murray, 29, of Butler, Pennsylvania, who was at the July rally with his girlfriend. \"I think a word that could describe it is, altogether, is just strength – strength and unity. I think one of the main goals of being the leader of a nation like America is to be able to unite people, not divide people.\"\n\nBrooke Goshen of Beaver, Pennsylvania – a mother of four – attended the July rally with two of her teenage kids and came back to Butler Farm Show with one of them.\n\n\"I knew that the security presence was gonna be upgraded a lot this time, so we decided to give it a shot and come back to this historic rally,\" Goshen told ABC News about her decision to come back. She also said she was excited to see Elon Musk.\n\nDave Nacey of Apollo, Pennsylvania, wasn't at the July Butler rally but decided to attend today's rally because he felt the need to show more support today.\n\n\"I feel that the support needs to be there 100% from everybody,\" Nacey said.","summary":"Donald Trump's return to Butler marked by heightened security and reflective supporters.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-return-butler-marked-heightened-security-reflective-supporters/story?id=114532212","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/75ae4987-99e3-4a26-b687-42b847cc5fe5/GettyImages-2176070505_1728167094617_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:41:56","author":"Lalee Ibssa","authors":["Lalee Ibssa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.193},{"id":258612968,"title":"Vice President Kamala Harris to Visit Asheville, North Carolina to Survey Damage from Hurricane Helene","text":"ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged ongoing federal support and praised the “heroes among us” as she visited North Carolina on Saturday in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, her second trip in four days to the disaster zone.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee arrived there one day after a stop in the state by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster.\n\nHarris opened her visit by attending a briefing with state and local officials, where she thanked “those who are in the room and those who are out there right now working around the clock.”\n\nShe promised federal assistance would continue to flow and added praise for the “strangers who are helping each other out, giving people shelter and food and friendship and fellowship.”\n\nDespite Trump’s claims that the federal response in the state has been “lousy,” Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said the state was “deeply grateful for the federal resources that we have. FEMA has been on the ground with us since the very beginning,” he said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAfter her briefing, Harris helped pack toiletries into aid kits at a distribution center, where she met Angelica Wind from hard-hit Asheville, who was there to volunteer with her daughter and a friend even though Wind said her own family was still without power and people were “just surviving.”\n\n“There’s a lot of resilience,” Wind told Harris, adding that, “We want to make sure people don’t forget about us.”\n\nHarris assured her the federal government was “here for the long haul.”\n\nMelissa Funderbunk told Harris about driving a truck carrying assistance to people in remote Morganton, “where people weren’t coming.”\n\n“You are the heroes among us,” Harris said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.\n\nThe two have been vocal and visible about the government’s willingness to help, and the administration’s efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.\n\nIn a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund “has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year.” He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program.\n\nMore than 200 people have died. It’s the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.\n\nBut in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.\n\nTrump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn’t doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene’s aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it “one of the great scams of all time.”\n\nALSO SEE: Donations continue ramping up one week after Helene ravages western NC\n\nDuring a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited “lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular.” In fact, Cooper said this week that more than 50,000 people have registered for FEMA assistance and about $6 million has been paid out.\n\nBiden has suggested that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is withholding money for disaster relief needs.\n\nHarris’ visits present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She’s trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known – showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy – in the closing stretch of her White House campaign.\n\nUntil this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president. That duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms, and more.\n\nHarris said this week that she wanted to “personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary.” She expressed admiration for how “people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.”\n\nShe said that shows “the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,” an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail.\n\n“We are here for the long haul,” she said.\n\nNorth Carolina is said to be a battleground state that could tip the fate of this year’s election in November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. &#8212; Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris pledged ongoing federal support&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vice President Kamala Harris to Visit Asheville, North Carolina to Survey Damage from Hurricane Helene first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/vice-president-kamala-harris-to-visit-asheville-north-carolina-to-survey-damage-from-hurricane-helene/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Hurricane-Helene-Vice-President-Kamala-Harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:35:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":258614232,"title":"Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters - The Associated Press","text":"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to “avoid what is harsh and hateful” in the heat of election season.\n\nDallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith’s twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election. \n\nThe devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.\n\n“As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,” said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.\n\nThe faith’s leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith’s 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.\n\nLatter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House. \n\nSome church members say the former president’s demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent’s inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church’s teachings. \n\nTrump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.\n\nHarris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.\n\nOne of Harris’ greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.\n\nIt is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump’s brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump’s support for Israel.\n\n“He’s the lesser of two evils,” said Idos, 70. “The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that’s kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.”\n\nThe religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships. \n\nSammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.\n\n“Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that’s not something I think I can stand by,” he said. \n\nUndecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics. \n\nThe couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn’t really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.\n\n“The important thing about any general conference message is that it’s general and then we’re asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,” Jenna said. “People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives.”","summary":"Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/407d16e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+23/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ff5%2F81%2F32f612193c6b89b6f7736b72541e%2F6a80033473c44a57b8f956089394e290","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:34:00","author":"Hannah Schoenbaum","authors":["Hannah Schoenbaum"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":258615866,"title":"Comedian Janey Godley, 63, shares heartwarming moment she is reunited with her beloved sausage dog Honey as she receives cancer care in hospice","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 6th 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk JUMPS on stage to join Trump as he re-enacts ex-president's 'fight, fight, fight' moment in front of 'Super Bowl-sized' crowd\n\nAmanda Abbington reveals she quit Strictly over cancer scare - as she goes to war with Giovanni Pernice AGAIN\n\nRevealed: King Charles eats lunch for the first time - and his meal of choice is a millennial's favourite\n\nI was juggling looking after my child with a busy job and doctors thought I had tonsilitis - then they found cancer\n\nDAN HODGES: The British people are being taken for fools.

Cancer affects two in one people, and it's affected me.'\nShe also thanked charities who have supported her throughout her health journey.\nLast week Janey revealed Liam Neeson had finally received the handmade scarf she promised she would knit him.\nTaking to Instagram on Saturday, Janey shared snaps of Liam wrapped in the colourful gift as she wrote: 'The Liam Neeson scarf has arrived in New York and he loves it'. \nThe Scottish star revealed last March during her BBC podcast The C Bomb that she was knitting Liam a scarf after she found out he was a fan of her voiceover sketches.\nShe joked at the time: 'He will need to get it before I die that's for sure.'\nDuring the pandemic Janey gained viral recognition for her voiceovers of politician's videos on TV, for example Nicola Sturgeon or Boris Johnson.\nThe star then went on to do a voiceover of Liam's famous scene from Taken where he says: 'I have a special set of skills. You've got my daughter I'm coming after you.'\n\nThe Scottish-born comedian announced earlier in September that she had been forced to cancel her upcoming UK tour amid ongoing treatment (pictured in November 2019)\n\nLast week Janey revealed Liam Neeson had finally received the handmade scarf she promised she would knit him and the actor seemed seemed over the moon after receiving the gift \nShe told fans: 'I did a video of that, and it was him lifting up the phone and me going: \"Listen son there is a big spider in my room. See if you bring up a wee cup or something that would be good\".\n'And he loved it and he liked it. So then my pal said to him \"She's started jazz knitting.\" Which is basically knitting without following a pattern.\n'It's horrendous. It is like I vomited up a knickerbocker glory. But I am knitting him this scarf, he will need to get it before I die, that's for sure.'\nThe star joked: 'Because the good news is you see the thing is when I die I don't have to grieve, as I will be dead and he will have a great big scarf around his neck and you will see a picture and think \"That's that creepy scarf she knitted for him\".'\nAnd seven months later the scarf has made its way to Liam who looked overjoyed as he kissed the knitted garment.\nTikTokGlasgowJaney GodleyLiam Neeson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nComedian Janey Godley, 63, shares heartwarming moment she is reunited with her beloved sausage dog Honey as she receives cancer care in hospice\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVEHas Miranda Hart finally landed a perfect husband at the tender age of 51?

The community’s coming together.”\n\nBefore visiting the donation center, Harris greeted National Guard members while at Charlotte Air National Guard Base who were loading military aircrafts with pallets of emergency aid to be flown to communities throughout western North Carolina.\n\nHarris also met with officials on Saturday afternoon where she received updates on recovery efforts for the area and announced that Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, had been added to the federal disaster declaration. Helene, a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall along Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 26, has killed more than 200 people and left thousands without power or drinkable water.\n\n“For the folks who are local, I also know what this means for each of you as a leader, to be a leader at a time that your own homes, your families, your friends, people you know, your community, has been directly hit,” Harris said during remarks ahead of a briefing at the North Carolina Air National Guard, which is on the grounds of the airport.\n\nHarris' visit comes exactly one month ahead of the 2024 presidential election, in which she is locked in a tight race against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. North Carolina is viewed as a pivotal swing state, and the speed and effectiveness of Biden administration’s response efforts could have ramifications on the race. \n\nTrump has also visited disaster-struck regions in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina over the last few days. \n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's latest updates. \n\nWhere is Tim Walz?\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, headlined a fundraising event on Saturday for the Harris campaign in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThe governor spent at least an hour at the event, which was being held at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Following his stop in Cincinnati, Walz left for Cleveland where he was set to headline another fundraising event.\n\n– Rebecca Morin and Sharon Coolidge, USA TODAY Network\n\n Another hurricane expected to hit Florida after Helene\n\nAs clean-up from Tropical Storm Helene continues across the Southeast, the National Hurricane Center has issued advisories for at least three storm systems. One of those could make landfall on the West Coast of Florida in the next few days.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Saturday said Tropical Storm Milton is expected to develop into a \"near major hurricane,\" with the risk of life-threatening impacts. The forecast shows the storm approaching the Gulf coast of Florida with winds of 110 mph ahead of a possible mid-week landfall near Tampa.\n\nForecasters are also tracking two other storm systems: Hurricane Kirk, a Category 3 storm over open ocean in the Atlantic and Hurricane Leslie, a Category 1 storm following behind Kirk. Neither were expected to make landfall as of Saturday.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhat FEMA support in North Carolina looks like\n\nAs communities across North Carolina continue to recover from Hurricane Helene, FEMA has offered support and staff to the state. Here is a breakdown of what it looks like, according to the White House:\n\n$26 million in housing and other types of assistance to more than 25,000 households in North Carolina.More than 5,400,000 meals and 6,300,000 liters of water shipped to the state.700 FEMA staff members on the ground. More than 1,200 urban search and rescue personnel are in North Carolina and the teams have rescued or supported more than 3,200 survivors as of Saturday.74% of originally reported power outages have been restored.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nNC Gov. Roy Cooper thanks FEMA for Helene recover response\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper thanked FEMA for its “massive unprecedented response” in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n“FEMA has been on the ground with us from the very beginning of this,” Cooper told reporters on Saturday before his briefing with Harris. \n\nDuring his remarks, Cooper said 68 people died from the storm, which is the official state count. However, local authorities said they believe there are more than 100 who have died from the storm across North Carolina.\n\nAs of Saturday, the USA TODAY Network analysis of Helene deaths increased to 228 across the states impacted by the storm.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nFEMA's response to Hurricane Helene\n\nFEMA has deployed more than 1,500 workers to impacted areas in the southeast, officials said. The agency has shipped more than 11.5 million million meals, more than 12.6 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 400,000 tarps to regions affected by Helene. FEMA has so far approved more than $45 million in up-front emergency aid to victims.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n Biden calls on Congress to pass disaster relief\n\nPresident Joe Biden urged members of Congress to replenish critical disaster relief programs that have run out of money, or that soon could run out.\n\nIn a Friday night letter to congressional leaders, Biden warned that the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program is set to run out of funds in a matter of weeks. He also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief funds could face a shortfall by the end of the year. Biden called on Congress to restore funding and provide FEMA with additional resources.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested Congress can wait until after the election to pass Hurricane relief measures.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n Helene among top deadliest storms in U.S. history\n\nAs search and rescue teams continue to examine stream beds and debris piles across North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, the toll of lives lost in Helene's horrific flooding mounts daily. At least 214 people have died as a result of the storm. Hundreds are still missing and officials expect the number to rise.\n\nBut already Helene is the fourth deadliest landfalling hurricane in the mainland U.S. since 1950. It ranks behind Hurricane's Katrina (2005), Audrey (1957 and Camille (1969).\n\n– Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\n Where is Trump today?\n\nDonald Trump is holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president returns to the venue where he first survived an assassination attempt in July.\n\nTrump held a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Friday evening.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\n Disaster politics in the 2024 presidential election\n\nDisaster politics are a staple of presidential elections, and this year is no different. With just a month to go until the election, Donald Trump has sought to make Biden and Harris' Hurricane Helene a focus of the campaign.\n\n“There’s nobody that’s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they’re doing right now,” Trump said to supporters Thursday night in Saginaw, Michigan.\n\nTrump's indictment has included falsehoods - he claimed that federal disaster money went to migrants and that Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp had trouble reaching Biden, but neither were the case - and the 2024 Republican nominee for the White House has been accused of playing politics with disaster relief during his presidency.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n Harris vows \"long haul\" government relief efforts\n\nKamala Harris pledged \"long lasting\" federal support to get residents and neighborhoods battered by flooding from Helene \"back up and running\" during a visit to Augusta, Georgia earlier this week.\n\n\"We're here for the long haul,\" Harris said.\n\nThe Biden administration has so far approved requests from Georgia, Florida and North Carolina for the federal government to fully cover the state and local costs of debris removal, search and rescue efforts, mass-feeding and other hurricane-related emergency response activities.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n(This story has been updated with a new headline, information and photos.)","summary":"LIVE: Harris visits North Carolina for update on Helene recovery, helps at donation center  USA TODAY","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/05/kamala-harris-north-carolina-hurricane-helene/75531129007/","image":"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/05/USAT/75535328007-20241005-t-202350-z-802862909-rc-2-keaad-37-o-1-rtrmadp-3-usaelectionharris.JPG?crop=3487,1962,x0,y0&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:29:45","author":"Karissa Waddick,Rebecca Morin","authors":["Karissa Waddick","Rebecca Morin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":258615840,"title":"Forrest TRUMP!

While one in five in the UK said they would vote Trump, which has almost doubled from four years ago when Betfair ran the same survey.\n\nThose aged 18-24 are most likely to back Trump if given a vote, with 32 per cent saying they would vote for him, which has almost tripled since the last election (11 percent).\n\nBetfair spokesperson Sam Rosbottom said: 'Several US celebs have made a successful transition to politics. Trump himself fronted The Apprentice on TV over there, plus there was Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. So, we thought it would be fun to discover which stars the British people think would do a good job in the White House.\n\n'It's not surprising that a well-loved actor such as Hanks, famed for playing likable but strong characters on screen, tops the poll.\n\n'Other popular figures such as The Rock, and Oprah are also backed to be a good leader of the free world.\n\n'He's already taken over Twitter, could the White House be next? Almost one in five Brits believe Elon Musk would make a good US President.'\n\nThe Betfair poll found that the real Presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has captured the imagination of the British people, with 60 per cent of all those polled saying they are interested in the battle for the White House.\n\nBetfair Exchange, the world's leading peer-to-peer betting platform, has already seen more than £125m in wagers on the US Election markets with plenty more expected in the next month.\n\nFour years ago, the Betfair Exchange next President market broke all records to become the world's biggest ever betting event, with £1.7bn staked on Trump v Biden.","summary":"Britons would not be blamed to tune out of elections after going to the polls earlier this year.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13928195/Brits-pick-Tom-Hanks-President-Rock.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/05/22/90498929-0-image-m-13_1728165399676.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:29:41","author":"Editor,Jose Ramos","authors":["Editor","Jose Ramos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.252},{"id":258614050,"title":"Day in Photos: Butler Rally, Detained Activist, and Human Tower","text":"Support UsSHARELaw enforcement sharpshooters position themselves on a roof prior to a rally by Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, at the Butler Farm Show Inc. in Butler, Pa., on Oct. 05, 2024.

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended the meeting, which was “a masterclass” by Putin to mold the relatively new president’s approach to Ukraine, according to The Times.\n\nPutin told Trump that Ukraine was a “corrupt” and “fabricated country” and insisted Russia had “every right” to wield its authority over the nation,The Times reported.\n\nTrump reportedly told Putin he was considering giving weapons to Ukraine and asked: “What do you think?”\n\nThe Russian leader said that would be “a mistake.” Ukraine would only ask for more, he reportedly warned Trump. According to three American officials who were in Hamburg, the former president did not push back.\n\nTillerson reportedly said to “nervous” White House aides after the meeting: “We’ve got work to do to change the president’s mind on Ukraine.”\n\nFiona Hill, a member of Trump’s National Security Council staff who was in the German city for the summit and briefed about the meeting by Tillerson, told The Times: “Putin was basically telling [Trump] that you can’t trust Ukraine, and don’t give them anything.”\n\nShe added that Tillerson said Putin had done his “K.G.B. shtick” on Trump.\n\nTillerson was fired by Trump in March 2018. The former ExxonMobil chief executive later shared some insight into the meeting in Hamburg with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he reportedly said Trump was “out-prepared” by Putin.\n\n“We spent a lot of time in the conversation talking about how Putin seized every opportunity to push what he wanted,” a committee aide told the Washington Post at the time. “There was a discrepancy in preparation, and it created an unequal footing.”\n\nTrump slapped this down in a statement, saying he was “perfectly prepared” and he did “very well at those meetings.”\n\nTrump was first impeached by the House of Representatives in December 2019 after it was revealed he tried to have Zelensky investigate President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, over potential impropriety by threatening to withhold military aid to the former Soviet republic. \n\nThough the Senate acquitted him in 2020, Trump told Zelensky on a phone call in July 2019: “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.” He added: “Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.” \n\nUkraine has been front and center in the 2024 presidential campaign. When Trump met with Zelensky in New York last month, he used the opportunity to declare his support for the Ukrainian and Putin as he once again claimed that he will end the war. “We have a very good relationship,” he told reporters as he stood with Zelensky. \n\n“And I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin,” he added. “And if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly.”\n\nTrump had previously canceled plans to meet with the Ukrainian leader after Zelensky sparked GOP outrage by visiting the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.","summary":"Trump had only been in office for seven months when he met with Putin in Hamburg","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-putin-ukraine-war-b2624488.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/05/18/SEI219143562.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OQS7W5NG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:21:20","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":258612010,"title":"What are Trump and Harris’ views on marijuana laws?","text":"(NEXSTAR) — Marijuana legalization has long been a topic of political conversation, especially over the last year as talks about reclassifying it as a less dangerous drug have continued. \n\nWhile the federal process of rescheduling marijuana trudges on, some are looking at the Oval Office — and who will be moving in come January — in anticipation. \n\nSo where do presidential nominees Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stand on the matter?\n\nHarris on marijuana legalization\n\nHarris recently spoke on the issue for the first time since becoming the Democratic nominee during an extended interview with the sports and culture podcast “All the Smoke.”\n\nIn the interview, released Monday, Harris said she believes “we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior,” The Hill reports.\n\n“I just feel strongly people should not be going to jail for smoking weed,” she told hosts Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. “And we know historically what that has meant and who has gone to jail.” \n\nWhile she went further than President Joe Biden by expressing support for full legalization, Harris has been criticized for her stance on marijuana in the past. \n\nAs The Hill reports, Harris aggressively prosecuted marijuana-related crimes while district attorney and attorney general in San Francisco and California, respectively. When she was running for president in 2019, however, she called for nonviolent marijuana-related criminal offenses to be expunged.\n\nShe also spoke out about a failed 2010 ballot measure in the state that would have legalized and regulated marijuana. But once she became a senator, Harris co-sponsored legislation to end the federal prohibition of marijuana.\n\nHarris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently dodged a question on marijuana legalization and expressed support for it being left to individual states. \n\nTrump on marijuana legalization\n\nEarlier this year, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would vote yes on an amendment to legalize marijuana in Florida come Election Day.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” he wrote. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults to safe, tested product.”\n\nHe later added that he would work on marijuana reform if he is elected to a second term, expressing support for rescheduling the drug and working “with Congress to pass common sense laws.”\n\nWhen running for president in 2016, Trump said that marijuana legislation should be left to the states. While Trump was in office, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal.\n\nHis running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), previously voted against the SAFER Banking Act, explaining to a constituent that he feared the bill would “pave the way for more widespread marijuana use and federal legalization.”\n\nWhere Americans stand\n\nAbout 70% of American adults said marijuana should be legal in a Gallup poll taken last year, the highest level recorded by the polling firm since it first asked about marijuana policy in 1969. By contrast, only about one-third of respondents supported marijuana legalization 20 years ago.\n\nLast year’s Gallup poll showed the highest support for marijuana among young voters, a key demographic in seven presidential battleground states.\n\nAn analysis of national survey data published earlier this year found that an estimated 17.7 million people reported using marijuana daily or near-daily in 2022 — up dramatically from less than 1 million people in 1992. Though alcohol is still more widely used, the report marked the first time that the number of Americans who use marijuana just about every day surpassed the number who drink that often.\n\nNearly half the country has already legalized medical cannabis, recreational marijuana, or both as of 2024.\n\nThe Hill’s Nathaniel Weixel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n(NEXSTAR) — Marijuana legalization has long been a topic of political conversation,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: What are Trump and Harris&#8217; views on marijuana laws? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/what-are-trump-and-harris-views-on-marijuana-laws/","image":"https://www.wfla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2024/10/d42fd938352741a58754f8a2c03e454a-e1714501989306.jpg?w=800","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 22:15:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153}]}
