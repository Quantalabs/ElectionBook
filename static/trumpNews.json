No one was taken into custody.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Chef Geoff’s and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nShawn Townsend, president of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington, told Fox 5 that they were concerned about “the fear-mongering tactics” used on a number of D.C. restaurants.\n\n“There was no one detained or arrested that I’ve heard of but regardless of that fact, disrupting food service during lunch hours while restaurants are open is alarming,” he said. “There is a sense of fear… Immigrants make up a large amount of workers in our restaurants in the district.”\n\nThe Washingtonian reported that ICE agents also visited Millie’s in Spring Valley, Pupatella and Chang Chang in Dupont Circle, and Ghostburger in Shaw to demand I-9 forms.\n\nThe agents, who said they were doing “administrative work,” reportedly left Pupatella after staff referred them to the pizzeria’s corporate office.\n\n“No raiding, no anything,” Pupatella executive Natasha Neely told the magazine. “They didn’t even enter the building.”\n\nAt Millie’s, agents did not push back when the general manager denied their request to question employees just as the restaurant was opening for lunch.\n\n“They all came in all of the public entrances at the same time,” owner Bo Blair told The Washingtonian. “We were under the impression that they were focusing on trying to find criminals… And this is just a whole new level of harassment to our hard-working, law-abiding employees.”\n\nThe raids followed rumors on Monday that ICE agents would begin targeting D.C. restaurant staff and food delivery workers this week. \n\nThe raids are part of the government’s broader push to deliver President Donald Trump’s long-promised mass deportation blitz.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly sought to assure the public that deportations would target violent criminals. A CBS investigation earlier found, however, that hundreds of people have been deported despite having no criminal history.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents raided multiple restaurants in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, including one owned by the husband of CBS News anchor Norah O’Donnell.\n\nChef Geoff’s, an American fare restaurant founded by O’Donnell’s husband Geoff Tracy, was raided by nearly a dozen ICE agents on Tuesday morning, according to Fox 5.\n\nThe immigration agents, dressed in Homeland Security uniforms, reportedly asked to see the staff’s I-9 forms that verify their identity and employment authorization.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-ice-agents-raid-restaurant-owned-by-cbs-news-star-norah-odonnells-husband/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/2X4RP7PQZRGZXEEEORWKHJDKAI.jpg?smart=true&auth=6825c1d8c776bc143f49d60986698256d70db66f61304b67aded87cedb85b811&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 01:11:34","author":null},{"id":318580616,"title":"Mortgage holders tipped to get much-needed relief: NAB boss","text":"National Australia Bank boss Andrew Irvine says a combination of a stable government and falling interest rates will help guide the Australian economy as he reiterates calls for the cash rate to drop to 2.6 per cent by early 2026.\n\nIn welcome news for homeowners, the NAB chief executive used his half-yearly results to talk up the strength of the Australian economy while also calling for further support for households.\n\n“There’s no doubt these are challenging times, there’s all sorts of geopolitical uncertainties that we have to manage,” he said.\n\n“That being said, Australia is in good shape. We enter this period of instability in a strong position.\n\n“We have unemployment that’s very low, I believe we will see three or four base-rate reductions that will stimulate the domestic economy.”\n\nMr Irvine said global trade uncertainty from US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs remained a key source of risk going forward for the Australian economy and reiterated calls for the cast rate to drop.\n\n“The sound starting position of the Australian economy provides scope for a more stimulatory monetary policy response to support the recovery against potential headwinds, with the cash rate now forecast to decline from 4.1 per cent currently to 2.6 per cent by February 2026,” he said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia began its rate-cutting cycle in February, reducing the cash rate by 25 basis points from 4.35 per cent to 4.10 per cent. It held interest rates during its April meeting but is widely expected to cut on May 20.\n\nNAB economist Sally Auld on Tuesday said the RBA would cut the cash rate by 50 basis points in May, followed by 25 basis point cuts in July, August, November and February.\n\nThe major bank is expecting five cuts in this rate-cutting cycle, with the central bank needing to “catch up” with recent global developments.\n\nThis would take the cash rate down to 2.6 per cent and shave an estimated $526 off monthly repayments for the average $600,000 loan.\n\nNAB announced on Wednesday that its cash profit rose to $3.58bn for the six months to March 31, beating forecasts of cash earnings of $3.47bn and up 1 per cent on the prior corresponding period.\n\nBut NAB said its net interest margin, a key metric of profitability, slipped 2 basis points from the March 2024 half to 1.7 per cent.\n\nNAB’s interim dividend of 85 cents puts $2.6bn back in the hands of shareholders.\n\nMr Irvine said the Australian economy would also have the added benefit of a re-elected Labor government.\n\n“If I look ahead, I think the recent election results are good for Australia. They bring stability, they bring consistency and they provide the Labor government with a clear mandate to drive the policies that we need in this country to support further economic growth,” he said.\n\nNAB’s results follow rival big four bank Westpac, which announced a worse-than-expected result on Monday.\n\nFor the six months ending March 31, the bank’s net profit after tax fell 1 per cent to $3.3bn.","summary":"NAB predicts struggling mortgage holders will get some much-needed relief on the back of an outsized rate cut in May.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/business/mortgage-holders-tipped-to-get-much-needed-relief-nab-boss-c-18610579","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-18610579/1ae3d8527c4b0adf44bcbd492b192416d7b8ab97-16x9-x0y0w2048h1152.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 01:05:24","author":"Cameron Micallef,Cameron Micallefnew","authors":["Cameron Micallef","Cameron Micallefnew"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":318579280,"title":"Scott Bessent says US doesn't want to decouple from China ahead of scheduled meeting with Chinese counterpart","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their Chinese counterparts over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss economic matters, a significant first step in trade talks between the two global superpowers since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on \"Liberation Day.\" Bessent told \"The Ingraham Angle\" in an interview Tuesday that he was planning on traveling to Switzerland to negotiate with the Swiss and found out that the Chinese team would also be traveling through Europe. He did not explicitly mention which side called the other first, saying there were \"a lot of contact points over time.\" CHINA'S ECONOMIC WOES THREATEN REAL WAR AMID TARIFF BATTLE \"The world has been coming to the U.S. and China has been the missing piece,\" Bessent told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. The White House has been attempting to negotiate trade deals with numerous countries after Trump announced a 90-day pause in April on most so-called reciprocal tariffs, excluding China, which faces a 145% tariff. \"We have shared interests. This isn't sustainable, as I said before, especially on the Chinese side — and, you know, 145%, 125% is the equivalent of an embargo. We don't want to decouple — what we want is fair trade,\" Bessent said. No trade deals have officially been announced since the pause was implemented. The Treasury secretary said at a White House press briefing last week that the United States has had substantial talks with Japan and a deal with India could be imminent. SEN RAND PAUL: TERMINATE THE TRUMP TARIFFS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE Trump’s tariffs have created volatility in financial markets since his \"Liberation Day\" announcement on April 2. The president asked voters to remain patient as his economic plan takes shape, following the economy's 0.3% contraction in the first quarter of 2025. Bessent told Ingraham that he expects the upcoming scheduled meeting with Chinese officials will be more about de-escalation than a big trade deal. \"We've got to de-escalate before we can move forward,\" he added. Trump said in an interview with NBC’s \"Meet the Press\" with Kristen Welker that at some point he would have to lower the tariffs on China \"because otherwise, you could never do business with them.\" \"They want to do business very much… their economy is collapsing,\" he said. Bessent did not discuss potential changes in tariff percentages, saying he wouldn’t negotiate in public, but stated that \"everything is on the table.\" \"At the end of the day, the president has said that he's happy just to give all countries a number if the negotiations don't go well, and that's what we're doing with the other 17 important trading partners,\" he explained.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy LAURA FOX FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:34 BST, 7 May 2025 |Updated:01:39 BST, 7 May 2025 \n\nVictoria Beckham's rift with her son Brooklyn has become 'her worst nightmare,' sources have claimed.\nThe designer, 51, has been at the centre of a feud that has pitted her eldest son and his wife Nicola Peltz on one side, and the rest of the family on the other.\nThe Mail previously revealed Romeo's girlfriend Kim Turnbull is being made the 'scapegoat' in the feud between Brooklyn and David - with Nicola 'at the centre' of the rift.\nAnd sources have now revealed the true impact this has had on Victoria, particularly after she and David worked hard to rebuild relations with Nicola following a feud that emerged between the two women in the lead-up to her wedding in 2022.\nA source told The Sun: 'This is Victoria's worst nightmare. The thought of any of her children falling out gives her sleepless nights.\n'It's been difficult with Brooklyn since he met Nicola, and there's no denying that there was a family fall-out over their wedding.\n\nVictoria Beckham 's rift with her son Brooklyn has become 'her worst nightmare,' sources have claimed (pictured with husband David, sons Romeo and Cruz and daughter Harper)\n\nThe designer has been at the centre of a feud that has pitted her eldest son and his wife Nicola Peltz (pictured) on one side, and the rest of the family on the other\n'But Victoria and David have worked hard to get things back on track, so this is a real blow.'\nMailOnline has contacted a representative for Victoria Beckham for comment. \nIn recent days David's lavish 50th birthday celebrations have been overshadowed by the enduring rift that has pitted his eldest son Brooklyn against the rest of his family.\nBrooklyn and aspiring actress Nicola have been notably absent from all the various stages of his father's parties, fuelling much speculation in the media as to the cause.\nThe pair were not at David's birthday dinner at Core restaurant in Notting Hill, west London at the weekend.\nThey also failed to join David and Victoria and their other children Romeo, Cruz and Harper when the family flew to France for a day of celebrations on Friday.\nAnd they were also absent from a big family party at the Beckhams' £10million Cotswolds estate last Wednesday, when David and Victoria were joined by their parents and siblings.\nKim and Brooklyn were undeniably close for a brief period – as photographs of them together at the time show - but suggestions that they were ever an item are wide of the mark, according to well-informed sources who spoke to The Mail.\n\nSome conspiracy theories around the row have centred on Romeo's girlfriend, DJ and entrepreneur Kim Turnbull, 25, who was previously close with Brooklyn (both pictured in 2016) \n\nSources have now revealed the true impact this has had on Victoria, particularly after she and David worked hard to rebuild relations with Nicola following her wedding in 2022\nThat Kim has now been 'thrown to the wolves' as the reason behind the family row is 'deeply upsetting' to Brooklyn's parents and brothers. \nIn fact, younger brother Cruz, 20, personally shut down the gossip recently when he responded to an Instagram post showing a picture of Romeo and Kim together.\nIn a now-deleted message, one user commented: 'It's appropriate to date your brother's ex too? Cool.'\nCruz replied: 'Brooklyn and Kim never dated.'\nOne friend told the Mail's Katie Hind at the weekend: 'This is nothing to do with Kim and is all about Nicola.\n'All David and Victoria want is their son back – and they will be there to welcome him any time.'\nFamily friends claim Brooklyn's wife has a pattern of 'starting an argument' before family events and then preventing her husband from attending.\nSome believe that friends of Nicola have been behind the briefings about Kim being the cause of Brooklyn's rift with his family, some of which went so far to claim that he had told them he refused to come to any event at which Kim was present.\nA source close to the family told MailOnline: 'Brooklyn was close to Kim because she was dating Rocco and they all hung out in a tightknit friendship group. But that was years ago. Brooklyn and Kim were close, but there was never any romance.\n'It seems Nicola doesn't like Brooklyn spending any time with the Beckhams full stop and is using his previous closeness to Kim and her getting in with the family as a reason to not be around them. She denies it, but Nicola has been controlling him since the wedding. The family - including the brothers - have had enough of it.\n'This is the narrative that's been put out to other news outlets, that Romeo is dating his brother's ex-girlfriend - and that's really weird, so that's why they wouldn't want to be around the family when she is there.\n'But none of this is true. And it's really upset Romeo and his parents because Kim is seemingly being used by Nicola as a reason to start the rift. Romeo is furious at the suggestion that he would bring an ex-girlfriend of Brooklyn into the family when there never was any romance.'\nKim looked comfortable posing with the famously tight-knit Beckham family in group pictures shared of them online over the past few months, most recently at David's birthday celebrations.\nAccording to TMZ, Brooklyn and Nicola requested to privately see David on his own to celebrate his birthday away from Romeo and Kim.\nThe publication claimed Brooklyn and Nicola 'would not be present at any public family events that Kim is at for the foreseeable' after things started to 'go south in December'.\nBut it has since been suggested that Brooklyn told his parents that he would be around to celebrate David's birthday, before his screeching U-turn on the matter.\nThe couple apparently flew to the UK with the 'sole purpose' of celebrating with David but they were apparently told their options were to attend the family events or not at all.\nThe US publication also suggested that Brooklyn and Nicola reached out privately to wish David a happy birthday on the big day.\nIt was claimed Brooklyn and Nicola pulled out of attending the Met Gala with the intention of attending David's birthday party, but were no shows at both events.\nA source told The Sun, Brooklyn was planning to attending David's 50th birthday party, but felt too uncomfortable to come after he felt Nicola was being blamed for the rift with his family.\nClaims that Brooklyn and Nicola were rebuffed when they asked David and Victoria to celebrate David's birthday privately were also said to be untrue. \nSources close to Nicola told US website TMZ they wanted 'to get together privately' to avoid Romeo's girlfriend Kim Turnbull as the couple are said to 'have a problem' with her.\nBrooklyn missed out on David's early celebrations in Miami last month as well as parties in the Cotswolds, France and London this week.\nFollowing the birthday party snub, it was revealed Brooklyn also declined an invitation by his father to join him and his brothers on a 'boys' fishing trip to celebrate his 50th.\nThe Mail revealed David invited Brooklyn on a short break six months ago when he began planning, yet his son failed to go despite arriving in the UK the day he went with Romeo and Cruz.\nSources have suggested that Brooklyn's decision was influenced by his American actress wife Nicola, 30.\n'Brooklyn was asked to join them ages ago,' one claimed.\n'Then he came to London in time but he didn't go. Once again David made the best of things and had a great time with Cruz and Romeo.'\nDavid still offered an olive branch to his son as he shared snaps from the trip, as he captioned one of his posts: 'You were missed @brooklynbeckham.' \n\nFriends claim Nicola has a pattern of 'starting an argument' before family events and then preventing her husband from attending\n\nOne friend told the Mail's Katie Hind at the weekend: 'This is nothing to do with Kim and is all about Nicola' (Kim is pictured during a recent Maldives holiday) \nOn Saturday, the family celebrated with A-list pals including Tom Cruise and David's former teammates at three Michelin-star Core in Kensington, West London.\nDuring the party, Romeo stepped up in older brother Brooklyn's absence as he delivered a speech.\nRomeo reportedly told guests: 'Good evening everyone. I would like to start by thanking you all for being here tonight. \n'I know without many of you in here tonight he wouldn't be half of the man he is today. But to the man of the moment...'\nBut as the party continued at the restaurant into the early hours, neighbours complained leading to a visit from two council officers at 3:35am. \nKensington and Chelsea Council told MailOnline that advice was given to minimise disruption and onlookers revealed that the music stopped immediately. \nNicola Peltz\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVictoria Beckham 'is suffering her worst nightmare during rift with son Brooklyn after she and husband David worked to rebuild relations with his wife Nicola Peltz'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

She’s a horrible, horrible human being, and I think she’s a total crook, there’s no question about it — but that’s just my opinion,” Trump said.\n\n“Pam’s gonna have to do what she wants,” Trump added.\n\n“She’s a very bad person. She’s a very, very bad — a very bad person who campaigned solely on ‘I’m going to get Donald Trump’ over and over again. She’s a sick person. But that has nothing to do with what Pam does. Pam is going to do what’s right. She always does. I’ve known her a long time.”\n\nA spokesperson for James, who has denied wrongdoing, said the attorney general will not respond to personal attacks. \n\n“AG James is focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers and upholding the law – not personal attacks, no matter who they come from,” the spox said. \n\nThe elected Democrat last February won a $364 million judgment after accusing Trump of inflating the value of his assets, including to secure more favorable loan terms. As part of the judgment, Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr. were ordered to pay $4 million each.\n\nAs of last month, the size of the penalties topped $500 million due to the accrual of interest as Trump appeals.\n\nThe allegations against James also stem from the details of financial documents.\n\nPulte’s criminal referral, addressed to Bondi, cites media reports about “multiple instances” in which James allegedly “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government-backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.”\n\n“This has potentially included 1) falsifying residence status for a Norfolk, Virginia-based home in order to secure a lower mortgage rate and 2) misrepresenting property descriptions to meet stringent requirements for government-backed loans and government assistance,” Pulte wrote.\n\nIn August 2023, James allegedly said in documents that the Norfolk home would be her primary residence — despite listing her home address as being in New York on other forms.\n\n“Primary residence mortgages receive more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates than secondary residence mortgages,” Pulte wrote.\n\nJames also allegedly listed a five-unit Brooklyn residence that she has owned since 2001 as having only four units — allowing her to meet the eligibility requirement for Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac “conforming loans” that are “subject to a cap of four dwellings per property,” Pulte wrote.\n\n“A building that exceeds four units must be treated as a multifamily property, and typically has larger down payment requirements and higher interest rates terms — with interest rates being between 0.75-1 percent higher — due to lenders viewing multifamily loans as significantly riskier,” the criminal referral says.\n\nJames’ personal attorney, Abbe Lowell, denied the allegations in an April 24 letter to Bondi, saying there was a misunderstanding about both instances.\n\nLowell wrote that the Norfolk documents were not fraudulent because James’ niece, Shamice Thompson-Hairston, was to occupy that home and that the document “mistakenly stated the property to be Ms. James’ principal residence.”\n\nThe attorney argued that James didn’t lie about the Brooklyn property having four units rather than five because “the property has functioned as a four-unit residence for the past 24 years since Ms. James bought it” and that its basement has been unoccupied.","summary":"\"She's a very bad person.

Palestinians are exhausted and hopeless, pummeled by 19 months of heavy bombing. Families of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza are terrified that the possibility of a ceasefire is slipping further away.\n\n“What’s left for you to bomb?” asked Moaz Kahlout, a displaced man from Gaza City who said many resort to GPS to locate the rubble of homes wiped out in the war.\n\nIsraeli officials said Monday that Cabinet ministers approved the plan to seize Gaza and remain in the Palestinian territory for an unspecified amount of time — news that came hours after the military chief said the army was calling up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers.\n\nDetails of the plan were not formally announced, and its exact timing and implementation were not clear. It may be another measure by Israel to try to pressure Hamas into making concessions in ceasefire negotiations.\n\nThe war began after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Israel says 59 captives remain in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that three more hostages have been confirmed dead, leaving 21 still believed alive.\n\nIsrael’s ensuing offensive has killed more than 52,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians in their count.\n\n“They destroyed us, displaced us and killed us,” said Enshirah Bahloul, a woman from the southern city of Khan Younis. “We want safety and peace in this world. We do not want to remain homeless, hungry, and thirsty.”\n\nSome Israelis are also opposed to the plan. Hundreds of people protested outside the parliament Monday as the government opened for its summer session. One person was arrested.\n\nFamilies of hostages held in Gaza are afraid of what an expanded military operation or seizure could mean for their relatives.\n\n“I don’t see the expansion of the war as a solution — it led us absolutely nowhere before. It feels like déjà vu from the year ago,” said Adi Alexander, father of Israeli-American Edan Alexander, a soldier captured in the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe father is pinning some hopes on Trump’s visit to the Middle East, set for next week. Israeli leaders have said they don't plan to expand the operation in Gaza until after Trump’s visit, leaving the door open for a possible deal. Trump isn't expected to visit Israel, but he and other American officials have frequently spoken about Edan Alexander, the last American-Israeli held in Gaza who is still believed to be alive.\n\nMoshe Lavi, the brother-in-law of Omri Miran, 48, the oldest hostage still believed to be alive, said the family was concerned about the plan.\n\n“We hope it’s merely a signal to Hamas that Israel is serious in its goal to dismantle its governmental and military capabilities as a leverage for negotiations, but it’s unclear whether this is an end or a means,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, every day, dozens of Palestinians gather outside a charity kitchen that distributes hot meals to displaced families in southern Gaza. Children thrust pots or buckets forward, pushing and shoving in a desperate attempt to bring food to their families.\n\n“What should we do?” asked Sara Younis, a woman from the southernmost city of Rafah, as she waited for a hot meal for her children. “There’s no food, no flour, nothing.”\n\nIsrael cut off Gaza from all imports in early March, leading to dire shortages of food, medicine and other supplies. Israel says the goal is to pressure Hamas to free the remaining hostages.\n\nAid organizations have warned that malnutrition and hunger are becoming increasingly prevalent in Gaza.

Meanwhile, the court itself, in line with a prior order binding the parties, is continuing to use the pseudonym.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, cited contract law principles in a 19-page opinion directing the government to try and get Lozano-Camargo back stateside “so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties’ binding Settlement Agreement.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nOn Monday, the government filed sealed arguments in an attempt to convince the judge to vacate her order. Along with those mysterious legal arguments, the government publicly filed a heavily redacted “Indicative Asylum Decision.”\n\nThe government’s public formal document explains why the Trump administration believes Lozano-Camargo’s underlying asylum claim will fail.\n\nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, however, the judge said the asylum case is too far removed from the current legal dispute to be dispositive.\n\n“I don’t think that this is a case about whether or not Cristian is going to eventually get asylum,” Gallagher said, according to a courtroom report by Politico. “Whether he ultimately receives asylum is not the issue. The issue is, and has always been, one of process.”\n\nThe issue, rather, is a 2024 settlement that limits how people who came to the country as unaccompanied minors can be deported, according to the judge. In Lozano-Camargo’s case, because he came to the U.S. when he was 17, that court-approved agreement means the government must wait until his asylum claim is extinguished.\n\n“It is an axiomatic principle of contract law that when a defendant breaches a contract, that defendant must restore the situation that existed before the breach,” Gallagher wrote. “In the case of Cristian, this requires putting him in the position ‘to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.’ In other words, under contract law principles, Cristian, and any other Class Member who has been removed in violation of the Settlement Agreement, must be returned to the United States to await adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.”\n\nAn accompanying April 23 order explains, in relevant part:\n\nDefendants are hereby ORDERED to facilitate Class Member Cristian’s return to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Facilitation includes, but is not limited to, a good faith request by Defendants to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States.\n\nIn her Tuesday order, Gallagher denied outright the government’s motion to vacate the facilitation demand. At the same time, the judge issued a brief stay that will expire on Thursday afternoon — in just over 48 hours — to give the Trump administration time to file an appeal.\n\nThe government argued the “indicative” ruling foreclosed the need for Lozano-Camargo to be returned, because he wouldn’t be granted asylum even if he were returned. But the court was not swayed.\n\n“It’s not a substitute for the process that was due,” the judge countered. “Process is important. We don’t skip to the end and say, ‘We all know how this is going to end up….’ My order requires that Cristian be returned to this country to get the process.”\n\nThe judge also previewed a possible series of next moves.\n\nIf the government is unsuccessful in getting the district court’s order overturned on appeal or stayed by the Fourth Circuit by the time the judge’s 48-hour stay is lifted, Gallagher said she would begin requiring the government to provide updates about the process of returning Lozano-Camargo to the U.S.\n\nThis, of course, tracks with the similar case of admittedly “wrongfully deported” Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father with protected status who was taken into custody by federal agents and quickly whisked away to CECOT along with Lozano-Camargo — despite court orders that he remain in the U.S. as well.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, overseeing the Abrego Garcia case, has also directed the government to facilitate his return. Additionally, Xinis has instructed the government to provide daily updates about their progress in getting Abrego Garcia back to the country, and increasingly found efforts have been lacking.\n\nGallagher previously referenced the earlier case as instructive.\n\n“[T]his Court is also guided by, and fully agrees with, the definition of ‘facilitate’; espoused by Judge Xinis and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Abrego Garcia,” the judge wrote last week. “Standing by and taking no action is not facilitation. In prior cases involving wrongfully removed individuals, courts have ordered, and the government has taken, affirmative steps toward facilitating return.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pictured signing executive orders in the White House&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Appointed by Trump Orders Return of Deported Man to the U.S. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-appointed-by-trump-orders-return-of-deported-man-to-the-u-s/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Trump-appointed-judge-demands-deported-mans-return-to-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 00:33:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":318578566,"title":"James Blunt cuts a dashing figure as he joins his wife Sofia at star-studded premiere for David Attenborough's new series","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, May 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral dead including children as India launches air strikes on 'terrorist camps' inside Pakistan: Islamabad says at least two war planes were shot down with dramatic escalation leaving nuclear-armed states teetering on the brink of war\n\nFury at 'two-tier Keir's' tax break for Indian workers that will make it cheaper to employ foreign staff - as bosses warn they will be forced to slash jobs\n\nIndia-Pakistan war fears: Live updates as Trump reacts to missile strikes raining down on Pakistani 'terror sites'\n\nI sent the same text to all my male friends.

He has a real passion for the drinks trade and runs his businesses alongside making music and touring. \n'James has put money into the brand and is looking forward to expanding the business with his partners. He has designs on his own booze too and his pub, The Fox and Pheasant in Chelsea, would stock it.'\nThe source added that James has a huge following and the celebrity drinks market is 'massive', so he's unlikely to struggle selling his own line.\nTen Four Drinks' website is set to launch soon, and its mission statement says it 'specialises in creating and managing beverage brands for the world’s greatest talent'.\nJames and Sofia led a host of stars at Sir David's event, including Cara Delevingne who chose a racy look.\nThe supermodel, 32, who never fails to make a statement, put on a very risqué display in the sexy mesh dress. \nJoining the actress and model at the celebration was her pregnant sister Poppy and pal Georgia May Jagger.\n\nYou're Beautiful singer James, 51, dressed up for the glitzy event in a sharp black tuxedo with a white shirt, adding some black shoes and a black bowtie\n\nHe put a loving arm around his wife Sofia Wellesley, 41, who looked nothing short of sensational on the red carpet wearing a royal blue one shoulder maxi dress\n\nJames's appearance comes after it was reported the musician is preparing to launch his own range of alcoholic beverages\nSir David's new film is the 'greatest message he's ever told', says its producer.\nOcean will see David delve further than ever before into the 'most important place on earth' - its oceans.\nAfter being significantly damaged by fishing and pollution, the film argues the sea is 'at a crossroads', but 'it can bounce back'.\nToby Nowlan, the movie's producer, said: 'This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours. This is the greatest message he's ever told.'\nNever-seen-before graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling - a common fishing practice around the world - has done to the seabed is said to feature in the film.\n\nCara Delevingne, 32, went braless and flashed her lace black thong as she led the star-studded attendees at David Attenborough's world premiere of Ocean \n\nA host of celebrities gathered at The Pelican in Notting Hill before heading to London's Royal Festival Hall for the main event, including Poppy Delevingne\n\nA-listers got together to celebrate the legendary environmentalist, 98, and his latest documentary which releases on his 99th birthday on Thursday (pictured with King Charles II)\n\nJoining the actress and model at the celebration was her pregnant sister Poppy (Left) and pal Georgia May Jagger (Right)\nThe pictures will display how the chain that trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind.\nThe process also releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the sea, something which contributes to global warming.\nSir David will examine inspirational stories of ocean recovery in areas where destructive fishing is banned - such as the Isle of Arran, Scotland and Hawaii.\nThe broadcasting icon contends that 'the ocean can recover faster than we can ever imagine'.\nBut 'we are running out of time', says Attenborough, who candidly admitted he may not be around to see our oceans saved as he 'nears the end of his life'. \nDuring the heartbreaking admission in the film's trailer, he said: 'When I first saw the sea as a young boy, it was thought of as a vast wilderness to be tamed and mastered for the benefit of humanity. \n'Now, as I approach the end of my life, we know the opposite is true. After living for nearly a hundred years on this planet, I now understand that the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.' \nHe added: 'Today, it is in such poor health I would find it hard not to lose hope were it not for the most remarkable discovery of all.'\n\nIn the film's trailer, Sir David made the heartbreaking admission that he is 'nearing the end of his life'\n\nThe environmentalist reveals in the new movie that 'the oceans can recover faster than we ever imagined'\n\nSir David is hugely popular for narrating the successful Planet Earth series [pictured, an image from Planet Earth III] as well as a host of other documentaries\n'If we save the sea, we save our world. After a lifetime of filming our planet, I'm sure nothing is more important.'\nSir David further made a reference to his years on this earth as he opened up about the extraordinary ocean discoveries over the decades and how important it is to preserve the health of the oceans.\n\n Cara Delevingne joins her pregnant sister Poppy at Ocean With David Attenborough world premiere \nHe said: 'My lifetime has coincided with the great age of ocean discovery. Over the last hundred years, scientists and explorers have revealed remarkable new species, epic migrations and dazzling, complex ecosystems beyond anything I could have imagined as a young man.\n'In this film, we share some of those wonderful discoveries, uncover why our ocean is in such poor health, and, perhaps most importantly, show how it can be restored to health. This could be the moment of change.\n'Nearly every country on Earth has just agreed, on paper, to achieve this bare minimum and protect a third of the ocean.\n'Together, we now face the challenge of making it happen.' \n\nSir David Attenborough has given us the best gift of all with his new documentary Ocean, writes BRIAN VINER\n\nOcean with David Attenborough (PG, 95 mins)\n\nSir David Attenborough turns 99 on Thursday and the best birthday present we can collectively give the great man is by going to the cinema to see his powerful new feature-length documentary, Ocean.\nThe film has its world premiere tonight at the Royal Festival Hall: an apt venue in a week of festivities commemorating VE Day 80 years ago.\nBut while in every news bulletin his surviving contemporaries are being asked to talk about the past, Attenborough wants only to look ahead. The older he gets, the more invested he seems to be in the future.\nIn a way, Ocean unfolds like a party political broadcast on behalf of the planet. Attenborough stresses that we can still counter the effects of climate change and diminishing biodiversity – and the key lies below the waves.\nHumanity’s potential salvation, improbable as it sounds, rests with the vast armies of ocean plankton, ‘the most abundant animal on earth’. They absorb about a third of all carbon dioxide emissions and produce more oxygen than all the world’s trees combined.\nBut as in all the best cinematic thrillers, Ocean dangles a lifeline while threatening to snatch it away. There’s a villain in this film.\nIt’s the deep-sea fishing industry, and in particular those enormous trawlers and dredgers that scrape all living things off the ocean bed. An entire eco-system is then boiled and processed to produce health supplements and pet food. And ‘all on board ship,’ adds Attenborough, with the nearest he ever gets to a sneer.\nAs always, his mighty age and experience, combined with that air of almost papal benevolence, imbue his every pronouncement with complete authority.\n\nSir David Attenborough's latest documentary stresses that we can still counter the effects of climate change and diminishing biodiversity\n\nKing Charles attended the premiere of 'Ocean with David Attenborough' at the Royal Festival Hall in London this evening\n\nBut as in all the best cinematic thrillers, Ocean dangles a lifeline while threatening to snatch it away (pictured: a still from Ocean with David Attenborough)\nWhen he declares that our understanding of the sub-oceanic world has been transformed in his lifetime, there is supporting black-and-white footage of him scuba-diving off the Great Barrier Reef in 1957, when he was already in his 30s and so taken aback by the spectacle ‘that I forgot, momentarily, to breathe’.\nYet this film is not typical of his astonishing TV series, the likes of Planet Earth and the Blue Planet.\nOcean is full of spectacular underwater camerawork (co-directors Toby Nowlan, Colin Butfield and Keith Scholey all deserve a name-check, and Prince Albert of Monaco, eye-catchingly, is among the executive producers), but unlike most Attenborough documentaries it does not linger on pouncing predators or mysterious mating rituals.\nOnly occasionally, his customary enthusiasm undimmed, does he introduce us to fascinating creatures. For instance to the peacock mantis shrimp, with its fabulously complex eyes that can detect UV light and rotate independently like angle-poise lamps.\nOr to boxer crabs, which for self-defence use clumps of venomous anemones as gloves, and look so much like pugilists limbering up for a fight that really there should be a promoter, a crustacean Frank Warren, standing just behind them.\nOn the whole, however, everything we see is to bolster Attenborough’s passionate message, namely that if the world’s nations, meeting next month at the UN Ocean Conference, can agree to create enough fully protected marine reserves, then humankind might be on to a winner.\nWhat fills him with hope, he explains, is the increasing evidence that our seas and oceans and everything in them can recover more quickly than previously he dared to think.\nThe few areas where intensive trawler-fishing has been stopped now positively overflow with marine life, and there’s a tiny protected zone of the Mediterranean, the most over-fished of all waters, which suggests even that can be reclaimed.\n\nAttenborough declares in his documentary that our understanding of the sub-oceanic world has been transformed in his lifetime\n\nOcean is full of spectacular underwater camerawork, but unlike most Attenborough documentaries it does not linger on pouncing predators or mysterious mating rituals\n\nOnly occasionally, his customary enthusiasm undimmed, does Attenborough introduce us to fascinating creatures, like the boxer crab\n\nWhat fills Attenborough with hope is the increasing evidence that our seas and oceans and everything in them can recover more quickly than previously he dared to think\nNone of this, he is keen to point out, imperils the fishing industry. It can continue to thrive, but must be better regulated.\nIn the meantime, populations of the giant black sea bass, once thought extinct, have rebounded. And nothing feeds Attenborough’s optimism like the fate of the whale.\nHunted virtually to extinction before commercial whaling was banned in 1986 – with almost three million killed in the 20th century alone - almost every species has made an astonishing comeback.\nHe vividly recalls thinking that it was curtains for the blue whale. But the largest animal ever to have existed has bounced back, and it’s a heck of a bounce.\nThere are blue whales being born today that will likely live for more than 100 years. Let us all hope that Attenborough matches and exceeds that tally. I fancy he still has plenty more to say.\nOcean with David Attenborough opens in cinemas Thursday\nDavid AttenboroughJames BluntSofia Wellesley\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJames Blunt cuts a dashing figure as he joins his wife Sofia at star-studded premiere for David Attenborough's new series\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

'When a university goes from being a university to becoming a political advocacy organization, it doesn't deserve nonprofit status.'\n\nHe went on to claim that 'students are self-censoring their remarks in classrooms [and] teachers are doing the same because you can't have real conversations. \n\n'Harvard should be a place where students go to learn and the best research gets done,' Ackman continued. 'It shouldn't be a place that is allowing pro-terrorist organizations on campus, that only allows certain kinds of thinking and speech on campus.\n\n'That's a political organization,' he argued. 'It's not a university.'\n\nBut he did not put the blame entirely on Harvard President Alan Gerber, who took over from embattled former President Claudine Gay.\n\nInstead, he pointed the finger at Harvard Corporation Lead Member Penny Pritzker.\n\n'If this were any other kind of corporation, the notion that she's still chairman of Harvard, leading the charge here and, in terms of Harvard, managed everything from COVID... to endowment management, to waste, to free speech, to who they hired as president of the university... It's time for a change in leadership in the board at Harvard.'\n\nAckman made similar arguments on Tuesday, when he said Harvard should not be entitled to taxpayer funds when the school wastes money on what he calls 'administrative bloat.'\n\nHe also criticized the school's investment policies, saying the Ivy League university is facing a financial crisis and that its $53 billion endowment is 'poorly invested.'\n\n'They have lost all future grants, their tax exemptions are at risk,' Ackman said on a panel at the Milken Institute Global Conference where 5,000 financiers, educators and scientists gather to discuss critical issues of the day.\n\n'It is all self-induced gross mismanagement and I think that the [Trump] administration is doing precisely the right thing now,' Ackman told the packed room.\n\nHe then again hit out at the school's governing board, saying it has become insular and that there is no mechanism to remove members the way there is in corporate America where investors can run board challenges.\n\n'What happens when you have a board that can self-appoint itself, and it becomes insular, and with a $53 billion endowment, they think, okay, we can just do whatever is on our mind,' Ackman argued.\n\nHis remarks came shortly after Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a letter to Harvard President Garber saying that 'Harvard is not eligible for any new grants from the federal government until they demonstrate responsible management at the university.'\n\nResearch grants would be the ones impacted - not federal student aid, which funnels through universities before providing students with financial relief. \n\nFor these grants to be re-issued, a senior Education Department official said Harvard 'would have to enter into a negotiation with the government to satisfy what the government says is in compliance with all federal laws.'\n\nThe senior official then railed against the Ivy League school's 'terrible behavior' saying that it has failed in four main areas - with anti-Semitism being at the top of the list.\n\n'They have become monolithically leftist and that DEI ideology connects to the anti-Semitism problem because they're teaching young people to make snap judgments about each other based on identity and skin color,' the senior official said. \n\nThe official said the two other areas where Harvard has failed include academic rigor and racial discrimination. \n\n'The Trump administration won't stand by as taxpayer dollars are used to support colleges that tolerate anti-Semitism or that support racist policies,' the official continued during a call with reporters Monday night.\n\nThe official added said that Harvard's endowment is 'virtually untaxed' and 'massive.'\n\n'It's larger than the GDP of many countries and it was only possible for them to amass that thanks to the blessings of this country that they do business in,' the official said. \n\nBut Garber has previously said he won't bend to the government, and even sued last month to overturn the funding freeze, pushing back against the government's 'sweeping and intrusive demands.'\n\nHe has since also called out Trump's plans to remove the school's tax-exempt status, which he told the Wall Street Journal is 'granted to educational institutions to enable them to successfully carry out their mission of education and, for research universities, of research.\n\n'Obviously, that would be severely impaired if we were to lose our tax-exempt status,' Garber said.","summary":"Billionaire Harvard alumnae Bill Ackman offered some brutal suggestions for his alma mater amid its ongoing battle with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14685227/Bill-Ackman-admission-Harvard-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/07/00/98109917-0-image-a-15_1746575869791.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/05/2331118077889498335/1024x576_MP4_2331118077889498335.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-07 00:22:49","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":318578560,"title":"Justin Baldoni hit with major setback amid legal battle with Blake Lively","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, May 7th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral dead including children as India launches air strikes on 'terrorist camps' inside Pakistan: Islamabad says at least two war planes were shot down with dramatic escalation leaving nuclear-armed states teetering on the brink of war\n\nFury at 'two-tier Keir's' tax break for Indian workers that will make it cheaper to employ foreign staff - as bosses warn they will be forced to slash jobs\n\nIndia-Pakistan war fears: Live updates as Trump reacts to missile strikes raining down on Pakistani 'terror sites'\n\nI sent the same text to all my male friends.

I am so incredibly proud of the impact this organization has made and deeply grateful for our staff, board, donors and partners.'\n\n Blake Lively takes major swipe at Justin Baldoni and his lawyer in Another Simple Favor \nAdding: 'Upon unanimous decision of the board of directors, today we will begin the process of sunsetting the Foundation.

With gratitude, Steve Sarowitz.

But I also acknowledge that many people don't have the opportunity to speak.'\n'So I do feel fortunate that I've been able to and as a woman, you have the ability to use your voice - that's kept me strong and helped me in my belief and my fight for the world to be safer for women and girls. It's a pretty simple thing.'\nShe and Baldoni are set to head to court in March 2026.\nMany fans focused on the fact that she was not wearing her wedding ring during her appearance. Instead, Blake wore a big cocktail ring on the middle finger of her left hand.\nThe fashionista doesn't always opt to wear her wedding ring for events, and frequently chooses statement costume jewelry.\nWhile on the show Lively said that her four kids, whom she shares with husband Ryan Reynolds, 48, have been her 'lifeline' during her 'intense' year.\nThe pair, who've been married since 2012, share daughters James, 10, Inez, eight, Betty, five, and son Olin, two.\nSpeaking of her kids — who Blake previously claimed were 'traumatized' by the Baldoni drama — the star said: 'It's no surprise it's been a pretty intense year and they're just my lifeline.'\n\nOn Thursday, Blake appeared on Seth Meyer's Late Night, her first talk show cince her legal dispute with Justin began in December\n'No matter what day I am having, I have to be Disneyland for them. It’s the best, it’s chaos.'\nHer late show appearance comes after Lively's legal woes have taken a turn for the worse, as she has now been subpoenaed by Baldoni's team.\nDailyMail.com has learned the papers were handed to her lawyers last week and asks for all communications – including texts and emails – related to Baldoni and the film that sparked the feud, It Ends With Us.\nLively has accused Baldoni of sexually harassing her during filming and claims he waged a negative publicity campaign against her.\nHe subsequently hit back and sued the actress and her husband Ryan for $400million, saying her allegations were defamatory and false, and accusing her of attempting to hijack the project.\nThe legal battle has already seen some zingers aired in court, among them Baldoni's claim that she tried to threaten him with Reynolds and erstwhile best friend Taylor Swift – referring to the superstars as 'my dragons' and comparing herself to Game of Thrones character Khaleesi.\nLively has also been accused of failing to read the novel on which the movie is based until well after filming started and forcing Baldoni and his family to sit in the basement during the premiere.\nOn top of that, some of her allegations have begun to look dubious such as the claim that Baldoni had nuzzled her neck and told her 'you smell so good' during a dancing scene.\n\nThe film at the heart of the feud, based on the 2016 bestseller by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and was a box office hit\nAlthough the mom-of-four claimed it had been filmed with microphones off, DailyMail.com obtained raw footage that showed the sound was on and that the conversation had instead been about the scent of Lively's fake tan.\nAttention has now turned to who else could be subpoenaed in the case, with Reynolds odds-on to have his communications scrutinized by Baldoni's team.\nLast week, speculation arose around Swift and Reynolds' friend Hugh Jackman with reports saying that they too are facing a legal grilling.\nSuperstar singer Swift is reportedly furious over being dragged into the case and has not been photographed with Lively for months.\nLast month, her boyfriend Travis Kelce unfollowed Reynolds in yet another sign that relations between the two couples have cooled.\nJustin BaldoniBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Baldoni hit with major setback amid legal battle with Blake Lively\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

That same day, he rescinded an order from his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, that allowed transgender troops to serve in the military.\n\nThen, on January 27, he unveiled a new directive, called “Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness”. It compared being transgender with adopting a “‘false’ gender identity”.\n\nSuch an identity, the order added, was not compatible with the “rigorous standards necessary for military service”.\n\n“Adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” the executive order said.\n\n“A man’s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”\n\nThat executive order sparked a slew of legal challenges, including the one at the centre of Tuesday’s Supreme Court order.\n\nIn that case, seven active-duty service members – as well as a civil rights organisation and another person hoping to enlist – argued that a ban on their transgender identity was discriminatory and unconstitutional.\n\nAdvocates for the group point out that the seven have together earned more than 70 medals for their service. The lead plaintiff, Commander Emily Shilling, had spent nearly two decades in the Navy, flying 60 missions as a combat pilot. Her lawyers estimate that nearly $20m has been invested in her training during that time.\n\nBut the Trump administration has argued that the presence of transgender troops is a liability for the military.\n\n“Another MASSIVE victory in the Supreme Court!” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on social media following Tuesday’s order.\n\n“President Trump and [Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth] are restoring a military that is focused on readiness and lethality.”\n\nHegseth also posted a short message, using an acronym for the Department of Defence: “No More Trans @ DoD.”\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has attempted to exclude transgender people from the armed forces. In July 2017, shortly after taking office for his first term, Trump announced a similar policy on the social media platform Twitter, now known as X.\n\n“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump wrote in consecutive posts, divided by ellipses.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the Supreme Court allowed that ban to take effect. Then, in 2021, Biden’s executive order nullified it.\n\nThe Trump administration pointed to its past success at the Supreme Court in its emergency appeal to lift the lower court’s injunction blocking its latest ban on transgender troops.\n\nThat temporary injunction was the decision of a US district court judge in Tacoma, Washington: Benjamin Settle. Himself a former army captain, Settle was named to his position under former President George W Bush, a Republican.\n\nIn March, Settle blocked the ban on transgender troops, saying that – while the government made reference to “military judgement” in its filings – its arguments showed an “absence of any evidence” that the restriction had to do with military matters.\n\n“The government’s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,” he wrote.\n\nOther judges have likewise issued injunctions, including District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, DC. She ruled in a case where 14 transgender service members sued against Trump’s ban, citing the right to equal protection under the law, enshrined in the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.\n\n“The cruel irony is that thousands of transgender servicemembers have sacrificed – some risking their lives – to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them,” Reyes wrote in her decision, issued shortly before Settle’s in March.\n\nOf the more than 2.1 million troops serving in the US military, less than 1 percent are estimated to be transgender.\n\nOne senior official estimated last year that there are only about 4,200 transgender service members on active duty, though advocates say that number could be an undercount, given the risk of violence and discrimination associated with being openly transgender.\n\nThe human rights groups Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation have been among those supporting transgender service members in their fight against Trump’s ban. The two organisations issued a joint statement on Tuesday denouncing the high court’s decision.\n\n“By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,” they wrote.\n\n“We remain steadfast in our belief that this ban violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and will ultimately be struck down.”","summary":"The court&#039;s decision split its nine-member bench along ideological lines, with its three left-leaning judges opposing.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/7/us-supreme-court-allows-ban-on-transgender-troops-to-take-effect?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25078007468007-1746573545.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 00:15:02","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.037},{"id":318581740,"title":"Trump’s Kennedy Center Head Throws Fit at Lin-Manuel Miranda and American Idol","text":"The Trump-backed interim president of the Kennedy Center lashed out at ABC Tuesday for the grave crime of including Lin-Manuel Miranda in American Idol.\n\nRic Grenell took to X after Monday’s episode revealed that Miranda, who has declined to perform at the venue after its Trump-led makeover, will be mentoring contestants in the lead-up to the season 23 finale later this month.\n\n“Shame on you, @AmericanIdol.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:10 BST, 7 May 2025 |Updated:01:11 BST, 7 May 2025 \n\nBlake Lively has been criticised by fans after impersonating a black woman in a Saturday Night Live skit that aired three years before her controversial plantation wedding to Ryan Reynolds. \nThe actress, 37, and her husband Ryan Reynolds are currently embroiled in a lawsuit with her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni after accusing him of sexual harassment as well as a smear campaign. The director then counter-sued the A-List couple, accusing them of defamation. \nAll of the parties dispute the allegations against them, but Blake has found herself under intense scrutiny for everything from 'mean girl' behaviour to feuds with other co-stars and her wedding to Ryan Reynolds on a former slave plantation in South Carolina - a move that has repeatedly attracted fierce criticism and for which Reynolds subsequently apologised.\nBlake has also face criticism by admitting she would wear a 'Scary Spice 'fro' and cover herself in bronzer while 'stalking' boys as a teenager, saying her disguise woulc make them 'think I was a Black girl'.\nNow it has emerged that she was embroiled in another incidence of impersonating a black woman when she took part in a Saturday Night Live sketch in 2009, entitled 'Virginiaca shops for a beaded skirt'. \nThe cilp, which was recently shared on X, reveals how Blake played Virginiaca's daughter as the pair clashed with a salesperson who insisted Blake's character 'cannot afford' a Prada skirt. \nUsing African American Vernacular English (AAVE) Blake - who was wearing a dark wig that appeared to resemble straightened afro hair - then shouted: 'You need to drop that attitude, I'm in no kind mood for that. I need my mama. Mama, where you is girl?'\n\nBlake Lively has been criticised for impersonating a black woman in a SNL skit from 15 years ago in latest blow after plantation wedding row and joking about blackface\n\nThe actress, 37, and her husband Ryan Reynolds are currently embroiled in a lawsuit with her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni after accusing him of sexual harassment\nHer mother, played by actor Kenan Thompson, then emerged from the changing room and they got into a debate with the shop assistant, with Blake continuing in the same pseduo accent: 'This my mom. You better stop tryna get up in her goody snack.'\nShe then proceeded to perform a twerk-like dance move while Virginiaca cheered her on, saying: 'Booty go round and round.'\nBlake's character told the assistant: 'You lucky my papa ain't up in here.' \nResharing the clip one fan took to Twitter to say: 'How did I miss Blake Lively playing a ratchet black woman on SNL?'\nTaking to the comments others were left shocked as they penned: 'Every day I like her less and less and less'; \n'Not funny at all'; 'hard to watch'; 'I couldn’t even get to the 1 minute mark, it was so cringe.' \n'No laughs. Did you hear laughs? 'Blake thought she was so funny. That wasn’t the least bit funny.'\nBlake and Ryan have previously come under fire for marrying at a plantation in South Carolina, as another asked: 'Was this before or after being married at a plantation?' \nOthers over on TikTok wrote: 'The second hand embarrassment… I’m surprised we didn’t cancel her for this';\n'I’ve never heard the live audience so silent on this show'; 'This was embarrassing to watch.'\n\nIn the sketch titled 'Virginiaca shops for a beaded skirt', Blake plays Virginiaca's daughter as the pair clash salesperson after he ensures Blake's character she 'cannot afford' a Prada skirt\n\nHer mother, played by Kenan Thompson, then emerges from the changing room as the pair get into a debate with the shop assistance \n\nTaking to the comments others were left shocked as they penned: 'Every day I like her less and less and less'\n\n Blake and Ryan have previously come under fire for marrying at a plantation in South Carolina , as another asked: 'Was this before or after being married at a plantation?'\n\n Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' plantation wedding scandal resurfaces amid legal war \nThe Hollywood couple famously tied the knot on September 9, 2012 during an intimate ceremony attended by several celebrity pals at Boone Hall Plantation & Gardens in South Carolina.\nThe stunning backdrop to the couple's nuptials has a dark history of slavery, with 'preserved' slave cabins and fields of cotton serving as a constant reminder of the horrors that once took place there.\nIt is one of America's oldest working plantations. In the 19th century it was owned by Henry and John Horlbeck who were in the brick business, building many of the public spaces in downtown Charleston using brick from the plantation.\nBy 1850, Boone Hall was producing 4,000,000 bricks per year using 85 slaves.\nYears after tying the knot, the Deadpool actor branded the wedding 'a giant f***ing mistake' in a 2020 interview after the pair were widely criticised for seemingly glamorising the former plantation where Black slaves suffered and died. \nThe 'shame' felt by the couple was so strong that they even decided to wed for a second time at their New York home.\nThey've also gone on to donate millions to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and have been vocal about their support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nHowever despite their efforts to right their wrongs, the scandal surrounding their wedding continues to linger online. \nMeanwhile the star has also been accused of wearing 'blackface' after admitting she would 'put bronzer' all over herself and wear a Scary Spice wig to 'stalk guys.'\nShe was slammed after a clip from 2006 showed her joking about using makeup and a wig to make herself look Black.\n\nThe Hollywood couple famously tied the knot on September 9, 2012 during an intimate ceremony at Boone Hall Plantation & Gardens in South Carolina \n\n12 feet by 30 feet slave cabins still remain on the property, and today house information about the slaves who lived there\nIn the resurfaced interview posted to TikTok, Blake and Justin Long, 46, were talking to MTV while promoting their film Accepted when she admitted to tricking her crush as a teenager.\nShe recounted: 'My best friend and I when we were in 10th grade had like crazy crushes, we'd drive around like stalking these guys.\n'We decided one night to go to the arcade where they were and I put bronzer all over myself and a Scary Spice 'fro so I think they'd think I was a Black girl, so I could stalk them and my friend dressed up as this goth girl and we literally sat outside their houses,' she shared.\nHer co-stars didn't bat an eyelid, with Justin responding with: 'So that makes you sweet and charming, you're still hot.'\nBut users were appalled by the story, sharing their thoughts in the comments.\n'I BEG your PARDON?' one shocked user wrote. \n\nLively subsequently thanked the famed lawyer Ifill for penning her piece in the magazine.\n\nLively, who has been accused of scheming for control on the set of It Ends with Us, received a glowing tribute from civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill. Pictured in NYC in 2019\n'\"I AM a geek… well excuse me because this one time, I bronzed my face to resemble Scary Spice to stalk a guy….\" and scene,' commented another. \n'I…. \"So they thought I was a Black girl\" like did she just say \"I attempted blackface\"??????' questioned another. \n'Did she say the way she is a geek is by cosplaying \"as a Black girl,\"' another user fumed. \nHowever, none of the crticism stood in the way of Blake being named on the Civil Time 100 list of the Most Influential People of 2025, and a gushing tribute from civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill.\nIn her testimonial, Ifill hailed Lively as a 'philanthropist' and a 'serious person' who was 'committed to move this country forward.'\n'I don’t know the Blake Lively of the red carpet. Or the Met Gala. I never watched Gossip Girl,' wrote Ifill. 'The Blake Lively I know is a philanthropist and a student of our country’s most intractable problems. She and her husband Ryan Reynolds reached out in 2019 to make a contribution to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.'\nIfill, who served as president and director-counsel of the organization from 2012 to 2022, wrote: 'I had been getting a few of these calls, as our work fighting against voter suppression and police brutality was receiving national attention.'\nShe noted: 'I’m always curious about the kind of research famous people do before they make that cold call to offer their support. The ones I have remained in relationship with are those who, like Blake, really did their homework.'\nIfill wrote that she 'admired immediately her curiosity, and her sincere work to understand the conditions that shape this country.\n'I remember an early conversation in which she expressed frustration that so much of our nation’s history was not part of the instruction she had received as a student.'\nShe added that Lively's 'commitment to filling those gaps—and becoming the most fully informed and prepared citizen - is what I appreciate most about her. Blake is a serious person. She’s a risk taker. And she’s committed to moving this country forward. For her children. And for mine.'\nRyan ReynoldsTikTokBlake Lively\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively is criticised for impersonating a black woman in SNL skit three years before slave plantation wedding to Ryan Reynolds - after backlash for joking about blackface\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

For Chinese Open House Despite Tensions","text":"Thousands attended an open house at China's embassy in Washington, D.C. on Satuday\nRussell Flannery\n\nU.S.-China trade tensions that have disrupted business between the two sides didn’t derail a scheduled cultural open house at the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. over the weekend. According to embassy figures, more than 10,000 visitors waited in a line that wrapped around the block where the country’s main diplomatic offices in the U.S. are located for a tour that focused on inland Gansu province.\n\nNot as well-known as major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, Gansu boasts the ancient city of Dunhuang, a regional and cultural hub along China’s ancient Silk Road.\n\nThe gathering was part of an “Around the World Embassy Tour” in which 60 embassies open their doors and shared their culture with residents and visitors from around the world, according to organizer Events DC. Other participating embassies ranged from Japan and Thailand in Asia to Norway and the United Kingdom in Europe.\n\n“Visitors ‘travel the world’ as they experience food, art, dance, fashion, music, innovations and manufactured goods from different countries. Each embassy decides what unique aspect of its country it wants to present to the public,” according to an event introduction.\n\nChina's popular Lanzhou beef noodles hail from Gansu.\nRussell Flannery\n\nGansu dance, song and images were highlighted. Ambassador Xie Feng in a speech noted the province’s longstanding ties to the U.S., such as work by the Dunhuang Academy with the Getty Conservation Institute to protect the area’s Mogao Caves. More than 400 visitors to the embassy enjoyed a free bowl of Lanzhou beef noodles – a style associated with the city of Lanzhou, Gansu’s capital.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nDelete Any Texts On Your Phone That Include These Messages\n\nWarning — 19 Billion Compromised Passwords Have Been Published Online\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, May 6th\n\nCurrent U.S.-China trade disputes didn’t go undiscussed at the cultural event. “Tariff hikes benefit no one,” Xie noted. “They disrupt business, raise costs, rattle financial markets and slow down global growth. China does not want a trade war, but is not intimidated by it,” he said. “If the U.S. wants to talk, it should act in the spirit of equality, respect, and reciprocity.”\n\nFor his part, President Donald Trump over the weekend defended his administration’s policies toward China in an interview with “Meet the Press.”\n\n“We were very tough with China, as you know,” Trump said on Sunday, according to a NBC transcript. “We put 145% tariff on. Nobody’s ever heard of such a thing. And we’ve essentially cut off trade relationships by putting that much of a tariff on. And that’s okay. We’ve gone cold turkey. That means that we’re not losing.”\n\nThough noting the potential for talks between the two sides, Trump later added: “We were losing hundreds of billions of dollars with China. Now we’re essentially not doing business with China. Therefore, we’re saving hundreds of billions of dollars. Very simple.”\n\nIllustrating how ties between the two global giants remain in flux, however, the U.S. announced on Tuesday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott K.H. Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will travel to Geneva, Switzerland later this week for talks with Chinese representatives.\n\nThough trade differences rage, Saturday’s D.C. event if nothing else shows how a flow of cultural exchanges and interest between the two sides are continuing.\n\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"Dance, song, noodles from Silk Road hub highlighted","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeschina/2025/05/06/thousands-line-up-in-dc-for-chinese-open-house-despite-tensions/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/681a9f0c3d396191bdc985e0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-07 00:06:41","author":"Russell Flannery,Senior Contributor","authors":["Russell Flannery","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":318573636,"title":"Trump expresses 'absolute confidence' as Steve Witkoff is sworn in as special Middle East envoy","text":"President Donald Trump’s new special envoy to the Middle East was sworn in by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Tuesday in an Oval Office ceremony. Speaking before the swearing-in, Trump praised Witkoff, who was instrumental in securing an extended ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the return of 33 hostages, including two Americans, who were being held by Hamas. Trump said Witkoff has \"been with me, more or less, one way or the other, every step of the way,\" adding that he has \"absolute confidence and support and trust\" in his Middle East envoy's ability to secure key deals in the realm of foreign diplomacy, such as ceasefire agreements between Israel and Hamas and between Ukraine and Russia. Though Witkoff is a real estate businessman by trade, Trump said he \"quickly established himself as one of the toughest, smartest and best negotiators in the business,\" which is why he chose him for the important role of special envoy to the Middle East. TRUMP'S GOODWILL TESTED AS PUTIN IGNORES PEACE EFFORTS DURING WITKOFF'S VISIT \"As a businessman, he's admired and respected by all, and now Steve is putting his talents to work for America's special envoy to the United States and making a lot of progress. Our country is blessed to have a negotiator of such skill and experience who really selflessly steps up to the plate, puts himself forward all the time,\" the president said. Trump did note there was somewhat of a learning curve for Witkoff when it came to foreign government relations but said he has been \"figuring it out\" at a lightning pace. \"It takes him about an hour to figure it out,\" Trump said. \"After that, he's brutal. He does a great job.\" NEXT US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR? HERE'S WHO TRUMP MIGHT PICK TO REPLACE WALTZ Trump noted Witkoff has already been active over the last several months, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders from Iran. \"He's working tirelessly to end the bloody and destructive conflicts,\" said Trump, touting Witkoff's success so far in negotiations with various world leaders. After the ceremony, Trump took questions from reporters, addressing a range of topics, including the just-announced ceasefire between the U.S. and the Houthis. When asked about conflicting reports indicating the Houthis do not plan to stop attacking Israel, Trump said that the terror group's surrogates have indicated \"very strongly\" that \"they want nothing to do with [the United States].\" Trump was also asked questions about the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and, in particular, about the release of the remaining 21 living hostages. \"This is a terrible situation. We're trying to get the hostages out. We've gotten a lot of them out,\" Trump told reporters, noting it is also just important to find and return the bodies of those already killed by Hamas. TRUMP'S SPECIAL ENVOY ON PUTIN'S CONTINENTAL ASPIRATIONS: ‘I JUST DON’T SEE THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE ALL OF EUROPE' He shared that two weeks ago a couple whose son died as a hostage came to him and said, \"Please, sir, my son is dead. Please get us back his body.\" \"They wanted his body. He's dead,\" Trump said from the Oval Office after Witkoff's confirmation. \"They know. He said they wanted his body as much as you would want the boy if he was alive. It's a very sad thing.\" Trump also commented on Iran and its potential development of nuclear weaponry. The president said definitively that \"they're not going to have a nuclear weapon.\" \"This is really crunch time. I would tell you, for Iran and for their country, this is a very important time for Iran. This is the most important time in the history of Iran, for Iran, and I hope they do what's right,\" Trump told reporters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I'd love to see a peace deal, a strong peace deal. … We want it to be a successful country,\" he added. \"We don't want to do anything that's going to get in the way of that.

O'Brien and Teamsters Motion Picture Division Director Lindsay Dougherty praised President Donald Trump’s call to place a 100% tariff on films produced in other countries. In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump wrote that the \"Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.\" He went on to warn, \"Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,\" and that, \"Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.\" Trump added that plans to institute a tariff are in the works, and he authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative \"to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.\" The two representatives of the Teamsters union praised Trump for this in a statement, saying, \"For years, Hollywood studios have hollowed out the industry by following Corporate America’s crooked playbook of outsourcing good union jobs.

The statement included an explicit statement of praise for Trump himself, declaring, \"We thank President Trump for boldly supporting good union jobs when others have turned their heads. This is a strong step toward finally reining in the studios’ un-American addiction to outsourcing our members’ work.\" The union clarified that they are willing to praise representatives of any party for embracing such an agenda. \"The Teamsters applaud any elected official — Republican, Democrat, Independent — who’s willing to fight for American workers,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the administration to build a trade agenda that benefits our members and workers throughout the American motion picture and TV industry.\" It concluded, \"It’s time to create good film jobs here at home by bringing production back to America.\" WHOOPI GOLDBERG LASHES OUT AT TRUMP'S HOLLYWOOD TARIFFS O’Brien spoke about the union's statement on Fox News’ \"America Reports\" Tuesday, reaffirming his support for Trump’s policy.

At one point in the interview, Fox News host John Roberts asked the union boss what he thinks about how Democrats are \"demonizing\" the president. O’Brien suggested that the Democratic Party is reflexively against anything Trump wants. \"I think I’ve said this before, whatever President Trump does, even if it’s good for this country, just because his name is Trump, he’s not gonna get the support,\" O’Brien said of the Democratic Party. \"We are looking beyond any differences of opinions that we have had with anybody.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We want to bring manufacturing back to the country.

Those receiving non-renewal or termination notices Tuesday represent about 20% of the employees funded in some manner by the terminated federal grants, the university said in a statement Tuesday.

We understand this news will be hard.” University spokesperson Jessica Murphy declined to say whether more layoffs were expected, but said Columbia is taking a range of steps to create financial flexibility, including maintaining current salary levels and offering voluntary retirement incentives.

Research will also be scaled back, with some departments winding down studies and others maintaining some level of research while pursuing alternate funding. The work impacted ranges from a project to develop an antiviral nasal spray for infectious diseases to various scientific studies on maternal mortality and morbidity, treatments for chronic illnesses such as long COVID, caring for newborns with opioid withdrawal syndrome and screenings for colorectal cancer, according to the university. The layoffs, while expected, were “dispiriting\" for faculty, said Marcel Agueros, secretary of Columbia's chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration arguing the cuts are unlawful. University officials say they're working with the Trump administration in the hopes of getting the funding restored. But Agueros, an astronomy professor, said it will take years to undo the damage already inflicted. “When there's an interruption in funding, people have to leave, new people can't be hired, some initiatives have to be put on hold, others need to be stopped, so research stops moving forward,” he said. In March, the Trump administration pulled the funding over what it described as the Ivy League school's failure to squelch antisemitism on campus during the Israel-Hamas war that began in October 2023. Within weeks, Columbia capitulated to a series of demands laid out by the Republican administration as a starting point for restoring the funding. Among the requirements was overhauling the university's student disciplinary process, banning campus protesters from wearing masks, barring demonstrations from academic buildings, adopting a new definition of antisemitism and putting the Middle Eastern studies program under the supervision of a vice provost who would have a say over curriculum and hiring. After Columbia announced the changes, U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the university was “ on the right track,\" but declined to say when or if Columbia's funding would be restored. Spokespersons for the federal education department didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday. Columbia was at the forefront of U.S. campus protests over the war last spring. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up an encampment and seized a campus building in April, leading to dozens of arrests and inspiring a wave of similar protests nationally. Trump, when he retook the White House in January, moved swiftly to cut federal money to colleges and universities he viewed as too tolerant of antisemitism.

However, it looks like AMD is also a bit nervous about what’s ahead, and for good reason. As uncertainty still looms about Donald Trump’s tariffs and their effect on the global economy, AMD included its concerns over these and other factors in its cautionary statement.\n\nAMD shared its Q1 2025 earnings results on its investor relations website this week. There, the company shared that its revenue was $7.4 billion. That was better than the $7.12 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. Moreover, the company came up with $0.96 per share on its earnings-per-share (EPS) metric. That came out above the $0.95 per share Whisper number and the $0.93 per share analyst estimate.\n\nWhile this all sounds like good news, it looks like AMD couldn’t be 100 percent positive about the times ahead, and some fresh factors are influencing its future success. One of those specifically listed in its Q1 2025 Cautionary Statement was tariffs:\n\nAMD also listed competitors Intel and NVIDIA as factors in its caution, but many are feeling the effects, or operating carefully around the chaos of current economic instability instigated by the Trump Administration. As we watch for more updates and details, stay tuned to the earnings topic here at Shacknews for further tech and game company fiscal reporting.","summary":"The company beat its major metrics versus Wall Street estimates, but shared concern about Donald Trump's tariffs in its cautionary statement.","url":"https://www.shacknews.com/article/144172/amd-q1-2025-earnings-results","image":"https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2025/05/06/amd-q1-2025-earnings-results-beat-eps-and-revenue-expectations_feature.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 23:49:04","author":"Tj Denzer","authors":["Tj Denzer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":318577442,"title":"Political roundabout: Duckworth's Senate pick, GOP on JB's future, Dems plan a human chain","text":"This is the inaugural edition of a new Daily Herald feature highlighting developing political stories from the suburbs and beyond.\n\nFriends in high places \n\nU.S. Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin have been close ever since he visited her at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, after the Illinois Army National Guard pilot’s helicopter was hit by an RPG during the Iraq War in 2004 and she lost both legs.\n\n“I could barely sit up for any length of time. But when Dick looked at me, he saw past the wounds, saw past the wheelchair,” Duckworth posted on social media after Durbin announced his retirement last month.\n\nThat’s why the Hoffman Estates Democrat’s recent endorsement of Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton for Durbin’s Senate seat was a significant one. Gov. JB Pritzker also backs Stratton.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly of Lynwood announced her candidacy Tuesday and State Treasurer Mike Frerichs took himself out of the race Monday.\n\nKelly said she’s running “to fight for health care that doesn’t bankrupt families, for wages that lift people up, for housing that’s affordable, for neighborhoods safe from gun violence.”\n\nOthers expected to join the fray are Democratic U.S. Reps. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg and Lauren Underwood of Naperville.\n\nPotential Republican candidates include U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood of Peoria and former Illinois National Committeeman Richard Porter of Northfield.\n\nState GOP chief breaks the news on Pritzker’s future?\n\nPritzker fired up New Hampshire Democrats last week in a feisty speech that lambasted President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the same time, he critiqued his party establishment as “do nothing Democrats.”\n\n“Here’s the problem with the do-nothing crowd now telling us what to do. They spent years watching Republicans illegitimately pack the Supreme Court, take away voting rights from people of color, systematically chip away at the constitutional order — and all the while they offered in response, a simple defense of norms and decorum and a blind hope that one day soon Republicans would wake up to find their better angels. Well, that got us exactly where we are today,” Pritzker said.\n\nThe high-profile appearance further fueled speculation the governor will run for president, although he has frequently brushed off such questions.\n\nMaybe Republican Party of Illinois Chair Kathy Salvi has the inside scoop.\n\n“It’s become clear that Pritzker’s only priority is what’s best for him and his presidential bid. This weekend's trip to New Hampshire is further proof that he’s already left Illinois behind,” the Mundelein Republican said in a statement.\n\nThis should be interesting\n\nThe Democratic Party of DuPage County announced a unique protest, Hands Across Chicagoland, from noon to 2 p.m. Sunday, May 18. Area Democrats plan to form a human chain along Ogden Avenue stretching from Chicago to Aurora.\n\nThey promised “we will not block streets or businesses along the route.”\n\nCook County GOP refresh\n\nAaron Del Mar of Palatine is back as chairman of the Cook County Republican Central Committee.\n\nDel Mar, who ran for Illinois lieutenant governor in 2022, is a member of the State Central Committee and served as Cook GOP chairman from 2012 to 2016. He was elected last month by the Cook central committee and replaces outgoing chief Sean Morrison.\n\nDel Mar thanked Morrison and pivoted to the 2026 election. “I look forward to making significant gains in Cook County and pushing back against the ultraprogressive administrations of Mayor Brandon Johnson and Toni Preckwinkle.”\n\n· Political roundabout is an occasional column on campaign, legislative and political news with a suburban focus.","summary":"Here’s a snapshot of developing political stories from the suburbs and beyond.","url":"https://www.dailyherald.com/20250506/nation-and-world-politics/political-roundabout-duckworths-senate-pick-gop-on-jbs-future-dems-plan-a-human-chain/","image":"https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=DB9EDA57-79D1-43EC-9766-40A1A6652174&function=fit&type=preview","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 23:46:56","author":"Marni Pyke","authors":["Marni Pyke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":318578556,"title":"Fury at 'two-tier Keir's' tax break for Indian workers that will make it cheaper to employ foreign staff - as bosses warn they will be forced to slash jobs","text":"Keir Starmer was last night accused of undercutting British workers to seal a £5 billion trade deal with India.\n\nUnder the agreement, tens of thousands of temporary Indian workers will be exempt from paying National Insurance in Britain, making them cheaper to hire.\n\nNew Delhi heralded the deal as an ‘unprecedented’ win, but the UK Prime Minister was accused of introducing ‘two-tier taxes’ after National Insurance contributions for British firms were increased in last year’s Budget.\n\nMany companies warned they will be forced to slash jobs or even shut down. Separately, the agreement said there would be more visas for yoga teachers as they were now classed as ‘skilled workers’, alongside chefs and musicians, capped at 1,800 a year.\n\nThe row comes just days after Labour was battered in the local elections by voters who turned to Reform UK over concerns about immigration.\n\nConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch refused to agree to the deal when she was trade secretary over the NI issue and concerns about visas and fairness.\n\n‘This is two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir,’ she said. \n\n‘When Labour negotiates, Britain loses.’\n\nThe agreement will see workers who are seconded to the UK offices of Indian-based employers, or a multi-national with offices in the country, exempt from NI for the first three years – allowing them to avoid paying both at home, as per Indian law, and in the UK. The firm will also not have to pay the contributions. The deal will be reciprocal for British workers transferred to workplaces in India.\n\nOfficials have not provided an assessment of the cost or impact on UK businesses.\n\nThe change is understood to have been a key demand by New Delhi’s negotiators who said the agreement, which has been three years in the making, will result in ‘significant financial gains’ for Indian companies.\n\nThe deal will also see the UK lower tariffs on clothes, shoes and food such as frozen prawns from the subcontinent, in exchange for reciprocal cuts for products including whisky and cars.\n\nBut the tax break – omitted from the UK press release on the pact – immediately provoked anger.\n\nGrim figures yesterday revealed the UK’s services sector had shrunk for the first time in 18 months, blamed on the NI increase – which came into force in April – and Donald Trump’s trade war.\n\nTory business spokesman Harriett Baldwin told the Commons: ‘This Government is literally putting up taxes for British workers, but cutting them for Indian workers. This deal looks like it’s subsidising Indian labour while undercutting British workers.’\n\nAnd the party’s justice spokesman, Robert Jenrick, wrote on X: ‘British workers come last in Starmer’s Britain.’\n\nWriting in today’s Mail, Reform leader Nigel Farage, fresh from delivering Labour a bloody nose at last week’s local elections, said: ‘In Starmer’s Britain, people who have grown up here, worked hard, paid their taxes and propped up the economy are effectively being asked to pay to put themselves out of work. It is nothing short of a betrayal of working people in this country.’\n\nDefending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds pointed to equivalent agreements with the EU, the US and South Korea under the Double Contribution Convention.\n\n‘It means that when our people are moved by a company to India they will be paying into the UK system and not the Indian system, and when Indian people are temporarily in the UK they’ll be paying into their system and not to ours,’ he said. ‘But it’s very specific as to who this applies to.’\n\nBut Tory MP Nick Timothy said ministers were ‘conning’ the public, adding: ‘These changes will create a massive incentive for UK firms to work with Indian service providers, undercutting domestic workers, companies and contractors.’\n\nIndian nationals accounted for the highest proportion of UK work visas issued last year.\n\nNo 10 said Sir Keir will visit India ‘at the earliest opportunity’ following a phone call between the PM and his counterpart Narendra Modi.\n\nLib Dem Treasury spokesman Daisy Cooper said: ‘The Government’s failure to even publish an impact assessment of these changes gives the impression of something that is completely half-baked.’","summary":"New Delhi heralded the deal as an 'unprecedented' win, but Starmer was accused of introducing 'two-tier taxes' after NI contributions for British firms were increased in last year's budget.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14685253/Fury-two-tier-Keirs-tax-break-Indian-worker.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/07/00/98109063-0-image-m-53_1746572815547.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 23:46:00","author":"Claire Ellicot Whitehall,Editor","authors":["Claire Ellicot Whitehall","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":318573472,"title":"Ferrari reveals date for iconic brand’s first-ever EV after ‘preparing for years’","text":"FERRARI has revealed the launch date for its first ever electric vehicle -

The quadrennial tournament, which the United States will host alongside Mexico and Canada, is expected to attract millions of fans from dozens of countries. The Department of Homeland Security has indicated it’s ready to handle the influx of international travelers. “Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event,” Vice President JD Vance said at a World Cup task force meeting led by Trump that included several top administration officials, as well as Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, the world organizing body of soccer. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to Secretary Noem,” Vance said, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has helped lead the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed Vance’s warning. “If you’re coming to see some soccer ... go on a road trip. See America,” he said before he changed his tone. “Don’t overstay your visa. Don’t stay too long.” Follow live politics coverage here Of the tournament’s 104 games, 78 will be played in the United States, with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Other match venues in the United States include Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City and Miami. Two factors could affect the number of tourists who travel to North America for the tournament next summer. For the first time in the World Cup’s 95-year history, it will be expanded to 48 teams. In recent years, only 32 have participated. While the expanded format is expected to attract more tourists, Trump’s hard-line immigration policies may have a cooling effect. Asked whether people who have taken part in pro-Palestinian protests should be concerned about attending the World Cup in the United States, Trump said: “I think people are allowed to protest. You have to do it in a reasonable manner, not necessarily friendly, but reasonable. Otherwise, Pam will come after you, and you’re going to have a big problem.” Attorney General Pam Bondi participated in Tuesday’s task force meeting. Infantino has estimated that between the FIFA Club World Cup, which is being hosted solely in the United States this summer, and next year’s World Cup, the country will draw 10 million international tourists. Noem struck a more inviting tone Tuesday than some of her administration colleagues. She cast the tournament as “an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place.” “We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together,” she said.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made a point of saying foreign visitors shouldn't stay longer than they’re allowed.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-officials-warn-fifa-world-cup-visitors-not-overstay-visas-rcna205236","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250506-donald-trump-Gianni-Infantino-FIFA-Task-Force-ac-514p-3ce092.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 23:38:05","author":"Alex Tabet","authors":["Alex Tabet"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.401},{"id":318569634,"title":"Alec Baldwin's wife Hilaria now claims her fluctuating Spanish accent is due to a medical condition","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, May 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral dead including children as India launches air strikes on 'terrorist camps' inside Pakistan: Islamabad says at least two war planes were shot down with dramatic escalation leaving nuclear-armed states teetering on the brink of war\n\nCara Delevingne slips into VERY risqué mesh dress as she joins her heavily pregnant sister Poppy at star-studded Ocean With David Attenborough world premiere in London\n\nIndia-Pakistan war fears: Live updates as Trump reacts to missile strikes raining down on Pakistani 'terror sites'\n\nI sent the same text to all my male friends.

The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency. The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security. The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures. \"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says. In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\" The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets. \"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\" The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy. The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth — or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024. In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\" \"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said. In a statement to CBS News last week, World Liberty said the Abu Dhabi deal represents the \"single largest-ever investment in a crypto company\" and sets a \"historic precedent.\" It did not respond to questions about how much the Trump family stands to make from the investment.Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, is seeking records and documents about Mr. Trump's crypto ventures from Fight Fight Fight LLC, the company that launched Mr. Trump's meme coin, and World Liberty Financial. The senator sent letters to both companies on Tuesday requesting the records, including communications between both companies, the Trump Organization, the president, his administration and foreign governments.","summary":"Sen.

The fair wound up on Monday.\n\nThe surprisingly robust turnout helped transactions rise by 3 percent compared with last year, to US$25.44 billion. Exhibitors and analysts have noted that the fair’s performance has improved confidence in the mainland’s export sector and the public’s faith in the country’s ability to weather a lengthy trade war. \n\nWhile US attendees were scant on the ground, the Post observed that most of this edition’s buyers hailed from emerging markets involved in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – 65 percent, according to official figures. \n\n[See more: California’s governor pushes for continued China trade despite Trump’s tariffs]\n\nBRI countries accounted for more than 60 percent of the total transaction volume, which still remained below the US$29.3 billion earned in 2019’s autumn edition – the last fair to take place prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\nDavid Wong, a lecturer at the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, told the Post that these were mostly small-to-medium-sized retailers looking to cut out the middleman through placing direct orders with Chinese suppliers.\n\nHowever, one such supplier warned that purchasing power in emerging markets could be hard to predict and that uncertainties remained.\n\n[See more: Beijing announces measures to protect workers in the face of Washington’s trade war]\n\n“Many buyers are only requesting samples,” said Miya Chen, a sales manager with electronic massage device maker Xiamen Comfier Tech. “They still need to return to their local markets to conduct testing and study distribution channels. This is just the beginning of a long development process.”\n\nLighting exporter Liang Xiong echoed Chen’s concerns: “It is important to note that profit margins on orders from emerging markets are generally much lower than those from US clients,” they told the Post.\n\nChina’s exports managed modest growth in the first quarter of this year, but the increase was driven by importers front-loading orders. US President Donald Trump’s tariffs of up to 145 percent on most Chinese goods only kicked in in April, meaning the second quarter will reveal the true impact of the hikes.\n\nInaugurated in 1957, the Canton Fair is considered to be the biggest trade show in China, with the event scheduled twice a year in Guangzhou. It has been dubbed a barometer of China’s foreign trade.","summary":"The number of overseas buyers at the latest Canton Fair was surprisingly high, with visitors from Belt and Road Initiative countries making up 65 percent of attendees\n\n\nThe post The Canton Fair reveals that more emerging market buyers are looking to China appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/greater-china/canton-fair-buyers-trade-war-china/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Canton-Fair-China.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-06 23:30:00","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","source_country":"mo","sentiment":0.048},{"id":318571086,"title":"Letters: In Congress’ absence, citizens must lead resistance","text":"Without Congress,\ncitizens must resist\n\nRe: “Schools in chaos amid research funding cuts” (Page A1, May 5).\n\nThis relentless assault on higher education, which also includes targeting international students, threatening to blow up the accreditation system and eviscerating the U.S. Department of Education, is a transparent attempt to exact revenge and silence opposition.\n\nIn my work in education research, I study how higher education transforms lives while producing knowledge and life-changing technologies. Yet this administration seeks to destroy this path to prosperity and ruin our nation’s global competitiveness.\n\nUntil Congress finds the courage to stand up to this blatant abuse of power, ordinary citizens will have to lead the resistance. We must protest the administration’s cruel and unlawful actions, boycott businesses that bend to its agenda, join legal actions challenging violations of the law, and support the many groups and efforts pushing back. Together we can fight back — and win.\n\nDavid Radwin\n\nGive birth certificate\nrights to adoptees\n\nCalifornia prides itself on championing civil rights and equality — yet adult adoptees in our state are still denied a basic right: access to their original birth certificates. While 15 states now allow adult adoptees unrestricted access, California continues to seal these documents, treating adopted citizens as second-class.\n\nThis isn’t just a matter of curiosity — it’s about identity, truth and dignity. Adoptees deserve to know their origins, just like any other person. Amended birth certificates that list adoptive parents as birth parents are legal fictions that erase history.\n\nBills like AB 1302 (2023) and SB 1274 (2024) tried to correct this injustice but failed. It’s time for our lawmakers to try again.\n\nI urge our legislators, especially those in the Bay Area, to support legislation granting adult adoptees the right to access their unredacted original birth certificates. California should join the growing list of states recognizing that truth and identity are not privileges. They are rights.\n\nJennifer Wallig\n\nTrans athletes make\ngirls sports unfair\n\nRe: “SJSU athlete sets fine example for girls” (Page A8, April 27).\n\nI felt I must respond to Barry Goldman-Hall’s letter supporting Blaire Fleming, a transgender athlete who participated in women’s sports at San Jose State University. Goldman-Hall states that this athlete is an inspiration to “young female athletes, both transgendered and cisgendered.”\n\nTaking female hormones doesn’t turn a male human being into a girl or a woman. Human sex is determined at conception and remains fixed throughout life. Even after death, the sex of a deceased individual can be determined by DNA analysis.\n\nWe have many categories in sports so that other people besides young males can win a prize. Fleming’s presence on the women’s volleyball team is denying a young woman a spot on that team and all the opportunities that being on that team provides. This is unfair and unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of the university and the athlete involved.\n\nLeslie Larsen\n\nDemocrats are\nplagued by hypocrisy\n\nRe: “Trump has continued his failed first term” (Page A6, April 24).\n\nHypocrisy knows no bounds when it comes to progressive Democrats.\n\nDuring Donald Trump’s first term, there was an $8.18 trillion increase in the cumulative national debt (this included a $4.24 trillion increase from March 2020 to January 2021 due to a once in a hundred years epidemic). The Joe Biden cabal came into office and increased the cumulative debt by an additional $7 trillion.\n\nMishandled the epidemic? Are you referring to stifling differing opinions as to what should be done?\n\nApparently, if a Republican president uses his authorized power to nominate Supreme Court justices, it is “packing the court,” but of course not so should a Democrat exercise the same power.\n\nRick Silvani\n\nDue process reserved\nfor Trump alone\n\nOne thousand two hundred and seventy riotous insurrectionists tried to stop Congress from certifying the president’s election on Jan. 6, 2021. Each rioter received a due process fair trial under the law, in which valid evidence was presented, and each had the opportunity to defend themselves. Each convicted rioter was judged guilty. Only the ringleader of the anti-democracy rebellion, the leader who told them to “fight like hell,” escaped trial and conviction. His lawyers masterfully played every “due process” trick in the book.\n\nThen, on Jan. 20, 2025, the insurrection leader, reelected president, pardoned the convicted rioters.\n\nNow, Donald Trump is invoking the ancient Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deport alleged “enemies” without any due process as required by law.\n\nThat one anti-democracy perpetrator, the traitor who evaded judgment, should be forced to stand trial now. If convicted, he should be deported to El Salvador.\n\nBruce Joffe","summary":"Also: Adoptee rights &#124; Trans athletes &#124; Democrats' hypocrisy &#124; Due process.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their counterparts in Geneva in the most-senior known conversations between the two countries in months. It comes amid growing US market worry over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.

Trump had claimed previously that the US and China were holding negotiations on lowering tariffs, which Beijing has denied, saying Trump must first lower his stiff tariffs. Bessent earlier Tuesday testified to a House committee that the US and China “have not engaged in negotiations” but “as early as this week,” the US will be announcing trade deals with some of the US' largest trading partners. The Chinese Commerce Ministry on Tuesday confirmed the meeting between the vice premier and Bessent in Switzerland. Also Read | Operation Sindoor!

Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, according to readouts from their respective offices. Both Greer and Bessent have had communications with their counterparts prior to the start of the trade war. Greer told Fox News Channel last month that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart for over an hour before the trade war started. “I thought it was constructive,” he said, adding, “this is not a plan just to encircle China. It's a plan to fix the American economy, to have a greater share of manufacturing as GDP, to have real wages go up, to be producing things instead of having an economy that's financed by the government.” And Bessent in February spoke with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng “to exchange views on the bilateral economic relationship,” according to a Treasury news release.

The majority-Muslim nation, a natural ally of Palestine, denied the reports that it sold 155mm artillery shells to Israel, and Islamabad repeated its historic opposition to the existence of the State of Israel and its refusal to recognize it diplomatically.\n\nAccording to Indian news sites this week, Pakistani ammunition factories reported dangerously depleted levels of artillery shells after selling some $364 million worth of them to Ukraine between February and March 2023. Pakistan is said to have shipped about 42,000 122mm rockets for Grad BM-21 systems, 60,000 155mm howitzer shells, and an additional 130,000 122mm rockets to Kyiv.\n\nIslamabad claimed that a child was killed in Tuesday’s attack and vowed that the strikes would not go unanswered.\n\n“We have confirmed reports of three civilians killed that includes one child,” Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told AFP.\n\nPakistan’s military said that the five locations included three in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and two, Bahawalpur and Muridke, in the country’s most populous province of Punjab.\n\n“We will retaliate at the time of our choosing,” said Pakistani military spokesman Lieutenant-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, calling the strikes a “heinous provocation”.\n\nAFP reported that the Pakistani military said it launched two missile tests in recent days, including of a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 280 miles, about the distance from the Pakistan border to New Delhi. The news agency reported that India was set to hold several civil defense drills Wednesday preparing people to “protect themselves in the event of a hostile attack”.\n\nNew Delhi earlier in the weeks had said that an April 22 attack on tourists in Kashmir last month that killed 26 people was carried out by gunmen from Pakistani group Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-designated terrorist organization, something Islamabad has denied. The victims were mostly mainly Hindu men in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India would “identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.”\n\nAsked about the strikes, US President Donald Trump said, “It’s a shame, we just heard about it… I guess people knew something was going to happen based on the past. They’ve been fighting for many, many decades and centuries, actually, if you really think about it.”\n\nThe two countries have been at odds over the disputed territory since the 1947 partition of India that created the state of Pakistan but left between 12 and 20 million people displaced and divided along religious lines in Kashmir.","summary":"At least three were killed in the strike, including a child.
