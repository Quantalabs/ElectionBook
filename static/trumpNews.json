I don’t put a price on our national security.”\n\nHoman, 63, also teased that the incoming administration would move to shut down the Darien Gap, a treacherous 70-mile stretch of jungle in Panama that serves as the only land bridge between South and Central America. \n\n“It needs to happen,” he said. “Shutting down the Darien Gap is going to protect our national security. It’s going to save thousands of lives.”\n\nThe popular smuggling route was used by more than 530,000 migrants last year alone as part of caravan voyages destined for the US-Mexico border. \n\n“We’re going to work with the foreign government,” Homan said of how the Trump administration would crack down on illegal crossings at the Darien Gap. \n\nPanama’s Security Minister Frank Abrego told the Wall Street Journal last month that the country’s immigration authorities had seen a 40% drop in crossings but are concerned the numbers could creep up again without ongoing US support.\n\n“We want the Trump administration to realize that its border is actually here at the Darien Gap and to see how complicated that area is,” Mulino told the Journal.\n\n“We are still concerned,” he added.","summary":"“We need to take care of the American people.

The House is very close and the Senate is also very close. In two years’ time, there will be midterm elections and history shows that the midterm election will swing the pendulum in the other way and you do not have both the houses under Republican leadership. It is my forecast. I think the chances of revoking the 22nd amendment are very little.”On the matter of migration, the German envoy said that it was a key issue in Germany’s internal politics and noted that 30 per cent of the German population has at least one non-German parent, and 20 per cent have two non-German parents, reflecting the country’s transformation into a major immigration destination over the past 20-25 years.He emphasised that Germany has liberal immigration policies, allowing individuals with the right qualifications to enter the country and search for employment without needing a job contract. Ackermann mentioned that many Indians have taken advantage of this opportunity, contributing to the growth of the Indian community in Germany.“I would say that the core of Germany’s internal politics is migration. You have to imagine that 30 per cent of the German population has one non-German parent and in 20 per cent of the German population, there are two non-German parents. Basically, our country has turned in the last 20-25 years into a complete immigration country; therefore, saying that closing the door is absurd because we are living off migration and from migration,” he said.“We would have the most liberal immigration laws in the Western world. When you want to move to Germany and if you have the right qualifications, you do not need a contract. You can come to Germany and look for a job. There are many Indians who are taking this opportunity to say that the Indian community is growing,” he added.However, he also acknowledged the challenges related to refugee and asylum-seeking illegal immigration, particularly during the influx of Syrians in 2015-16 and Ukrainians in 2022-24.“But there is another part. What people felt overwhelmed with was the refugee asylum-seeking illegal immigration they have experienced in the last 10 years. In 2015-16, we had millions of Syrians coming to Germany and in 2022-24 we had millions of Ukrainians coming to Germany,” the German envoy said.“What we are trying to achieve is to reduce illegal migration and promote legal migration,” he added.Ackermann concluded by stating that while Germany’s asylum laws, which offer protection to persecuted individuals, should be maintained, there is an ongoing effort to manage migration effectively and ensure that legal migration remains a priority.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2025/01/chances-to-revoke-22nd-amendment-very-little-german-envoy-on-trumps-potential-third-term/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ANI-20250111002006.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 00:30:23","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":279851610,"title":"What's next for TikTok? App left with few options after skeptical Supreme Court reception","text":"After lawyers for TikTok appeared before the Supreme Court on Friday and received a skeptical reception, it seems only a few pathways remain for the platform’s future in the U.S. If the Supreme Court votes to uphold the law that President Joe Biden signed in April, TikTok will shut down on Jan. 19, the day before Donald Trump takes office. The law requires TikTok to divest from its Chinese ownership and sell to a U.S. company. If the justices declare the law unconstitutional, TikTok can continue to exist as it is today for its 170 million American users — around half of the U.S. population. But the direction of Friday’s oral arguments put that possibility into question. There are a few factors that could play into other options. TikTok has asked to extend the timeline of the Supreme Court’s decision, a choice the justices can make to push back their final judgment. Trump has supported TikTok, filing an amicus brief in December to the Supreme Court to advocate for such an extension, which would bring the sale deadline into his presidential term. An extension, he said, would allow his administration (which is divided on TikTok) to pursue a “political resolution” for the app’s future. It’s not entirely clear what form that would take. One of Trump’s options would be to grant a 90-day extension for TikTok to continue its effort to find an American buyer — a provision specifically written into the law forcing a sale. However, TikTok’s Chinese parent company ByteDance said it will not approve a sale of the app. If ByteDance were to approve a sale, there are U.S. buyers willing to purchase TikTok, including billionaire business executive Frank McCourt. Gautam Hans, a professor of law at Cornell University, said TikTok had “a tough go” with the Supreme Court and added he finds it unlikely that the justices will side with the platform. He called Trump’s brief “unprecedented” and said that it’s unclear how Trump will seek a political resolution, with a few unlikely possibilities. “There might be a possibility that he pressures Congress to rescind the law,” Hans said. “That would be pretty extraordinary, given that the law passed on a partisan basis overwhelmingly. You’d have to have a lot of reversals from legislators to undo the law.” Hans said that Trump could also direct the Justice Department not to enforce the law, meaning that it would not prosecute Google and Apple’s app stores for hosting the app. But Hans didn’t think that the legal counsel for either company would be comfortable defying the law on Trump’s word alone. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the U.S. government’s position on TikTok to the Supreme Court, indicated during her argument that she believes ByteDance could pivot to selling the company if the law is upheld. “I think Congress expects we might see something like a game of chicken, ByteDance saying we can’t do it, China will never let us do it,” Prelogar said in court on Friday. “But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance will consider, and it might be just the jolt that Congress expected the company would need to actually move forward with the divestiture process.” Rita McGrath, the academic director in executive education at Columbia Business School, said that buyers like McCourt are betting that TikTok will decide to sell to a U.S. owner after all, if the company is left with no other options. “If they do get shut down, which seems to be likely, I think it opens up a second tier of bargaining possibilities,” McGrath said. “TikTok has taken the time - since the law was passed until these court hearings - to not investigate buyers, to not investigate an alternative, to not look into whatever legal remedies they might have. They’ve been going on a lobbying and charm offensive. This is kind of a Hail Mary for them.” McGrath said that whether TikTok sells or not, she believes creators will be able to transition to alternatives. Platforms like Meta, with Instagram Reels, and Google, with YouTube Shorts, would see an advantage in the short-form video space if TikTok disappears. Still, McGrath said it would be a “loss” for the people who have built up large, profitable and influential TikTok followings. “Users have real interests here. They are using the platform to communicate, to share content, to discuss, to make money. Shutting this down is going to be a major social, political and economic consequence for those individuals, not just the company,” Hans said. “So that is what I think is going to be really challenging from a First Amendment perspective, the rights and interests of the users, which are really important given there are over 170 million of them in this country that are going to be affected in ways that can’t easily be fixed.”","summary":"After lawyers for TikTok defended the app to the Supreme Court and received a skeptical reception, it seems that there are only a few pathways left for the app.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tiktok-supreme-court-hearing-ban-argument-trump-sale-rcna186050","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250110-tiktok-ban-scenarios-donald-trump-supreme-court-cs-48689c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 00:29:11","author":"Kat Tenbarge","authors":["Kat Tenbarge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":279849928,"title":"A timeline of Donald Trump and UFC CEO Dana White's relationship","text":"Donald Trump might be the only person who can attend an Ultimate Fighting Championship fight and outshine the headliners — even UFC CEO Dana White doesn't draw the same type of reaction.In November, Trump set the crowd off by walking into UFC 309 at Madison Square Garden to join his entourage, which included Elon Musk, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Trump's cabinet nominees.White stands at the center of it all.

That will be a decision for her to make,” Biden, 82, said just 10 days before leaving the White House.\n\nThe nation’s oldest-ever president at first ignored the question during an evening Q&A with journalists after he defended his own decision to seek re-election last year before dropping out and backing Harris as his successor just 107 days before the election.\n\nAsked if he regrets running again and whether that made it easier for Trump to win a second non-consecutive term, Biden, who had appeared to tout monthly jobs-growth data, said, “I don’t think so.”\n\n“I think I would have beaten Trump, could have beaten Trump, and I think that Kamala could have beaten Trump, would have beaten Trump,” Biden said, looking down as he spoke and offering no explanation for Harris, 60, going on to lose all seven swing states.\n\n“I thought it was important to unify the party,” Biden said of his decision to drop out amid a mutiny by fellow Democrats concerned about his mental acuity following a dismal June debate.\n\n“And when the party was worried about whether or not I was going to be able to move — even though I thought I could win again, I thought it was better to unify the party,” Biden said.\n\n“It was the greatest honor in my life to be president United States, but I didn’t want to be one who caused a party that wasn’t unified to lose an election. And that’s why I stepped aside, but I was confident she could win.”\n\nHarris won the fewest Electoral College votes of any Democratic candidate since Michael Dukakis in 1988 and likely would face stiff competition for the nomination in 2028.\n\nIn a sign that she had been preparing for a continued political career, Harris planned to embark next week on a global tour touting what she regards as foreign policy achievements but nixed the whirlwind trip as deadly wildfires continue to tear through her home state of California. \n\nShe had planned to stop in Singapore to discuss the administration’s focus on Asia, then in Bahrain to discuss the Middle East and finally in Germany to recount the NATO response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nBiden told reporters he plans to remain in the public eye after leaving office — unlike some predecessors, such as George W. Bush, who almost never makes public remarks on contemporary politics.\n\n“I’m not going to be out of sight or out of mind,” he said.","summary":"\"I think she's competent to run again in four years.

Today, the power is back on, the air is still, and the sky blue, a stark contrast to the destruction just five miles east of us. The winds will be back next week. In the meantime, I’ve managed to write up my hot take on this year’s edition of the world’s biggest trade show, which was attended by 140,000 people in 2024.

Everywhere you looked, booths and panels touted the transformative potential of artificial intelligence. Yet for all the talk, there wasn’t much to see. Unlike XR, which dazzles with visual demonstrations, AI is invisible. Exhibitors leaned heavily on last year’s devices, repackaged as “AI-enabled.” Demonstrating AI’s full potential in real time was hampered by bandwidth limitations inside the convention center.\n\nUnitree Robotics.

Huang painted a sweeping vision of AI’s role across industries, from robotics to healthcare and automotive. His message was clear: Nvidia is not just a chipmaker; it’s the king of the AI revolution. Huang showcased Nvidia’s AI-powered robotics platform, emphasizing how it could reshape industries like logistics and manufacturing. For all the hype, the exhibition floor offered little evidence of a robotics revolution.\n\nLAS VEGAS, USA - JANUARY 08: Emage Vision's TOMO robot plays the piano inside The Venetian Campus ...

The most successful product in the space, Meta’s AI-enabled Ray-Bans, weren’t even in the same building with the other XR in Central Hall. Many players that once staked their claim in the XR space were conspicuously absent. In their place, Xreal dominated the conversation with its sleek glasses and 3 DOF (degrees of freedom) screen extenders. Rokid maintained a solid presence as well, but the real innovation was hard to spot.\n\nHead of Business Development of Sony Electronics Thaisa Yamaura speaks during a Sony news conference ...

Developed by Sony's XR Business Development Division, XYN comprises three components: mobile motion capture sensors, an XR head-mounted display, and a spatial reality display. The new headset will retail for $4,750.\n\nAt the Luxxotica booth there was a line to check out the new AI features on the Meta Ray-Bans.\nCharlie Fink\n\nThere were smart glasses everywhere that were knockoffs of Meta’s Ray-Bans, with the primary innovation being the integration of ChatGPT instead of Meta’s Llama models. While these glasses offer the same audio features and cameras, they don’t offer the quality, fashion, comfort and ease-of-use of the plug-and-play Ray Bans. They’re just fifty bucks less.\n\nStraining to see Halliday's tiny microdisplay at CES 2025.\nCharlie Fink\n\nHalliday introduced its new smart glasses which feature a monocromatic monocular microdisplay in the frames, that can show notifications, or maps.

That’s why companies like Xreal and Rokid are focusing on screen-extender functionality, allowing users to project personal screens that feel like a 300-inch TV. Xreal’s 5 DOF model is a step forward in this space, offering enhanced immersion. But the question remains: Do people really want this? All day every day smart glasses like Meta’s Ray-Ban feels like it’s happening without the display. Most consumers already have large, high-resolution devices in their pocket. For most consumers under 30, it’s their main screen.\n\nOcuLenz brings vision correction to patients suffering from Advanced.Macular Degeneration by using ...

Ocutrx was at the show, as they were last year, showing tw set o new devices. Using proprietary software running on a Qualcomm XR2 chip, OcuLenz provides vision correction to patients with Advanced Macular Degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of vision loss in adults over 60, and the ORLenz 5K XR headset displays 3D holographic images and drastically improves ergonomics by giving surgeons freedom of movement and positioning.\n\nConel Amariei, founder and CEO of Lumen.\nCharlie Fink\n\nConel Amariei was back at CES with his Lumen headset, which uses lidar sensors to activate vibrations inside a haptic headband to silently, invisibly guide the blind without the need for a cane or guide dog. I also sought out Soliddd, whose CEO I interviewed for an article on accessibility last year. They, too, are making a headset to help the brain “see around” blind spots caused by AMD.\n\nA Future Under Construction\n\nAmid the noise, the broader message of CES 2025 was clear: AI is the new frontier, but its road to consumer impact is still under construction. It’s easy to imagine a future where AI reshapes how we work, play, and interact with technology, but this year’s CES demonstrated how far we are from that vision.\n\nFor XR, the path forward is similarly murky. The technology remains niche, with few standout use cases beyond gaming and screen-extension. While Xreal and Rokid are pushing boundaries, the lack of broader industry momentum raises questions about the sector’s future beyond AI-enabled smartglasses, which may be the ulimate form factor, because AI, the web, and location awareness is all the functionality you need, and perhaps want, in a pair of glasses.\n\nCES 2025 was a show of promises, not breakthroughs. AI is poised to change everything, but its presence at the show was more theoretical than tangible. XR continues to struggle for relevance, with flashes of innovation drowned out by a sea of sameness. For both sectors, the next year will be critical. How will AI manifest its transformative potential? Can XR find its killer app?\n\nAt this year’s CES, the answers were unclear.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

It’s both possible, and desirable, to strike a balance.”\n\nThe call comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves holds a series of meetings in Beijing and Shanghai aimed at improving economic relations with China.\n\nThe visit is the latest example of Labour’s softer approach to Beijing after a freezing of relations under former prime minister Rishi Sunak, although the Government has insisted it will “challenge” China where necessary.\n\nThe Chatham House paper suggested greater co-operation on areas such as emissions trading and carbon budgeting, deploying low-carbon technologies and adapting to the risks posed by climate change.\n\nJiangwen Guo, another of the co-authors, said: “The UK and China have a long history of successful collaboration on climate change.\n\n“With rising geopolitical instability, and a retrenchment of climate leadership in some quarters, they have an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of bilateral co-operation, and in so doing shore up multilateralism and accelerate practical climate action, which is in all our interests.”\n\nBut the authors also acknowledged the challenges posed by the incoming Donald Trump administration in America, saying the new president’s harder line on China could pressure the UK into abandoning co-operation in all areas.\n\nThey said: “To be successful, any new phase of UK-China climate co-operation must therefore account for these challenges and be designed in such a way that it is resilient to the inevitable political turbulence it will encounter.”\n\nA Government spokesperson said: “The biggest risk to our energy security is staying dependent on fossil fuel markets and only by sprinting to clean power by 2030 can the UK take back control of its energy and protect both family and national finances from fossil fuel price spikes.\n\n“Investment in the energy sector is subject to the highest levels of national security scrutiny – and we take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing relations with China and will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must.\n\n“Through our Plan for Change, we will reignite our industrial heartlands as we seize the opportunities of the clean energy transition, and will continue to drive investment and export opportunities for businesses and communities in the UK.”","summary":"Chatham House said a formal deal would enable ‘bolder and more confident engagement’ by the UK in China ‘and vice versa’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/china-chatham-house-beijing-rachel-reeves-government-b1204197.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/11/00/d55c93116db70955557a22d16740749dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM2NjA0ODgy-2.78244036.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 00:01:00","author":"Christopher McKeon","authors":["Christopher McKeon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.184},{"id":279848192,"title":"Malaysia’s Asean chair to-do list, from turmoil to tariffs – and Trump","text":"Malaysia takes the helm of Asean at a time of see-sawing threats and opportunities, with Donald Trump’s tariff-wielding return to the world stage, peaking tensions in the South China Sea and the deepening bloodshed in Myanmar all set to test the diplomatic skill of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\nFor Anwar, 77, this is a crowning moment in a career that has weathered persecution, imprisonment and decades in opposition. Since taking office in late 2022, he has worked to restore Malaysia’s global reputation after years of domestic political turmoil and introspective government.\nHis international outreach has seen him rattle through visits to China, the US, India, Russia and Turkey – to name but a few – signalling his administration’s focus on foreign relations and an acute awareness of the security and economic challenges ahead.\nBut will it be enough? Chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comes with responsibilities that are both symbolic and strategic – hosting key meetings, setting the agenda on pivotal issues including trade, security and disputes, and acting as the region’s face in global diplomacy.\nTaken as a whole, the bloc represents the fifth-largest economy on Earth with a combined gross domestic product of US$3.6 trillion, growing at a combined 4.5 per cent in 2024.\nYet its effectiveness remains constrained by consensus-driven decision-making that can render it toothless when it comes to the most pressing issues. Critics have derided Asean as a “talking shop” incapable of decisive action, and Malaysia’s year in charge is unlikely to escape the same scrutiny.\n“Chairs will be judged by how they manage – or mismanage – hot button issues, of which there are plenty for Malaysia to juggle this year,” Thomas Daniel, a foreign-policy analyst from Malaysia’s Institute of Strategic and International Studies, told This Week in Asia.\n\nTrump, tariffs and trade wars\nExternally, Asean faces a wild card in Washington. Donald Trump, set to return to the White House in a matter of days, has threatened sweeping new tariffs on all manner of imports – not just those from China – in a move that could send shock waves through Southeast Asian economies.\nThe transactional nature of his first term is tipped to continue, with investments and defence support on the line for any nation, or region, his hawkish administration perceives to be out of step with US interests.\nCountries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia saw an influx of manufacturers fleeing US-China trade tensions during his first term. This time, however, Trump’s trade wars are expected to target the entire region, potentially dismantling the advantages that had made Asean a magnet for global supply chains and companies relocating to avoid levies on made-in-China goods.\nThe US president-elect campaigned on a pledge to impose tariffs as high as 20 per cent on all imports, especially from countries with large trade surpluses.\n\n“Early in the new administration, the Trump White House will indeed impose high new tariffs on a large scale,” warned Kurt Tong, a former US ambassador for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in a report for the trade-focused Hinrich Foundation think tank. “It is also clear that Asia, and especially China, will be a top target.”\nBut there are opportunities amid the uncertainty. As the US appears set on retreating from environmental sustainability commitments, China could emerge as the undisputed leader in green technology, creating potential for Asean to deepen its ties with Beijing.\n“Asean countries may benefit from Chinese technology, especially in vehicle, energy and food production,” Azizul Amiludin, an economist and senior lecturer at Universiti Malaya, told This Week in Asia.\nThe US also remains Asean’s largest foreign direct investor – pumping in US$476.3 billion in 2023 alone. Malaysia itself has enjoyed much of that influx, with the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce reporting 172.6 billion ringgit (US$37.5 billion) of FDI that same year, largely stemming from American tech giants like Amazon, Intel and Microsoft setting up shop in the country since Anwar came to power.\n\nThe jinx of the junta\nAsean’s biggest internal crisis remains Myanmar, still locked in a vortex of violent chaos nearly four years after the junta seized power. Its civil war has spilled across borders, fuelling a surge in human trafficking, drug smuggling and Southeast Asia’s worst refugee crisis.\nNeighbouring nations – including fellow Asean members Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia – have struggled to cope with the influx of displaced people, particularly the persecuted Rohingya, as the bloc finds itself split over how to handle an isolated military government assailed by a pro-democracy rebellion.\n“What’s crucial is for Myanmar to return to being a peaceful country where its people can live harmoniously,” Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan said on December 21. But large swathes of the country are now controlled by opposing factions and warlords, and the junta has shown few signs of relinquishing its grip.\nPrevious Asean chair Laos largely sidestepped the issue, “struggling to find meaningful solutions”, in the words of a report from the Asean Studies Centre at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nMalaysia, meanwhile, has shown willingness to take a harder line. In 2022, it became the first Asean member to engage with Myanmar’s civilian National Unity Government after then-Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah chastised the junta for blocking conflict resolution efforts.\nAll eyes will now be on Anwar’s administration – in particular Hasan and newly appointed Special Envoy to Myanmar Othman Hashim – to see if it will push for a stronger stance or fall back into Asean’s default mode of cautious diplomacy.\nFurther complicating the issue is Anwar’s recent appointment of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra as a personal adviser on Asean matters. Thaksin advocated for a previous Myanmar junta during his time in office and his ties to the country’s generals have raised eyebrows among activists.\n“This decision sends a troubling message to the people of Myanmar, who have hoped for a stronger Asean stance under Malaysia’s leadership,” said Salai Ling, deputy executive director of the Chin Human Rights Organisation that aims to support marginalised groups in the war-torn nation.\n\nBad currents\nThen there’s the South China Sea, where China’s increasingly aggressive stance has split Asean members into opposing camps. Nations like Vietnam and the Philippines, which have the most to lose, are pushing back hard against Beijing’s sweeping territorial claims. Others, including Cambodia and Laos, remain reluctant to challenge their largest trading partner.\nMalaysia, for its part, has struck a delicate balance, maintaining cordial ties with China while quietly resisting its encroachments. A leaked diplomatic cable last year revealed that Beijing had made threats against Malaysia’s oilfields in contested waters. Yet Anwar has played down the tensions, insisting that Malaysia has no problems with China.\nThis is in stark contrast to the Philippines, which has pushed back against continual harassment from Chinese coastguard vessels and militia ships, buoyed by its mutual defence treaty with Washington – a pact that also risks dragging the US into any future conflict should animosities escalate.\nStill, Malaysia plans to use its chairmanship to push for a long-awaited code of conduct in the South China Sea, Defence Minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said during a November meeting with Chinese Ambassador Ouyang Yujing. This procedural framework is designed to prevent conflicts, but years of negotiations have produced little progress.\n“The limited progress underscores the US’ continued role as a strategic counterweight for nations such as the Philippines and Vietnam,” said Hafidzi Razali, CEO and founder of public affairs, policy advisory and strategic communications firm Strategic Counsel.\n\nFollow the Brics road?\nAs Malaysia navigates this treacherous diplomatic terrain, analysts say Anwar’s personal charisma and international network will serve as key assets.\n“His international network is impressive, and he’s been able to endear himself to other state leaders,” said Tunku Mohar Mokhtar, a political analyst from the International Islamic University in Kuala Lumpur.\nWhile mostly focused on trade and wooing investors to return to Malaysia following the upheavals of the 1MDB scandal, Covid-19 pandemic and Trump’s first trade war, Anwar has also used the global stage to push for other agendas, particularly in his advocacy for Palestinians amid the indiscriminate slaughter of the Gaza war.\n“Anwar is friendly with leaders in the West and the East and is brave enough to express his stance without necessarily insulting his targets,” Tunku Mohar said.\nAnwar is friendly with leaders in the West and the East and is brave enough to express his stance\nTunku Mohar Mokhtar, political analyst\nThe Malaysian leader has also presided over his country becoming a partner nation of Brics, a coalition of major emerging economies spearheaded by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that represents over 40 per cent of global GDP and is expanding in a challenge to Western-led multilateral frameworks.\nEconomists have voiced scepticism about the benefits of joining Brics, which encompasses diverse geographies, demographics and sometimes conflicting interests.\n“This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to predict the economic benefits for member countries,” said Doris Liew from the Institute of Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) Malaysia.\nStill, Asean’s largest economy, Indonesia, became the latest full Brics member this week, the bloc’s current chair Brazil announced on Monday. Malaysia and Thailand both became Brics partners following a summit in Kazan, Russia last October.\nUniversiti Malaya economist Azizul said Brics could provide Asean member states with leverage in international negotiations, such as those with the European Union over its ban on palm oil due to deforestation concerns.\n“Asean as an organisation however, may be wary of formalising any grouping arrangement with Brics as it balances US-China geopolitical interests in the region,” he said.\n\nFor his part, Anwar has pushed for Asean to become more of an international player, influencing world affairs.\n“Southeast Asia’s ambition reaches beyond its borders, striving to be a force for positive change on the global stage,” he said in an opinion piece published by Project Syndicate on December 16.\nTo that end, Malaysia aims to bolster engagement with Brics, as well as Asean’s external partners – such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand – calling it “essential” as a signal of the bloc’s intent to expand economic and strategic networks.\nAnwar’s task will be made all the more challenging by Asean’s code of “centrality” – the idea that member countries work together to shape decisions in the region – which often masks rifts and a lack of cohesion as member countries focus on their own interests.\n“Only a cohesive, united and institutionally strengthened Asean can be effectively ‘central’ in an emerging global order that is fragmented and transactional,” ISIS Malaysia’s Thomas said.\nIn his December commentary, Anwar underscored the importance of Asean seizing the moment.\n“The choice is stark: Asean must move forward in unity or face the divisive forces gathering momentum across Asia and beyond,” he said\nBut the strength of those “divisive forces” is yet to be fully revealed.","summary":"Can Anwar Ibrahim’s diplomatic finesse help Malaysia steer Asean through the storm of rising trade tensions and regional crises?","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3294314/malaysias-asean-chair-do-list-turmoil-tariffs-and-trump","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/10/95635d72-29f3-48dc-ad6b-770c8eb3b0af_154292b1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 00:00:09","author":"Hadi Azmi","authors":["Hadi Azmi"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.467},{"id":279848314,"title":"Judge Sentences Trump to ‘Unconditional Discharge’ in NY Case; Supreme Court Reviews TikTok Plea | Capitol Report","text":"Jan-10-2025\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is sentenced in his New York criminal case.

The judge ordered him to review trial testimony and other materials from the case, and warned him that future violations could land him behind bars.\n\nMoss and Freeman sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation for falsely accusing them of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020 election. His lies upended their lives with racist threats and harassment.\n\nGiuliani smiled and chuckled as the judge explained why she was holding him in contempt of court. Howell, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, said it is “outrageous and shameful” for Giuliani to suggest that he is the one who has been treated unfairly in this case.\n\n“This takes real chutzpah, Mr. Giuliani,” she said.\n\nShortly before the hearing began, Giuliani slammed the judge in a social media post, calling her “bloodthirsty” and biased against him and the proceeding a “hypocritical waste of time.” After leaving the courtroom, Giuliani called the hearing a farce and the judge “completely biased and prejudiced.”\n\n“I don’t care what she did. She is a completely farcical judge,” Giuliani said outside the courtroom. “She didn’t consider a damn thing I said. She wrote it beforehand.”\n\nIt’s the latest legal setback for Giuliani, who is also facing criminal charges and lost his law license in D.C. and New York after pursuing false claims that Trump made about his 2020 election loss.\n\nGiuliani briefly testified during Friday’s hearing, only to authenticate records about his personal finances.\n\nThe judge didn’t fine Giuliani for his most recent defamatory comments about the case, but she said would impose daily fines of $200 if he doesn’t certify within 10 days that he has complied with her order to review trial testimony and other case-related material.\n\nA jury sided with the mother and daughter in December 2023 and awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in other damages.\n\n“Mr. Giuliani started lying about Plaintiffs in December of 2020, and refused to stop after repeatedly being told that his election-rigging conspiracy theory about Plaintiffs was baseless, malicious, and dangerous,” the plaintiffs’ lawyers wrote.\n\nGiuliani’s attorneys argued that the plaintiffs haven’t presented “clear and convincing” evidence that he violated a court order in the defamation case in comments that he made on November podcasts about alleged ballot counting irregularities in Georgia.\n\n“Giuliani acted with the good faith belief that his comments did not violate the (judgment) and he should not be subject to contempt sanctions,” his lawyers wrote.\n\nOn Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium.\n\nGiuliani, who testified in Liman’s Manhattan courtroom Jan. 3, said he didn’t turn over everything because he believed the requests were overly broad, inappropriate or even a “trap” set by plaintiffs’ lawyers.\n\nGiuliani, 80, had tried to get out of appearing in person Friday, telling the judge he gets death threats and has been told to be careful about traveling. But he withdrew his request to appear virtually after the judge ordered him to explain whether he has traveled from his Florida home within the last month.\n\nOn the witness stand at the defamation trial, Moss and Freeman described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.\n\nGiuliani has pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges in the Arizona case alleging he spread false claims of election fraud there after the 2020 election.\n\nHe was separately charged in Georgia along with Trump and other allies of the former president accused of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. The future of the Georgia case is unclear after an appeals court said Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute it because of an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship she had with a special prosecutor she hired to lead the case.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

NIS is the only supplier of gas to Serbia and the majority owner of both gas pipelines that transport gas from Russia to households and industries in the country.\"Today, the United States imposed the most significant sanctions yet on Russia's energy sector, by far the largest source of revenue for Putin's war,\" Daleep Singh, the Biden administration's deputy national security advisor for international economics, said in a statement.Senior administration officials told reporters the measures were designed to give the United States additional leverage to help broker a \"just peace\" between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the United States for introducing the sanctions. \"These measures deliver a significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia's war machine by disrupting its entire supply chain,\" he wrote in a post on the social media platform X.Friday's announcement comes just 10 days before Biden is due to step down, and puts President-elect Trump in something of an awkward position given his stated desire to end the Ukraine war on day one of his presidency.Asked about the timing, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that oil markets were now in a \"fundamentally\" better place than they had been in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and that the US economy was also faring better. \"We believe the moment was ripe right now to adjust our strategy,\" he said.The US State Department announced it was also taking action against Russia's energy sector, \"sanctioning nearly 80 entities and individuals, including those engaged in the active production and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia.\"Among those it designated were people involved in Russia's metals and mining sector, \"and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom.\"The move sparked condemnation from Rosatom, which called it \"unreasonable and unlawful\" in nature.\"The sanctions are perceived as an element of unfair competition on the part of unfriendly states,\" Rosatom said in a statement published by several Russian news agencies.","summary":"The United States and Britain on Friday announced sanctions against Russia's energy sector, including oil giant Gazprom Neft, just days before outgoing President Joe Biden leaves office.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/us-uk-unveil-widespread-sanctions-against-russias-energy-sector-1855116","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1870734/russias-gazprom-neft-was-one-companies-targeted-us-treasury-departments-sanctions.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:42:07","author":"Daniel Avis","authors":["Daniel Avis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":279847334,"title":"Every terror attack is sickening, says MI5 head at FBI director’s leaving event","text":"MI5’s director general has said every terrorist attack is “sickening” during a speech in Washington celebrating the outgoing FBI director.\n\nSir Ken McCallum, who was knighted in the latest New Year Honours, made the remarks at a leaving event for FBI director Christopher Wray at the FBI headquarters on Friday.\n\nHe said he and Mr Wray have worked together “incredibly closely on counter-terrorism” over the years.\n\n“Every attack is sickening to us as human beings – and, as those in this room and dialled in know well, is sickening in a very particular way to those of us who have made it our life’s work to defeat terrorists and their evil ideologies”, Sir Ken said.\n\nHe added: “MI5 and the FBI, and therefore Chris and I, have worked together incredibly closely on counter-terrorism down the years. We stand together, at all times.”\n\nIn December, Mr Wray announced that he plans to resign at the end of President Joe Biden’s term in January.\n\nIt came a week and a half after President-elect Donald Trump declared his intention to nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the job.\n\nMr Trump appointed Mr Wray for the 10-year term in 2017 but the FBI chief quickly fell out of favour with the then-president and his allies.\n\nThe president-elect has publicly criticised him and the FBI on multiple occasions, including after a search of his Florida property for classified documents and two investigations that resulted in his indictment.\n\nDuring the same event on Friday, Mr Wray said the FBI must remain independent, above the partisan fray and “committed to upholding the rule of law”.\n\nAdhering to the rule of law “means conducting investigations without fear or favour and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication’s not there”, he said.\n\n“That’s what the rule of law is all about,” he said. “We’ve got to maintain our independence and objectivity, staying above partisanship and politics because that’s what the American people expect and I think that’s what they deserve.”\n\nSir Ken paid tribute to the longstanding partnership between the FBI and MI5 that is “anchored by shared values and vital in light of shared threats”.\n\nHe said: “We work together not because we like each other – though we do – but because our job demands it.\n\n“We know we provide a better service to our fellow citizens when we team up. Real-time intelligence exchanges and joint capabilities keep Brits and Americans safe.”\n\nHe recalled how a 2006 Al Qaeda plot targeting seven flights out of Heathrow was detected and disrupted by MI5 and British police, “saving hundreds, if not thousands, of American lives”.\n\nSir Ken added: “In an era of transnational threats, international partnerships are pivotal.\n\n“As he hands on the baton, I look forward to working with his successor as our organisations continue to strive to keep our generations safe. Together.”\n\nHe said the “defining feature” Mr Wray’s tenure has been his “personal leadership in calling out state-backed cyber, espionage and interference threats” and “engaging the private sector, who are so key to our resilience”.\n\nSir Ken also paid tribute to the victims of the New Year’s Day attack on New Orleans, which killed 14 people.","summary":"Sir Ken McCallum, who was knighted in the latest New Year Honours, gave a speech at the leaving event for FBI director Christopher Wray on Friday.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/christopher-wray-fbi-mi5-donald-trump-new-year-honours-b1204194.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/10/23/66e4b9b8875f5c6c52caafd318d8bf00Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM2NjM2MTUw-2.67764358.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:35:02","author":"Pol Allingham","authors":["Pol Allingham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":279846326,"title":"What happened during Trump's \"hush money\" sentencing","text":"What happened during Trump's \"hush money\" sentencing\n On Friday, a New York judge sentenced President-elect Donald Trump in his criminal \"hush money\" case.

Es la sugerencia más reciente de Trump para redibujar el mapa del hemisferio occidental. En varias ocasiones, el presidente electo se ha referido a Canadá como el “estado 51”, ha exigido que Dinamarca considere ceder Groenlandia y ha pedido a Panamá que devuelva el Canal de Panamá. Este es un vistazo a su declaración y lo que implica un nombre: Desde su primera candidatura a la Casa Blanca en 2016, Trump ha tenido varios choques con México sobre distintos temas, desde la seguridad fronteriza y la imposición de aranceles hasta los productos importados. En ese entonces, prometió construir un muro a lo largo de la frontera entre Estados Unidos y México y hacer los mexicanos lo pagaran. Estados Unidos finalmente construyó o renovó cerca de 724 kilómetros (450 millas) de muro durante su primer mandato. A menudo, el Golfo de México es mencionado como la “tercera costa\" de Estados Unidos debido a que abarca cinco estados del sureste del país. Para los mexicanos no hay otra manera de llamarlo. Los estadounidenses y los mexicanos divergen en cómo llamar a otro cuerpo de agua clave, el río que forma la frontera entre Texas y los estados mexicanos de Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León y Tamaulipas. Los estadounidenses lo llaman río Grande, mientras que los mexicanos lo conocen como el río Bravo. Quizás, pero no es una decisión unilateral y otros países no tienen que aceptarlo. La Organización Hidrográfica Internacional —de la cual tanto Estados Unidos como México son miembros— trabaja para asegurar que todos los mares, océanos y aguas navegables del mundo estén trazados y cartografiados uniformemente, y también nombra algunos de ellos. Hay casos en los que los países se refieren al mismo cuerpo de agua o monumento con diferentes nombres en su propia documentación. Puede ser más fácil cuando un monumento o un cuerpo de agua está dentro de los límites de un país. En 2015, el entonces presidente Barack Obama aprobó una orden del Departamento del Interior para cambiar el nombre del Monte McKinley —el pico más alto de América del Norte— a Denali, un cambio que Trump también ha dicho que quiere revertir. Después de las declaraciones de Trump el martes, la representante Marjorie Taylor Greene de Georgia dijo durante una entrevista con el podcaster Benny Johnson que pedirá a su personal redactar un proyecto de ley para cambiar el nombre del Golfo de México, un movimiento que, según dijo, se encargaría de financiar nuevos mapas y materiales de política administrativa en todo el gobierno federal. El cuerpo de agua ha sido representado con ese nombre durante más de cuatro siglos, una determinación original que se cree fue tomada de un poblado indígena norteamericano de “México”. Sí. En 2012, un miembro del Congreso de Mississippi propuso un proyecto de ley para renombrar las porciones del golfo que tocan las playas de ese estado como “Golfo de Estados Unidos”, un movimiento que el autor del proyecto de ley más tarde refirió como una “broma”. Ese proyecto de ley, que fue enviado a un comité, no fue aprobado. Dos años antes, el comediante Stephen Colbert había bromeado en su programa televisivo que, tras el masivo derrame de petróleo de Deepwater Horizon en el Golfo de México, debería ser renombrado “Golfo de Estados Unidos” porque, “lo rompimos, lo compramos”. Hay una antigua disputa sobre el nombre del mar de Japón entre Japón, Corea del Norte, Corea del Sur y Rusia, y Corea del Sur ha argumentado que el nombre actual no se usaba comúnmente hasta que Corea estaba bajo el dominio japonés. En una reunión de la Organización Hidrográfica Internacional en 2020, los estados miembros aceptaron un plan para reemplazar los nombres con identificadores numéricos y desarrollar un nuevo estándar digital para sistemas modernos de información geográfica. El Golfo Pérsico ha sido ampliamente conocido por ese nombre desde el siglo XVI, aunque el uso de “Golfo” y “Golfo Árabe” es dominante en muchos países de Oriente Medio.

But is it the end of the party’s decade in power?\n\nThe coming weeks and months will determine whether that is the case. Members of the Liberal Party will select a new leader who will become the 24th prime minister of Canada—even if it is just for a few months. The choice in front of party members is to either continue the status quo or to start a new era for Canada’s longest standing political movement.\n\nPoll after poll shows Liberal support from Canadians is declining—some may even say collapsing. Last month, a survey by the Angus Reid Institute showed that support for the Liberals was at an all-time low of 16 per cent. That is even lower than the level of support Michael Ignatieff received in the 2011 election, which reduced the party to third-party status.\n\nThis is a five-alarm fire for the party. Canadians have lost confidence in the Liberals’ ability to lead the country in all measures. Why? Because everyday life is becoming—or has become—unaffordable for far too many.\n\nSo, where do the Liberals go from here?\n\nIt is about time for Liberals to accept that this is where we are and to stop trying to explain to Canadians that they should feel or think differently.\n\nThe leadership race is an opportunity to renew and reinvigorate the party by putting Canadians back at the centre of the conversation and delivering a vision that respects the hopes and fears of the public. This is not the time for infighting with distractions, like purity tests on who is more of a Liberal. \n\nProgressives in Canada only need to look south for some insight and learnings from the historic political comeback of Donald Trump, who defeated the well-funded Kamala Harris campaign to secure a second presidential mandate. As James Carville reminded us in a recent New York Times op-ed: “It was, it is and it always will be the economy, stupid.” Canada’s next election will be won by who Canadians believe will be more likely to put more money in their wallets and make life more affordable.\n\nIn the coming days, rumoured leadership candidates will transition to officially declared contenders in the fight to be the next prime minister.\n\nThe electoral hill to climb is steep and it is unclear if any new Liberal leader can reverse the low and sustained polling numbers that have weighed the party down during its current mandate.\n\nThe next leader of the Liberal Party of Canada needs to show Canadians they hear their concerns and—even better—that they share them. It is the only way the party has a chance to push back against a decade of being in the political wilderness. The next leader must be battle-tested with a track record of success on the campaign trail, growing the economy to create well-paying jobs for people and families, and an excellent communicator who can not only go head-to-head with Pierre Poilievre, but who can effectively connect with Canadians across the country.\n\nThe next leader needs to be running to win.\n\nThe path to win is clear—it’s the economy, stupid.\n\nTyler Pronyk is vice-president of strategy and operations at Coast Communications and Public Affairs.

Some economists have argued that other promised Trump policies—tariffs and deporting illegal immigrant workers—could stoke inflation by making imports more expensive and increasing labor costs.\n\nConsumer confidence surged in the wake of the November election, possibly on the strength of expectations that Trump will deliver growth and lower inflation. More recently, however, confidence has pulled back, driven by a revival of fears about worsening income and labor market conditions over the next six months, as well as inflation concerns.\n\nWarning signs around inflation featured prominently in recent notes from ING commenting on U.S. manufacturing and job vacancy data and Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report, with analysts suggesting inflationary pressures are likely to be more persistent than previously thought.\n\n“Today’s data suggests that the economy is maintaining its strong momentum and that inflation continues to be sticky with concern over tariff implementation starting to impact corporate thinking and behaviour,” ING analysts wrote in one of the notes, which cited stronger than predicted job opening numbers and an acceleration in inflationary pressures from a survey-based report on U.S. manufacturing activity.\n\nMeanwhile, another economic confidence measure released on Friday, the Rasmussen Reports Economic Index, aligned with the University of Michigan measure in painting a picture of waning consumer enthusiasm. The Rasmussen index fell nearly four points from December to a reading of 103.4 in January. The group noted that the gauge hit a high of 147.8 in January 2020 during then-President Donald Trump’s first term in office, before tumbling later that year due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. During President Joe Biden’s term, the index ranged from a high of 123.7 in May 2021 and a low of 78.6 in July 2022.\n\nDespite the decline in consumer sentiment, the latest government jobs report shows that the labor market remains robust. The U.S. economy added 256,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate inched down from 4.2 percent to 4.1 percent.","summary":"U.S. consumer confidence slipped in January as inflation concerns surged, with long-run inflation expectations reaching their highest level since 2008.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/consumer-confidence-slips-as-inflation-expectations-surge-to-16-year-high-5789776","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/14/id5705495-GettyImages-2157186260-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:29:18","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":279851256,"title":"The Army Is Already Halfway to Hitting its Recruiting Goal for This Year","text":"The Army is already nearly halfway to meeting its ambitious goal of recruiting 61,000 active-duty soldiers during this fiscal year, according to internal data reviewed by Military.com.\n\nThe service has 30,000 new enlistments this year -- an increase of 6,000 compared to the same period last year, the data shows.\n\nThe milestone comes as the service continues to grapple with a historic recruitment crisis, the worst since the Vietnam War, underscoring the uphill battle to convince young Americans to don the uniform.\n\nRead Next: Military Academies Quashed Army-Navy Game Advertisement Featuring Marine Recommended for Medal of Honor\n\nThe promising year in recruiting also gives the incoming Trump administration enormous momentum as recruiting woes have been among the top issues at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, has pledged to make recruitment a top priority, often citing cultural and political grievances as the root of the military's recent difficulties, but with no evidence to support those claims.\n\nInstead, the Army's struggles have mostly been attributed to young Americans not qualifying for service, either failing to meet body fat or academic standards. In 2022, the Army stood up the Future Soldier Preparatory Courses, training camps for applicants to get up to snuff with those standards.\n\nNearly one-quarter of the 55,000 soldiers recruited last year went through one of those courses and would have otherwise not been able to serve. That allowed the Army to meet its recruiting goals in 2024 after missing its enlistment goals since 2022.\n\nEarly data suggests those courses have become a silver bullet for the recruiting crisis, and they have been lauded by service planners. The idea is to meet young Americans where they are, getting them into shape or providing them critical tutoring for the SAT-style entrance exam as test scores in schools have been falling for years, particularly for boys.\n\nThe early recruiting milestone this month, first reported by Military.com, is largely attributed to the service's delayed-entry program, which consists of 11,000 recruits, about double the numbers from recent years.\n\nThat pool consists of young Americans who volunteered to serve last year but were delayed being shipped to basic training until this year, which is when they're formally counted in the recruiting numbers.\n\nOne reason the delayed-entry pool is so large is that the service has effectively run out of space to conduct basic training, giving up some of that real estate to the Future Soldier Preparatory Courses.\n\nThe service has faced persistent delays in medically processing recruits, prompting officials to bring in additional staff and adopt a more lenient approach to minor medical histories unlikely to affect military performance.\n\nRecruiters have long complained about enlistment delays -- sometimes lasting months -- for minor injuries or conditions that applicants have already recovered from. As those delays continue, potential recruits are more and more likely to walk away.\n\nThe Army has also embraced new strategies to entice recruits, including allowing them to choose their initial duty station. Popular picks include Fort Cavazos in Texas, Fort Carson in Colorado, and Fort Campbell in Kentucky, which have drawn roughly 800 recruits each this year.\n\nThose bases offer more job opportunities and proximity to recruits' hometowns, making them attractive choices. Fort Campbell, for example, is a prominent base for recruits from the Midwest, while Texas remains a recruitment powerhouse for the Army.\n\nSurge of Female Enlistments Helped Drive Army Success in Reaching 2024 Recruiting Goal","summary":"The service has 30,000 new enlistments this year -- an increase of 6,000 compared to the same period last year, the data shows.","url":"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/01/10/army-already-halfway-hitting-its-recruiting-goal-year.html","image":"https://images05.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025-01/mil-six-army-recruits-sworn-in-1800.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:25:04","author":"Steve Beynon","authors":["Steve Beynon"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":279844166,"title":"Epic CEO Tim Sweeney says tech leaders are 'pretending to be Republicans' to gain favor with Trump, skirt antitrust laws, and ultimately 'rip off consumers and crush competitors'","text":"Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney had some biting words on Friday for tech executives who are fawning over US president-elect Donald Trump, accusing them of playing nice to push anti-competitive policy to the detriment of the rest of us.\n\n\"After years of pretending to be Democrats, Big Tech leaders are now pretending to be Republicans, in hopes of currying favor with the new administration,\" Sweeney said in a post on X. \"Beware of the scummy monopoly campaign to vilify competition law as they rip off consumers and crush competitors.\"\n\nGoogle and Apple are among Trump's new tech industry admirers: Both are donating $1 million to the inauguration, with Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly making the contribution personally.

The incoming president has expressed his intent to implement mass deportations of immigrants who are in the country illegally — a position that many bishops are voicing concerns about.\n\nThe guidance issued this month, just weeks before Trump takes office, states that “safeguarding American communities and upholding the rule of law are laudable goals” but adds that “a country’s rights to regulate its borders and enforce its immigration laws must be balanced with its responsibilities to uphold the sanctity of human life, respect the God-given dignity of all persons, and enact policies that further the common good.”\n\n“Enforcement measures should focus on those who present genuine risks and dangers to society, particularly efforts to reduce gang activity, stem the flow of drugs, and end human trafficking,” the guidelines read.\n\n“Just enforcement also requires limiting the use of detention, especially for families, children, pregnant women, the sick, elderly, and disabled, given its proven harms and the pervasive lack of appropriate care in detention settings,” the guidance continues.\n\nTrump nominated Tom Homan, the former director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), to serve as his border czar in the next administration. He and Trump have said their first priority for deportations will be criminals.\n\nThe USCCB guidelines discourage the use of military personnel, resources and tactics to carry out deportations, adding that state enforcement should consider “families, community ties, and religious liberty interests.”\n\nOn the matter of families, the USCCB discourages policies “that require eligibility for programs or services to hinge on an entire family being comprised of citizens,” noting the prevalence of mixed-status families that include “combinations of citizens and noncitizens.” \n\n“Catholic teaching maintains that families are the foundation of society, and the success of any civilization hinges on the well-being of its families,” the document adds. “... Immigration reform measures should be evaluated according to whether they strengthen families and promote family unity.”\n\nThe bishops also urge lawmakers to support a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents of the United States and an expansion of pathways for legal immigration. According to the bishops, “improving and increasing opportunities for people to lawfully enter the United States, on both a temporary and permanent basis, are necessary steps to address several pressing issues, from family separation to regional labor shortages.”\n\nAdditionally, the bishops request that protections for refugees, asylum seekers, and victims of human trafficking and abused youth remain in place. \n\n“The dehumanization or vilification of noncitizens as a means to deprive them of protection under the law is not only contrary to the rule of law but an affront to God himself, who has created them in his own image,” the guidelines add. “Further restricting access to humanitarian protections will only endanger those who are most vulnerable and deserving of relief.”\n\nFurthermore, the USCCB is urging “meaningful cooperation between the United States and other countries” to address forced migration and conditions that cause migrants to flee their home countries. The guidelines state, “There are a multitude of factors causing people around the world to migrate in large numbers today, often as the only way to sustain or protect human life.”","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/us-catholic-bishops-issue-2025-immigration-reform-guidance","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20250110170116_0748e0366e1b44f8efddd9a5111c0f6b16ef910dc0616fbf6998a7555f1b1c43.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:22:49","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.096},{"id":279844934,"title":"Trump is planning 100 executive orders starting Day 1 on border, deportations and other priorities","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is preparing more than 100 executive orders starting Day One of the new White House, in what amounts to a shock-and-awe campaign on border security, deportations and a rush of other policy priorities.\n\nTrump told Republican senators about the onslaught ahead during a private meeting on Capitol Hill. Many of the actions are expected to launch on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when he takes office. Trump top adviser Stephen Miller outlined for the GOP senators the border security and immigration enforcement measures that are likely to launch soonest. Axios first reported on Trump and his team’s presentation.\n\n“There will be a substantial number,” said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.\n\nAllies of the president-elect have been preparing a stack of executive orders that Trump could sign quickly on a wide range of topics — from the U.S.-Mexico border clampdown to energy development to federal Schedule F workforce rules, school gender policies and vaccine mandates, among other day-one promises made during his campaign.\n\nWhile executive actions are common on the first day of a new White House, as a new president puts a stamp on certain priorities, what Trump and his team are planning is an executive punch unseen in modern times as he prepares to wield power in untested ways, bypassing the legislative machinery of Congress.\n\nSome could be significant, others could be more symbolic messages of the new president’s direction.\n\nSenators briefed by Trump and his team during a lengthy session at the Capitol this week are expecting the new administration to rollback many of the Biden administration executive orders while putting his own proposals in place.\n\nFinishing the U.S-Mexico border wall, setting up immigration detention facilities where migrants could be housed until they are expelled are all part of the mix — some $100 billion in proposals, senators said, that incoming Trump administration and the GOP Congress are working to fund as part of their big budget reconciliation legislation.\n\nSenators expect Trump to revert back to many of the same U.S-Mexico border measures in place during his first term — including those that require migrants to apply in other countries or remain in Mexico, rather than enter the U.S., while their claims are being processed — as well as massive enforcement actions to deport those currently in the U.S. without legal authority.\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who led negotiations on border security and immigration during the last Congress, said he expects the Trump team to focus initially on an estimated 1 million migrants who he said most recently entered the country, have been convicted of crimes or who courts have otherwise determined are otherwise ineligible to stay in the U.S.\n\n“That’s the low-hanging fruit,” Lankford said. “People that recently crossed, people that were legally present and committed other crimes, people that the court has ordered them removed — that’s well over a million people. Start working through that process.”\n\nTrump himself once mused during the presidential campaign about having a “tiny desk” at the Capitol on Inauguration Day, where he would sit and quickly sign his executive orders.\n\nWhile there are no public signs he is considering that, the Republican senators are planning to welcome Trump inside the building after he takes the oath of office. The new president would typically sign the paperwork needed for the formal nominations of his Cabinet and administrative picks.\n\nMany of Trump’s choices for top administration jobs are going through Senate confirmation hearings this upcoming week. Traditionally, the Senate begins holding votes on a president’s nominees as soon as he takes office, with some even being confirmed on Inauguration Day.\n\n“That would be nice,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said senators are still awaiting background checks and other paperwork for many of Trump’s picks. “We’ll see.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/donald-trump/2025/01/10/trump-100-executive-orders-day1-border-security-deportations","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/900c9a6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5862x3346+0+281/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2F58%2Fa3758fac43e2b4d169b351fd7249%2Fap25","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:21:36","author":"Lisa Mascaro | AP","authors":["Lisa Mascaro | AP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":279844412,"title":"Trump makes misguided accusations about California water management amid wildfires","text":"President-elect Donald Trump has used the devastating Los Angeles wildfires to revisit a policy disagreement with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, pushing a series of complaints that experts say are false or misleading. Trump this week blamed Newsom for the fires, which have killed at least 10 people, forced 180,000 to evacuate and burned more than 10,000 structures. “I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this,” Trump wrote Wednesday on his social media platform, Truth Social. The availability of water has been a particular concern over the past few days after some fire hydrants in the Pacific Palisades temporarily dried up as firefighters attempted to contain a massive blaze there. But three water policy experts said the problem wasn’t the water supply — the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power filled all available water facility storage tanks ahead of the fires. Rather, the city’s water infrastructure wasn’t equipped to fight major wildfires, they said. After the hydrants dried up, the water department attributed the issue to excessive demand on the system. The department couldn’t refill tanks quickly enough, it said, so the pressure dropped and water struggled to reach hydrants in the hills. A reservoir in the Palisades that could have helped with water pressure was also out of commission when the fire started. Electrical outages further disrupted the flow of water to hydrants. President Joe Biden said in a public address on Thursday that utilities shut off power due to concerns about sparking additional fires, which in turn disrupted water pumps. “Cal Fire is bringing in generators to get these pumps up and working again,” he said. Newsha Ajami, chief development officer for research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said it can be easy to misattribute these issues to water scarcity. “I can understand, if you are not a water person per se, you might not know all the details that go into this system,” she said. Part of Trump’s criticism seemingly refers to a plan put forth during his first administration to redirect more water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in Northern California to Central Valley farms and Southern California cities. Newsom’s administration opposed it, saying it would endanger fish species in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. According to experts, the debate has nothing to do with the current fires, which were the product of heavy winds and a long period without rainfall in California. “To basically tie those two together is nothing short of irresponsible … It’s just throwing gasoline on the fire, and the fire is bad enough,” said Mark Gold, director of water scarcity solutions at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Gold worked in Newsom’s administration in 2020, when the governor clashed with Trump over the Delta plan. Other experts have also said the wildfires are a product of extreme climate conditions and infrastructure not meant to handle wildfires. Gold now serves on the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and noted that the region has plenty of accessible water in reservoirs: “I am not exaggerating when I say we have record storage as we speak.” Los Angeles County gets its water from several different sources, including local aquifers and imported water from the Colorado River, Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and Owens River in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains. “At any given year, there’s a fairly rigorous process to allocate water based on availability, looking at what’s in storage and being able to evaluate how much water can be used this year versus what we need to save in case we have a drought next year,” said Erik Porse, director of the California Institute for Water Resources. But Trump has accused Newsom of restricting those allocations to Southern California. “Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,” Trump wrote on Wednesday. Trump added that Newsom “wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of California.” Newsom’s administration sued the Trump administration in 2020 for failing to protect the smelt species. But Newsom’s communications director, Izzy Gardon, said in a statement that “there is no such document as the water restoration declaration — that is pure fiction.” “The Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need,” Gardon added. The Trump transition team did not respond to NBC News’ inquiry about what declaration Trump was referencing. California officials and the Biden administration agreed to a new water distribution plan in December. The plan increases water exports from the Delta to Southern California, but cuts exports to some farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. On top of his criticism of Newsom, Trump also blamed Biden for issues delivering water to fire zones. “NO WATER IN THE FIRE HYDRANTS, NO MONEY IN FEMA. THIS IS WHAT JOE BIDEN IS LEAVING ME.

The Department of Homeland Security said no large-scale enforcement operations were taking place in Southern California. The sender of the false report also said that a friend worked in the city of Lakewood and passed along information that ICE had been conducting raids at WinCo Foods, a supermarket chain, and other area businesses in that area. A spokesperson for WinCo Foods could not immediately be reached for comment. An employee at a Lakewood branch store, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said no immigration sweeps were happening at the grocery store. Lakewood City Manager Thaddeus McCormack said federal law enforcement agencies don't inform the city about operations, but he added that he was not aware of any deployment of immigration officers in the area. He said he heard similar rumors including false claims of immigration checkpoints on Lakewood Boulevard, one of the city's main thoroughfares. \"I can tell you that hasn't manifested,\" he said. Alethea Smock, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said there were no large-scale enforcement operations taking place in Southern California. In a written statement, the federal agency said it does not conduct immigration enforcement activities during major emergencies, especially in \"protected areas\" that include evacuation routes, sites used for shelter or distribution of emergency supplies, registration sites for disaster-related assistance or reunification of families and loved ones. \"DHS is committed to ensuring that every individual who seeks shelter, aid, or other assistance as a result of a natural disaster or emergency event is able to do so regardless of their immigration status,\" the statement read. The hoax comes 10 days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump has promised to launch mass deportations on the day he takes office and selected Thomas Homan, the former acting ICE director, to serve as his \"border czar\" to see it through. The hoax is also similar to those that circulated across the country during Trump's first presidential term. False reports about immigration checkpoints and sweeps spread across various social media platforms, prompting police investigations. Times staff writer Noah Haggerty contributed to this report.","summary":"A spokesperson said the Department of Homeland Security was not conducting any large-scale operations in Southern California amid fires.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-10/false-reports-of-immigration-sweeps-in-los-angeles-spread-amid-wildfires","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/911ab1d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2583x1356+0+183/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F85%2Fd3%2F02d71bd148f1bd2ff613653291b9%2Ftrump-mass-deportati","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:19:36","author":"Julia Wick,Ruben Vives","authors":["Julia Wick","Ruben Vives"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.056},{"id":279845954,"title":"Liberal leadership: Carney expected to launch bid next week, Clark organizing heavily, Gould considers entering","text":"MORE POLITICS NEWS \n\n BREAKING | \n\n Liberal leadership: Carney expected to launch bid next week, Clark organizing heavily, Gould considers entering\n\n Liberal leadership: Melanie Joly, Brian Gallant will not run, both focused on other matters\n\n Liberal leadership candidates will need to pay a $350K entrance fee\n\n Poilievre says the next Canadian election will be about the carbon price\n\n Yvonne Jones, longtime Liberal MP for Labrador, retiring from federal politics\n\n PM Trudeau says he thinks Trump is using talk of Canada becoming 51st state to distract from tariff impact\n\n Liberals will remove 'fraudulent' memberships, as some register their pets to vote\n\n Canada could impose tariffs on U.S. steel, orange juice in response to Trump threat\n\n Justin Trudeau is resigning after an historic political tenure, here's a look back at his career-defining moments\n\n In a seismic political move, Justin Trudeau has announced his intention to step down as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and prime minister, once his successor is named.

David Cook and his challenger in the race, fellow Republican Rep. Dustin Burrows, have been in a stalemate after a majority of Republican lawmakers voted in favor of Cook for speaker at a December meeting.\n\nBurrows was among 26 Republicans who didn’t agree with the vote and left the meeting. The same day, Burrows announced that he had secured the bipartisan support of 38 Democrats and 38 Republicans in the 150-member chamber and declared himself the winner.\n\nCook and his allies then disputed that Burrows had won.\n\nThere are 88 Republicans and 62 Democratic lawmakers in the Texas House. A majority of votes, 76, is needed to become speaker.\n\nThe race represents a battle between the party’s more conservative wing and moderates wanting to work with Democrats.\n\nThe conservative wing consists of many grassroots Republicans in rural areas and the state’s top Republicans including Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Paxton, and Attorney General Ken Paxton—all supporters of President-elect Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda.\n\nThe Texas speaker is arguably the third most powerful position in state government. Whoever holds the gavel has the power to influence which bills are brought to a vote.\n\nSome Republicans fear speakers elected mainly by Democrats and a handful of Republicans could compromise the state’s conservative agenda. Dade Phalen, who was the Republican speaker during the last legislative session, won the gavel with support from Democrats. In turn, he appointed several Democrats to positions of power as committee chairs.\n\nSome Republicans say that key pieces of conservative legislation have been thwarted by giving Democrats chairmanship power.\n\nThe Republican caucus called on Burrows to quit the race since he did not receive the majority of Republican votes.\n\nAccording to state GOP rules, all of the 88 Republicans must support the GOP member with the most caucus votes for speaker—which was Cook.\n\nOver the past month, the ongoing civil war within the Republican party set off a flurry of social media posts from state lawmakers and others including Donald Trump Jr., with some calling for the GOP to censure lawmakers who don’t comply with the rules.\n\nSeveral Republicans favoring Burrows also supported outgoing speaker Phelan, who chose not to seek the leadership position again after narrowly winning his seat in a primary challenge from David Covey in 2024.\n\nThe intense race drew attention from outside the Lone Star State, prompting Trump to endorse Phelan’s opponent.\n\n“By stepping aside, I believe we create the best opportunity for our members to rally around a new candidate who will uphold the principles that make our House one of the most exceptional, deliberative legislative bodies in the country—a place where honor, integrity, and the right of every member to vote their district takes utmost precedent,” Phelan said in a statement in December.\n\nWhile the Republican-led House voted to impeach the attorney general, the Senate, which was also controlled by Republicans, acquitted Paxton in September 2023.\n\nPatrick, who presides over the Senate, criticized Phelan at the end of the trial, calling the process rushed and flawed.\n\n“The speaker and his team rammed through the first impeachment of a statewide official in Texas in over 100 years while paying no attention to the precedent that the House set in every other impeachment before,” Patrick said.\n\nComplaints from Texas grassroots Republicans began to grow in 2023 as Phelan awarded chairmanships to minority party members that hindered passage of key platform measures such as school choice.","summary":"The race represents a battle between the Texas GOP's more conservative wing and moderates who want to work with Democrats.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/next-republican-texas-speaker-may-be-elected-with-the-help-of-democrats-5789324","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/06/13/speaker-dade-phelan-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:14:47","author":"Darlene McCormick Sanchez","authors":["Darlene McCormick Sanchez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056},{"id":279843506,"title":"Joe Biden's Prime-Time Farewell Address: What We Know","text":"President Joe Biden is set to deliver a prime-time farewell address on Wednesday night.Why It MattersBiden's farewell address will be his last big opportunity to reach millions of Americans and speak to the rest of the world about his legacy before he leaves office on January 20.What To KnowBiden's Oval Office remarks will be televised Wednesday, January 15, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday that the president would reflect on his \"50-plus years as a public official.\"Biden's Years Of Public ServiceBiden served as a U.S. senator from Delaware for 36 years. He had recently turned 30 years old when he took office in 1973, making him one of the youngest people to become a U.S. senator. He served in his seat until 2009 when he became the 47th U.S. vice president. He served under former President Barack Obama for two terms, and he became the 46th U.S. president in 2021 after beating then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.Biden was the Democrats' top pick in the 2024 election, as he was the incumbent, before a dismal debate performance against Trump last summer. Vice President Kamala Harris subsequently became the Democratic presidential nominee and only had a few months to campaign. She lost to Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in November 2024.Biden Says He Would Have Beaten TrumpIn a recent USA Today interview, Biden was asked if he could have won the 2024 election had he remained in the race.\"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, based on the polling,\" he said.When asked if he would have had the physical strength to serve another four years, Biden said, \"I don't know.\"Biden Rated Worse Than Trump, ObamaA new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that only about one-quarter of Americans rated Biden as a \"good\" or \"great\" president, with less than 10 percent describing him as \"great.\"Comparatively, about one-third of Americans rated Trump as \"good\" or \"great\" at the end of his term.

While their authorization was set to expire in the spring, the incoming Trump admin will now find it difficult to remove the over 800,000 people covered by the program.\n\nTPS allows immigrants from countries believed to be unstable to stay in the country and obtain work permits. It does not provide a path to citizenship. President-elect Trump has been a vocal critic of the program and unsuccessfully attempted to remove the protected status from nearly 400,000 Venezuelans in the country during his first term. \n\n“These designations are rooted in careful review and interagency collaboration to ensure those affected by environmental disasters and instability are given the protections they need while continuing to contribute meaningfully to our communities,” Department of Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas shared in a statement.\n\nTrump and Vice President-elect Vance have both railed against TPS on the campaign, notably spreading conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Ohio who were in the United States legally under the program.

The party is working with a tight time frame because opposition parties intend to defeat the Liberal government the next chance they get in the House of Commons, which would plunge Canada into an election.\n\nTrudeau has prorogued Parliament until March 24, so the March 9 date gives the new Liberal leader two weeks to prepare for the House's return and a national campaign.\n\nIn the interview with CBC, Clark said that timeline isn't long enough.\n\n\"I think it hurts the party's opportunities to grow,\" she said.\n\nClark also said she doesn't think the Liberals should keep the carbon pricing regime, saying \"the Trudeau carbon tax isn't working.\"\n\nThe carbon price, a signature piece of Trudeau's climate policy, has become a political lightning rod and is likely to become a critical part of any Liberal contender's campaign.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre insists the carbon price will be the ballot box issue in the coming election. His slogan \"axe the tax\" has been prominent in every Conservative rally and talking point since he ran for his party's leadership in 2022.\n\nHe said Thursday that it doesn't matter who wins the leadership election, since all of his potential opponents have backed carbon pricing.\n\nChandra Arya, the only sitting Liberal MP to declare his candidacy for the leadership thus far, said Thursday he would scrap the carbon price.\n\nLast spring, Carney told a Senate committee that the federal carbon price has “served a purpose up until now” and called on anyone who wants to scrap it to come up with a “credible and predictable” alternative.\n\nA source who is helping prepare Carney's campaign launch said the former Bank of Canada governor began ramping up his calls to Liberal MPs and other party members on Monday after Trudeau announced he will resign once a new Liberal leader is chosen.\n\nThe source said support that was strong initially grew Wednesday when the Liberal caucus met in Ottawa, and after Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said that day he would not be seeking to run. Many who had been considering backing LeBlanc then moved over to Carney, the source said.\n\nThe source claimed Carney has more than 30 sitting MPs in his corner so far, which would amount to more than one-fifth of the caucus.\n\nCandidates have until Jan. 23 to declare their candidacy, and must pay an entry fee of $350,000. Members must sign up by Jan. 27 to vote for the new leader.\n\nThat entry fee is steep compared to past Liberal races and could narrow the field of potential candidates. In the 2013 leadership race that Trudeau won — which had six candidates — the entrance fee was just $75,000.\n\nIn 2022, the six candidates who ran for the Conservative party leadership paid a $300,000 entrance fee.\n\nThe Liberal party has not yet announced all the rules for the leadership race, including the spending limit for candidates.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly took herself out of the running Friday, making her the second cabinet minister to choose their current job over a chance to become prime minister.\n\nJoly said that while she's ready to become the first female leader of the Liberal party, she's not willing to leave her cabinet posting at a \"crucial time\" for Canada-U. S. relations.\n\n\"The reality is, I can't do both,\" she told reporters on Parliament Hill on Friday morning.\n\nJoly made the comments heading into a Canada-U. S. cabinet committee meeting called to discuss the retaliatory measures Ottawa is preparing in the event incoming U.S. president Donald Trump follows through on his threat to slam Canada with stiff tariffs.\n\n\"We will be ready and I'll do my job,\" Joly said, adding that she will be headed back to Washington next week.\n\nLeBlanc dashed the hopes of many of his caucus supporters Wednesday by becoming the first potential cabinet aspirant to rule out a leadership bid. Judy Sgro and other Liberal MPs have asked him to change his mind, saying he would add to the race as a strong candidate.\n\nA host of other current cabinet ministers are also considering leadership bids, including Karina Gould, François-Philippe Champagne, Jonathan Wilkinson, Anita Anand and Steven MacKinnon.\n\nArya and former Montreal MP Frank Baylis are the only two candidates to officially declare they are in the race so far.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2025.\n\nKyle Duggan, The Canadian Press","summary":"OTTAWA — Former Bank of Canada governor Mark

behind Steele Dossier slaps employees with unexpected blow: ‘He’s frankly an a–hole’","text":"WASHINGTON — Democrats are buzzing about powerful party-linked attorney Marc Elias springing a mandatory arbitration clause on employees of his law firm — with insiders speculating about whether the firm has something to hide and accusing Elias of hypocritically limiting worker rights.\n\nNew York native Elias, 55, made headlines with his work on Hillary Clinton’s procurement of a dossier full of salacious gossip about then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 — and his eponymous law firm, which he founded in 2021 and has dozens of employees, works primarily on behalf of Democrats and progressive causes.\n\nThe Elias Law Group’s new policy, which drew an internal protest letter from 42 subordinates, prevents employees from suing and includes a class-action waiver and non-disclosure agreement, according to the legal news website Above the Law, which first reported on the move.\n\n“All, as a condition of employment…[Elias Law Group] is implementing an arbitration agreement that applies to all employees. The agreement implements an alternative to litigation for resolving employment-related disputes,” chief operating officer Jacqui Newman wrote on Dec. 19.\n\n“Arbitration offers a confidential and cost-effective way to address issues, ensuring that both employees and the Firm resolve matters fairly and efficiently. You will receive the agreement from HR with your 2025 compensation memo by the end of this week. All employees are required to review and sign the agreement by December 30, 2024,” Newman wrote.\n\nThe ensuing protest letter, also published by Above the Law, decried the “sudden, unexplained reversal of policy” and objected to the changes being issued “with no notice and little explanation”\n\n“Firm personnel have been given just over a week, during the winter holidays, to agree to this dramatic change in the terms of our employment,” Elias’ employees fumed. “And we have been offered no opportunity to provide any input or voice any concerns. No explanation for the urgency has been offered, and we can think of none.”\n\nDays after the announcement, Elias mysteriously purged his once-vociferous X account — stoking further intrigue.\n\n“I have stopped posting here. For pro-democracy news follow @DemocracyDocket and subscribe for free,” Elias informed his more than 816,000 followers.\n\nSources told The Post that Democratic insiders are perplexed about the implementation of the arbitration clause, which left-wingers loathe for its perceived benefit to bad bosses.\n\n“Everyone is wondering why there is such an urgency to it,” said a Democrat who has worked with Elias in the past. \n\n “It is especially bizarre to have sprung this on the staff in the week between Christmas and New Year’s.”\n\nA second person, a senior Democrat with knowledge of the situation, told The Post that “it just doesn’t make sense to be so hypocritical as a top Dem lawyer unless there’s some big reason he wants to avoid litigation by his staff.”\n\nThe drama prompted the airing of pent-up criticism of Elias, whose firm describes itself on its website as “the nation’s largest law firm focused on representing the Democratic Party, Democratic campaigns, nonprofit organizations, and individuals committed to securing a progressive future.”\n\n“Elias Law Group is all about Marc’s ego and not about the people who work there,” the Democrat who has worked with Elias said. “His lack of awareness and his lack of concern for entry and mid-level employees at his own firm is a scandal in itself.\n\n“Everything Marc Elias does is about attracting notice to himself.”\n\n“He’s a very smart guy,” the second source said, “but he has to be the smartest person in the room and is frankly an a–hole.\n\n“If Marc won’t do the right thing here, it’s not only deeply hypocritical, he’s making a real headache for his clients, many of whom are leaders in the Democratic and progressive movements,” this person said. “Marc owes everyone an explanation for this suspect decision and timing.”\n\nThe Elias Law Group did not respond to The Post’s requests for comment.","summary":"More than three dozen subordinates at the Elias Law Group have signed a letter of protest.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/10/us-news/dem-super-lawyer-behind-steele-dossier-slaps-employees-with-unexpected-blow-hes-frankly-an-a-hole/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/96517161.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0rfzXlqu-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:07:14","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":279843608,"title":"Greenland's leader says his people don't want to be Americans as Trump covets territory","text":"Greenland's prime minister said that the mineral-rich Arctic territory's people don't want to be Americans, but that he understands US President-elect Donald Trump's interest in the island given its strategic location and he's open to greater cooperation with Washington.\n\nThe comments from the Greenlandic leader, Múte B. Egede, came after Trump said earlier this week that he wouldn't rule out using force or economic pressure in order to make Greenland — which is an autonomous territory belonging to Denmark — a part of the United States. Trump said that it was a matter of national security for the U.S.\n\nEgede acknowledged that Greenland is part of the North American continent, and “a place that the Americans see as part of their world.” He said he hasn't spoken to Trump, but that he's open to discussions about what “unites us.”\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump is now a convicted felon. What does that mean?﻿\n\n“Cooperation is about dialogue. Cooperation means that you will work towards solutions,” he said.\n\nEgede has been calling for independence for Greenland, casting Denmark as a colonial power that hasn't always treated the Indigenous Inuit population well.\n\n“Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American. We want to be Greenlandic,” he said at a news conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen.\n\nTrump’s desire for Greenland has sparked anxiety in Denmark as well as across Europe. The United States is a strong ally of 27-nation European Union and the leading member of the NATO alliance, and many Europeans were shocked by the suggestion that an incoming US leader could even consider using force against an ally.\n\nBut Frederiksen said that she sees a positive aspect in the discussion.\n\n“The debate on Greenlandic independence and the latest announcements from the U.S. show us the large interest in Greenland,” she said. “Events which set in motion a lot of thoughts and feelings with many in Greenland and Denmark.\"\n\n“The US is our closest ally, and we will do everything to continue a strong cooperation,” she said.\n\nFrederiksen and Egede spoke to journalists after a biannual assembly of Denmark and two territories of its kingdom, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The meeting had been previously scheduled and wasn't called in response to Trump's recent remarks. Trump's eldest son also made a visit to Greenland on Tuesday, landing in a plane emblazoned with the word TRUMP and handing out Make America Great Again caps to locals.\n\nThe Danish public broadcaster, DR, reported Friday that Trump's team encouraged homeless and socially disadvantaged people in Greenland to appear in a video wearing the MAGA hats after being offered a free meal in a nice restaurant. The report quoted a local resident, Tom Amtof, who recognised some of those in a video broadcast by Trump's team.\n\n“They are being bribed, and it is deeply distasteful,” he said.\n\nGreenland has a population of 57,000. But it's a vast territory possessing natural resources that include oil, gas, and rare earth elements, which are expected to become more accessible as ice melts because of climate change.

There was also a small vigil of anti-Trump demonstrators behind a hoarding reading “Trump is guilty.”\n\nTrump’s counsel had argued sentencing should have been postponed while the Republican appealed his conviction, but New York state Associate Justice Ellen Gesmer rejected that on Tuesday.\n\nTrump repeatedly called the prosecution a “witch hunt” which Steinglass said was “designed to have a chilling effect.”\n\n“This defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system,” the career prosecutor said.\n\nTrump’s lawyer Todd Blanche said he “very, very much disagree with much of what the (prosecution) just said.”\n\nTrump was certified as the winner of the 2024 presidential election on Monday, four years after his supporters rioted at the US Capitol as he sought to overturn his 2020 defeat.","summary":"&#8220;Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,&#8221; said Merchan.

In a way, that hearkens back to “he said-she said” journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.\n\nThe moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.\n\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg delivers a keynote address.

PHOTO: AP\n\n“In the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,” said director of the International Fact-Checking Network Angie Drobnic Holan. Her organisation started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta’s move.\n\n“In the long term,” she said, “I think it’s very uncertain what this will all mean.”\n\nFACT-CHECKING IN THE MEDIA IS A FEW DECADES OLD\n\nFact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it’s a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter “he said-she said” stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organisation FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.\n\nPolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.\n\nBy 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, “sped up a trend that had already begun”.\n\nSome conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn’t like being called out for it, said chief executive officer and editor of the centre-right site The Dispatch Steve Hayes.\n\n“The people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, ‘We are the arbiter of truth, period,” Hayes said. “And anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.”\n\nLabelling systems largely didn’t help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of “pants on fire”, as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.\n\nHolan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work, “That attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.”\n\nPEOPLE THINK TRUTH REMAINS ELUSIVE EVEN WITH FACT-CHECKING\n\nGrand Old Party suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism’s Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70 per cent of republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn’t asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52 per cent of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they’re reading about elections is true or not.\n\nIn a column on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticised Republican officials for delivering “mostly false” facts 88 times compared to 31 times for democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.\n\nBUT IS THAT BIAS? OR IS IT CHECKING FACTS?\n\nAdair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book, Beyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy. He’s not hesitant anymore. “Trump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,” Adair said. “I’m not the first to say that. I think he has capitalised on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.”\n\nTension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump’s team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump’s second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.\n\nOn its own, fact-checking “doesn’t reach those exposed to misinformation,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/bias-or-truth/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PAGE-11-B_11012025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 23:04:43","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.044},{"id":279850228,"title":"FBI must be independent and above the partisan fray, outgoing director says","text":"The FBI must remain independent, above the partisan fray and “committed to upholding the rule of law”, outgoing director Christopher Wray said in a farewell address just days before his expected retirement at the conclusion of the Biden administration and following more than seven years on the job.\n\n“No matter what’s happening out there,” Mr Wray said, “in here, we’ve got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time, with professionalism, with rigour, with integrity.\n\n“That means following the facts wherever they lead, no matter who likes it or doesn’t — because trust me, if there’s anything I’ve learned in this job, there’s always someone who doesn’t like you.”\n\nThe remarks at the packed farewell ceremony at FBI headquarters steered clear of any direct political reference, with no overt mention of President-elect Donald Trump’s scathing criticism of him or the turmoil the bureau has encountered amid a spate of highly charged investigations into both Mr Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nAdhering to the rule of law, Mr Wray added, “means conducting investigations without fear or favour and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication’s not there”.\n\n“That’s what the rule of law is all about,” he said. “We’ve got to maintain our independence and objectivity, staying above partisanship and politics because that’s what the American people expect and I think that’s what they deserve.”\n\nMr Wray has announced his intent to resign ahead of Mr Trump’s inauguration on January 20, roughly three years short of the 10-year tenure given to FBI directors.\n\nThe move followed Mr Trump’s statement that he would install Mr Patel, a former Justice Department prosecutor who has sharply criticised FBI investigations into Mr Trump, called for major overhauls of the bureau and talked about going after members of the so-called “deep state” in Washington — a pejorative term Mr Trump and his allies used for entrenched civil servants.\n\nMr Wray’s tenure saw the emergence of increasingly sophisticated Chinese cyberespionage campaigns, brazen assassination plots by Iran — including one that targeted Mr — and, most recently, a New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 revellers and that the FBI is investigating as an act of terror.\n\nBut the FBI in recent years has found itself mired in politically explosive investigations that have dominated attention and affected public perception of the bureau.\n\nThose include investigations into Mr Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate — agents searched the Florida property in 2022 — and his efforts to undo the 2020 presidential election, both of which resulted in indictments.\n\nThe FBI also investigated Mr Biden’s handling of classified information and the president’s son, Hunter, on tax and gun violations.

It reaffirms long standing principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics.”\n\nThe memo further stated that instead of specific DEI programs, Meta will now “focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.”\n\nThe move comes just days after Meta declared that it would be ending its fact-checking partnership program that was used to censor content on Facebook and its other social media websites.\n\nThese are wins insomuch as this indicates the general direction of big business and social media in the age of Trump.\n\nZuckerberg has been making the rounds in a media blitz to convince everyone that he’s had a change of heart and that all those mean things his company did—like ruthlessly censor content that the Left didn’t like—was really because of the mean old Biden administration.\n\nThat’s funny—did Biden officials force Zuckerberg to spend hundreds of millions of dollars supporting Democrats and Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential bid?\n\nWho knows what’s really in Zuckerberg’s heart. In a sense, it doesn’t matter. What’s happening at Meta is indicative of a larger trend that’s a product of the two big blows against the corporate DEI complex.\n\nThe first was the Supreme Court’s ruling on affirmative action in higher education that declared racial preferences to be unlawful. This put enormous pressure on universities to end racial preferences in admissions and hiring because they were suddenly subject to costly lawsuits. It didn’t entirely cure the disease.\n\nHigher education is committed to DEI as a matter of faith and university officials have done their best to skirt the law. \n\nIn contrast, Big Business is a lot less committed to the bit and a lot more dependent on the bottom line.\n\nDEI programs were already a drag on companies for many reasons. Paying inquisitors who often make the final product worse is hardly a winning strategy for any business, despite what the bogus and now thoroughly debunked McKinsey study said on the matter.\n\nSo now that businesses don’t feel they have to have DEI programs, many are voluntarily phasing them out to save money.\n\nThat change will be hastened by the fact that Democrats are being swept out of power and President Donald Trump will soon be back in the White House. It’s not just about the “vibe” shift, though to a certain extent that’s a real thing right now.\n\nMore importantly, businesses must consider whether it’s worth it to keep DEI programs when they have a chance to be investigated by the Justice Department under Trump. On this end, big business will face serious whiplash. All the pro-DEI nonsense promoted by the Biden White House is now under threat and companies know that. Lawsuits will be filed, funding will be pulled, and businesses will have to ask themselves if it’s worth it to keep up the nonsense.\n\nZuckerberg, whatever his motivation, is smart to get ahead of this and declare that DEI and censorship will go away and that he’s had an Elon Musk-style conversion moment.\n\nOur system shouldn’t work this way. But thanks to the growth and transformation of our federal government over the last century, presidential elections can have sweeping consequences.\n\nThe danger is that DEI policies can all be brought back with a shift in power. This moment of Glasnost could end abruptly if the Left wins a few election cycles and continues its march through the institutions.\n\nIt’s critical that in the next few years that DEI and the left-wing ideology it’s associated with be further discredited in the eyes of the American people. DEI’s proponents are typically incompetent at governing as opposed to accruing raw political power. And they no longer fully control the media environment to foist narratives and untruths on the American people at will.\n\nThe Trump administration must do what any wise general does after a great victory. It must pursue a routed opponent and use this time to decisively eviscerate DEI’s hold over Western institutions.","summary":"The Trump Effect is in full swing before the new president even takes office.&#160; Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that the company would end...
