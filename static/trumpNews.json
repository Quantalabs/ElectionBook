And the Chinese have categorically stated that no such requests were being made.\n\nAhead of this weekend's meeting in Switzerland, Beijing wanted to make it crystal clear who had asked for the talks.\n\n\"The meeting is being held at the request of the US side,\" declared Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian.\n\nTrump tried to downplay the importance of who was the requester versus the requested.\n\n\"We can all play games — who made the first call, who didn't make them. Doesn't matter,\" Trump said.\n\nTake of that what you will.\n\nWhat seems clear is that China was willing to bet it could withstand the pressure of tariffs better than the US could.\n\nChina stands firm\n\nThe tariffs were certainly hurting China's economy.\n\nAmerica is a massive market for their products, and a 145 per cent tax on their goods was an effective embargo of trade.\n\nChina's leadership, however, doesn't need to be as sensitive to public opinion as Trump's.\n\nThey know US public discontent is quickly picked up both by polling numbers and by members of Congress hearing directly from their constituents.\n\nPolls were already suggesting American discontent with the way their president was handling the economy, while members of Congress had fiery town hall meetings.\n\nTrump may be banned by the Constitution from running for a third term, but he still has a strong interest in Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress after the midterm elections, held next year.\n\nChina's leadership faces no such democratic reckoning. They could withstand pressure longer than Trump could.\n\nTrump capitulation a positive sign for investors\n\nTrump's first major step-down was when he put in place a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on all countries except China.\n\nAt the time of that pause, he said it was because people were getting \"yippy\".\n\nNow he has put a pause on the reciprocal tariffs on China too.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the announcement because they have taken it as further evidence that Trump isn't as wedded to a high-tariff regime as he claimed on Liberation Day.\n\nBut in both cases, Trump has kept the 10 per cent \"baseline\" tariff in place.\n\nChina is also facing a 20 per cent punitive tariff for what Trump says is its role in the manufacturing and distribution of the drug fentanyl.\n\nLast week, the president announced a trade \"deal\" with the UK, the first since the reciprocal tariffs were put in place.\n\nWhile Trump claimed it as a \"maxed-out deal\", once you scratch the surface, it looked more like a deal to make a deal in the future.\n\nYes, the UK is now able to sell 100,000 new vehicles into the US at a 10 per cent tax, instead of the 25 per cent tariff most countries now face when selling cars.\n\nThere are also concessions for steel and aluminium, but the UK hasn't managed to negotiate away the 10 per cent baseline tariff.\n\nTariff lessons for Australia and others\n\nEvidence is now mounting that the 10 per cent tariff really is here to stay.\n\nIf that's the case, it means there's little incentive for countries like Australia, which is only facing the baseline 10 per cent tariff, to negotiate any deal with Trump.\n\nUnlike the UK, Australia doesn't have a local car industry to protect.\n\nYes, some relief from the steel and aluminium tariffs would be beneficial to the companies and people involved in those sectors.\n\nBut Australia won't want to be trading off things like biosecurity or access to cheaper generic medicines to gain those benefits.\n\nWhat may well shake out of Trump's tariffs is a series of deals with individual countries for slightly increased American access to markets — which Trump will herald as major achievements.\n\nTrump may have overreached with his inflated tariff on China, but investors should be careful about overreacting.\n\nA 30 per cent tariff on Chinese goods is still going to hurt American consumers, and it doesn't look like the baseline tariff is going anywhere anytime soon.","summary":"The trade war between the US and China isn't fully over, but a deal between the two sides to slash reciprocal tariffs is a major capitulation from Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-13/trump-china-tariffs-capitulation-markets-respond/105285374","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7319ecbecedae13eea991bfd25d7f9e1?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2099&cropW=3731&xPos=0&yPos=194&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 01:02:48","author":"Carrington Clarke","authors":["Carrington Clarke"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":320653910,"title":"Trump’s Gulf tour: What to expect — $1 trillion deals, Gulf summit and a ‘Persian Gulf’ name change","text":"Dubai: US President Donald Trump has embarked on a three-day visit to the Gulf, his first official foreign trip since retaking office in January. .The high-stakes tour kicks off in Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, with significant economic and geopolitical objectives on the table..What should Gulf economies do to absorb Trump's policies? .This marks Trump’s second overseas visit since returning to the White House, following his attendance at Pope Francis’s funeral in Rome last month..Riyadh first: Breaking tradition again.Trump arrives in Riyadh on Tuesday, continuing a tradition from his first term, when he chose Saudi Arabia as his first international destination, breaking with the longstanding tradition of visiting the UK, Canada or Mexico..Attack on oil tankers in Gulf of Oman: Trump pins tanker attacks on Iran, dismisses shipping lane threat.He is set to attend a Gulf summit in Riyadh on Wednesday, visit Qatar later that day, and conclude his tour in the UAE on Thursday.Trump won’t be able to avoid diplomacy on Gaza or Iran: The Gulf countries hosting him are also interested in easing the regional tensions that emanate from these two places.“Trump can easily score a win by reassuring them of America’s strategic commitment to the region, demonstrating consistent messaging and generally rising above the fray,” analysts Elizabeth Dent and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy wrote Friday..$1 trillion deals: Trump’s economic focus.One of the primary objectives of Trump’s visit is securing major economic deals, including a $1 trillion Saudi investment in US industries — a notable expansion of the $600 billion pledge made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier this year..Yemen truce deal is only between US and Al Houthis, says government.The push for such deals comes as the US faces declining economic growth, marking its first drop in output in three years..Security and stability: Gulf states’ priorities.Regional leaders are eager for Trump to reassure them about US security commitments. .US calls for a coalition to protect Gulf waters.“Security, security and security” is what Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states seek most from Trump’s visit, said Ali Shihabi, an author and commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia..“Gulf States are looking for reassurance of the US security commitment to the Gulf’s stability,” Shihabi told CNN. “Trump has many priorities and has been known to lose interest quickly … and they want to keep him engaged.”.Last year, the US and Saudi Arabia came close to finalising a landmark defence and trade pact – but the deal stalled over Saudi Arabia’s insistence that Israel commit to a path toward Palestinian statehood..Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group, told CNN’s Becky Anderson that Trump is likely to move ahead with major deals regardless of normalisation, which he said is “dead.”.Saudi top diplomat in US to prepare for Trump visit.Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the president wants to expand the Abraham Accords, under which the UAE and Bahrain recognised Israel during Trump’s first term, to include Saudi Arabia..Talks were reportedly under way on Saudi Arabia joining the accords, but after Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman paused those discussions..‘Persian Gulf’… or Arabian Gulf?.In a symbolic shift, Trump has stated he may decide during his trip how the US refers to the body of water between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. .Currently known as the “Persian Gulf” in US circles, Trump may opt for the terms “Arabian Gulf” or “Gulf of Arabia” instead, sparking interest in the region over this diplomatic decision..UAE: AI, tech, and economic diversification.In the UAE, Trump is to meet President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss investment opportunities in sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing..In March, the UAE announced a $1.4 trillion investment plan over 10 years focused on AI, semiconductors, manufacturing and energy. Its existing US investments already total $1 trillion, according to the UAE embassy in Washington..“The UAE sees a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a significant contributor in AI and advanced technology,” Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE President, told CNN. .“The commitment to invest $1.4 trillion… aligns with the UAE’s goal to diversify its economy away from its over reliance on hydrocarbons to ensure prosperity for the country in the future.”.Qatar: Military ties and Syria sanctions.In Qatar, where the US maintains its largest military base in the region, Trump is expected to meet with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss military cooperation and regional security..Given Qatar’s close relationship with Syria’s leadership, there may also be discussions about easing sanctions on Syria..Why not Israel?.Israel is absent from Trump’s itinerary, a notable omission amid rising tensions in Gaza. Sources suggest Israel had hoped for a visit during the trip, but Trump dismissed the possibility, stating, “We will be doing it at some point, but not for this trip.”.A US official told Axios that “nothing good can come out of a visit to Israel at the moment,” as the conflict in Gaza intensifies..What’s at stake.Trump’s Gulf tour, focused on economic partnerships, regional security, and geopolitical alignment, is shaping up to be a critical moment for US influence in the region. His actions could set the stage for future diplomatic breakthroughs, including potential shifts in Saudi-Israel relations and a redefined US-Gulf relationship.","summary":"Trump’s Gulf agenda: Summit, big deals, and name chang","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/trump-s-gulf-tour-what-to-expect-1-trillion-deals-gulf-summit-and-a-persian-gulf-name-change-1.500124957","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-05-12/8nh1nh8t/trump_saudi_1747085562729.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 01:01:00","author":"Gulf News Report","authors":["Gulf News Report"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0.125},{"id":320651532,"title":"India News | Delhi CM Rekha Gupta Offers Prayers at North Guruvayurappan Temple","text":"New Delhi [India], May 13 (ANI): Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta offered prayers at the North Guruvayurappan Temple in the national capital on Monday.\nCM Gupta was accompanied by Delhi BJP President Virendra Sachdeva.\nAlso Read | Bodoland Lottery Result Today, May 13, 2025: Assam State Lottery Sambad Tuesday Lucky Draw Results Declared, Check Winners List With Ticket Numbers.\nSpeaking to ANI, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said, \"The national capital, Delhi, is a miniature of India.

He should also press the government to end the persecution of underground churches, clergy, and worshipers.\"\nIt added, \"The Chinese government has continued to install Chinese Communist Party-compliant clergy. AsiaNews reported that during the mourning period for Pope Francis, who died on April 21, 2025, the Chinese government had moved forward on the appointments of an auxiliary bishop in Shanghai and the bishop of Xinxiang, Henan province.\"\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Hamas Says It Released American-Israeli Hostage Edan Alexander in Goodwill Gesture Toward Donald Trump Administration.\nMaya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said the new Pope should push for fresh negotiations with Beijing to protect the religious freedom of Catholics in China.\n\"Pope Leo XIV has an opportunity to make a fresh start with China to protect the religious freedom of China's Catholics. The new Pope should press for negotiations that could help improve the right to religious practice for everyone in China,\" Maya said.\n\"Chinese Catholics worshiping in underground churches are among the 'ordinary people' on whom Pope Leo has said the church should focus its attention. It's critical for religious freedom in China that the Catholic church stands on their side, and not on the side of their oppressors,\" Maya added.\nThe HRW statement further said that Pope Leo should press the Chinese government to immediately free several Catholic clergy, including James Su Zhimin, Augustine Cui Tai, Julius Jia Zhiguo, Joseph Zhang Weizhu, Peter Shao Zhumin, and Thaddeus Ma Daqin, who in recent years have been imprisoned, forcibly disappeared, or subjected to house arrest and other harassment.\nThe Chinese government has long restricted the country's estimated 12 million Catholics to worship in official churches under the leadership of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, and has persecuted Catholics who have attended underground \"house churches\" or pledged allegiance only to the pope. The government has conducted frequent raids on underground churches and arrested unapproved clergy and congregants.\nThe 2018 Provisional Agreement regarding the Appointment of Bishops, the full text of which has never been made public, ended a decades-long standoff over who had the authority to appoint bishops in China. Under the agreement, Beijing proposes future bishops, and the pope has veto power over those appointments.\nSince the 2018 agreement, the two parties have agreed on the appointment of 10 bishops, covering about a third of the over 90 dioceses in China that remained without a bishop. The Vatican has never exercised its veto power, however, even when the Chinese government violated the agreement by unilaterally appointing bishops in 2022 and 2023, appointments that Pope Francis later accepted, according to HRW.\nThe Chinese government, which restricts all religious practice in China to five officially recognized religions, regulates official church business and retains control over personnel appointments, publications, finances, and seminary applications.\nThe 2018 Holy See-China agreement was reached during President Xi Jinping's drive to tighten already stringent controls over religions in China in the name of \"Sinicization\" of religion. In recent years, the authorities have demolished hundreds of church buildings or the crosses atop them, prevented adherents from gathering in unofficial churches, restricted access to the Bible, confiscated religious materials not authorised by the government, and banned Bible and religious apps.\nThe HRW further reported that the Chinese government's Sinicization of religion has meant ruthless repression of Buddhism in Tibet, where the Chinese authorities have imposed strict controls over the process of selecting Tibetan lamas, including by forcibly disappearing the six-year-old Panchen Lama since 1995, and by controlling the process for the selection of the future Dalai Lama.

Those poor girls, so incredibly unfair,’ tweeted a third. \n\nOne person writing an opinion piece in The College Fix about the event suggested Stark-Chessa had in fact deliberately slowed their pace down so as not to win by so large a margin. \n\n‘Given that the meet appeared to have been a local one between three schools, I had a sneaky suspicion he did “just enough” to win … without making it look lopsided,’ the writer stated.\n\nFueling the debate further is the background of Stark-Chessa’s parents, who are not just any Maine residents but academic elites with powerful institutional roles.\n\nSoren’s father, Dr. Frank Chessa, is director of clinical ethics at Maine Medical Center and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. \n\nHe plays a senior role at the hospital’s Gender Care Clinic, which provides ‘gender-affirming’ care and surgical consultations for patients, including adolescents.\n\nSoren’s mother, Susan Stark, is a professor of philosophy at Bates College, where her academic work focuses on reparations, white supremacy, and reproductive ethics. \n\nMaine has been at the epicenter of controversy after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at ‘Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports’. It came after years of controversy involving athletes such as Blaire Fleming and Lia Thomas.\n\nBack in February, Mills had a now-infamous run-in with the president during a White House meeting, when she told Trump ‘see you in court’ over his threat to withdraw federal funding if Maine did not comply with his ban.\n\nThe feud has continued, with Maine currently being sued by the Department of Justice over its refusal to ban transgender athletes.\n\nBut last week the board of the Maine Region School Unit voted to ditch a policy that states: ‘Students shall be able to participate in accordance with the gender identity asserted at school.’\n\nStark-Chessa’s athletic rise has been swift – and controversial. \n\nJust eighteen months ago, as a freshman, Stark-Chessa competed on the boys’ team but since beginning to identify as female, the runner has dominated girls’ sports across cross country, track and field, and Nordic skiing.\n\nIn the fall of 2023, Stark-Chessa placed third in the Class C girls’ cross country state championship and was later named to the all-state team by the Maine Trust for Local News.\n\n‘I hugged three girls crying after that race,’ said Chantal Mincey speaking in 2023, a mother from Houlton to the Daily Signal. \n\n‘They love this sport, but what’s the point if they’re just going to lose every time to someone who has a male advantage? It’s crushing their confidence.\n\n‘I have to reassure them: It’s your mom and dad’s fight, and we will protect you, and we will support you in this, and we’ll do the best we can, and we won’t give up,’ she said. \n\n‘We will do our best to protect these female athletes.’ \n\n‘These girls are in a lose-lose situation,’ said Cathy Ross in 2023, a mother of two runners to the Daily Signal. ‘They don’t want to pretend Stark-Chessa is a girl and congratulate him, but if they don’t, they’re labeled hateful or bad sports. It’s humiliating.’\n\nAt a recent Festival of Champions cross-country meet, Stark-Chessa placed fifth among girls – but their time would have ranked 162nd in the boys’ division. \n\nSome parents believe Soren’s upbringing may have influenced their shift in identity. \n\n‘You can see this kid from 200 meters away,’ said Katherine Collins, a mother from Winterport told the Maine Wire. \n\n‘You look at his thighs, his build – it’s obvious he’s a boy. I wonder if his parents had a hand in all this.’\n\nDespite growing opposition, Maine’s governing bodies have done little to change course.\n\nIn 2021, Maine’s Human Rights Act was revised to bar discrimination in school athletics on the basis of gender identity. \n\nThe Maine Principals’ Association (MPA) followed suit in 2023, repealing a prior rule that barred athletes from competing in girls’ sports if they had an ‘unfair athletic advantage.’\n\nUnder current MPA rules, no medical records or gender reassignment documentation is required. \n\nA school alone can verify an athlete’s declared gender for purposes of competition.\n\nMike Burnham, executive director of the MPA, told WMTW, ‘The MPA, and its member schools, don’t make state law, but are required to follow it.’\n\nParents like Chris Boyington believe the consequences are nothing short of catastrophic.\n\n‘My daughter trains every day,’ he said to the Daily Signal. ‘She has potential. But the moment a biological male enters the field, her future is jeopardized. And I fear this is just the beginning.’\n\nBoyington is far from alone. Across Maine, parents are sounding alarms about what they see as the erosion of hard-fought opportunities for girls.\n\n‘Eventually,’ Ross warned, ‘if more boys get the idea, you’ll have the top 10 in a girls’ race all be biological males. And then what do you have left? You don’t have girls’ sports anymore.’\n\nLaws once meant to protect women’s access to athletics appear to be enabling biological boys to claim championships, medals, and scholarships, often at the expense of the very girls those laws were written to protect.\n\nBiological males have reportedly claimed more than 30 girls’ and women’s titles across the US in the past 19 years – with most of that surge occurring in the past three reports the Washington Stand.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration sued Maine for not complying with the government’s push to ban transgender athletes in girls and women’s sports, escalating a dispute over whether the state is abiding by a federal law that bars discrimination in education based on sex.\n\nThe lawsuit came after weeks of feuding between the Republican administration and Democratic Governor Janet Mills that had led to threats to cut off crucial federal funding and a clash at the White House when she told President Donald Trump: ‘We’ll see you in court.’\n\nThe political overtones of the moment were clear, with Attorney General Pam Bondi – and one of the athletes who joined her on stage at the Justice Department – citing the matter as a priority for Trump. \n\n‘President Trump, before he was elected, this has been a huge issue for him,’ Bondi said. ‘Pretty simple: girls play in girls’ sports, boys play in boys’ sports. Men play in men’s sports, women play in women’s sports.’\n\nTrump campaigned against the participation of transgender athletes in sports in his 2024 race. \n\nAs president, he has signed executive orders to prohibit that and to use a rigid definition of the sexes, rather than gender, for federal government purposes. The orders are being challenged in court.\n\nTrump’s departments of Education and Health and Human Services have said Maine’s education agency is violating the federal Title IX antidiscrimination law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls teams. \n\nThe Justice Department is asking the court to order the state to direct all schools to prohibit the participation of males in athletic competition designated for females.\n\nMaine officials have refused to agree with a settlement that would have banned transgender students from sports, arguing that the law does not prevent schools from letting transgender athletes participate. \n\nMills has said there is a pressure campaign by Washington to force Maine to ignore its own human rights laws.\n\n‘This matter has never been about school sports or the protection of women and girls, as has been claimed, it is about states rights and defending the rule of law against a federal government bent on imposing its will, instead of upholding the law,’ Mills said in a statement.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the government tried to extend civil rights policies to protect transgender people. \n\nIn 2016, the Justice Department, then led by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, sued North Carolina over a law that required transgender people to use public restrooms and showers that corresponded the gender on their birth certificate.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in February, ‘Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,’ that gave federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with his administration’s interpretation of ‘sex’ as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\nQuestions over the rights of transgender people have become a major political issue in the past five years.\n\nTwenty-six states have laws or policies barring transgender girls from girls school sports. GOP-controlled states have also been banning gender-affirming health care for transgender minors and restricting bathroom use in schools and sometimes other public buildings.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSpectators at a Maine high school spring track meet were stunned as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Young Girl&#8217;s Frustrated Reaction After Losing Race to Transgender Competitor first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/young-girls-frustrated-reaction-after-losing-race-to-transgender-competitor/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Girls-act-of-disappointment-after-she-lost-race-to-trans.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:43:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":320650626,"title":"BREAKING: Donald Trump touches down in UK as Air Force One lands on way to Middle East","text":"Donald Trump has landed in the UK with his plane refuelling at a US airbase as he heads to the Middle East for talks with trouble flaring in Gaza and Iran.\n\nFlight restrictions around RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk already indicated the US president’s Air Force One jet would land there late on Monday or early on Tuesday en route to an official visit to the Middle East. \n\nLegislation published by the Government prohibits unauthorised flights in the area between 11pm on Monday and 4am on Tuesday.\n\nThis is “for reasons of public safety and security during visits by a head of state”, according to a statutory instrument. The same restrictions are in place between 5pm and 10pm on Friday, indicating Air Force One may refuel at RAF Mildenhall again.\n\nTrump refuels in the UK\n\nIt took under 26 minutes to refuel Trump’s plane on a stopover at the site during a journey to Vietnam in February 2019 during his first term as president, US officials said. There are reports that Trump intends to accept a Boeing 747 plane as a gift from the Qatari royal family during his visit to the Middle East.\n\nThe plane would be converted to serve as Air Force One. Trump suggested last month that a date for September is being set for him to meet the King in Britain.\n\nHe told reporters in the White House he was “invited by the King and the country”. Trump was feted with a grand state visit to Britain, hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II, in June 2019 during his first presidency.\n\nOn his trip to the Middle East, Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, though his most pressing regional challenges concern two other countries: Israel and Iran.\n\nWhat is the situation in Gaza?\n\nAfter ending a ceasefire two months ago, Israel is intensifying the war in the Gaza Strip, where a blockade on food, medicine and other supplies is worsening a humanitarian crisis. And Iran, an enemy of Israel and a rival of Saudi Arabia, stands on the cusp of being able to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nYet Trump will focus his attention on three energy-rich nations home to existing or planned Trump-branded real estate projects — places where he aims to leverage American economic interests to do what he personally revels in: making business deals.\n\n“This is his happy place,” said Jon B Alterman, a senior vice president at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “His hosts will be generous and hospitable. They’ll be keen to make deals. They’ll flatter him and not criticize him. And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners.”\n\nWill Trump be hosted in The Gulf?\n\nTrump won’t be able to avoid diplomacy on Gaza or Iran. The Gulf countries hosting him are also interested in easing the regional tensions that emanate from these two places.\n\n“Trump can easily score a win by reassuring them of America’s strategic commitment to the region, demonstrating consistent messaging and generally rising above the fray,” analysts Elizabeth Dent and Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said.\n\nBy not scheduling a trip to Israel during his first trip to the region during his second term as president, Trump is reinforcing a feeling in Israel that its interests may not be top of mind for him. That sense intensified last week, when Trump announced that the U.S. would halt its strikes on the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group in Yemen that agreed to stop its attacks on American vessels in the Red Sea.","summary":"Donald Trump has landed at a US airbase in the UK for refuelling as Air Force One heads to the Middle East where the president has talks planned amid trouble in Gaza and Iran","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-donald-trump-touches-down-35213498","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article35213500.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Trump-25132563357694.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:42:39","author":"Michael D.

The delegation also highlighted national strategies to increase women's representation in leadership roles.\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Hamas Says It Released American-Israeli Hostage Edan Alexander in Goodwill Gesture Toward Donald Trump Administration.\nMona Ghanem Al Marri, Vice President of the UAE Gender Balance Council, underscored the UAE's steadfast contributions to G20 discussions and the close alignment between the Working Group's priorities and the nation's women's empowerment agenda.\nShe emphasised that empowering women across sectors is a national objective, achieved through progressive legislation, institutional support, capacity-building programmes and ambitious targets. These measures have driven notable gains in women's leadership within government, business, technology and the green economy.\nShe also highlighted the value of international collaboration through platforms such as the G20 Women's Empowerment Working Group.

Backed by national policies and the strong support of the country's leadership, these initiatives have significantly increased women's representation in decision-making positions.\nToday, women hold 50 percent of the seats in the Federal National Council and around one-third of cabinet positions. Their presence has also grown across the judiciary, diplomatic corps, and senior executive roles in both the public and private sectors. The implementation of the Equal Pay for Equal Work Law in 2018 has further strengthened the foundation for more women to move into top leadership positions.\nMouza Al Suwaidi reaffirmed the UAE's commitment to financial inclusion, underscoring the constitutional guarantees and Central Bank policies that ensure women have equal access to financial services.\n\"The UAE remains committed to advancing women's financial autonomy and participation in economic life,\" Al Suwaidi said. \"Our Constitution and laws guarantee equal rights for women to own property, access credit, and participate in commercial activities.\"\nShe also highlighted the country's expanding care economy, supported by comprehensive laws and policies such as maternity and parental leave, remote work options, and the provision of on-site nurseries in government workplaces. In 2024, the UAE launched the Ministry of Family Affairs to further strengthen family stability, reinforcing the family's role as a cornerstone of both society and the economy.\nIn addition, she outlined the UAE's multi-layered approach to addressing gender-based violence, which includes robust legislation and protective frameworks to safeguard women's safety and well-being.\nConcluding her remarks, Al Suwaidi said, \"We value the platform the G20 provides to share knowledge, shape global dialogue, and drive collective action toward gender equality.

Officials needed to consider whether the new legislation would spark a public backlash especially after hard lessons from the 2019 protests,” he said.\n“But it shouldn’t come too late as national security risks can emerge urgently, when US-China relations have been worsening.”\nSection 110 of Article 23 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance empowers Hong Kong authorities to make subsidiary legislation to provide for specific implementation details of the security law. The government planned to enact it via “negative vetting” on an unspecified date of gazettal.\nLau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, a semi-official think tank, also attributed the security authorities’ move to United States President Donald Trump’s strategies to contain and isolate China through a trade war.\nHe dismissed speculation that the planned new law was intended to apply to ongoing high-profile cases including the national security trial of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, which is set to hear its closing argument later this year.\nHe said Article 55 of the Beijing-imposed national security law empowered authorities to transfer significant national security cases for trial to mainland China, for example, when the Hong Kong judiciary faced insurmountable challenges in presiding over cases.\n“But this will only be invoked as ‘a last resort’, not during ongoing trials. A very extreme scenario is when no designated local judges could discharge their duties due to overwhelming pressure exerted by the Western powers,” he said.\n“This is highly unlikely, but authorities need to prepare for any kind of scenario when the US administration is dominated by China hawks.”\nArticle 55 has been one of the most controversial provisions in the security law, as it grants the Office for Safeguarding National Security jurisdiction over certain cases. This has not been invoked since the law came into effect in 2020.\nCiting a scenario to justify the need for the subsidiary legislation, Tong said that if Article 55 was invoked but an individual refused to comply with orders from a mainland court to appear at trial or provide documents, the planned new law could specify that relevant Hong Kong security laws – not the mainland ones – were applicable.\nOne of the proposed subsidiary legislations is about prohibiting a person from disclosing information regulating investigations being conducted by the office in certain cases to ensure strict confidentiality.\nA government insider explained that while the existing clauses under Article 23 were “too broad in nature”, the planned new law could narrow the scope to cover implementation details on a local law level.\nTong said there were a few things authorities could specify in the subsidiary legislation, including the extent of required confidentiality and the consequences for non-compliance.\nProfessor Simon Young Ngai-man, from the law faculty of the University of Hong Kong, noted that the interpretation of the national security law by the country’s top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, had already made clear the powers of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security to make judgments.\nIt was also clear that its decisions were very broad and not subject to judicial review, he said, suggesting that someone might “have in mind an anticipated problem” should Article 55 be invoked.\n“Perhaps more procedural clarity is needed, especially if jurisdictional questions arise when the novel mechanism in Article 55 is ever invoked,” he said.","summary":"But observers dismiss speculation law aimed at being applied to ongoing high-profile cases.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3310053/hong-kong-subsidiary-law-push-prompted-sino-us-tensions-muted-society","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/12/81214669-4163-473b-8054-9f1cfee29b76_724db307.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:30:14","author":"Natalie Wong","authors":["Natalie Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":320653370,"title":"EPA Targets Engine Start-Stop Systems in Cars","text":"The Trump administration is taking aim at automatic engine start-stop systems—technology installed in millions of U.S. vehicles to reduce fuel use and emissions—with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin signaling plans to roll back incentives for the feature that he says drivers despise.\n\nZeldin’s announcement comes amid a broader shift under President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved aggressively to dismantle a range of environmental rules it says put pointless burdens on energy producers, manufacturers, and consumers.\n\nWhile the EPA doesn’t require start-stop systems, it has granted automakers fuel economy credits for adopting the technology. Zeldin’s post suggests the agency may eliminate or revise those incentives, though officials have yet to announce formal policy changes.\n\nThe EPA declined to provide details of any plans to revise or eliminate existing incentives in response to an inquiry from The Epoch Times.\n\nStart-stop systems are designed to automatically shut off a vehicle’s engine when it stops—at a red light, for example—and restart it when the driver releases the brake.

In most vehicles, drivers must press a button to turn the feature off each time they start the car.\n\nZeldin’s remarks come as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping deregulatory agenda across multiple agencies.\n\nOn May 9, Trump directed agencies to rescind federal water efficiency standards for household appliances such as showerheads, toilets, dishwashers, and washing machines—calling them relics of a “radical green agenda” that reduced performance and increased costs.\n\nThe EPA’s expected rollback of incentives for start-stop systems would mark another high-profile pivot away from the climate policies of previous administrations.","summary":"Start-stop systems exploded under Obama-era rules offering emissions credits, but officials are now signaling a course reversal.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/epa-targets-engine-start-stop-systems-in-cars-5856617","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/05/15/id5266909-New-York-cars-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:30:11","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":320651534,"title":"World News | EU Extends Sanctions, Legal Framework Against Cyberattacks","text":"Brussels [Belgium], May 13 (ANI/WAM): The European Council has decided to extend restrictive measures (sanctions) against cyberattacks threatening the European Union and its member states for another year, until May 18, 2026, while also extending the legal framework (sanctions regime) for these measures for three years, until May 18, 2028.\nThis framework allows the European Union to impose targeted restrictive measures on individuals or entities involved in cyberattacks that have a significant impact and pose an external threat to the EU or its member states.

We just kind of talked about how we've dealt with it, how to move forward, how to remain positive and when to comment and not to comment,' she told People. \n\nSt. Cyr, who like Hudson was semifinalist but didn't win the competition, added that Hudson was gracious when talking about dealing with the press. \n\n'I really appreciate her willingness to talk to me about the media coverage,' St. Cyr said.\n\nThe transgender pageant contestant was worried about being pitted against Hudson by the media, admitting: 'that's how people get clicks.' \n\nHowever, St. Cyr confirmed that 'there was no bad blood' between the competitors - who had never met before the contest - and if anything, the meeting with Hudson was beneficial. \n\n'It definitely made us both a lot more comfortable going into the pageant that night,' she said. \n\nHudson advised St. Cyr to do her homework before she spoke with the media and to find out 'who's doing these articles and when you should be commenting.'\n\nOverall, the vibes between the pair were supporting and neither was willing to make a public spectacle of the other. \n\n'I think we both wanted to make it clear that we had nothing to do with it and that we were just happy to be competing. So I was very thankful for that.'\n\nSt. Cyr said that Hudson understood 'that a lot of backlash' was drawn by both of them.\n\n'We showed up and competed and we both made it to the second day,' she said of the pageant itself. \n\n'So I think that that shows a lot of what you can do when you don't let negativity step in front of you and your dream.'\n\nSt. Cyr only added media scrutiny to the contest after it was announced she would be competing.\n\n'When I started cheerleading I had all the odds stacked against me. So much pushback, so many people telling me it wasn't a space for me,' St. Cyr wrote in a Facebook post on March 25.\n\n'But I fought for what I loved and I ended up being a very successful cheerleader, winning state and national titles and inspiring people to join even if they hadn't been doing it their whole life.\n\n'I sense a similar trajectory in my ongoing journey with pageants. I believe I have everything it takes to be Miss Maine USA and I know that no amount of experience can match a true passion and drive to accomplish something.'\n\nIt comes with Donald Trump's administration locked in a legal battle with the woke state over its failure to comply with the government's push to ban transgender athletes in girls and women's sports.\n\nSt. Cyr told Maine's Total Coverage that she had already entered the pageant before Trump took office. \n\nShelby Howell was declared the winner of Miss Maine USA, with Mara Carpenter also finishing ahead of Hudson. \n\nHudson and Belichick made a swift exit after she failed to win – with the former cheerleader putting on a brave face and smiling as they pulled away from the hotel.\n\nShe was still in her purple evening gown and Hancock sash as she clutched the hand of her lover as they were escorted out of the property from a secluded garage with their bodyguard.\n\nBelichick remained expressionless as they walked the short distance in the underground car park, with the brunette continuing to strut her stuff and wave at the camera.\n\nHe was seen scowling at her behind the wheel of the car as she pointed at her bedazzled bag again as they pulled away in the 2025 Mercedes Benz GLE 580, worth $89,200.\n\nHowever, they both grinned as they waved at their bodyguard for the weekend, flashing peace signs as Bill drove them away from the event.\n\nJordon declined any interviews, but was quick to thank those who told her that she looked incredible in the purple floor length gown with a slit, paired with silver heels.\n\nIt comes after she placed second runner-up (third) in the contest – one place lower than she was in 2024. Her older beau was pictured with her father, Heath, 52, for the first time since their relationship became public.\n\nBefore the final placing was announced, she gave an emotional speech in front of her father and Belichick, saying 'hate never wins'.\n\nThe eight-time Super Bowl-winning coach Belichick was escorted in by security before shaking hands with Heath Hudson, 52, and smiling at him ahead of the pageant getting started.\n\nHeath was also escorted to the front row seats by the former Navy veteran for the second day of the event, hoping to see his daughter, 24, don the winners tiara.\n\nJordon was, however, awarded the Style award by the judges with Belichick and her father watching on. It comes after fans questions if Hudson’s parents supported the relationship, despite having an age gap of around 12 years themselves.\n\nBut the pair were seen happily chatting ahead of Hudson strutting her stuff on the stage, with sources confirming Bill has visited her childhood home in Hancock previously.\n\nDespite a special segment of the show dedicated to Mothers Day, Hudson was the only contestant not to record a message for her mother.\n\nHudson's smiling display at the Miss Maine contest comes less than 24 hours after DailyMail.com revealed that she almost quit the contest before it had even begun, amid a backlash against her relationship with Belichick.\n\nSources close to the 'headstrong' 24-year-old cheerleader revealed that she had been thinking about dropping out after the disastrous CBS interview aired of her interrupting on behalf of 49-years-older beau.","summary":"Bill Belicheck's girlfriend Jordan Hudson had an encounter backstage with the transgender contestant she was competing against in the Miss USA Maine pageant.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-football/article-14705169/trans-miss-maine-bill-belichick-girlfriend-jordon-hudson.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/13/01/98272839-0-Bill_Belichick_s_girlfriend_Jordon_Hudson_had_an_encounter_backs-a-27_1747095755100.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:27:23","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Also Read | Congress on PM Modi Speech: Pawan Khera Says 'We Expected PM Narendra Modi to Respond to Donald Trump's Remarks, Hyphenation With Pakistan Is Unacceptable'.\n\"After the surgical strike and air strike, now Operation Sindoor is India's policy against terrorism. Operation Sindoor has carved out a new benchmark in our fight against terrorism and has set up a new parameter and new normal,\" he said. \"First, If there is a terrorist attack on India, a fitting reply will be given. We will give a befitting response on our terms only. We will take strict action at every place from where the roots of terrorism emerge. Secondly, India will not tolerate any nuclear blackmail. India will strike precisely and decisively at the terrorist hideouts developing under the cover of nuclear blackmail,\" he added. PM Modi said India will not differentiate between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism. \"During Operation Sindoor the world has again seen the ugly face of Pakistan, when top Pakistani army officers came to bid farewell to the slain terrorists. This is strong evidence of state-sponsored terrorism.We will continue to take decisive steps to protect India and our citizens from any threat,\" he said. \"We have defeated Pakistan every time on the battlefield. And this time Operation Sindoor has added a new dimension. We have displayed our capabilities in the deserts and mountains and also proved our superiority in New Age Warfare. During this operation the authenticity of our Made in India weapons were also proven. Today the world is witnessing that in 21st century warfare the time has come for Made in India defence equipment,\" he added. The Prime Minister said India's greatest strength is our unity against all forms of terrorism. \"This is certainly not the era of war but this is also not the era of terrorism. Zero tolerance against terrorism is the guarantee for a better world. The way the Pakistani army, Pakistan government are encouraging terrorism, it will destroy Pakistan one day. If Pakistan wants to survive, it will have to destroy its terror infrastructure. There is no other way to peace. India's stand is very clear... Terror and talks cannot go together... Terror and trade cannot go together.... Water and blood cannot flow together,\" he said. \"Today, I would also like to tell the global community that our stated policy has been: if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK),\" he added. The Prime Minister said Operation Sindoor is not just a name but it's a reflection of the feelings of millions of people of the country. \"Operation 'Sindoor' is our unwavering commitment to justice. Late night of 6th May and in the early morning of May 7, the whole world saw this pledge turn into reality. Indian forces attacked terror hideouts in Pakistan and their training centers with precision. The terrorists had never imagined that India could take such a big decision. But when the country is united, endowed with the spirit of Nation First and national interest is paramount, then strong decisions are taken and results are achieved,\" he said. . \"When India's missiles and drones attacked terrorist bases in Pakistan, not only the buildings of terrorist organizations but their courage also was shaken badly. Terrorist bases, like Bahawalpur and Muridke are universities of global terrorism. The big terrorist attacks of the world, be it 9/11, be it London Tube bombings, or the big terrorist attacks which have happened in India in the last many decades their roots are somehow connected to these terrorist hideouts. The terrorists had wiped out the Sindoor of our sisters and India responded by destroying their terrorist headquarters,\" he said. PM Modi said more than 100 dreaded terrorists have been killed in India's precision strikes. \"Many terrorist leaders were roaming freely in Pakistan for the last two and a half to three decades who used to conspire against India. India killed them in one stroke,\" he said. India also responded appropriately to aggression by the Pakistan military and pounded several airbases in Pakistan.

From the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica last week, he pleaded, “Help us, too, and help each other to build bridges, with dialogue, with meetings, uniting us all to be one people, always in peace.” \n\nIn a meeting with reporters Monday, he asked the media to use its power to “say no to the war of words and images.”\n\nMeanwhile, his oldest brother has populated his public Facebook page with slurs, disparagements and conspiracy theories popular among the MAGA supporters of President Donald Trump. The posts go far beyond disapproval of the Democratic Party, suggesting “anti-American democrat communists” be arrested for treason.\n\nAs recently as April 23, two days after Pope Francis died, Prevost railed against Barack Obama, whose presidency ended in January 2017, calling him and the Democrats, “one very small step from being full blown communists, longing for the total destruction of our way of life and turning the country into a dictatorship, and a racist one on top of it.”\n\n“They suck,” he posted on his Facebook account that also listed him as a graduate of Mendel Catholic High School.\n\nHe’s also called for “anti-Trump Democrats” to “be arrested and tried for subversion and even treason against the U.S.A.” He shared another post saying “we are now living in a country our founding fathers fought to escape,” adding his own comment, “they’d have really stormed the Capital [sic] by now and hung most of those in office for the mess they’ve created.”\n\nIn February, Prevost shared an image reading: “Your child isn’t trans, you’re just a sh- -ty parent.”\n\nAs the day advanced Monday, several of his posts were blocked after being labeled “false information” by Facebook. By day’s end, nearly all Prevost’s posts had been deleted.\n\nIn an interview conducted before the posts came to light, Prevost spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times about his famous brother and their childhood in south suburban Dolton and the newfound attention he’s receiving.\n\n“Some of them, I noticed, have started poring through my social media posts, and have pegged me as a, ‘Oh, he’s a MAGA guy,’” he said. “Yesterday, I was on Newsmax, and I mentioned I watched the chimney and the Vatican on Newsmax. I just happened to have it on because they were there around the clock. … Now it’s all over Newsmax TV: Pope’s Brother Watches Newsmax. … They have it on the little ticker thing that runs under the screen.”\n\nPrevost did not respond to questions later in the day about the specific items he had written and shared.\n\nIn the earlier conversation, he said he was trying to accommodate the many reporters asking for interviews so his silence wouldn’t reflect poorly on his now-famous brother.\n\n“You don’t want the negative, ‘Oh, the Pope’s brother refuses to speak to [reporters]. He doesn’t need that.”\n\nAt some point before last week’s papal conclave, Pope Leo’s brothers asked him if he aspired to the papacy. As a kid, a few people had singled out Leo as a future pope, Louis Prevost said. He’s still “Rob” to his brothers.\n\n“And he kind of jokingly said, ‘Who the hell would want that job?’ ” Prevost said. “Rob, in his years in the Augustinians, and jobs he has had with them and with the church, he did have the background for it and the training for the position. And we said, ‘If they vote you in, what are you going to do? Are you able to deny it?’ \n\n‘Yeah, I can deny it.’ ‘Would you deny it?’ ‘No, probably not. If I get elected, what drove them to vote for me — I can’t turn my back on it, because that’s God’s wish.’\n\n“And that’s what happened. I think they all saw a guy, that ‘Wow, he’s got it all.

I feel so terribly sorry for these girls forced to compete against big fat cheating males,' wrote one X user.\n\n'The look of dejection on the part of the girl who is the rightful winner is palpable. Shame on everybody who allowed this to happen,' added another.\n\n'The really sad part is that I could tell even from that distance, and even with the video small on my screen, who was the boy from the very beginning. It was the muscle mass and the way he held himself. Those poor girls, so incredibly unfair,' tweeted a third. \n\nOne person writing an opinion piece in The College Fix about the event suggested Stark-Chessa had in fact deliberately slowed their pace down so as not to win by so large a margin. \n\n'Given that the meet appeared to have been a local one between three schools, I had a sneaky suspicion he did “just enough” to win … without making it look lopsided,' the writer stated.\n\nFueling the debate further is the background of Stark-Chessa's parents, who are not just any Maine residents but academic elites with powerful institutional roles.\n\nSoren's father, Dr. Frank Chessa, is director of clinical ethics at Maine Medical Center and a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. \n\nHe plays a senior role at the hospital's Gender Care Clinic, which provides 'gender-affirming' care and surgical consultations for patients, including adolescents.\n\nSoren's mother, Susan Stark, is a professor of philosophy at Bates College, where her academic work focuses on reparations, white supremacy, and reproductive ethics. \n\nMaine has been at the epicenter of controversy after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports'. It came after years of controversy involving athletes such as Blaire Fleming and Lia Thomas.\n\nBack in February, Mills had a now-infamous run-in with the president during a White House meeting, when she told Trump 'see you in court' over his threat to withdraw federal funding if Maine did not comply with his ban.\n\nThe feud has continued, with Maine currently being sued by the Department of Justice over its refusal to ban transgender athletes.\n\nBut last week the board of the Maine Region School Unit voted to ditch a policy that states: 'Students shall be able to participate in accordance with the gender identity asserted at school.'\n\nStark-Chessa's athletic rise has been swift - and controversial. \n\nJust eighteen months ago, as a freshman, Stark-Chessa competed on the boys' team but since beginning to identify as female, the runner has dominated girls' sports across cross country, track and field, and Nordic skiing.\n\nIn the fall of 2023, Stark-Chessa placed third in the Class C girls' cross country state championship and was later named to the all-state team by the Maine Trust for Local News.\n\n'I hugged three girls crying after that race,' said Chantal Mincey speaking in 2023, a mother from Houlton to the Daily Signal. \n\n'They love this sport, but what's the point if they're just going to lose every time to someone who has a male advantage? It's crushing their confidence.\n\n'I have to reassure them: It's your mom and dad's fight, and we will protect you, and we will support you in this, and we'll do the best we can, and we won't give up,' she said. \n\n'We will do our best to protect these female athletes.' \n\n'These girls are in a lose-lose situation,' said Cathy Ross in 2023, a mother of two runners to the Daily Signal. 'They don't want to pretend Stark-Chessa is a girl and congratulate him, but if they don't, they're labeled hateful or bad sports. It's humiliating.'\n\nAt a recent Festival of Champions cross-country meet, Stark-Chessa placed fifth among girls - but their time would have ranked 162nd in the boys' division. \n\nSome parents believe Soren's upbringing may have influenced their shift in identity. \n\n'You can see this kid from 200 meters away,' said Katherine Collins, a mother from Winterport told the Maine Wire. \n\n'You look at his thighs, his build - it's obvious he's a boy. I wonder if his parents had a hand in all this.'\n\nDespite growing opposition, Maine's governing bodies have done little to change course.\n\nIn 2021, Maine's Human Rights Act was revised to bar discrimination in school athletics on the basis of gender identity. \n\nThe Maine Principals' Association (MPA) followed suit in 2023, repealing a prior rule that barred athletes from competing in girls' sports if they had an 'unfair athletic advantage.'\n\nUnder current MPA rules, no medical records or gender reassignment documentation is required. \n\nA school alone can verify an athlete's declared gender for purposes of competition.\n\nMike Burnham, executive director of the MPA, told WMTW, 'The MPA, and its member schools, don't make state law, but are required to follow it.'\n\nParents like Chris Boyington believe the consequences are nothing short of catastrophic.\n\n'My daughter trains every day,' he said to the Daily Signal. 'She has potential. But the moment a biological male enters the field, her future is jeopardized. And I fear this is just the beginning.'\n\nBoyington is far from alone. Across Maine, parents are sounding alarms about what they see as the erosion of hard-fought opportunities for girls.\n\n'Eventually,' Ross warned, 'if more boys get the idea, you'll have the top 10 in a girls' race all be biological males. And then what do you have left? You don't have girls' sports anymore.'\n\nLaws once meant to protect women's access to athletics appear to be enabling biological boys to claim championships, medals, and scholarships, often at the expense of the very girls those laws were written to protect.\n\nBiological males have reportedly claimed more than 30 girls' and women's titles across the US in the past 19 years - with most of that surge occurring in the past three reports the Washington Stand.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration sued Maine for not complying with the government's push to ban transgender athletes in girls and women's sports, escalating a dispute over whether the state is abiding by a federal law that bars discrimination in education based on sex.\n\nThe lawsuit came after weeks of feuding between the Republican administration and Democratic Governor Janet Mills that had led to threats to cut off crucial federal funding and a clash at the White House when she told President Donald Trump: 'We'll see you in court.'\n\nThe political overtones of the moment were clear, with Attorney General Pam Bondi - and one of the athletes who joined her on stage at the Justice Department - citing the matter as a priority for Trump. \n\n'President Trump, before he was elected, this has been a huge issue for him,' Bondi said. 'Pretty simple: girls play in girls' sports, boys play in boys' sports.

At the start he quipped that he hoped everyone would “stay awake to the end” of his speech. He said: “Let us disarm communication of all prejudice and resentment, fanaticism and even hatred. Let us free it from aggression. “We do not need loud, forceful communication but rather communication that is capable of listening and of gathering the voices of the weak who have no voice. Disarm “Let us disarm words and we will help to disarm the world .

They present a challenge for all of us.” He was interrupted several times with applause, cheers and chants of “Viva Papa”. Thousands crammed into a huge auditorium to hear the new American pontiff. The hall is located right next to the lodgings he stayed in until he was elected on Thursday. Speaking in front of The Resurrection sculpture in the Paul VI Audience Hall, he urged the assembled press to say no to the war of words and images. The Pope also reiterated the Church’s solidarity with imprisoned journalists “seeking the truth” and demanded their release. Injustice He told reporters: “You are at the forefront of reporting on conflicts and aspirations for peace, on situations of injustice and poverty, and on the silent work of so many people striving to create a better world. “For this reason, I ask you to choose courageously the path of communication in favour of peace.” In his first Sunday blessing the pontiff called for peace in the war in Ukraine and a ceasefire in Gaza. Pope Leo will now be formally inaugurated at a mass in St Peter’s Square on Saturday. The King will be represented by Prince Edward.

The all-stock transaction will allow the firm backed by the Trump brothers to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. The merger is expected to close as early as the third quarter of this year.The company's goals, according to an overview posted Monday, are to mine new bitcoin \"below market cost\" and to build up a reserve of the cryptocurrency.\"Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable Bitcoin accumulation platform in the market,\" Eric Trump said in a statement.American Bitcoin was launched in March, with crypto mining firm Hut 8 owning a majority stake. At the time, the company said it \"aims to become the world's largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner.\" It's the successor to American Data Centers, a venture backed by Eric Trump, his older brother Donald Trump Jr. and publicly traded Dominari Holdings.Crypto mining also has a stamp of approval from Eric and Donald Trump Jr.'s father. The president pledged to make the United States a \"bitcoin mining powerhouse\" last year.What is bitcoin mining — and why is it controversial?Mining is an essential part of how bitcoin operates. The currency isn't centralized, and instead relies on independent actors — known as miners — who carry out complicated math problems to verify bitcoin transactions and list them on a public ledger known as a blockchain. As a reward for this work, miners earn units of bitcoin for crunching the numbers successfully.The value of a bitcoin stands at around $102,000, and the reward for mining decreases over time as the number of bitcoin in circulation increases, making mining a lucrative endeavor. But mining is controversial because it's extremely energy-intensive, with miners operating gigantic data centers filled with server racks that carry out the mathematical operations necessary to mine. A team from Cambridge University estimates bitcoin uses about 187.9 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, more than the entire country of Egypt.Trump family's crypto empire growsThe Trump brothers' foray into bitcoin mining marks the family's latest crypto venture. The president and his two eldest sons are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, which got a multi-billion dollar boost earlier this month from an Abu Dhabi-based firm, and Mr. Trump launched a highly volatile \"meme coin\" called $TRUMP in January.Crypto investments make up about $2.9 billion of the family's net worth, one report estimates.The Trump family's interest in cryptocurrency has drawn criticism for conflicts of interest. Last week, Senate Democrats blocked a crypto regulation bill from moving forward and pushed for it to include new limits on elected officials participating in some types of crypto ventures, with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts accusing Mr. Trump of \"crypto corruption.\"The White House has pushed back on the criticism.

The worry? That lower profits at home might push drugmakers to charge more abroad..Markets react: Global pharma stocks slideThe impact was swift. Pharmaceutical stocks in Europe and Asia dropped sharply following the news. Major players like Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, and Roche lost ground even as broader markets rallied. In Japan, the pharma index posted its biggest daily drop in months, and US giants such as Pfizer, Merck, and Eli Lilly also saw early trading pressure.The market jitters reflect deeper concerns: if the US forces companies to lower their prices — especially in massive government-backed programmes like Medicare and Medicaid — those same companies may look to recoup lost revenue by raising prices elsewhere.What this means for drug prices outside the USMany countries currently benefit from cheaper drug prices than the US, partly because their governments negotiate directly with pharmaceutical firms or enforce price controls. If the US begins tying its prices to international benchmarks — or simply forces a cut — the companies might recalibrate global pricing models.In other words, what’s affordable today in one country could become costlier tomorrow. And that has analysts watching closely.\"This has the potential to be very negative for the industry,\" said Bank Vontobel analyst Stefan Schneider, noting that many global drugmakers generate 40–60% of their revenue from US sales.Countries without strong price controls — or with private healthcare systems — may feel the brunt of any corporate-driven price adjustments. Drugmakers could also slow down rollouts in lower-margin markets, or limit the supply of new treatments, especially if revenue is under pressure..New law to regulate medical products in UAE: Up to Dh1 million fine for violators .Why pharma companies are nervousWhile details of Trump’s order are still sparse, analysts say it likely targets drug prices under Medicare and Medicaid, which together account for roughly 40% of US drug sales. A significant drop in prices for these programmes could deal a major financial blow, especially to companies highly dependent on US income.That includes firms like Takeda, Sanofi, Novartis, and GSK, all of which generate a sizable portion of their global earnings from American consumers.“A renewed push to lower drug prices may have an enormous impact on the sector’s revenues,” said Stephen Barker of Jefferies Japan.Previous attempts to enforce similar rules have been struck down in court, but this time around, even the threat of price cuts has been enough to shake investor confidence.Can companies pass the cost on?It’s not guaranteed that drugmakers will succeed in raising prices abroad — many governments maintain tough pricing policies. But the risk is real, especially in middle-income nations where regulatory frameworks are weaker or still evolving.At the same time, developing countries with growing healthcare needs could find themselves in a bind, potentially facing higher prices for essential medicines as companies seek to offset losses in their most lucrative market.Bottom line: US pharma policy with global consequencesIf the executive order leads to meaningful price cuts in the US, it might reshape global drug pricing strategies. For now, it’s a waiting game — but patients, insurers, and healthcare providers outside the US would do well to watch closely.What helps US consumers pay less could end up costing the rest of the world more.","summary":"","url":"https://gulfnews.com/business/markets/trump-to-cut-drug-prices-will-us-drug-savings-drive-up-costs-worldwide-1.500124632","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-04-04/f373icl8/202504043368238.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-13 00:04:00","author":"Justin Varghese","authors":["Justin Varghese"],"language":"en","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":320648568,"title":"Heed Pope Leo’s warning on AI dangers — and don’t let Big Tech police itself","text":"Pope Leo XIV was entirely right in his warning Saturday: The rise of AI poses “new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor.”\n\nChallenges that all of us need to consider; we’d be crazy to leave it all up to our tech overlords.\n\nThe new pope chose the name Leo in tribute to Leo XIII, who faced the moral challenges of the industrial revolution; the new tech revolution will be far more profound.\n\nDisturbing things like deepfakes, from porn to political deceptions, are the least of it; even Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of everyone having a dozen AI “friends” only scratches the surface.\n\nThe industrial revolution gave us machines that could perform physical tasks far beyond human ability; AI will do the same for mental work. \n\nUsing AI to cheat is already rampant among college and high-school students, but the “cheaters” may see more clearly than the outraged old guard: What skills should any of us be developing for the future?

It was the culmination of Trump’s weekslong promotion of the contest, which has drawn allegations that he is using his position to enrich his family business while opening himself up to foreign influence.\n\nThe cryptocurrency, called $TRUMP, was created in mid-January and boasts a market capitalization of over $2bn after months of investors buying into the heavily promoted coin. A Trump family-linked company and another firm own a majority of the coins, according to Reuters.\n\nRelated: Critics slam deregulation of crypto as Trump family expands its footprint in industry\n\n“Congratulations, if you’re in the top 220 on the leaderboard we will be contacting you in the next 24 hours. Check your inbox (and spam folder) and expect a phone call for the Trump Official Dinner invitation and details,” the $TRUMP website announced mid-day on Monday. “President Trump will see YOU on May 22 at the Gala Dinner in Washington D.C.”\n\nTrump’s crypto enterprise has drawn criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and even the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential conflicts of interest and allegations of corruption. The contest to dine with the president has intensified those concerns, as it has created what is essentially a bidding war for direct access to the president.\n\nThe dinner is being held at Trump National golf club in Virginia and will also include “an ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president” for the top 25 holders of the coin. The rules listed on the coin’s website suggest that the person who bought the coin can also send someone else instead of themselves, stating that if the buyer can’t attend they are able to list the name of a family member or friend to go in their place.\n\nAlthough the coin’s buyer leaderboard is public, it doesn’t explicitly list the names of the winners. The site instead lists only the usernames and cryptocurrency wallet numbers of the buyers, which has led to speculation about who is vying for a place at the dinner and what political or financial interests they may harbor.\n\nMany of the top $TRUMP holders used foreign cryptocurrency exchanges that ban US users from purchasing the coins, according to Bloomberg’s analysis of the crypto wallets.

More Washington, DC, On Monday, May 12th he signed another executive order, this time targeting pharmaceutical prices and invoking a most favored nation model to bring these down. Photographer: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg\n© 2025 Bloomberg Finance LP\n\nOn Truth Social, President Trump posted yesterday that the United States “will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.” He wrote that prices would drop from 30% to 80% off of their current levels, adding that he would sign “one of the most consequential executive orders in history” this morning. But the order raises more questions than it answers. And potential logistical and legal challenges loom.\n\nTrump is resurrecting a plan from his first term in office to peg prices paid in the U.S. to those in other comparably wealthy countries in terms of gross domestic product per capita. Specifically, the then envisioned most favored nation model would pay (reimburse healthcare providers) no more for high-cost physician-administered drugs than the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in other peer nations.\n\nIn 2018 and 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed different methods, including an MFN model, to reduce Medicare prescription drug spending in the U.S. by tying prices of physician-administered drugs to an international index comprised of a group of countries with a similar GDP per capita. An executive order issued by Trump in 2020 was blocked in the courts before it could be implemented.\n\nUnlike the proposal from the first administration, the executive order signed today pursues an MFN strategy in separate stages. First, it says that within a month of the date of the order, the Secretary of HHS will “communicate most-favored-nation price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.”\n\nGiven the differences in timing of launches of drugs across countries, price setting by reimbursement authorities and dosing and packaging, it will be a difficult task to create a commensurate price index between the U.S. and its peers. And locating proprietary net prices will be hard in some international jurisdictions. Presumably, experts at HHS will be in charge. But after cuts at HHS, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation group is no longer employed to help with such analyses.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft Confirms New Free Update Deadline For Windows Users\n\nTrump Says He Won’t Use Luxury Plane From Qatar After Leaving Office—Here’s What We Know\n\nSamsung Drops Galaxy S25 Price In Major New Sale\n\nAnd then, the administration wants drug makers to voluntarily sell their wares at MFN prices directly to patients, though there’s no legal framework that would force manufacturers to abide by this request. The executive order then looks to “facilitate direct-to-consumer purchasing programs for pharmaceutical manufacturers that sell their products to American patients at a most-favored-nation price.”\n\nThough exceptions exist, such as in the relatively new weight loss classes of medications, most firms don’t have a set-up in place for DTC sales of drugs to patients. And so, despite the help promised from the federal government, it’s not guaranteed to be a smooth rollout should the plan get that far.\n\nFurthermore, the order appears to presume that the MFN prices of medications sold directly to patients would be less than what they’re currently charged at the pharmacy counter. However, it’s unknown if this would be the case for the majority of pharmaceuticals. Besides the uninsured or those who don’t have certain medications covered like obesity drugs, most insured patients in Medicaid, Medicare and the commercial sector pay less in co-payments for most medicines at the pharmacy counter than an MFN price, even if that price is 30% to 80% lower than in the U.S.\n\nIf DTC sales with MFN prices fail to materialize or don’t accomplish their goals, the Secretary of HHS “shall propose a rulemaking plan to impose most-favored-nation pricing.” Here, the executive order lacks any detail, however, regarding which subset of drugs will be included, which countries will be involved in establishing an MFN index, how (through what mechanism) the administration intends to pursue its objectives, and to whom—which patients or beneficiaries of which public programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid—an MFN model would be applicable or whether it would also apply to commercially insured patients.\n\nAnd by using the word “impose” at this stage in the process it lays out, the Trump administration could run afoul of constitutional issues. Legally, there could be challenges to mandating that drug makers sell at MFN prices, as this may be seen as violating the constitutional Commerce Clause. This stipulates that only Congress has the power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among states, and with the Indian tribes.”\n\nThe White House says that “Americans must have access to the most-favored-nation price” for pharmaceuticals and that it will take “immediate steps to end global freeloading.” Here, the administration pins part of the blame on higher U.S. prices on “foreign nations,” as they’re “forcing American patients to pay for a disproportionate amount of global pharmaceutical research and development, including by suppressing the price of pharmaceutical products below fair market value.”\n\nBut this assumes that drug prices overseas are “below fair market value.” This could very well be true. But it ignores the fact that drug pricing in international markets is often subject to a rigorous process in which governments and quasi-governmental agencies attempt to establish the value of newly approved therapeutics using cost-effectiveness and other measures and adjust net prices accordingly.\n\nOne can question the methodologies used and whether overseas authorities get the alignment of price and value right. Nevertheless, the Trump administration can’t disregard that a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact assessment underlies most pricing arrangements. As such, it’s highly unlikely that other nations would go along with manufacturers raising the prices of pharmaceuticals. Moreover, government budget constraints in Europe and elsewhere are tight, with strict rules around cost containment coupled with adherence to the objectives of maintaining sustainable healthcare systems in which universal access is guaranteed.\n\nAs spelled out thus far, the executive order on lowering drug prices to those of an MFN leaves out critical details on its implementation and sidesteps logistical and legal hurdles which may prove tough to overcome.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"The executive order on lowering drug prices to those of a most favored nation leaves out details on its implementation and sidesteps logistical and legal hurdles.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/05/12/trump-says-executive-order-will-lower-drug-prices-by-30-to-80/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/682260df7b48acefca6682ec/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-12 23:52:11","author":"Joshua P.

Brian Schatz today blasted President Donald Trump’s plan to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari government to be used as a future Air Force One as “disgusting” and “wildly corrupt” among other things.\n\nHe plans to ask his Senate colleagues to condemn Trump’s plan to accept the Boeing that’s worth over $400 million but will cost a million more to upgrade it to Air Force standards and ensure it’s not bugged or can be tracked, according to ABC News, which first reported the gift from Qatar on Sunday.\n\nRELATED: ABC News: Trump to accept 747 from Qatar to use as Air Force One\n\nTrump confirmed the report to reporters today, saying “Now, I could be a stupid person and say, ‘Oh no, we don’t want a free plane.’”\n\nSchatz blasted the plan today on the Senate floor and called it a clear violation of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n“I cannot believe I have to say this but a president should not take a $400 million gift from a foreign country,” Schatz said. “It doesn’t matter which president, what party, it doesn’t matter which foreign country. … I shouldn’t have to explain why but it is a high principle literally enshrined in the Constitution … the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution. It’s a fancy phrase, but a simple idea. No foreign gifts. If a foreign government offers you anything, but especially something close to half a billion dollars worth, the answer is no thank you. End of story. Very simple. End of story. I cannot take that. … But it’s also explicitly prohibited by the United States Constitution.\n\n“… Air Force One is not just a random luxury airplane,” Schatz said. “It is a symbol of and a projection of American power. It has flown 15 different presidents. It carried President John F. Kennedy’s body after his assassination and saw President Johnson be sworn in under unprecedented circumstances. It rushed George W. Bush back to Washington after the Twin Towers were struck and just two years ago it flew President Joe Biden to a secret trip to Ukraine during the war. When people see Air Force One on TV, when they see it land in other countries …. they immediately know that America has arrived. It represents not just the weight of the presidency, but America itself, generations of history and international leadership. But in one fell swoop Trump is selling out one of the most iconic symbols of American power that we have.\n\n“… It’s disgusting. It’s wildly corrupt. And just because they are doing the corruption in plain sight does not make it any less damning, or sad or gross.”\n\nAccording to The Hill, Trump told reporters that the gift “helps us out because … we have 40-year-old aircraft. The money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to keep them tippy top is astronomical. You wouldn’t even believe it. So, I think it’s a great gesture from Qatar; I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I could be a stupid person and say, ‘No we don’t want a free, very expensive airplane,’ but I thought it was a great gesture.”\n\nTrump said he thinks Qatar made the offer because he has “kept them safe,” adding, “If it wasn’t for us, they probably wouldn’t exist right now.”","summary":"U.S. Sen.
