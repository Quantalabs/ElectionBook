In that sense it is reminiscent of Nato's Article 5 requiring a joint response for an armed attack against any one member. \n\nBut being issued as an executive order from the White House, it bypasses Congress, which under the War Powers Act should be consulted by the president before committing US forces. \n\nThat means the order might lack legal force and could potentially be rewritten or ditched under a future president. It is also likely to face scrutiny from Democrats in Congress.\n\nThe move is also being challenged by parts of Trump's own Maga support base who see it as at odds with his \"America First\" agenda. \n\nLaura Loomer, an influential far-right activist close to Trump, suggested Qatar was more of a threat than ally to the US. \n\nThe Trump-loyalist radio host Mark Levin said the order upended America's traditional alliances in the region, asking: \"If the leadership of Hamas in Qatar is killed by Israel, are we going to war with Israel?\"\n\nThen there is the issue of the Trump family's personal and business links to Qatar, which his opponents say amount to a conflict of interest in his foreign policy dealings with the ultra-wealthy Gulf state. \n\nThe Trump Organization, run by his sons Eric and Donald Jr, struck a deal in April to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar featuring Trump-branded beach-side villas and an 18-hole course, developed by a firm owned by the Qatari government. \n\nQatar has also donated a 747 jetliner to the US, which Trump wants to use as a replacement for Air Force One. \n\nThe president has said it will be decommissioned after he leaves office and would be displayed in his yet-to-be-built presidential library. The White House and Qatari officials have denied any conflicts of interest over business links and policy. \n\nBut Tony Carrk of the watchdog group Accountable.US accused Trump of erasing the line between the two. \n\n\"Donald Trump apparently wants US taxpayers to foot the bill for potential military protection of his luxury Qatar golf course while currying favour with his Qatari-government-tied business partners,\" he said.\n\nTrump visited Doha as part of his regional tour in May, which involved trade talks in gilded palaces with the most powerful and wealthy figures in the region. \n\nBut the White House has always vehemently rejected the accusations of a conflict of interest.\n\nDeputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to the BBC: \"President Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children. There are no conflicts of interest.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203yldq44wo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ac22/live/e5e8df20-9fe0-11f0-a6a3-917e1fd570b4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 01:09:31","author":"Tom Bateman","authors":["Tom Bateman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":365678696,"title":"Egypt Urges Full Israeli Withdrawal from Gaza, Reaffirms Support for Palestinian Statehood","text":"Paris, October 02 (QNA) – Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty emphasized the urgent need for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid, and the rejection of any efforts to annex the West Bank or displace Palestinians from their land.\n\nSpeaking during a policy dialogue at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) in Paris, Abdelatty reiterated Egypt's longstanding position in support of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights, chiefly the establishment of an independent state based on the June 4, 1967, borders with East Jerusalem as its capital—the only viable path to achieving just and lasting peace in the region.\n\nHe also called on the international community to uphold its moral responsibility by pressuring Israel to allow humanitarian access into Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty welcomed the peace efforts led by former US President Donald Trump, and highlighted Egypt's training of Palestinian security forces as part of broader support for strengthening governance in Gaza.\n\nOn regional matters, the minister confirmed Egypt's continued efforts to support stability in Sudan, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, and Somalia.\n\nRegarding the Iranian nuclear file, Abdelatty said Egyptian diplomacy played a key role in facilitating the agreement recently signed in Cairo between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to resume technical cooperation.\n\nOn water security, the Egyptian Foreign Minister reaffirmed Cairo's commitment to international law in managing Nile Basin resources, rejecting any unilateral measures in the Eastern Nile region, and stressing that Egypt will take all necessary steps to safeguard its water security.

Since the video dropped Monday, Kelly said on “The Megyn Kelly Show” that it seems Democrats aren’t “getting their message across,” a point Bevan agreed with. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Mike Johnson Rips Democrats, Legacy Media For ‘Intentionally Lying’ About Healthcare For Illegals)\n\n“I think that’s right. One of the most interesting things about politics over the last few years is that Democrats don’t know how to meme. They can’t meme. And Republicans, and Trump in particular, and the MAGA folks have mastered the art, and they continue to do it,” Bevan said. “So they do this Sombrero thing. And then Hakeem Jeffries comes out with this indignant, ‘Say it to my face’ or whatever. Then they put a Sombrero on that.”\n\n“It’s become a running gag now that everybody is in on, it seems like, except for the Democrats who are busy yelling that this is racist,” Bevan added. “There was just one where they put a Sombrero on JD Vance, and he was talking in sort of Spanglish about how he can’t compromise. He can’t negotiate with the Democrats because they’re, ‘retardo.'”\n\nThe video posted on Trump’s Truth Social came just before Senate Democrats, led by Schumer, shut down the government Tuesday by opposing a GOP spending bill. Despite Democrats, including Hakeem Jeffries, blasting the meme as “disgusting” and “racist,” Trump has continued posting versions of Jeffries with a sombrero, mustache, and mariachi music in the background.\n\nRepublicans hammered Democrats over the shutdown. Democrats tried to counter with a livestream that ran for more than 10 hours, according to Politico. But the stream was riddled with technical glitches and, at times, only drew a few dozen viewers, the outlet reported.\n\nBevan went on to call out the Democrats’ new age “telethon,” saying the party “really seem to be just sort of flailing about.”\n\n“The question is, ‘OK, well how much is this going to hurt them politically?’ Or are we just living in two completely different information bubbles where the left thinks the Democrats, they’re with them, and the right is obviously with Republicans?” Bevan asked. “So there’s very little political damage that can come from this.”\n\n“On the other hand, they’re definitely not helping themselves, I don’t think. And I think it’s clear to everyone that they are the obstacle to opening the government. So they will pay a political price, but it’s just a question of how much will they pay,” Bevan said.\n\nIn addition to the livestream, Democrats posted a video on their party’s Instagram Wednesday captioned, “Gov shutdown but it’s cats.” The clip showed kittens representing Republicans and Democrats, with the GOP blamed for the shutdown.\n\nDemocrat California Gov. Gavin Newsom also tried to mimic Trump’s viral sombrero meme, posting on X a video turning House Speaker Mike Johnson into a minion and captioning it, “Trump’s Minion Mike lies to the American people.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bill Melugin, Cammila Wamsley, director of Portland’s ICE office, said the facility has faced violence for more than 100 consecutive nights, with Portland police largely absent under guidance from the mayor and city council. \"I just, I can’t figure out what’s happening at the FDA. I’m totally baffled by it,\" Wamsley said, describing her frustration at seeing federal staff attacked outside the building while officers inside lack jurisdiction to intervene. \"It’s frustrating for us to watch people be attacked on the street and know that we don’t have the authority to be able to really step in unless there’s some nexus to federal law.\" She said nightly protests have escalated beyond chants and signs, with bottle rockets striking the ICE building, rocks shattering windows, lasers targeting officers’ eyes and barricades blocking vehicles. ANTI-ICE PORTLAND RIOTERS WITH GUILLOTINE CLASH WITH POLICE IN WAR-LIKE SCENES Wamsley said protesters have followed ICE staff members home and doxxed at least six employees. \"Later, towards the evening and around dark, there are a lot of folks that come up dressed in all black,\" she explained. \"They are here to wreak havoc. They’ll block our cars, throw paint, damage property, and even try to follow our folks home.\" She warned that when crowds swell quickly, the violence becomes more dangerous.

The folks here can go from a crowd of 50 to a crowd of 1,000 in 30 minutes,\" she explained. \"Sometimes we only have 20 officers here. We would not be able to defend the building with that show of force.\" Wamsley said the Portland Police Department has been slow to respond — and sometimes doesn’t respond at all — because of city policy. She explained that assaults have occurred outside and across the street from the building, but police have either taken too long to arrive or not shown up at all. \"That is not the stance they would take six blocks from here, but it is the stance they take with us because of guidance from the mayor and city council,\" Wamsley said. PORTLAND MAYOR DOUBLES DOWN ON SANCTUARY STATUS AFTER VIOLENT ANTI-ICE RIOT Fox News Digital has reached out to the Portland mayor’s office and police department for comment. Still, Wamsley said ICE staff remain committed to their mission despite the unrest. \"The people that work here, are here to serve the American public,\" she said. \"They are here to enforce the same immigration laws we’ve had in place since the 1950s. Nothing has changed in that regard. We come to work every day. We do our job the way we have been doing it, and we’ll continue to do that.\" PORTLAND RAMPS UP PRESSURE ON ICE BUILDING WITH LAND USE VIOLATION NOTICE Todd Rignel, assistant special agent for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in Oregon, said federal agencies are targeting Antifa-linked groups they blame for organizing much of the unrest. \"They’re not just facing HSI. They’re facing the FBI, ATF, DEA, IRS – all of these agencies,\" he said. \"That’s a force to be reckoned with.\" The comments come as Portland remains a flashpoint for unrest, with the ICE facility at the center of nightly confrontations. President Donald Trump announced plans to send 200 National Guard troops to Portland to support immigration authorities. Officials said the troops would be stationed near protest areas.

According to a flyer advertising the event, the demonstration is scheduled from 6 to 6:30 p.m. in a university parking lot ahead of the UVA volleyball game. The flyer, which depicts an American flag on a grill, promotes \"hot dogs and burning flags.\" The flyer drew wider attention after White House rapid response strategist Greg Price shared it on X.

Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to \"conduct operations against them pursuant to the law of armed conflict.\" \"The United States has now reached a critical point where we must use force in self-defence and defence of others against the ongoing attacks by these designated terrorist organisations,\" the memo says.\n\nIt signals a potential new moment not just in the administration's willingness to reach beyond the norms of presidential authority to wage war, but in Mr. Trump's stated “America First” agenda that favours non-intervention overseas. It also raises stark questions about how far the White House intends to use its war powers and if Congress will exert its authority to approve — or ban — such military actions.\n\n Declaration follows strikes on boats in the Caribbean\n\n The U.S. military last month carried out three deadly strikes against boats in the Caribbean that the administration accused of ferrying drugs. At least two of those operations were carried out on vessels that originated from Venezuela.\n\nThose strikes followed up a buildup of U.S. maritime forces in the Caribbean unlike any seen in recent times.\n\nThe memo did not include a timestamp, but it references a September 15 U.S. strike that “resulted in the destruction of the vessel, the illicit narcotics, and the death of approximately 3 unlawful combatants.” “As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions to the White House.\n\nPentagon officials briefed senators on the strikes on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhat the Trump administration laid out at the classified briefing at the Capitol was perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework that raised questions particularly regarding the role of Congress in authorising any such action, that person said.\n\nThe memo lays out a rationale seen both as the administration's justification for the military strikes it has already taken on the boats in the Caribbean — which have raised concerns from lawmakers as potentially unlawful — as well as any forward action to come.\n\nDetails weren't given on the cartels targeted \n\nMr. Trump has designated several Latin American drug cartels as foreign terrorist organisations and the administration had previously justified the military action as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States.\n\nPentagon officials could not provide a list of the designated terrorist organisations at the centre of the conflict, a matter that was a major source of frustration for some of the lawmakers who were briefed, according to the person familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile “friendly foreign nations have made significant efforts to combat these organisations,” the memo said, the groups “are now transnational and conduct ongoing attacks throughout the Western Hemisphere as organised cartels.” The memo refers to cartel members as “unlawful combatants.” As the Republican administration takes aim at vessels in the Caribbean, lawmakers of both major political parties have raised objections and pressed Mr. Trump to go to Congress and seek war powers authority for such operations.\n\nThe first military strike, carried out September 2 on what the Trump administration said was a drug-carrying speedboat, killed 11 people. Mr. Trump claimed it was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang, which was listed by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organisation this year.\n\nSeveral senators as well as human rights groups questioned the legality of Trump's actions. They called it potential overreach of executive authority in part because the military was used for law enforcement purposes.\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to explain how the military assessed the boats' cargo and determined the passengers' alleged gang affiliation before the strikes.\n\nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committees, said the drug cartels are “despicable and must be dealt with by law enforcement.” \"The Trump Administration has offered no credible legal justification, evidence, or intelligence for these strikes,” said Mr. Reed, a former Army officer who served in the 82nd Airborne Division.","summary":"The Trump administration has yet to explain how the military assessed the boats' cargo and determined the passengers' alleged gang affiliation before the strikes.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-us-in-armed-conflict-with-drug-cartels-after-ordering-strikes-in-the-caribbean/article70119237.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3cs8or/article70119238.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-10-02T211531Z_1116351396_RC2DSGAE6DR9_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MILITARY-DRUGCARTELS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:51:11","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":365679430,"title":"\"Keep fighting\": Democratic lawmakers squeezed on government shutdown","text":"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has been closely coordinating his shutdown strategy with outside liberal groups, Axios scooped last week.But the groups are clearly playing an inside-outside game and are using their volunteers to dissuade Democrats from compromising.\n\nDriving the news: The Working Families Party and MoveOn are ginning up their phone and text banks for their activists to pressure their senators.\n\n\"I'm calling to encourage Senator _________ to hold the line during this shutdown and keep fighting against Trump's health care cuts and price increases,\" according to a script from the WFP first obtained by Axios.\"Thank your Senator for continuing to hold the line on healthcare against Republicans' cuts,\" according to a text sent to MoveOn members.\n\nThe intrigue: The groups are using carrots and sticks.\n\n\"Your Senator just voted against making healthcare affordable for families.

Three senators abstained.Milei's blockade of funding for public universities suffered a similar fate, with 58 votes in favor and seven against overriding it. There were four abstentions in that vote.Milei came to office on a promise to revive Argentina's ailing economy and tame runaway inflation by shrinking the welfare state.He has dramatically reduced inflation and produced a budget surplus through deep cuts to public spending, which have affected public hospitals, universities and pensioners in particular.The president, who has bet his mandate on balanced budgets, had justified his vetoes of spending increases by arguing that \"there is no money\" to fund them.Martin Lousteau, a centrist senator, criticized Milei for \"never talking about health or education\" while constantly stressing the importance of Argentina meeting its debt obligations.Left-wing Senator Daniel Bensusan argued that the debate over public funding was not \"technical, fiscal, or accounting-related: it is political and moral.\"The pediatric care law declares a pediatric emergency and earmarks more funds for the prestigious Garrahan Hospital.\"I am very hopeful that something will change,\" Alejandra Maldonado, a 50-year-old neonatal nurse at the hospital, told Congress Thursday while waiting for results of the vote.","summary":"Argentina's struggling President Javier Milei suffered a new setback on Thursday as Congress overturned his vetoes of laws increasing funding for public universities and for pediatric care.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/new-setback-milei-argentine-congress-overturns-spending-vetoes-3785335","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4625479/demonstrators-celebrated-outside-argentinas-congress-after-senators-overruled-president-javier.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a686641ca20c0fc0e6254c3a360b0a81","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:45:17","author":"Martin Raschinsky And Sonia Avalos","authors":["Martin Raschinsky And Sonia Avalos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":365673882,"title":"Gran redada de inmigración en edificio de apartamentos de Chicago deja a residentes aturdidos","text":"Dan Jones fue despertado abruptamente a eso de la 1 a.m. el martes por el sonido de agentes federales intentando romper la puerta de su departamento. Como no pudieron pasar su doble cerradura, se regresó a la cama.\n\nPero cuando se despertó horas después para ir a trabajar, salió y encontró puertas rotas esparcidas por el pasillo y a sus vecinos desaparecidos.\n\nJones, de 27 año de edad, es uno de los residentes del 7500 S. South Shore Drive que están intentando reconstruir lo que quedó después de que una redada federal de inmigración de alto perfil en la madrugada dio como resultado la detención de decenas de sus vecinos en su edificio de apartamentos en South Shore.\n\nAgentes federales armados, vestidos con uniformes militares de faena, forzaron las puertas durante la noche, sacando a hombres, mujeres y niños de sus apartamentos, algunos de ellos desnudos, dijeron residentes y testigos. Los agentes se acercaron o ingresaron a casi todos los apartamentos en el edificio de cinco pisos, y ciudadanos estadounidenses se encontraban entre los detenidos por horas.\n\nCuando llegó a casa del trabajo, Jones dijo que entró a su unidad y encontró que todos sus electrónicos y muebles habían desaparecido, y toda su ropa y zapatos estaban tirados en el suelo. Jones dijo que no tenía idea de quién tomó sus pertenencias y no había recibido respuestas de la Policía de Chicago.\n\n“Estoy enojado”, dijo Jones. “Me siento derrotado porque las autoridades no están haciendo nada”.\n\nEl miércoles, juguetes, zapatos y comida aún estaban en montones en los pasillos del edificio. Se vio a los administradores de la propiedad tirando colchones y puertas rotas a los contenedores de basura.\n\nEl Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) dijo que agentes federales de la Patrulla Fronteriza, el Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI) y el Buró de Alcohol, Tabaco, Armas de Fuego y Explosivos (ATF) arrestaron a 37 personas en la redada. DHS dijo que algunos de los arrestados “se cree que están involucrados en el tráfico y la distribución de drogas, crímenes con armas e infracciones de inmigración”.\n\nLos federales también afirmaron que el vecindario de South Shore era “una ubicación conocida por ser frecuentada por miembros de Tren de Aragua y sus asociados”, pero DHS no presentó evidencia para respaldar esta afirmación, y las autoridades no confirmaron que ninguna de las personas arrestadas fuera miembro de la pandilla venezolana.\n\nSe ha acusado y detenido a supuestos miembros de Tren de Aragua en la ciudad, incluso en agosto. Pero el Chicago Sun-Times ha encontrado poca evidencia que los vincule con la violencia en Chicago.\n\nRodrick Johnson, de 67 años de edad, es uno de los muchos residentes que fueron detenidos por agentes federales durante la redada en South Shore. Un ciudadano estadounidense, dijo que los agentes rompieron su puerta y se lo llevaron esposado con bridas de plástico.\n\nJohnson dijo que lo dejaron atado afuera del edificio durante casi tres horas antes de que los agentes finalmente lo dejaran ir.\n\n“Pregunté [a los agentes] por qué me detenían si era un ciudadano estadounidense, y dijeron que tenía que esperar hasta que lo verificaran”, dijo Jones. “Pregunté si tenían una orden, y pedí un abogado. Nunca trajeron uno”.\n\nUn video tomado cerca de la calle 75 y South Shore Drive mostraba a agentes federales en vehículos grandes reunidos en la calle cerca del edificio. Algunos llevaban uniformes de la Patrulla Fronteriza. Otros tenían logos del FBI.\n\nUn portavoz de la oficina del FBI en Chicago confirmó que la agencia estaba presente para apoyar un operativo de inmigración “enfocado” llevado a cabo por la Patrulla Fronteriza.\n\nLa redada es una de las operaciones más grandes ejecutadas desde que la administración del presidente Donald Trump anunció el lanzamiento del “Operativo Midway Blitz” el 8 de septiembre, trayendo una avalancha de oficiales federales de inmigración al área de Chicago para llevar a cabo redadas y arrestos.\n\nUna redada similar se realizó en el suburbio de Elgin, cuando agentes liderados por la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU., Kristi Noem viajaron en un vehículo militar y derribaron la puerta de un hogar donde detuvieron a seis personas, incluidas dos ciudadanos estadounidenses.\n\nEn la redada de South Shore, los vecinos dijeron que los agentes federales usaron granadas de destello para irrumpir en el edificio y se desplegaron varios drones y helicópteros.\n\nEbony Sweets Watson, quien vive al cruzar la calle, dijo que “parecía que había cientos” de agentes afuera de su puerta.\n\nWatson dijo que vio a agentes sacando a residentes, incluidos niños, fuera del edificio sin ropa y en camiones U-Haul. Los niños fueron separados de sus madres, dijo.\n\n“Fue desgarrador verlo”, contó Watson. “Incluso si no eres madre, ver a los niños salir completamente desnudos y ser separados de sus madres fue horrible”.\n\nWatson dijo que entró al edificio para ayudar a uno de los residentes y se sorprendió por lo que vio.\n\n“Había cosas por todas partes”, dijo Watson. “Podías ver los certificados de nacimiento de las personas y papeles tirados por todos lados. El agua estaba filtrándose en el pasillo. Estaba locamente caótico”.\n\nJones, que vive en el cuarto piso, dijo que la mayoría de sus vecinos eran venezolanos y a menudo se turnaban para limpiar el pasillo porque los propietarios hacían poco para mantenerlo.\n\n“Eran buena gente”, dijo Jones mientras miraba la unidad de su vecino de al lado. “No hablaban una palabra de inglés, pero usamos aplicaciones de traducción para comunicarnos”.\n\nJones se preguntó qué pasaría con los niños pequeños de su vecino.\n\nJones y Johnson dijeron que creían que el propietario echaría a los residentes restantes del edificio, que según registros públicos habían recibido previamente infracciones de código. No se pudo contactar a los propietarios del edificio para hacer comentarios.\n\nBrandon Lee, portavoz de la Coalición por los Derechos de Inmigrantes y Refugiados de Illinois (ICIRR), dijo que el grupo estaba trabajando para identificar a los detenidos en la redada.\n\n“Fue una demostración violenta de fuerza en la madrugada”, dijo Lee. “Sacar familias de un edificio de apartamentos en un vecindario residencial como ese es dañino, es traumático, y eso no es algo de lo que las personas puedan recuperarse fácilmente, ya sea que ellas mismas hayan sido llevadas o que hayan sido testigos de ello”.\n\nTraducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por La Voz Chicago","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/10/02/gran-redada-de-inmigracion-en-edificio-de-apartamentos-de-chicago-deja-a-residentes-aturdidos","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/beb5e92/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5998x4001+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F04%2F94aa43a2411db0a6298c0cf1a2cd%2Fsouth","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:43:46","author":"Cindy Hernandez","authors":["Cindy Hernandez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":365673580,"title":"New Mexico Lawmakers Pass Bills to Support Rural Healthcare and Fund Food Assistance","text":"SANTA FE, N.M. – In a swift response to President Donald Trump’s reductions in federal expenditure for Medicaid and nutrition initiatives, New Mexico lawmakers convened a special legislative session on Thursday to bolster funding for food aid and rural health services.\n\nDuring this session, the Democrat-dominated Legislature approved a bill for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s consideration, allocating over $16 million to maintain food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and support food banks. This action comes as the federal government ceases SNAP eligibility for numerous noncitizens and adjusts benefit calculations for others.\n\n“Ensuring that New Mexicans do not face hunger due to these federal SNAP changes is crucial,” stated Democratic state Sen. George Muñoz from Gallup.\n\nAnother $50 million would help sustain medical services at rural health clinics and hospitals that often rely heavily on Medicaid spending. \n\nRepublican legislators, forming the minority, unanimously opposed the spending measures, contending that the significant federal adjustments to Medicaid are distant and that New Mexico should prioritize addressing errors in benefit distribution instead.\n\nSimultaneously, Democrats, alongside some GOP lawmakers, supported measures to sustain subsidies for health insurance in New Mexico’s Affordable Health Care exchange, should federal credits lapse. These federal subsidies are a central issue in the budget deadlock in Washington, which led to the federal government shutdown on Wednesday.\n\nAlthough many of the federal health changes under Trump’s extensive legislation are not due to take effect until 2027 or later, New Mexico’s Democratic legislators admitted that their efforts offer only a temporary solution.\n\n“Some of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,” said state Rep. Nathan Small of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the spending bill. “I want to make sure that we’re all thinking of, not hundreds of millions, but billions of dollars of reduced Medicaid support to our state.”\n\nLujan Grisham, a Democrat, supports major provisions of the bills, and she has the authority to veto any and all spending provisions.\n\nTrump’s big bill is prompting urgent action in several Democratic states, but not in Republican ones.\n\nFunding for food\n\nNew Mexico lawmakers approved a quick infusion of state spending on food assistance through SNAP for elderly recipients.\n\nNearly one-fourth of New Mexico residents receive food assistance through SNAP, making it a major line of defense against hunger.\n\nFood banks statewide receive an $8 million bump in direct state support, under the bill. And $2 million is devoted to restocking food pantries at universities and public schools.\n\nTrump’s big bill expands work and reporting requirements for SNAP participants, ends eligibility for many noncitizens, and changes benefit calculations.\n\nRural health care\n\nTrump’s big bill sets aside $50 billion over five years for rural hospitals, providers and clinics — but that may not offset significant cuts.\n\nThe stakes are high in New Mexico, where about 38% of residents rely on Medicaid. And state lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — are warning of a rural health care crisis as New Mexico struggles to retain medical professionals and keep clinics and hospitals open.\n\nState Sen. Pat Woods, a Republican from the state’s sparsely populated eastern plains, co-sponsored changes to rural health care grants aimed at shoring up existing health care services at rural clinics and hospitals. A 64-3 vote of the House on Thursday sent the bill to the governor for consideration.\n\n“We’re trying to figure out a way to fund and keep some of these clinics open. What’s going to happen in the future? Who the hell knows,” Woods told a panel of state lawmakers. “What I worry about is keeping these clinics and hospitals open until the dust settles.”\n\nSubsidies for insurance\n\nLegislators also voted to set aside $17 million to ensure subsidies don’t lapse on New Mexico’s Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\nThat initiative also would extend insurance subsidies to middle-income residents who whose earnings equal or exceed 400% of the federal poverty level — roughly $128,000 annually for a family of four.\n\nDemocratic state Senator Carrie Hamblen of Las Cruces said the insurance subsidies will help avoid a “perfect storm of unaffordability,” warning that rising insurance rates threaten to undermine participation in the exchange and make matters worse. State health official have warned that tens of thousands of residents might drop insurance coverage as exchange rates increase in 2026.\n\nSeparately, legislators approved $6 million in state funding for public broadcasting stations — including $430,000 for five tribal stations hit hard by the defunding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by Congress and Trump. Approved federal grants to the stations for the current federal budget year were clawed back, under a bill signed by Trump in July.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. – In a swift response to President Donald Trump’s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Mexico Lawmakers Pass Bills to Support Rural Healthcare and Fund Food Assistance first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/new-mexico-lawmakers-pass-bills-to-support-rural-healthcare-and-fund-food-assistance/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/New-Mexico-Legislature-approves-bills-to-prop-up-rural-health.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:43:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.139},{"id":365674992,"title":"‘The Problem The Democrats Have’: Former Biden Aide Explains How Party Set Itself Up For Shutdown Fallout","text":"Michael LaRosa, the longtime press secretary to Jill Biden, said Thursday that Democrats are walking into a political trap of their own making as the federal shutdown continues.\n\nLawmakers failed to pass a temporary funding bill before the deadline, forcing the federal government to shut down at midnight Wednesday. In an appearance on “The Record with Greta Van Susteren,” LaRosa said Democrats face the difficult question of how can they claim to defend federal employees while refusing to support a continuing resolution based on the very budget they championed?\n\n“That is why Schumer voted to keep the government open responsibly in March,” LaRosa said. “And that’s the problem now that Democrats are going to run into. How can you be a champion for the federal workforce when DOGE cuts are taking place?”\n\nLaRosa said that the longer the shutdown lasts, the more political ground Democrats risk ceding to President Donald Trump.\n\n“President Trump can make the DOGE cuts look like child’s play in one week, and the Democrats are kind of, you know, if they really care about [the] federal workforce, they’re going to come out and vote for a CR, by the way, this is the Biden budget. This is the Biden spending levels. That’s the other problem the Democrats have,” LaRosa said. (RELATED: John Thune Shares What ‘Reasonable Democrats’ Are Telling Him About Shutdown)\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer voted to advance a GOP-led stopgap spending bill in March, joining nine other Democrats in support of the measure to prevent a government shutdown. His vote drew fierce backlash from progressives and top House Democrats, who accused him of capitulating to Republican demands.\n\nSix months later, Democrats reversed course. Senators failed to clear a House-passed stopgap funding bill, falling short of the 60-vote threshold in a 55–45 vote, according to the official roll call. Earlier in September, Democrats also failed to advance their own proposal, leaving Congress without a viable path to keep the government funded.\n\nThe standoff centered on whether to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire after 2025.

What is Trump planning to mobilize for or against? Free speech? Freedom of Assembly? Freedom of Religion? Being Black, brown or Asian? Or maybe being Palestinian? Jewish? Anything he opposes?\n\nIt’s time to contact your U.S. representatives and senators and tell them to exert whatever pressure they can to stop this scary attempt at silencing us.\n\nEleanor Levine\n\nTrump abandoning last\nshred of following law\n\nRe: “Cities eyed for military drills” (Page A1, Oct. 1).\n\nThe emergency meeting of high-ranking military officers at Quantico this week was a thinly veiled maneuver to prepare the military for the coming police state.\n\nDonald Trump says, “We’re under invasion from within. No different than a foreign enemy but more difficult in many ways because they don’t wear uniforms.” That enemy is anyone who disagrees with Trump. This sets the stage for a police state right here in America. Generals might have to decide to disobey an illegal order or face termination with a possible loss of pension. Sure, this termination is probably illegal and can be fought in court with very expensive and lengthy legal counsel. What would you do?\n\nLaws do not seem to matter anymore. Witness the continued shipment of 2000-pound bombs to Israel in support of the relentless slaughter of innocent women and children of Gaza in direct violation of our own Leahy Laws.\n\nForrest Cioppa\n\nAntioch must do more\nto protect citizens\n\nRe: “Two dead, two hospitalized in shooting near restaurant” (Page B3, Sept. 20).\n\nI was saddened and infuriated by the recent double homicide in Antioch. With the crime rates going up and incidents seeming to be never-ending, I have become numb to all of the violence that has been happening.\n\nI have to always ask what the mayor of the city of Antioch and the City Council are doing about the violence? There needs to be something to get the youth and young adults off the streets and direct their attention and late-night activities to something more productive. Imagine a thriving city and bustling downtown Antioch with restaurants, nightclubs, art galleries and maybe even poetry slams.\n\nThe city needs to execute a solid plan to create a safe space for all of its citizens.\n\nBunnie Mays\n\nMoraga Canyon housing\nopponents silenced\n\nMy neighbors and I in and around Moraga Avenue have been working hard to bring to the public’s attention our concerns about the enormity of scale of the 197 units proposed by ​the Piedmont​ Moraga Canyon housing development.\n\nMoraga Avenue is a​ very windy, two-lane road ​with blind spots in an extremely high-fire area​ that begins and ends in Oakland. Our main focus is safety as it relates to evacuation in case of fire or earthquake, and our goal is to attempt to downsize the project to the original number of 133 units. One of the ways that we’ve been ​getting the word out is the use of lawn signs that show what 197 units would look like. In recent weeks, these signs, on private property,​ have disappeared.\n\nThese actions impinge on our rights to free speech. It is disheartening that we are feeling it at our community level.\n\nJane Pingatore Holland\n\nWalters is letting\nTrump off the hook\n\nRe: “State has only itself to blame for big issues” (Page A6, Oct. 1).\n\nIn his column, Dan Walters bashes Democrats for all California’s problems, Donald Trump for none.\n\nThis is ridiculous, as Trump targets Democrat-controlled states, deploying the military to intimidate and crush the lives of immigrants and anyone who fits ICE racial profiling, cuts funding and sues our institutions.\n\nThe East Bay Times publishes diverse perspectives, and that’s great. But Walters is published almost every day. He detests Democrats and especially Gov. Newsom. To those of us with a more nuanced view, it’s reprehensible how much more space he gets than anyone else.\n\nDoug McKenzie\n\nConservatives abandon\npoor, common decency\n\nRe: “Mallard Fillmore” (Page B9, Oct. 1).\n\nI am horrified by this comic today. Insinuating that poverty is a choice and that conservatives think this is common sense is why there are fewer and fewer safety nets for people in real need. What poll is this referring to? A made-up poll to support not funding social services. This is propaganda at its lowest. There are many reasons for poverty, but not one is by choice.\n\nIn the instance of African American poverty, being robbed of generational wealth and experiencing systemic racism are good places to start to understand why that group has faced poverty. Add to that, poor levels of education and health care, and you have a great recipe for poverty across the mainly red states.\n\nWhy don’t conservatives use common sense and common decency to help people out of poverty instead of making policies and defunding programs to keep them there?","summary":"Also: Abandoning law &#124; Protect Antioch &#124; Opponents silenced &#124; Easy on Trump &#124; No decency.

JPMorgan Private Bank was more bullish, predicting gold would hit between US$4,050 and US$4,150 in the middle of next year. Spot gold was trading at US$3,875 an ounce on Thursday after hitting a record high of US$3,895.33 a day earlier.\n“Even after a strong year-to-date rally, gold remains an effective portfolio diversifier and hedge against political and economic risks, in our view,” UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment office said in a report last month. “We expect gold to benefit from a weaker dollar, robust central bank demand, lower real interest rates and investor concerns about rising government debt levels, the potential for financial repression and ongoing geopolitical risks.”\nThat would come as good news to Chinese investors, who have limited investment options beyond yuan-denominated stocks and properties, and only restricted access to overseas equities. For now, only the performance of mainland-listed small capitalisation stocks can match gold’s returns. A gauge of the tech board on the Shanghai exchange has surged 45 per cent this year amid a global frenzy over artificial intelligence.\nCurrently, 13 gold ETFs trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, according to Bloomberg data. The biggest among them is Hua An Yifu Gold ETF, with 59.8 billion yuan of assets under management. The 13 funds have returned 42 per cent so far this year, tracking the spot gold price on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.\nGold’s spectacular run stands in sharp contrast to the US dollar index, which typically has a negative correlation with the metal and has declined nearly 10 per cent this year.\nGlobal central banks have ramped up buying of gold as a diversified foreign reserve, hedging against risks from US tariff policies and budget deficits. They bought around 480 tonnes of gold in the first half, an increase of 12 per cent from the same period a year ago, according to industry data.\nThat added to purchases of 1,136 tonnes in 2024, the second highest annual total on record. The People’s Bank of China boosted its gold holdings for a 10th consecutive month in August, increasing its cache to about 2,200 tonnes, which represented 8.6 per cent of the nation’s foreign reserves. Meanwhile, China’s holdings of US Treasuries fell to a 17-year low of US$730.7 billion in July, according to the official data from the US government.\nUS President Donald Trump’s repeated attempts to meddle in monetary policy have also buttressed gold, leading investors to question the credibility of the Federal Reserve. Trump called for rate cuts numerous times, and more recently his administration installed Stephen Miran, a dove on monetary policy, on the Fed’s board of governors.\nMiran voted against a decision by the Fed to cut the interest rate by a quarter point in the policy meeting last month, calling for a half-point cut to prevent a deterioration of the labour market. Too aggressive loosening would risk a flare-up of inflation, which remains above the Fed’s target of 2 per cent.\n\n“The Fed’s independence seems challenged by the US administration’s efforts to change the make-up of the central bank’s board governors,” Lombard Odier said in a report in September, which added that core US inflation could rise above 3 per cent next year.\nInvestors have also ratcheted up wagers on gold on signs that growth and the jobs market were cooling in the US, which fanned expectations of further rate reductions. Fed chair Jerome Powell has already made it clear that the labour market would be prioritised over inflation in setting monetary policy. Gold moves in the opposite direction to interest rates.\n“The markets seem to be fully focused on the outlook for US growth and US monetary policy, with concerns about the independence of the Fed providing additional support,” said Carsten Menke, head of next-generation research at Julius Baer. “Expectations of further interest rate cuts have turned into a key driver of [gold’s] price performance despite US monetary policy not yet being expansive.”","summary":"Chinese investors sitting on 150 billion yuan (US$21 billion) worth of gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are likely to enjoy an extended run of a world-beating rally in the metal’s price amid robust demand, according to Swiss banks Julius Baer and Lombard Odier.\nEven after gaining almost 50 per cent this year, gold prices were set to rise to US$4,000 an ounce in the next 12 months, Julius Baer said, while Lombard Odier said the precious metal would rise to US$3,900.

She said President Donald Trump “ran on de-weaponizing and cleaning up the systemically corrupt DOJ, but you can’t do that if you have in powerful positions people who were top advisers to the very architects of the lawfare against the president,” she said.\n\nWhile Kelly suggested Ben’Ary may have been part of an “internal resistance” to the Comey prosecution, one person familiar with the matter told the Associated Press he had no involvement in the case.\n\nBen’Ary had served in the Justice Department for nearly two decades and was most recently prosecuting an alleged planner of the 2021 suicide bombing at Kabul airport, which killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 170 Afghan civilians. The trial for Mohammad Sharifullah, the alleged planner of the attack, is slated for Dec. 8.\n\nBen’Ary’s firing followed the recent departure of Maya Song, another senior prosecutor who had served as top deputy to former U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert. Song also worked in Monaco’s office during the Biden administration. Her LinkedIn profile indicates she is no longer with the Justice Department as of this week, the Washington Examiner confirmed.\n\nSiebert, a Trump appointee, was removed last month amid reports that his office was reluctant to bring charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) in a long-running mortgage fraud probe.\n\nTrump appointed Lindsey Halligan, a former White House aide and longtime Trump legal adviser, to lead the Alexandria-based office. Halligan was named on Sept. 20, shortly after Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue cases against his perceived opponent, including Comey.\n\nHalligan’s first major move was securing Comey’s indictment. Comey is charged with lying to Congress about whether he authorized leaks to the media.\n\nMinutes after the indictment was filed, Comey’s son-in-law, Troy Edwards, resigned from his position in the same office. In a brief letter to Halligan, he wrote that he was leaving “to uphold my oath to the Constitution and the country.”\n\nIn addition to Siebert’s reluctance to bring charges related to the James investigation, allies of Trump, including Kelly, pointed to Siebert’s familial relations as a warning sign while a grand jury was still weighing a prosecution against Comey. Siebert’s father-in-law, Richard Cullen, is a godfather to one of Comey’s daughters, the Washington Post previously reported in June 2017.\n\nMonaco has long been a target of Trump and his allies for her behind-the-scenes role in the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation. Earlier this year, she was included in a long list of former Democratic officials who lost access to security clearances and classified information.\n\nAs former President Barack Obama’s homeland security adviser in 2016, she was part of a small circle of national security officials, including then-CIA Director John Brennan and then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who reviewed intelligence related to Russian election interference and discussed potential responses.\n\nAccording to declassified documents and congressional testimony, Monaco participated in high-level White House meetings where officials considered whether to brief the Trump campaign about potential Russian contacts. Critics argue that those deliberations helped lay the groundwork for the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane inquiry and the broader lawfare campaign Trump has accused his opponents of orchestrating.\n\nAs deputy attorney general during the Biden administration, Monaco played a key role in overseeing the start of two federal criminal cases against Trump. She also helped orchestrate the DOJ’s aggressive prosecution of Jan. 6 rioters. \n\nMore recently, Monaco drew Trump’s ire again after joining Microsoft as chief legal officer, prompting him to call on the tech giant to fire her in a social media post.\n\n“Lisa Monaco, her dirty fingerprints stretch all the way back to the summer of 2016 as an architect of Russiagate,” Kelly said. “So you can’t have people who worked in close capacity with her—Senior Counsel, Associate Deputy Attorney General—you can’t have them in the DOJ. I mean, they can’t be trusted.”\n\nTRUMP EYES NEXT TARGETS AS COMEY CHARGES FORESHADOW MORE INDICTMENTS\n\nComey has denied wrongdoing and is expected to appear in court next week. “My heart is broken for the Department of Justice,” he said in a statement claiming his innocence last week.\n\nHe is scheduled to be arraigned in federal court in Alexandria on Oct. 9.","summary":"Two senior federal prosecutors have departed the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, adding to the mounting upheaval inside the office that recently brought criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey.

He said it wore away any trust he had left in the VA to offer services without a political agenda.\n\n“This blatant propaganda being spat out was astonishing,” said Port, a Virginia-based volunteer for the progressive advocacy organization Common Defense. “Then the astonishment turned into just anger that we’re being politicized like this.”\n\nPort is among a growing number of Americans whose routine interactions with the federal government this week have been met with partisan messaging. As a Senate deadlock keeps the federal government unfunded, with no end in sight, some traditionally apolitical federal agencies are using their official channels to spread a coordinated political message: It’s the Democrats’ fault.\n\nThe rhetoric, popping up in bright-red webpage banners, email autoreplies and social media posts, lays blame on the political party that is out of power in Washington when both sides are refusing to accommodate the other.\n\nDemocrats, who have minorities in both the U.S. Senate and House, have demanded that a set of expiring health insurance tax credits be extended before they sign on to any deal. Republicans, who need several Democratic votes in the Senate, said those negotiations should wait until after the funding measure passes.\n\nExperts say the communication strategy from across the federal government reflects how aligned President Donald Trump’s entire administration has become in targeting his political opponents.\n\nFar more partisan than the straightforward alerts that typically grace agency websites during shutdowns, the messages are in keeping with Trump’s pattern of requiring loyalty and obedience at all levels of government.\n\n“There’s really been a consistent and sustained effort to try to pull the entire bureaucracy in sync with what the president wants,” said Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The big risk here is that it erodes the fundamental trust that people have in government’s ability to be impartial.”\n\nSeveral government websites blame Democrats\n\nMany internet users noticed the first political postings from government agencies on Tuesday, before the shutdown began. The website of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development displayed a message warning that “The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands.”\n\nThat afternoon, employees across the federal government reported receiving messages from their agencies noting Trump’s general opposition to a shutdown.\n\nBy Thursday, the second day of the shutdown, at least nine federal agencies displayed messages on their websites or social media accounts pinning it on the “radical left” or Democrats.\n\nThe website of the Small Business Administration placed its message in a red banner that took up the entire screen on a smartphone. It said actions from Senate Democrats are preventing the agency “from serving America’s 36 million small businesses.” Other websites, including that of the Food and Drug Administration, told visitors that mission-critical activities would continue “during the Democrat-led government shutdown.”\n\nSeveral other federal agencies maintained politically neutral messages, noting simply that there might be delays in services or updates because of the lapse in funding.\n\nEmployee out-of-office messages are changed\n\nAt the Department of Education, out-of-office email messages were reset Wednesday with language blaming Democrats for the shutdown.\n\n“On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution,” the message said. “Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations.”\n\nSome employees tried to change it to something nonpartisan only to see it reverted, according to an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe White House isn’t shying away from the politics, displaying a by-the-second ticker on its website adding up the length of time for which “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government.”\n\nConcerned citizens calling the White House comment line on Wednesday also heard a political voicemail message. In the recording, press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeats Trump’s false claim that Democrats forced the government shutdown fight because they want to fund health care for illegal immigrants.\n\nCould the messaging violate federal law?\n\nEthics watchdogs said the political messages from government agency websites and emails exceed the level of partisanship they have seen in the past from the civil service.\n\nMultiple experts said the messages also violate a 1939 law called the Hatch Act, which restricts certain political activities by federal employees. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics lawyer and law professor at Washington University said they are “aimed at pursuing partisan political advantages” and therefore violate the law.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Office of Special Counsel calling for an investigation into the messages for “apparent violations of the Hatch Act.”\n\nDonald K. Sherman, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said he doesn’t think the messages violate the Hatch Act because they discuss the Democratic Party related to a policy difference rather than an election or a candidate. Still, he said, the postings might violate other ethics laws and are “wildly inappropriate.”\n\nVeterans Affairs spokesman Pete Kasperowicz defended his agency’s email message, saying it was “100% factual.”\n\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a Wednesday night interview with NewsNation that he’s not worried about the Hatch Act allegations against his agency. He called them a “distraction” to deflect from “irresponsible actions on the Hill” and how “Americans are being impacted greatly by this government shutdown.”\n\nAsked about the HUD website banner Thursday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson said it shared “the objective truth.”\n\n“There are 44 Democrats in the Senate — and by the way every Democrat in the House except one — who voted to shut the government down,” Johnson said in a press conference outside his office. “They are the ones that made that decision. The White House, the executive branch, take no pleasure in this.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Collin Binkley, Joey Cappelletti and Gary Fields in Washington, and video journalist Ty ONeil in Las Vegas contributed to this report.","summary":"Blame is hurled from agency website banners, in email autoreplies, and in social media posts.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/02/government-shutdown-partisan-messaging/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Government_Shutdown_43900.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:23:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":365672510,"title":"Federal agency website notifications, social media posts blame shutdown on ‘radical left’ Democrats","text":"By ALI SWENSON\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Army veteran Samuel Port couldn’t believe what he was reading in his latest weekly newsletter emailed from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIt blamed Senate Democrats for the federal shutdown, saying they were blocking a stopgap bill to fund the government “due to unrelated policy demands.” It then listed various disruptions to veterans’ resources.\n\nIn Port’s view, the finger-pointing was inappropriate from a federal agency and lacked the context that Republicans, too, could have taken steps to keep the government funded.

The website of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development displayed a message warning that “The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands.”\n\nThat afternoon, employees across the federal government reported receiving messages from their agencies noting Trump’s general opposition to a shutdown.\n\nBy Thursday, the second day of the shutdown, at least nine federal agencies displayed messages on their websites or social media accounts pinning it on the “radical left” or Democrats.\n\nThe website of the Small Business Administration placed its message in a red banner that took up the entire screen on a smartphone. It said actions from Senate Democrats are preventing the agency “from serving America’s 36 million small businesses.” Other websites, including that of the Food and Drug Administration, told visitors that mission-critical activities would continue “during the Democrat-led government shutdown.”\n\nSeveral other federal agencies maintained politically neutral messages, noting simply that there might be delays in services or updates because of the lapse in funding.\n\nEmployee out-of-office messages are changed\n\nAt the Department of Education, out-of-office email messages were reset Wednesday with language blaming Democrats for the shutdown.\n\n“On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution,” the message said. “Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations.”\n\nSome employees tried to change it to something nonpartisan only to see it reverted, according to an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nThe White House isn’t shying away from the politics, displaying a by-the-second ticker on its website adding up the length of time for which “Democrats Have Shut Down the Government.”\n\nConcerned citizens calling the White House comment line on Wednesday also heard a political voicemail message. In the recording, press secretary Karoline Leavitt repeats Trump’s false claim that Democrats forced the government shutdown fight because they want to fund health care for illegal immigrants.\n\nCould the messaging violate federal law?\n\nEthics watchdogs said the political messages from government agency websites and emails exceed the level of partisanship they have seen in the past from the civil service.\n\nMultiple experts said the messages also violate a 1939 law called the Hatch Act, which restricts certain political activities by federal employees. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics lawyer and law professor at Washington University said they are “aimed at pursuing partisan political advantages” and therefore violate the law.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter to the Office of Special Counsel calling for an investigation into the messages for “apparent violations of the Hatch Act.”\n\nDonald K. Sherman, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said he doesn’t think the messages violate the Hatch Act because they discuss the Democratic Party related to a policy difference rather than an election or a candidate. Still, he said, the postings might violate other ethics laws and are “wildly inappropriate.”\n\nVeterans Affairs spokesman Pete Kasperowicz defended his agency’s email message, saying it was “100% factual.”\n\nHUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a Wednesday night interview with NewsNation that he’s not worried about the Hatch Act allegations against his agency. He called them a “distraction” to deflect from “irresponsible actions on the Hill” and how “Americans are being impacted greatly by this government shutdown.”\n\nAsked about the HUD website banner Thursday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson said it shared “the objective truth.”\n\n“There are 44 Democrats in the Senate — and by the way every Democrat in the House except one — who voted to shut the government down,” Johnson said in a press conference outside his office. “They are the ones that made that decision. The White House, the executive branch, take no pleasure in this.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Collin Binkley, Joey Cappelletti and Gary Fields in Washington, and video journalist Ty ONeil in Las Vegas contributed to this report.","summary":"Blame is hurled from agency website banners, in email autoreplies, and in social media posts.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/10/02/government-shutdown-partisan-messaging/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Government_Shutdown_43900.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:23:31","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":365679214,"title":"Tariffs Backfiring? Trump Mulls $10 Billion Bailout for Struggling Farmers","text":"US President Donald Trump is considering a fresh aid package worth at least $10 billion for American farmers as the agricultural sector warns of growing economic strain from his extensive tariff measures, The Wall Street Journal reported. According to the report, people familiar with the discussions said the administration is exploring the use of tariff revenue to fund the programme, with distribution potentially beginning in the coming months. One senior official said the deliberations have focused on a range between $10 billion and $14 billion in aid, much of it likely directed at soybean producers and other key parts of the farm economy. \"The discussions are ongoing and nothing has been definitively settled,\" the official said. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins were in regular contact \"about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President’s November victory.\" \"He has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made,\" Kelly added. Also Read: Strategic Misfire? Why Trump’s Tariffs On India Are Raising Eyebrows Among US Think Tanks The President earlier this week said he planned to press Chinese President Xi Jinping to purchase US soybeans to assist struggling American farmers. The two leaders are expected to meet in South Korea in the coming weeks. A potential deal could alter the administration’s approach to the planned aid, officials said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that new support measures could be announced as early as Tuesday. American farmers are currently grappling with falling crop prices and rising production costs despite one of the largest harvests in history. Federal data suggest that soybean farmers could lose about $100 per acre this year. \"I think that money would be out of our hands pretty quickly,\" Chris Swanson, a soybean farmer in Iowa, referring to the potential bailout, told The Wall Street Journal. From January through August, US soybean exports to China dropped sharply to about 200 million bushels, down from nearly one billion during the same period in 2024, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Meanwhile, Brazil has filled much of the gap, shipping more than two billion bushels to China. Representative Derrick Van Orden, a Republican from Wisconsin, said: \"Right now things are very difficult, especially for our bean farmers. This is going to be solved by trade and finding markets in countries that aren’t actively plotting to destroy the United States.\" Farmers were among those hardest hit during Trump’s first trade war with China, when soybean imports collapsed and the government paid roughly $23 billion in compensation. With earlier funding sources now restricted by new tax legislation, the White House is seeking alternative means to support farmers while urging the agriculture sector to expand domestic markets and develop new export routes. The Treasury Department said the US collected $149.2 billion in customs duties during the first eight months of this year — a record amount, largely driven by Trump’s tariffs.

The Global Sumud Flotilla - which included climate activist Greta Thunberg - was stopped, with Israel ’s Foreign Ministry declaring the operation over on Thursday. Israeli strikes and gunfire overnight and into Thursday killed at least 41 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, as Hamas was still considering its response to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal for ending the nearly two-year war. It requires Hamas to return all 48 hostages - about 20 of them thought by Israel to be alive - give up power and disarm in return for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and an end to fighting. However, the proposal, which has been accepted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , sets no path to Palestinian statehood. The flotilla, which started out with more than 40 boats and nearly 450 activists, was carrying a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Its main goal, they said, remained \"to break Israel's illegal siege and end the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people.\" Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed it as a \"provocation,\" saying that various countries have offered to deliver the aid the boats were carrying. The organisers of the flotilla said at least 39 of their boats were intercepted or assumed intercepted in a nightlong Israeli operation. Israeli authorities later said only one boat remained \"at a distance\" and would be intercepted. The Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered this war. Militants killed some 1,200 people that day, while 251 others were abducted. Forty-eight hostages are still held in Gaza - around 20 believed to be alive. Israel's ensuing campaign has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israeli forces detained and removed dozens of people - including Greta Thunberg, former Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau and European Parliament member Rima Hassan - from the flotilla. Around 400,000 Palestinians have fled famine-stricken Gaza City since Israel launched a major offensive there last month. On Thursday morning, smoke could be seen in northern Gaza and people were fleeing the area headed south.","summary":"The Global Sumud Flotilla, which included climate activist Greta Tunberg as one of its passengers, was boarded by Israeli forces as it was bound for the Palestinian territory of Gaza","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/israeli-forces-detain-dozens-after-36006450","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36001457.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_FILES-ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-CONFLICT-AID-FLOTILLA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:18:11","author":"Chris Hughes","authors":["Chris Hughes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":365677110,"title":"Berklee College of Music lays off 70 employees, no faculty","text":"Berklee College of Music laid off 3 percent of its employees across its campuses, affecting 70 staff members and no faculty positions, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe workforce reduction will not impact any programs or academic offerings, a spokesperson for the prestigious music college said in a statement to Boston.com Thursday.

No different than a foreign enemy,” is setting the stage for a declaration of martial law. Further, Trump threatened the military leaders, “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room — of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.”\n\nThis is the talk of a despot, not the elected leader of a democratic nation.

But this delicate balancing act is now being tested by a series of policy shocks delivered by US president Donald Trump’s administration.\nThese disruptions, unlikely to ease anytime soon, raise a critical question: Can India retain its status as the world’s fastest-growing major economy?\nThe most urgent challenge facing Indian policymakers is weathering the escalating trade war. In August, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian imports, citing the need to reduce India’s trade surplus with the US and punish the country for its massive purchases of Russian oil.\nAdding to the pressure, Trump has urged the European Union and other G7 countries to take even harsher steps – namely, to impose a 100% tariff on imports from India and China.\nTrump’s decision to hike H-1B visa fees to US$100,000 represents yet another blow to India’s economy, particularly its IT services industry – one of the country’s most dynamic growth engines. Currently, Indian nationals account for more than 70% of all H-1B holders, with most of them working in IT or technology-related sectors.\nGiven this, it’s hardly surprising that the share prices of Indian companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro, which rely heavily on H-1B visas to access the US market, declined following Trump’s announcement.\nWhile Trump has labelled India a “dead economy,” it is unclear whether he meant this as a statement of fact or a threat he will make good unless India offers sufficient concessions in its trade negotiations with the US. Either way, there is little evidence to suggest the Indian economy is at risk of collapsing anytime soon.\nOn the contrary, India is among the world’s most vibrant economies. In July, before the new US tariffs were imposed, the International Monetary Fund projected that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by 6.4% in 2025 and 2026 – well ahead of America’s projected annual growth rate of 1.9%. No other major economy comes close, with the exception of China, at 4.8%.\nBarring external shocks, India is well-positioned to sustain its rapid growth rate over the next decade and become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030. Given its vast population and growth momentum, India could even overtake China and the US to emerge as the world’s largest economy within the next 50 years.\nThat said, the extent to which US policy shifts might affect India’s growth trajectory remains unclear. In the early 2000s, India was far less exposed to global trade than China was, with exports accounting for less than 15% of its GDP, compared with China’s 20%.\nSince then, however, India’s reliance on trade has increased significantly. Exports now make up more than 20% of GDP, leaving the country more vulnerable to trade shocks.\nGiven that the US is India’s largest export market, Trump’s tariffs will likely hit harder than similar actions by other trade partners. Still, it is important to remember that India is a continental economy, with domestic consumption playing a far greater role than external demand.\nMoreover, the EU’s trade significance for India nearly matches that of the US, and China and the Middle East are also important export destinations. Consequently, while US tariff hikes are disruptive, they are far from fatal.\nThis is not to say that Indian policymakers can afford to be passive. To mitigate the impact of US restrictions, they must pursue a dual strategy comprising stimulative macroeconomic policies and a concerted effort to deepen trade ties with the EU, China, and the Middle East.\nIt is also worth noting that the relative importance of the US market is likely to decline as a result of Trump’s protectionist trade policies. Should his administration stay the course, the EU and China may well surpass the US as the world’s leading import destinations by 2028.\nBeyond short-term policy responses aimed at offsetting the fall in US demand, the Indian authorities would be well advised to implement structural reforms.\nKey priorities for sustaining long-term growth include raising the female labour-force participation rate from 33% to levels much closer to China’s 60%, improving the investment climate by tackling bureaucratic corruption, and upgrading infrastructure – roads, railways, ports, and airports – to lower the cost of production and trade.\nBy adopting these reforms, India will not only be able to weather Trump’s tariff war in the short term but also sustain its growth miracle for years to come.\n\nShang-Jin Wei, a former chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, is professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School and Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"Barring external shocks, India is well-positioned to sustain its rapid growth rate over the next decade and become the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/10/03/indias-economy-is-stronger-than-trump-thinks","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082d4c1d-india-new-delhi-epa-011025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 23:00:50","author":"Shang-Jin Wei","authors":["Shang-Jin Wei"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":365673172,"title":"American trust in media reaches record low in new Gallup poll","text":"More than seven in 10 Americans distrust the mainstream media, according to a new Gallup poll released Thursday.

Moreover, 58% disapprove of the way in which he is handling the economy. It is the issue they cared about the most in November, when the election took place, and in June too.\n\nHowever, they are now paying much more attention to immigration. In November, the demographic ranked the issue sixth on a list of issues. It has jumped to second place as the Trump administration continues its crackdown, which has been largely focused on the Latino community.\n\nHowever, despite the negative trend, few Latinos said they would be willing to shift to the Democratic party. Under a fifth of respondents said it's unlikely Trump and Republicans will lose their support.\n\nDemocratic strategist Maria Cardona told CBS News that party members \"need to talk about what they will do for Latinos, not just how horrendous Donald Trump and Republicans have been.\"\n\n\"Democrats need to lead with 'this is what we will do for you, here is how we will help you and your family live a better life,' which is again the reason why we all came to this country to begin with.\"\n\nThe poll is not a one-off. Another survey conducted by Global Strategy Group for Somos Votantes found Trump's overall favorability underwater by 20 points among Latino voters. His job approval dropped from -11 in February to -23 today, while approval of his handling of the economy fell from -13 in February to -26 in September.\n\nThe erosion has been particularly visible among younger voters and men, groups that had shown more mixed views in prior polling.

This time, the Democrats are demanding the rollback of healthcare cuts that were imposed over the summer. As a result of the government shutdown, over 100,000 federal employees face layoffs, and regular services, such as passport and federal loan offices, are likely to be disrupted. However, essential services will continue as usual.\n\nConcerns are also emerging about the operations of agencies like the Social Security Administration (SSA), as a majority of the 74 million beneficiaries rely on their monthly benefits to get by. The good news is that all SSA recipients will continue to receive their funds on time during the shutdown.\n\nThe reason is that benefits for retirees and disabled Americans are covered by mandatory spending, meaning that the program is approved by Congress without an expiry date.\n\nHowever, several experts are worried that customer service at the SSA could be disrupted during the shutdown, making it difficult for recipients to connect with an official for query resolution.\n\n'The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,' said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. 'But customer service at the SSA may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.'\n\nFederal agencies have contingency plans for shutdowns. For instance, some workers are expected to work without pay as they are offering essential services. In order to gauge the potential impact on SSA operations due to the current shutdown, it is necessary to understand how many workers are deemed essential.\n\nThe SSA published a contingency plan in September, noting that around 45,000 workers would continue to work in the event of a shutdown, while nearly 6,200 would be furloughed.\n\n'We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,' according to the plan. 'We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.'\n\nSome of the non-critical operations include Freedom of Information Act requests and overpayment processing. Note that the shutdown could also delay the announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which is an annual increase in Social Security benefits to help recipients keep up with inflation.\n\nThe SSA announces the COLA raise every year when the US Labor Department releases the Consumer Price Index data for October, which is scheduled for 15th October this year. In case the shutdown continues till then, the announcement of the inflation print could be postponed, which could in turn delay the COLA announcement. This would make it difficult for millions of Americans to plan their finances and budgets for next year.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"Social Security payments will continue to arrive on time despite the US government shutdown, but customer services at the agency are likely to be impacted.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/74m-social-security-recipients-told-payments-will-continue-despite-government-shutdown-services-3785332","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4624868/social-security-administration.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 22:59:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.062},{"id":365675516,"title":"Citadel Bumps Stake in SPAC by 1,300% Days Before SEC Approved Its Merger With Nuclear Plant Developer","text":"Billionaire investor Kenneth Griffin leads one of the most successful hedge funds in the world. As the founder and CEO of Citadel Advisors, Griffin is widely known for his open-mindedness to diverse asset classes and love for math, evident from his quantitative investing approach, which helped Citadel generate over $74 billion (£54.7 billion) in net gains since its inception in 1990.\n\nRecently, Citadel Advisors purchased nearly 1 million shares of HCM II Acquisition (Nasdaq:HOND) on 23rd September, just before the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 26th September for the merger with Terrestrial Energy.\n\nSPACs are blank-cheque companies formed to raise capital through an initial public offering, with the intention of later acquiring or merging with an existing, private operating company. SPACs offer a faster alternative to a traditional IPO for private companies, enabling them to become publicly traded by merging with the shell companies.\n\nTerrestrial Energy develops small modular nuclear plants using Generation IV advanced reactor technology. Soon after the SEC approval, the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy selected the company for the Fuel Line Pilot Program, according to a 1st October press release.\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May to form the pilot program aimed at addressing the country's shortage of domestic nuclear fuel resources. Terrestrial Energy will establish an Integral Molten Salt Reactor fuel line within a DOE-approved facility and engage Western suppliers to advance the molten salt reactor fuel cycle within a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain anchored in the US.\n\nAccording to Terrestrial Energy, the contract award complements its recent selection for DOE's Advanced Reactor Pilot Program announced in August 2025, to create a framework spanning both reactor development and fuel supply chain capabilities.\n\n'President Trump has made clear that a strong nuclear sector is a central component of America's energy security and prosperity,' said Deputy Secretary of Energy James P. Danly. 'Restoring a secure domestic fuel supply will ensure that advanced reactors can move quickly from design to deployment and into operation. The ability to produce these fuels is essential to ensuring American leadership in nuclear energy and to meeting the nation's growing demand for reliable power.'\n\nFurthermore, Trump is mulling a proposal to alter plutonium to fuel a new generation of power plants, including startups pitching advanced reactor designs. The development is part of a broader push by Trump to convert tonnes of the DOE's plutonium for civilian use, which experts believe could undermine the US weapons program.\n\nAccording to media reports, over a fifth of the plutonium required to meet Trump's mandates would come from highly radioactive spheres made for the cores of nuclear weapons. However, the DOE continues to face a crunch to make more of those spheres.\n\nThe department is 'not meeting the current pit manufacturing schedule,' according to a former DOE official familiar with the department's plutonium reserves.\n\nDisclaimer: Our digital media content is for informational purposes only and not investment advice.

Experts Question Why Google's AI Is Muted on the President's Health, Fuelling Conspiracy Theories","text":"Google has come under fire after users noticed a striking omission in search results related to US President Donald Trump's health. On 1 October 2025, online users discovered that searching terms such as 'Does Trump show signs of dementia?' produced no AI-generated summary.\n\nInstead, the platform displayed a notice saying: 'An AI Overview is not available for this search'. This became controversial because the same query about former President Joe Biden produced a detailed AI response addressing dementia allegations.\n\nThe difference sparked fresh accusations of bias, censorship, and even a potential cover-up of Trump's condition.\n\nNo Google AI Summary for Donald Trump Dementia Searches\n\nAccording to The Hindustan Times, searches such as 'is Trump in cognitive decline' only returned a list of links. Google's AI Overview, which usually gives a short summary, was entirely absent. The Independent later confirmed the discrepancy with its own tests.\n\nWhen users searched the same question for Biden, Google displayed a more direct response. The AI system acknowledged that assessing dementia was complex, added that only medical professionals could make a diagnosis, and even referenced Special Counsel Robert Hur's report describing Biden as a 'well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory'.\n\nThe different treatment between Trump and Biden led to questions about why Google's AI was silent on one but active on the other.\n\nGoogle Faces Serious Accusations\n\nThe lack of an AI response to Trump's health immediately raised accusations of political bias. Critics argued that the tech company was shielding him from public scrutiny, as reported by The Daily Beast. Some outlets suggested Google might be concerned about Trump's history of reacting aggressively to negative press.\n\nThe timing also made the issue more sensitive. Trump, now 79, is set to surpass Biden as the oldest sitting President. His health has been scrutinised for years due to rambling speeches, memory lapses, and strange claims, such as stating his presidency began in 2016 or mentioning his uncle taught the Unabomber.\n\nThese moments added fuel to ongoing debates about his cognitive condition.\n\nGoogle Defends Lack of AI Overview on Trump Health\n\nGoogle rejected suggestions of intentional bias. A spokesperson explained that the AI Overview feature does not appear for every query. The company stressed that its systems decide automatically whether an AI-generated answer would be helpful.\n\n'Our systems automatically determine where an AI response will be useful, and it's not always 100 percent consistent,' the spokesperson said.\n\nHe added: 'We don't show AI Overviews on every query and similarly in AI Mode, for some topics (like current events) we may show a list of links as the response'.\n\nThe company's explanation did little to calm speculation. Critics argued the inconsistency highlighted larger concerns about transparency and trust in artificial intelligence tools.\n\nGoogle AI Overview Issue Sparks Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe missing AI summaries for Trump's health fuelled a wave of conspiracy theories online. Many claimed Google was hiding information about alleged dementia. Others argued the silence itself gave the appearance of a cover-up.\n\nSpeculation about Trump's health has circulated for years. Earlier in 2025, images of a lump on his arm prompted online claims of hidden medical problems. At one point, rumours spread that he had died after being unusually quiet for a weekend. Those stories were debunked, but added to the growing mistrust surrounding his condition.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner said that Trump showed signs of major decline in language skills. He said, 'He used to speak with a high level of vocabulary in very polished paragraphs. Now... his vocabulary has gone down... sometimes he's really unable to complete a thought. Sometimes he's unable to complete a word'.\n\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed concerns, calling himself a 'stable genius' and boasting about achieving top scores in cognitive tests. Still, the lack of a Google AI summary compared with Biden's continues to raise questions about fairness, transparency, and whether technology companies play a role in shaping the debate over leaders' health.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"If you search 'does Donald Trump have dementia?' on Google, it will not show you an AI summary.

Fox News Digital found no evidence that Prophet’s DEI commitments were connected to Cracker Barrel’s rebranding. EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: CRACKER BARREL CEO DODGES QUESTIONS AFTER LOGO FLIP-FLOP In August, the brand unveiled its new logo, which dropped the illustration of a man, \"Uncle Herschel,\" resting his arm on top of a wooden barrel, a folksy image that has embodied the brand&apos;s Southern hospitality for the last 56 years. Some interpreted the change as an appeal to the woke movement. The logo change sparked backlash that wiped over $140 million off the chain’s market value at the height of the crisis as customer outrage and investor unease fueled what became the steepest losing streak in months. Shares are down over 7% year-to-date. President Donald Trump even weighed in, calling on the chain to return to its roots.

The American President had previously spoken about how he might consider relocating FIFA matches to different cities depending on how “safe” it is. Victor Montagliani rebutted the claim while making clear that Trump does not hold the power to make that decision.\n\n“If I think it isn’t safe, we’ll move it into a different city,” the President was heard answering when asked about the World Cup matches scheduled in Seattle and San Francisco. A total of 6 matches are scheduled to take place in both the Democratic run states.\n\nTrump went on to add Los Angeles to the list of states he thinks might consider unsafe. Los Angeles, also a Democratic-run city, will host 8 FIFA matches. He shared how if his administration decides a city is even a “little bit dangerous,” the schedule will be subject to change.\n\nHe shared how the same applied to the 2028 Olympics, which will be taking place in Los Angeles. “Because they’re playing in so many cities, we won’t allow it to go. We’ll move it around a little bit,” the 79-year-old declared while circling back to the FIFA matches.\n\nThe President was heard claiming that Seattle and San Francisco were “run by radical left lunatics who don’t know what they’re doing.” There has been much speculation about whether Trump can actually reschedule and relocate the matches to his liking if he decides.\n\nTrump seems to have overestimated his authority when it came to the World Cup’s schedule. FIFA Vice-President Victor Montagliani has come forward to make it clear that the American President holds no sway over the championship’s schedule.\n\n“It’s FIFA’s tournament, FIFA’s jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” Montagliani declared to shut down the speculation. The comment came during his appearance at the Leaders Week London at the Allianz Stadium.\n\nMontagliani was quick to note that football was “bigger” than the disagreement between the left and the right. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans,” he added.\n\nHe went on to share how the sport was bigger than “any country.” FIFA matches will take place in other cities, including Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Miami, New York/New Jersey, and Philadelphia.\n\nGianni Infantino, who serves as the President of FIFA, has refrained from commenting on the topic. The tournament is set to hold its final on July 19th, with 48 teams taking part in the tournament.","summary":"Victor Montagliani says relocating matches if FIFA's decision after Trump threatens to relocate world cup matches.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/fifa-vice-president-claps-back-at-trump-over-threat-to-relocate-matches-from-dangerous-cities","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FIFA-Vice-President-claps-back-at-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 22:57:39","author":"Luisomartapia/ @omarbula,Vaishnavi Shetye","authors":["Luisomartapia/ @omarbula","Vaishnavi Shetye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":365677018,"title":"Trump piles pain on Democrats over US government shutdown","text":"Donald Trump signalled on Thursday that he planned to follow through on his threat for mass lay-offs of US federal workers as he ratcheted pressure on Democrats to back moves to end the government shutdown.\nThe Republican US president announced he would meet budget chief Russell Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent”.\nTrump’s announcement on social media came with the government entering the second day of a stoppage that is expected to see 750,000 employees sent home without pay across a wide range of agencies.\nVought told House Republicans on Wednesday that many of those workers would be targeted for permanent lay-offs to be announced in the next day or two, echoing Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt’s threat that firings were “imminent”.\nLeavitt told reporters on Thursday the job cuts were likely going to number “in the thousands”.\n\nTrump has emphasised that he views cutbacks as a way of increasing pain on Democrats, arguing that “we can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them”.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and his House counterpart Hakeem Jeffries have dismissed the job cuts threat as an attempt at intimidation and said mass firings would not stand up in court.\nTwo Senate Democrats and an independent who votes with the party have broken with their colleagues, but the rest have been voting against a House-passed resolution to keep the government funded at current levels through November 21.\n“This is day two of Donald Trump’s shutdown, but it’s day 256 of the chaos that the Trump presidency has unleashed on the American people,” Jeffries told a news conference at the US Capitol on Thursday.\nThe House minority leader accused Republicans of shutting down the federal government because “they don’t want to provide healthcare to working-class Americans”.\nAlthough House Republicans were on holiday, Jeffries said Democrats were ready and willing “to sit down with anyone, any time, any place” – including with Trump and US Vice-President J.D.

Agencies have gone dark, families are anxious, and markets are uneasy. But make no mistake: This crisis is not the product of fiscal prudence or a careful budgeting process. It is the direct result of Democrats demanding $1.5 trillion in new spending, including billions for free healthcare and benefits for illegal immigrants, at the expense of hardworking Americans.\n\nThis is political hostage-taking, plain and simple.\n\nAt the center of this standoff is the Left’s obsession with expanding entitlements for non-citizens. According to the White House’s own analysis, the Democrat plan would commit nearly $200 billion over the next decade to cover healthcare for illegal immigrants and other non-citizens. To fund this reckless giveaway, they would gut reforms designed to protect vulnerable American patients.\n\nThis shutdown is not about whether veterans get their checks or whether small businesses receive federal support. Conservatives offered clean funding measures to keep the government open. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the radical Left rejected them. They chose illegal immigrants over American citizens. (RELATED: Trump’s Bulldog Will Have Democrats In Fetal Position By End Of The Schumer Shutdown) \n\nShutdowns are never painless. Economists estimate that each week of closure drains about $15 billion in GDP and costs tens of thousands of jobs. Families waiting on permits, benefits, or loan approvals will see delays. Active-duty military will continue serving without pay. Essential workers will carry on, but under stress and uncertainty.\n\nThat hardship lands squarely on the shoulders of the Democrats. They had the choice to fund government responsibly — border security, veterans, infrastructure, law enforcement — without tying it to a radical agenda. Instead, they walked away.\n\nThis comes as the national debt already tops $37 trillion, and annual interest payments on that debt are projected to exceed defense spending within two years. At a moment that demands restraint and focus, Democrats doubled down on giveaways and pork-barrel politics.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have drawn a sharp line: government should serve Americans first. That means securing the border, defending the homeland, strengthening wages, and investing in infrastructure. It does not mean funneling taxpayer money to illegal immigrants or bloated agencies that exist to enforce woke ideology.\n\nThe Trump-Vance Administration’s budget framework is a plan rooted in national interest, not political gamesmanship. Unlike Democrats, this administration has been transparent. They told the American people exactly what they would fund and what they would not. It is the Left that chose to block these commonsense measures and force a shutdown.\n\nWhy would Democrats force this outcome? The answer is simple: politics. They believe that by dragging the nation through a shutdown, they can paint Republicans as irresponsible while hiding their own radical priorities.\n\nBut Americans are not fooled. Poll after poll shows that citizens want stronger borders, fiscal discipline, and an end to handouts for those who broke our laws to enter this country. By making illegal immigrant healthcare the hill they chose to die on, Democrats have revealed their true priorities.\n\nThis shutdown is painful but also clarifying. It exposes the Left’s willingness to sacrifice stability in order to expand government dependency. And it highlights the Trump-Vance Administration’s commitment to an America First agenda, even under intense pressure.\n\nRepublicans must hold the line. To surrender now would be to signal that Democrats can always win by threatening chaos. That would guarantee more reckless spending, more border neglect, and more shutdowns engineered by the Left in the future.\n\nInstead, conservatives should rally around the principle that government exists for citizens, not special interests, and not illegal aliens. That is the only path to a stable, prosperous, and sovereign United States of America.\n\nThe shutdown is real. The pain is real. But so is the opportunity to redefine what government stands for. If Republicans stay united and the Trump–Vance Administration continues its firm leadership, Democrats will have no choice but to come back to the table, and on terms that prioritize America first.\n\nThis fight is not just about dollars. It’s about direction. Do we spend our future on illegal immigrant benefits and ideological programs, or do we invest in security, sovereignty, and American prosperity?\n\nJorge Martínez is Senior Advisor and National Director of Hispanic Outreach for America First Works.

Putin where it hurts — to finally end his bloody war","text":"President Donald Trump — after repeatedly warning the Kremlin that his patience was wearing thin over its continuing invasion of Ukraine — has begun to match words with action.\n\nAs Moscow continues to flout his efforts to broker peace, Trump has agreed to give Kyiv US intelligence to support strikes on energy infrastructure deep inside Russia, helping Ukraine take the war to President Vladimir Putin’s doorstep.\n\nTrump should now follow through by supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles to do the job — and ratcheting up the economic pressure on Russia.\n\nDespite Putin’s professed readiness for peace, his assault on Ukraine has only intensified.\n\nTrump struck a compromising stance at the two leaders’ Alaska summit, yet the Russian autocrat has since refused even to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIndifferent to the death and destruction he inflicts on both Ukrainians and his own citizens with each passing day, Putin has continued to insist on maximalist demands that effectively render a settlement impossible.\n\nIt’s long past time for Moscow to face consequences for its intransigence.\n\nTrump’s decision breaks with his administration’s previous policy of blocking Ukrainian strikes inside Russia using American-supplied missiles or targeting data.\n\nIn addition to the new intelligence sharing, Trump reportedly is weighing whether to provide Ukraine with various long-range missiles.\n\nThese include the Tomahawk, which Zelensky requested during a recent meeting with the American leader.\n\nThese munitions have much longer ranges than the ATACMS ballistic missiles and Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles Ukraine previously received from the United States, Britain and France, of which Kyiv has few left.\n\nAnd they pack a more powerful punch than Ukrainian-made drones, which typically carry relatively small warheads.\n\nThese new missiles would likewise add capacity and capability to Ukraine’s nascent arsenal of indigenously produced long-range missiles.\n\nUS-supplied intelligence and missiles can enhance Ukraine’s ongoing drone strike campaign against the Russian energy industry.\n\nIn recent months, Ukraine has struck over 40% of Russia’s oil refineries, causing fuel shortages and price hikes and forcing Moscow to restrict gasoline and diesel exports.\n\nTrump should provide Ukraine with as many missiles as possible, both long-range munitions as well as additional ATACMS.\n\nIn addition, Ukraine should be permitted to use American missiles, targeting data and mission planning support for strikes on not only energy infrastructure but on other targets as well, including key military-industrial sites.\n\nFor example, Kyiv could employ the Tomahawk or another missile with similar range to strike the Russian plants making the Geran and Gerbera drones that bombard Ukrainian cities and critical infrastructure night after night.\n\nIn concert, Trump should work with European and G7 allies to tighten the screws on Russia’s economy.\n\nThis effort should include an aggressive application of so-called secondary sanctions aimed at denying Moscow revenue from oil exports.\n\nWhile Trump has threatened tariffs on Russian oil customers such as China, sanctions are the better option.\n\nHarsh US tariffs have failed to convince India to ditch Russian oil — and tariffs are incompatible with Washington’s goals of securing trade deals with New Delhi and Beijing.\n\nWhen it comes to economic pressure, Trump should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nHe is right to push Europe to end its remaining imports of Russian energy, which have already declined dramatically since 2022.\n\nBut even though some European countries — mainly Hungary and Slovakia — continue to buy some Russian oil and gas, that is no excuse for US inaction.\n\nIf Trump refuses to sanction Russia until Europe ceases buying any Russian hydrocarbons, it’ll effectively be giving Moscow a pass to continue the killing in Ukraine.\n\nTo be sure, Putin will never abandon his decades-long obsession with making Ukraine a Russian vassal.\n\nBut over time, he perhaps could be convinced to stop shooting, at least for now, on terms Kyiv can live with.\n\nThat will require putting further military and economic pressure on Russia — and proving to Putin that neither Ukrainian forces nor Western resolve will break.\n\nJohn Hardie is deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.","summary":"As

Climate-focused reporting platform DeSmog wrote in April that it had seen a document appearing to trace the backlash to global PR consultancy Red Flag, which represents the meat and dairy industry. DW contacted Red Flag for comment, but the agency did not respond before publication. \"Food is something people connect with,\" said Maddy Haughton-Boakes, a senior campaigner at Changing Markets Foundation, a Dutch NGO working to support solutions that benefit society and the environment. \"Everybody has a very personal connection with food and what we eat, and people know that. And if you play to that individualism agenda, you can really rile people up and motivate people.\" A new investigation by Changing Markets lays out how \"industry-friendly scientists, doctors, health influencers, journalists and authors\" connected with the meat industry took part in a \"targeted and coordinated campaign\" to derail the 2019 EAT-Lancet report and its health and sustainability research, with critics portraying it as being \"dangerous, elitist and anti-science.\" \"At the time, a lot of the backlash was presented as organic,\" Haughton-Boakes told DW. \"We know now that it wasn't organic.\" She said their research showed how \"mis-influencers\" tagged and shared each other's content, using similar or identical wording and hashtags like #Yes2Meat, #MeatHeals #ClimateFoodFacts to tout the health and environmental benefits of meat. And, she added, amid the current geopolitical instability and soaring food prices, there have been signs in recent days that this latest report will face the same resistance. The Changing Markets investigation said many of the people behind the 2019 campaign \"are still active and engaging with each other, their reach has grown and the public acceptance or take-up of their ideas has increased.\" \"The promotion of carnivore diets has shifted into the mainstream now,\" said Haughton-Boakes, highlighting the influence of manosphere podcasts and the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement in the US under President Donald Trump. \"Globally, there's this protein boom and idea that you have to consume vast amounts of meat [and] animal protein for your health.\" Social media, AI helping to spread misinformation Haughton-Boakes said the weakening of fact-checking units and safeguards against misleading information on social media services such as X, Instagram and Facebook over the last year have helped fuel misinformation. As has the rise of AI tools boosting the spread of fake news and convincing deepfake videos and images. Writing for the Paris-based Geopolitical Studies Group, sociologist Jose Henrique Bortoluci and Emmanuel Guerin, a fellow at the European Climate Foundation, said the relative freedom of social media has fostered an environment in which climate disinformation has flourished. \"Opportunistic individuals take advantage of this environment to generate skepticism and spread misinformation. They have mastered the art of imitating 'expertise' or undermining it, exemplified by the rise of pseudo-experts and think tanks aimed at discrediting climate science,\" they wrote in July. In an email to DW, Bortoluci stressed that social media platforms need to be regulated, as with broadcast media and advertising. \"There is no individual or institutional effort that can limit the spread of fake news and the advancement of disinformation campaigns if the platforms themselves are not co-responsible in tackling the problem,\" he said. Taking back the 'emotional narrative' \"We all in the [EAT-Lancet] Commission share the same concern over this return… of mis- and disinformation, and denialism on climate science,\" Rockström told reporters earlier this week, in response to a DW question. But he felt the new report was ready to \"meet that assault\" with its \"rigorous\" global scientific assessment. \"We're not dictating any specific one-fit-for-all type of diet,\" he added, pushing back against a common misinterpretation of the 2019 EAT-Lancet report. Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, pointed out that the planetary health diet was similar to many traditional diets around the world. Examples of this healthy meal plan will be displayed on the report website in a series of pictures, he said — an apparent effort to connect with people and take back what Bortoluci and Guerin called the \"emotional narrative\" highjacked by misinformation. \"[The pictures] make the case that this is not a deprivation diet that we're talking about,\" said Willett. \"This is something that could be delicious, aspirational and healthy.\" Edited by: Tamsin Walker","summary":"A major scientific update to one of the most influential food and planetary health reports of the last decade is in the crosshairs of a pro-meat misinformation campaign.","url":"https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/online-attacks-threaten-major-climate-friendly-diet-report-7141198.html","image":"https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/74220737_403.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-02 22:40:20","author":"Deutsche Welle","authors":["Deutsche Welle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.189},{"id":365672158,"title":"Father battling leukemia detained by ICE, can't get correct medication: ACLU","text":"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan has filed a case in federal court on behalf of eight undocumented individuals who have been detained, including a father battling a rare form of leukemia.\n\nThe ACLU said that because of a recent directive by President Donald Trump's administration, the detainees are no longer able to have bond hearings to seek release while their immigration cases play out, a process that can take months or even years. \n\nThe directive is being challenged in several lawsuits across the country.\n\n\"In this country, due process is fundamental,\" Miriam Aukerman, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Michigan, who is representing the plaintiffs, said at a virtual conference on Thursday.\n\n\"We don't just lock people up and throw away the key. Rather, judges decide who should be behind bars. That is true for citizens and non-citizens for decades,\" Aukerman said.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs currently detained, Jose Daniel Contreras-Cervantes, suffers from a rare form of leukemia, with a four-to-six-year life expectancy, according to lawyers and his wife, who say he has not been able to consistently receive the treatment he needs while in detention. \n\nABC News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for a comment.\n\n“We know that our time together was limited because of his prognosis,” Lupita Contreras, a U.S. citizen, said in a statement. “We didn't know that some of our precious time together would be abruptly and cruelly stolen.”\n\nJose was detained in August following a traffic stop for allegedly going ten miles over the speed limit, according to his wife and the ACLU.\n\nBorn in Mexico, he came to the U.S. when he was 14, they said. Jose and Lupita have three children. Their two sons appeared briefly on the virtual press conference, saying in tears how much they missed their father.\n\n“For 22 days, Jose did not receive his medication, which he is to take daily for his leukemia,” Lupita said. “Lapses in his medication and medical treatment can cause severe symptoms, including damage to his vision, infections and the loss of his life.”\n\n“He is not getting the type of medication that his doctors recommend. He's getting a substitute medication,” Aukerman added. “He's not being treated by the specialist care team he needs. He is getting some medical treatment, but he's not getting the medical care that he needs for his condition.”\n\nAccording to Aukerman, other than traffic violations, Jose does not have any criminal record that could otherwise prevent a bond hearing from being considered.\n\n“This new directive is one of the most dangerous and far-reaching abuses of power that we've seen in this administration's mass deportation campaign,” Aukerman said. “If unchecked, it will affect thousands, possibly millions of people. It will result in family separation on an unprecedented scale.”\n\nThe ACLU said in a press release that the other petitioners \"have lived in the United States as long as 25 years, in some cases since infancy, and have longstanding ties to their communities.
