In 2013, she successfully prosecuted a group of teachers in Atlanta using Georgia's RICO statute after arguing the educators conspired to cheat on state standardized tests.The YSL case, which has become clouded by a series of controversies, is one of two high-profile criminal RICO cases currently being led by Willis' office. Her team is also prosecuting former President Donald Trump and his allies for their alleged efforts to overturn the state's 2020 election under Georgia's racketeering laws.The case against the alleged YSL gang members was halted earlier this month after Judge Ural Glanville said he would pause proceedings until a decision on the motion to remove him from the case was made.\"The trial of the Young Thug RICO gang case should be a cautionary tale for prosecutors,\" McAuliffe said. \"The case has been unmanageable from the beginning. Chaos and delay almost always favor the defense.\"Newsweek reached out to Willis' office via email for comment.At 18 months and counting, the YSL trial is the longest in Georgia's history. Willis indicted Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffrey Williams, and 27 others for gang-related crimes more than two years ago. Prosecutors argue that Williams is the kingpin of the YSL gang. His attorneys dispute those claims, arguing instead that YSL stands for his record label Young Stoner Life.Only six of the defendants, including Williams, are standing trial. Jury selection began in January 2023, and opening statements started in November 2023.It's not only the length of the trial that has shocked legal observers, a string of dramatic courtroom moments have also drawn national attention to the case. Throughout the course of the trial, one of the defendants has been stabbed in jail, a witness revealed that an investigator from Willis' office had asked her out on a date during the probe and drugs were distributed in the middle of the courtroom.Things reached a boiling point last month when Williams' attorney Brian Steel confronted Glanville in court about a private meeting the judge held with prosecutors and a state witness. Glanville became infuriated and demanded that Steel disclose how he learned of what was said in the meeting, and when Steel refused, the judge held him in contempt of court and sentenced him behind bars for 20 days. The jail sentence was later stayed by an appeals court.The stunning sequence of events prompted defense attorneys to file motions for Glanville's recusal, arguing that the judge was helping the prosecution win a conviction. Glanville was removed from the case Monday and it has since been reassigned to Judge Shukura Ingram.Legal experts warn that the move to replace Glanville with another judge only puts Willis' case in further jeopardy.\"Any trial that goes on indefinitely has a higher and higher chance of a mistrial. Changing judges mid-trial is extremely rare,\" McAuliffe said. \"The new judge must address a long list of evidentiary issues and try to move the trial forward. The new judge's priority will be to get the case to the jury for a verdict or end it through a mistrial or dismissal. The prior scenario of an endless trial likely won't be acceptable––for good reason.\"Cathy Russon, a managing editor at Law&Crime, said it was unlikely Ingram could pick immediately or at the point where Glanville left off, meaning it was unlikely the trial was seeing another court date soon.\"I'd say very little chance that Judge Ingram (that's who is taking his place) is able to jump in and continue seeing as how she likely has a full load like all Fulton Co. judges. Also we expect motions for mistrial and/or dismissal to come out,\" Russon wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"I doubt this trial is continuing in the near future.\"","summary":"\"Chaos and delay almost always favor the defense,\" McAuliffe said of the Young Slime Life trial.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-fani-willis-became-cautionary-tale-lawyers-1926075","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2429781/fani-willis-cautionary-tale.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:35:41","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":251936442,"title":"The Critical Moments That Have Secret Service Boss Under Pressure","text":"Donald Trump was mere inches from being shot dead Saturday in what’s been widely characterized as the Secret Service’s biggest failure in decades.

But he also warns that late-campaign developments – in the form of an “October Surprise” – could complicate things down the stretch. “The map has expanded in a massive, massive way,” Eric Trump said in Milwaukee Tuesday. “The internal numbers are great. You’re seeing massive, massive shifts,” he added, noting that it’s not just states that are in play, but demographics nationally. “We’ve never done better with the youth vote than we are doing right now. We’ve never done better with the African American vote than we’re doing right now. That vote has moved by 20%. We’ve never done better with the Hispanic vote than we are doing right now. We’ve never done better with the Jewish vote than we’re doing right now,” Eric Trump said, before moving to states that the Trump campaign thinks it can win. Among them are Minnesota, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Nevada “In Nevada, we’re up by like 10%. We’re up by like 7% in Arizona. I would have never thought there was a time where your polls actually showed you higher in Nevada than they did in Arizona. I mean, Arizona is just incredibly red, but that’s actually how well we’re doing in Arizona. That’s how well we’re doing in Nevada.” RNC and Trump political director James Blair and pollster Tony Fabrizio offered similarly upbeat takes, saying that Minnesota, Virginia, New Jersey and New Mexico were all in play also, along with Maine. Blair confirmed that the “map is expanding,” meanwhile, and that the Trump side is optimistic that they can “outspend” the Biden campaign. They’re also confident that news events, including Saturday night’s assassination attempt on the former President, have “really galvanized our supporters and brought new supporters aboard.” “Joe Biden has spent $150 million in the battleground states,” Blair said. “And the numbers are going in the wrong direction.” Fabrizio noted that the media was late to understanding that Minnesota and Virginia were in play, chiding press for “playing catch-up” and not understanding “the level of enthusiasm our base has versus the level that Joe Biden’s base has.” “You’re writing as if North Carolina and Arizona are still toss-up states,” he said, saying that opportunities for GOP pick-ups exist in this electoral cycle that didn’t in 2016 or 2020. One thing to watch, he said, would be which marginal candidates made the ballots in which states. Still, Fabrizio said that many 2020 Biden voters have “buyers’ remorse,” and are simply too “disaffected” to vote Biden again. Ad buys focusing on abortion and Jan. 6, he added, have taken polling numbers in the “wrong direction” for the Biden campaign – despite a staggering $150 million in the bank to spend on messaging. “Right now on average, put my polls aside (and look at) public averages. We’re ahead by almost five points in Pennsylvania. We’re ahead by a little over six points in Arizona and coming up on seven points in Nevada. And by the way, that’s not counting in the undecideds that will break to us. So, you know, right now we have a pretty comfortable margin in those states,” Fabrizio said. Fabrizio is also bullish on Trump’s appeal to younger voters buckling under the pressure of the economy, since roughly 35% of them in target states have had to take “second jobs to make ends meet.” “Their memory is that the economy was doing much better and there was more opportunity,” Fabrizio added, referring to Trump’s presidency. Despite the positive polling, there was an acknowledgement that currently unforeseeable events could change the topography of the race. Eric Trump offered cautions, saying that it’s a certainty the Biden campaign will “cheat” and that a familiar late-campaign trope is bound to recur weeks before the election. “Guys, there’s gonna be an October surprise,” Eric Trump asserted. “I want to get the world prepared for the fact that the same game that they’ve played every single time, you know, the Democratic October Surprise, which is something that they spring on you, which is so sensational that it buries you, but it’s something that you don’t have enough time to disprove. So by the time it kind of gets through the media, it’s already done the damage that they intend to do, even if it’s not true.” Fabrizio echoed Eric’s sentiments, warning supporters that Dems “will do anything” to win.","summary":"The former president’s middle son is telling Florida Republicans that the electoral map has expanded and that certain key demographics are going Donald Trump’s way.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/us-news/eric-trump-bullish-on-internal-2024-polls-but-fretting-dem-october-surprise/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-ppo3tigr9-1721175736340.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721161386&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gBKkWZrK-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:26:57","author":"A.g.

It's time for an important conversation in this country.\" \"Our politics has gotten too heated,\" he continued. \"As I've said in the Oval Office on Sunday night, as I've made clear throughout my presidency, we all have responsibilities to lower the temperature and condemn violence in any form. You gotta remember, in America we're not enemies, we're friends, we're neighbors.\" But Biden did not refrain from relentlessly criticizing the former president in his 30-minute speech, saying that \"just because you must lower the temperature … doesn't mean we should stop telling the truth of who you are, what you've done, what you'll do.\" Biden used Saturday's shooting to launch into a forceful condemnation of gun violence in America, nearly yelling when he cited the impact of gun violence on kids. \"You know, the pain, the price of violence. You understand if you're going to talk about standing against violence, you must stand against all violence,\" Biden said, addressing NAACP members, before listing off other notable acts of violence, including the killing of George Floyd, and the events of January 6, 2021. \"More children in America died of gunshot wounds than any other reason. That is stunning and that is sick,\" he later almost shouted. Biden appeared careful to focus on policy differences -- not calling Trump himself, as he has before, a \"threat to democracy.\" \"Just think about where the Black community was when I came into office. Think about how far the Black community has come. We still got a long way to go. COVID no longer controls our lives. Our economy has not figuratively, literally, the strongest economy in the world; historic low Black unemployment, record growth of black small business. Let me say this again, because Trump is lying like hell about it,\" he said. \"Black unemployment hit a record low under Biden-Harris administration.\" \"As Harry Truman said, 'I've never deliberately given anyone hell. I just told the truth and they thought it was hell,'\" Biden said. \"That's what I'm gonna do. Well, here's the truth about why Donald Trump's presidency was hell for Black Americans.\" The president cited Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, his tax cut which benefitted wealthy Americans, and his pandemic policies that Biden said were \"especially devastating to Black communities.\" Then, capitalizing on Trump's comment in last month's debate in which he referenced \"Black jobs,\" Biden said, \"Folks, I know what a Black job is: it's the Vice President of the United States! I know what a Black job is: the first Black president in American history, Barack Obama!\" as audience members roared in approval. In a notable comment amid some calls for him to step aside for someone else to lead the ticket, primarily Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden said of her, \"And by the way, she's not only a great vice president, she could be president of the United States.\" At one point, Biden took aim individually at Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Trump's newly selected running mate, seeking to tie him, as he has done with Trump, to Project 2025. \"They're lying about their Project 2025. They want to deny your freedom: the freedom to vote, have your vote counted. They'd impose a nationwide ban on abortion. His new vice president, if you ever had any doubt, man, just take a look at what he's been saying,\" Biden said. \"They want to prosecute their political enemies, they want to cut Social Security and Medicare.\" Earlier in his remarks, though it's become the focus of his campaign's messaging in recent weeks, Biden flubbed his delivery of his anti-Project 2025 argument multiple times, at one point calling it \"this project of 2024\" and another \"their program on 2025.\" At another point, when announcing his administration's proposal to place a 5% cap on rent increases, the president seemed to have lost track of the teleprompter's words, pausing and leaning in before falsely saying the cap would be \"no more than 55 dollars.\" About two minutes later, Biden correctly said it was 5%. These flubs come as Biden's every comment under an intense microscope after last month's poor debate performance. Though focus on the president's age has taken a temporary backseat with the attempted assassination of Trump and the addition of Vance to the Republican ticket, Biden alluded to the difficult two weeks he has endured after his debate performance. \"Harry Truman was a president who was often counted out. He was also known for something else,\" Biden said. \"The story goes, Truman said, 'You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.' Well, guess what? Last couple weeks – after the last couple weeks, I know what he means,\" Biden said. Biden has seen softening support among Black voters in recent polls, with Democrats fearing their base will sit out the election, but the attendees at Tuesday's event were largely in his corner, welcoming him with cheers of \"Four more years!\" Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president and chief executive of National Council of Negro Women, one of those who spoke ahead of Biden, said Black women were going to stay in engaged. \"In the spirit of Bethune and Height this morning,\" she said, referencing civil rights icons Mary McLeod Bethune and Dr. Dorothy Height, \"we are here to light under the feet of this country and say, 'not on our watch.\" \"Black women, we're going to do our part,\" Arline-Bradley continued. \"Black women, we're going to do our part to save democracy again. We're going to have women on the ballot, again. We're going to organize the voters again.\" Arline-Bradley later adding, \"And Black women we will never be silenced ever, ever, ever again.\"","summary":"He hit back his rival's claims and policies but avoided personal attacks.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-1st-major-speech-after-trump-shooting-accuses/story?id=111998836","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/89012f9d-716c-42f4-b85b-26b5eba413ca/biden-gty-jt-240716_1721170419719_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:18:15","author":"Fritz Farrow,Gabriella Abdul-Hakim,Will McDuffie","authors":["Fritz Farrow","Gabriella Abdul-Hakim","Will McDuffie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":251936356,"title":"Watch “Borat 2” star Rudy Giuliani fall at the Republican National Convention","text":"Rudy Giuliani — star of one of the most memorable sequences in the two-time Oscar-nominated sequel Borat Subsequent Moviefilm — took a tumble at the 2024 Republican National Convention. The 80-year-old disbarred lawyer and former mayor of New York City was captured Tuesday on video as he fell on the floor of Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum on the second day of the conservative political event, according to footage shared to X by Spectrum News producer John Park. Park's post indicates Giuliani fell \"during a walk-through on the floor\" at the RNC, while Taylor Popielarz, a reporter at Spectrum News, also shared to social media that Giuliani was \"holding an Osmo camera and continued filming once he was back on his feet.\" In photographs from the scene of Giuliani's accident, the state abbreviation for Ohio's delegates, \"OH,\" can be seen on the back of a row of chairs Giuliani landed amongst — a fitting exclamation for his surprise spill. Giuliani, who previously served as a legal adviser to Home Alone 2 star Donald Trump, attended the convention to cover it as part of his Rudy Giuliani Show on the FrankSpeech platform. Prior to leading the comical clip, Giuliani had a small (apparently unwilling) role in the second Borat film, which saw Academy Award-nominated actress Maria Bakalova portray the titular character's (Sacha Baron Cohen) teenage daughter, Tutar, who attempts to seduce Giuliani following what the politician seemingly didn't know was a mock press interview. In the scene, Giuliani appears to reach his hand down his pants, though he ultimately called the movie moment a \"complete fabrication\" and said he \"was tucking in\" his shirt. On Monday night at the RNC, Trump named author, Hillbilly Elegy subject, and junior senator for Ohio J.D. Vance as his running mate; and model Amber Rose appeared on stage to voice support for Trump, two days after a man opened fire on the former president during a campaign event in Pennsylvania.

Usha, 38, would be the possible first Indian American second lady, if Trump and Vance win the November 5 general elections against incumbent President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Usha joined her 39-year-old husband on Monday as he accepted the nomination in an acclimation vote by delegates — after the couple jubilantly greeted convention attendees. The daughter of Indian immigrants, Usha grew up in a San Diego suburb. Friends from her childhood and adolescence described her as a “leader” and a “bookworm.” As of 2014, she was a registered Democrat. Usha, a graduate of Yale Law School, is a civil litigation attorney at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. She has clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. She also clerked for Justice Brett Kavanaugh while he was a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Usha and Vance met at Yale Law School where the two were studying. She would be the first Hindu spouse of a vice president — and would succeed second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a vice president, The New York Post reported. The Vance couple was married in 2014 in Kentucky and were blessed by a Hindu priest at a different event, according to a New York Times profile. The Vances have three children: sons Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter named Mirabel. Usha said she was reluctant to gain greater public exposure in a “Fox & Friends” joint interview with her husband last month, the Post reported. JD Vance’s successful 2022 Senate campaign was “an adventure,” she said, but “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now.” “But I believe in JD and I really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life — where we’re open,” she said in the interview. Vance said that his wife “is not a Christian” but was “very supportive” of his deepening faith, the report added. Asked about the challenges of an interfaith marriage, she said, “There are a lot of things that we just agree on, I think, especially when it comes to family life, how to raise our kids. And so I think the answer really is, we just talk a lot.” Prior to law school, she got a bachelor’s degree in history from Yale and a master of philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge. Usha has not appeared in many public events but has made some appearances on talk shows. On Monday, she was seen along with Vance on the floor of the Republican National Convention as part of the Ohio delegation. People said Vance tends to keep his children out of the spotlight, though he has made references to his children over the years.

The president plans to propose legislation that would enforce term limits on justices and a code of ethics for justices, The Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter. Biden announced the changes during a Zoom call on Saturday, July 13 with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “I don’t want to prematurely announce it—but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court,” Biden said, according to a transcript of the call viewed by the Post. The president said he was working with “constitutional scholars” for the last three months on possible changes to the high court—meaning Biden’s office was working on these changes before the Supreme Court’s controversial decision to find former President Donald Trump immune from criminal prosecution for “official acts” taken while holding the office. Biden strongly condemned the court’s decision on July 1, but declined to take questions from reporters at a press conference the same day. It is unclear exactly when Biden plans to announce this legislation to the public. The White House did not return a request for comment from the Daily Beast. Biden could be looking for momentum going into the Democratic National Convention in August, as members of his own party continue to pressure him to drop out of the race after a lackluster debate performance with Trump—who was officially named the Republican nominee on Monday. Biden’s push for term limits and an enforceable code of ethics for justices echoes criticism from Democrats after Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose lavish vacations to Bali and stays at a manor owned by billionaire and conservative donor Harlan Crow in 2019, which were first reported by ProPublica in 2023. Thomas finally acknowledged the trips in June, but claimed they were “inadvertently omitted” from his previous disclosure reports. Earlier in June, Justice Samuel Alito also came under fire for allegedly flying the “Appeal to Heaven” flag and an upside-down American flag at his homes in New Jersey and Virginia—both symbols used in recent years by far-right movements.","summary":"Kent Nishimura/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Joe Biden is planning to announce major reforms to the Supreme Court in upcoming weeks, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe president plans to propose legislation that would enforce term limits on justices and a code of ethics for justices, The Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBiden announced the changes during a Zoom call on Saturday, July 13 with members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-goes-to-war-with-scotus-after-clarence-thomas-and-samuel-alito-ethics-scandals","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_39/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721175265/GettyImages-2161709911_lddaez","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:15:44","author":"Zachary Folk","authors":["Zachary Folk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":251936072,"title":"How Trump's VP pick JD Vance could help court billionaires, tech donors","text":"How Trump's VP pick JD Vance could help court billionaires, tech donors JD Vance, former President Donald Trump's running mate, may be key to bringing in big donations from billionaires and Silicon Valley titans that could be instrumental to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.

The famous New York Times picture now where you literally see the vapor trail of the bullet coming out of the backside of his ear. It's hard to believe it could've been so much different. I can't even imagine what that would've meant for this country,\" Eric Trump said.Eric Trump said the former president's hearing is fine and that he is \"in great spirits.\"Asked about the recent revelation that U.S. intelligence had also detected an Iranian plot against his father, Eric Trump did not seem surprised.\"We've been hearing this from Iran, including from the leaders directly, for years at this point,\" he said. Eric Trump cited the assassinations of Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's Quds forces, and former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as reasons why Iran would want retribution against the former president.Eric Trump didn't provide any details about security changes since the assassination attempt, but he did praise the response by Secret Service agents who protected his father on stage Saturday. Still, he wants accountability for the failures that led to the shooting.\"The men and women on that stage in that moment are the greatest people in the world,\" Eric Trump said. \"I know many of them personally and they're phenomenal, phenomenal individuals. And I'm sure they'll get to the bottom of it, but there'd better be real accountability. You can't have ex-presidents taking bullets through the ear.\"He said the fact that snipers and rally attendees spotted the shooter as early as 26 minutes before the first shots were fired is \"infuriating.\"\"I grew up competing in the shooting sports. I know that world very, very well, and a rifle shot at 130 yards is like a four-inch punt, right? You don't, you don't miss it if you're competent,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not an overly mushy person ... but, you know, somebody was watching down on him because it could have gone very, very differently.\"Eric Trump said it was \"hard to believe\" the Secret Service would overlook a building as large as the one the gunman used to gain his vantage point. \"A big building that size, 130 yards away from a podium, from an elevated position — you don't need to be a security expert to realize that you might want to have somebody up there.\"In the interview, Eric Trump also expressed enthusiasm about his father's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, of Ohio. He said he was excited to see Vance take on Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming vice presidential debate, which will be hosted by CBS News.\"I think JD Vance will be putting a bag of popcorn in the microwave and, you know, he is ready to go,\" Eric Trump said. \"Believe me, he's not gonna be backing away from that debate.

This is our chance to continue the incredible pro-Israel legacy of the most pro-Israel president in history — Donald J. Trump,” he said, to cheers. “They said [it] couldn’t be done. … He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. They said it couldn’t be done, but he weakened the Iranian regime. They said it couldn’t be done, but he delivered the historic Abraham Accords, bringing us closer to peace in the Middle East. With President Trump we will repair and rebuild the U.S.-Israel relationship that has deteriorated after four disastrous years under President Biden.” Brooks noted that Biden is still withholding some weapons from Israel — and the crowd booed. “There is only one pro-Israel party,” Brooks concluded, “and it’s the Republican Party. “And here at home, under Donald Trump, we will put a stop to the rising tide of antisemitism. President Trump will bring back law and order, so that American Jews can once again wear a kippah and walk the streets without fear. President Trump will stop the mobs on college campuses so Jewish students feel safe when they go to class.” He also said Trump would “stand up to the Hamas sympathizers and the Sqaud,” referring to anti-Israel Democrats in Congress. “Am Yisrael Chai!” he concluded, using a Hebrew rallying cry that means “The people of Israel live.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Matt Brooks, the CEO of the Republican Jewish Coalition&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Matt Brooks from the Republican Jewish Coalition predicts that Donald Trump will support Israel and put an end to violent groups promoting anti-Semitism. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/matt-brooks-from-the-republican-jewish-coalition-predicts-that-donald-trump-will-support-israel-and-put-an-end-to-violent-groups-promoting-anti-semitism/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/Israeli-flag-Trump-RNC-Getty-1024x768.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:12:42","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":251936060,"title":"'Devastated' fans mourn Tenacious D's cancelled tour after Trump assassination joke","text":"Fans of Tenacious D are \"devastated\" the band has cancelled the rest of their Australian tour in the wake of a controversial onstage joke about the attempted assassination of former US president Donald Trump.

The near-murder of Trump was immediately damning for the Secret Service–whose entire purpose is to protect prospective, current, and past presidents (and their families)–but the blunder has become even more mind-boggling as more details have surfaced. That included the Secret Service conceding Tuesday that local cops were inside the very building where Thomas Crooks, 20, perched himself on a rooftop—less than 150 yards from Trump, a distance most proficient shooters consider an almost certain kill zone. Yet, those agents were unable to stop Cooks from climbing onto the roof, pulling out a rifle, and rattling off multiple shots toward the former president—one going through his ear, and another fatally striking a former fire chief who was attending the rally with his wife and daughter. Below, The Daily Beast has broken down the most egregious of the Secret Service’s failures known to date at Saturday’s rally in Pennsylvania. Pre-rally prep Things were bad from the jump for those tasked with protecting the former president. His rally was just outside Butler, a town of 13,000, and was in a mostly-open field with only a handful of buildings inside and outside the event’s official perimeter. Among those was the Agr International building, where Crooks infamously laid flat and opened fire at Trump. Despite advance teams arriving at the rally site as early as July 10 to prepare, the Agr building was designated to local law enforcement instead of the Secret Service—supposedly because it fell outside the event’s official perimeter and which was a usual practice, according to Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. That decision baffled security and military experts. The retired sniper Dallas Alexander, whose Canadian Special Operations team is responsible for the furthest confirmed kill in history, said in a video statement Sunday that Crooks was in the “most fucking obvious” place for a gunman, adding that even a “seventh-grader” would’ve known to have the rooftop on lockdown. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who’s been ordered to appear before Congress next week to attest for the security disaster, claimed Tuesday morning that the Secret Service didn’t have their own snipers on the building’s roof because it was “sloped,” which made it a safety issue. That excuse doesn’t add up, however, since Secret Service snipers were photographed on an equally sloped—if not more sloped—roof at the rally, behind Trump’s stage. Slipped through the cracks Donald Trump’s rally was slated to begin at 6 p.m. local time Saturday, and the former president officially started his speech about five minutes late. Crooks had his first encounter with security at 3 p.m. Saturday during a security screening, CNN revealed. A rangefinder Crooks was carrying alerted personnel, who, according to CNN, kept an eye on him until he left the area. Crooks’ next moves are uncertain, but it is believed he returned to his car to grab his rifle. He apparently used the building’s air conditioning system to climb on top of the building, a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Local law enforcement had their first encounter with Crooks 20 minutes before Trump’s speech and deemed he was suspicious, Beaver County Emergency Services revealed Tuesday. How, then, did Cooks continue to walk just outside the rally’s perimeter unchecked? That question remains unanswered, despite local officials admitting that officers at the scene deemed Crooks appeared so “suspicious,” that a local cop had taken a photo of him more than 15 minutes prior to the rally’s scheduled start. Failure to respond Chilling videos from the rally showed that some attendees spotted Crooks crawling onto the roof well before he was in a position to open fire, calling into question authorities’ response time to literal screams that there was a gunman on the roof. In one clip, obtained by The Washington Post, a man can be heard screaming “Officer! Officer!” as others point toward the Agr building and Crooks, a full 86 seconds before he fired his first shot. Others appeared to note that Crooks was on the roof more than two minutes before he opened fire at 6:11 p.m.—approximately six minutes into Trump’s rally spiel. “Look, they’re all pointing,” someone could be heard saying in a separate clip, as at least one police officer walked around the side of the building. “Someone’s on top of the roof.” “There he is, right there,” said another. “Right there, see him? He’s laying down!” Those clips have been backed up by multiple witnesses, who claimed they desperately tried to get police to stop Crooks to no avail. That included Greg Smith, who told BBC News he and others tried to alert police for “two or three minutes” that an armed man had reached the roof. The officers in the clip appeared to match the uniforms of the Butler Township Police Department, who was working in coordination with the Secret Service. Michael Slupe, the Butler County Sheriff, told local news outlets that moments before Crooks opened fire, one of his deputies reached the ledge of the Agr building’s roof and spotted Crooks, but had to let go of the ledge and retreat when the 20-year-old pointed his rifle at him. Just 12 seconds before the first shot was fired, an officer can be seen walking around the building Crooks was atop of. In other videos from those pivotal final seconds, people screamed that a man on the roof had a gun. MilkBarTV compiled some of these cellphone videos and stitched together a timed montage—a chilling four-and-a-half minute clip that shows the chaotic moments before a former U.S. president was nearly gunned down. The clip showed that seemingly everyone outside the rally’s perimeter knew a shooter was about to open fire. Yet, the scores of snipers and Secret Service agents inside the perimeter did nothing to stop him. “They were looking at him while he was looking at them,” one senior law enforcement official told CNN, describing how Crooks met eyes through the rangefinder with one of the four counter-sniper teams. While Crooks wasn’t stopped before pulling the trigger, the Secret Service said he was killed by a sniper—who fired a single shot—within seconds after opening fire. The aftermath Harsh criticisms of the Secret Service and its director, Kimberly Cheatle, arrived within hours. Joe Biden called for an independent investigation into what went wrong, which was echoed by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who called the incident a security “failure.” Security experts and lawmakers from both parties have agreed with Mayorkas’ assessment, saying they’re perplexed at how Crooks, a relative nobody, was able to come within an inch from murdering a former U.S. president. Cheatle has been ordered to testify in front of Congress on Monday to answer about her agency’s failings. As of Tuesday evening, the Secret Service is yet to concede outright that it was its own failures that led to Saturday’s disaster. Instead, the agency has insinuated the fault lies with local police who failed to secure the outside perimeter. Regardless of who’s to blame, the attack exposed long-standing issues within the Secret Service. Jason Chaffetz, who was chair of the House Oversight Committee in 2015 when it penned an investigative report on Secret Service security failures, has long called for the Secret Service to hire more agents. On Sunday, he called the Trump rally a “catastrophic failure.” “We did all these investigations and did an extensive report so this would never happen again,” he told the Post. “It’s as if they paid no attention to the bipartisan recommendations.”","summary":"Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty ImagesDonald Trump was mere inches from being shot dead Saturday in what’s been widely characterized as the Secret Service’s biggest failure in decades.\n\nThe near-murder of Trump was immediately damning for the Secret Service–whose entire purpose is to protect prospective, current, and past presidents (and their families)–but the blunder has become even more mind-boggling as more details have surfaced.\n\nThat included the Secret Service conceding Tuesday that local cops were inside the very building where Thomas Crooks, 20, perched himself on a rooftop—less than 150 yards from Trump, a distance most proficient shooters consider an almost certain kill zone.

It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The DNC first released a summary of its new agenda on July 13. The platform touts President Joe Biden’s policy positions and presents a “bold, progressive agenda” for a potential second Biden administration. “We have a product to be proud of, we have a president to be proud of, we have an administration to be proud of, and let’s get out there and finish the work,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D) said after the vote. The platform positions include growing the economy, lowering family costs, tackling climate change, securing energy independence, closing the “racial wealth gap,” investing in small businesses, restoring Roe v. Wade, gun control, securing the border, and “strengthening American leadership worldwide.” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison celebrated the platform—which “incorporated a diverse set of expertise and perspectives”—in a statement. “The breadth and depth of this platform is rooted in our collective experience and reflects a bold agenda that affirms Democrats’ commitment to protecting fundamental freedoms,” he said. Related StoriesUS Secret Service Director Says No ‘Credible’ Threats Against DNC, RNC7/8/2024DNC Invests $2 Million to Win Key Down-Ballot Races in 11 Non-Battleground States6/10/2024 Democrats say their plan is to rebuild the economy “from the middle out and bottom-up, not the top down.” The summary mentioned “breaking ground” on more than 57,000 projects across 4,5000 communities throughout the country while pushing for $877 billion in private funding from companies to build new factories. “We’ll keep fighting to pass the PRO Act, to give everyone the right to organize for better pay, benefits, and working conditions, and we’ll finally raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,” the committee wrote. The plan also involves “expanding access to capital” for Americans to start and grow small businesses. Democrats also hope to make the tax code “fairer for the middle class while making the wealthy and big corporations finally pay their fair share.” Americans earning less than $400,000 a year will see no tax increases, “period,” they added, suggesting that the plan would cut the federal deficit by $3 trillion in the next 10 years. “Lower costs is Democrats’ No. 1 economic priority,” the committee wrote, while noting President Biden’s efforts to cap insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare. The summary also mentions the president’s efforts to forgive student loans for millions of borrowers.Climate and EnergyDemocrats hope to continue President Biden’s climate agenda, which they describe as the “most aggressive … in history.” “Democrats will scale up solar, wind, and geothermal projects made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act and invest in clean energy R&D to build America’s legacy as a nation of new frontiers and possibilities,” the committee wrote. The plan involves expanding the clean-energy workforce, with a goal of tripling the size of the American Climate Corps within 10 years, which President Biden launched in 2023 to “mobilize a new, diverse generation of clean energy, conservation, and resilience workers.” Democrats also hope to scale back “tens of billions of dollars” in oil and gas subsidies. President Biden “is positioning America to lead the future—energy independent, resilient, innovative, and strong.”Border SecurityThe 2024 party platform calls for President Biden to “secure our border, fix our immigration system, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and others” as a continuation of work the DNC says he has done since “his first day in office.” The plan emphasizes the president’s efforts to find across-the-aisle solutions to the border crisis, including the bipartisan border bill that twice failed in Congress earlier this year. Democrats also touted the president’s recent executive order on limiting border crossings, which they stated cut illegal crossings “by over 50 percent.” “In President Biden’s second term, he will push Congress to pass legislation that is consistent with our values as a nation,” the committee wrote. Democrats say that legislation must secure the border, reform the asylum system, expand legal immigration, and “keep families together by supporting long-term undocumented individuals, including Dreamers.” They suggest “lasting, comprehensive reforms” for border security “require congressional action.”Other Platform Initiatives The 2024 Democratic Party platform also involves gun control, including “universal background checks, safe storage requirements, and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.” Democrats also want to “strengthen democracy” and advance a “unity agenda” to tackle challenges common to all Americans, including fighting the opioid epidemic, addressing the mental health crisis, “holding Big Tech accountable,” helping veterans and combatting the cancer crisis. The party also hopes to restore abortion access at the federal level after the 2022 Dobbs decision reversed Roe v. Wade, sending the issue back to the states. The platform will be displayed during the Democratic National Convention next month, which starts on Aug. 19. Democrats approve a new party platform every four years, with the previous 92-page platform being approved on July 27, 2020.RNC PlatformRepublicans approved their new party platform on July 15, the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his vice presidential pick, concluding months of speculation. This choice marks a significant step in Vance’s political journey, characterized by his rise from a challenging upbringing to becoming a key figure in American politics. Early Life and Education Born on August 2, 1984, Vance grew up in a lower-class family in Middletown, Ohio. He experienced financial and familial hardships, vividly recounted in his best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.” Vance’s upbringing in the declining Rust Belt profoundly influenced his worldview, shaping his political ideologies. Despite these challenges, Vance excelled academically, earning a dual degree in political science and philosophy from Ohio State University and a J.D. from Yale Law School. At Yale, he met his future wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, a corporate litigator and former clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and then-appellate Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Military Service and Impact JD Vance’s formative years were not only shaped by his challenging upbringing but also by his service in the Marine Corps. Vance served as a Marine combat correspondent during the Iraq War, an experience that significantly influenced his views on U.S. foreign policy. Despite initially supporting the war, JD Vance later became a vocal critic, describing his initial support as a mistake. He has since used his platform to advocate for a more restrained and strategic approach to military engagements, emphasizing the need for honesty and accountability from the foreign policy establishment. Legislative Achievements and Bipartisan Efforts Since his election to the Senate, JD Vance has demonstrated a willingness to work across the aisle on key legislative initiatives. Notably, he co-sponsored a rail safety bill with Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) following the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and collaborated with former Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on legislation to recover executive pay from large failed banks. These efforts showcase JD Vance’s pragmatic approach to governance, aiming to address pressing issues through bipartisan cooperation. Despite these collaborations, Vance maintains a strong conservative stance on many issues, balancing his legislative agenda with his core political principles. Political Career and Ideology Vance’s political career began in earnest when he won the 2022 GOP Senate primary in Ohio, bolstered by former President Trump’s endorsement. Since joining the Senate in January 2023, Vance has established himself as a staunch populist conservative, often aligning with pro-Trump factions within the Republican Party. His voting record reflects his commitment to conservative values, with the Heritage Foundation rating him as voting with conservative positions 93% of the time. Ukraine Stance and Foreign Policy A significant aspect of Vance’s political stance is his criticism of continued U.S. support for Ukraine. He has consistently voted against Ukraine aid packages, arguing that Europe should shoulder more of the financial burden. In an April op-ed for The New York Times, Vance described the notion that Ukraine will reclaim all its lost territory as “fantastical,” advocating for a more sustainable approach to the conflict. In contrast, Vance supports aid to Israel, emphasizing the strategic importance of missile-defense parity. He also advocates for a strong focus on countering China’s growing influence, asserting that the U.S. must prioritize its resources effectively. Personal Life and Legacy Vance’s personal story is one of resilience and transformation. His memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” not only brought him national attention but also highlighted the struggles of the white working class in the Rust Belt. The memoir was adapted into a Netflix film in 2020, further cementing his place in American cultural and political discourse. Married to Usha Chilukuri Vance, the couple has three children: Ewan, Vivek, and Mirabel. Vance’s rise from a troubled childhood to the national political stage underscores his commitment to addressing the issues facing America’s working class. Conclusion As J.D. Vance prepares to join Donald Trump on the 2024 presidential ticket, his journey from Middletown, Ohio, to national prominence serves as a testament to his determination and evolving political vision. His stance on key issues like Ukraine aid and his focus on China highlight the distinct approach he brings to the Republican platform. Vance’s story continues to inspire and provoke discussion as he steps into the national spotlight.","summary":"JD Vance rose from Rust Belt upbringing to populist conservative senator and vp candidate with a critical stance on Ukraine aid and China.","url":"https://newsblaze.com/usnews/politics/jd-vance-vp-candidate_198142/","image":"https://newsblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/jd-vance-speaking.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:04:32","author":"Alan Gray","authors":["Alan Gray"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.364},{"id":251935532,"title":"Tenacious D’s Kyle Gass Dropped by Agent Following Trump Assassination Joke","text":"Tenacious D‘s Kyle Gass has been dropped by his agent Michael Greene of Greene Talent in the wake of Gass’ onstage joke about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Greene confirmed with Billboard. The news was first reported by Rolling Stone. The joke came during a Tenacious D show at the ICC Syndey Theatre in Sydney on Sunday (July 14) after Gass’ Tenacious D partner Jack Black implored him to “make a wish” when Gass was presented with a birthday cake on stage. Gass responded, “Don’t miss Trump next time,” a reference to the attempted assassination of the former president (and newly-crowned Republican presidential nominee) during a rally in Butler, Pa. on Saturday (July 13). The tragic incident resulted in the death of one audience member and led to serious injuries for two others. After video footage of Gass’ joke began circulating online, Black wrote via Instagram on Tuesday (July 16) that he had been “blindsided” by the comment and that “and all future creative plans” for the duo would be put on hold. “I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,” he added. Gass concurrently released his own statement apologizing for the remark, saying, “The line I improvised onstage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone. What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgement. I profoundly apologize to those I’ve let down and truly regret any pain I’ve caused.” Tenacious D and its Australasia tour producer, Frontier Touring, canceled a total of six shows in the wake of the backlash: Newcastle (July 16), July 18 (Brisbane), July 20 (Melbourne), July 22 (Adelaide), July 24 (Wellington) and July 26 (Auckland). As of press time, there is no word on whether the duo will still play five shows scheduled for October on its Rock D Vote Tour in U.S. swing states ahead of the presidential election. A representative for Gass did not immediately respond to Billboard‘s request for comment on this story. On Tuesday, Australian Senator Ralph Babet of the United Australia Party released a statement condemning Tenacious D and requesting that they “be immediately removed from the country.” He also called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to join him in denouncing the duo and asked Immigration Minister Andrew Giles “to revoke their visas and deport them immediately.” He added, “Anything less than deportation is an endorsement of the shooting and attempted assassination” of Trump. Trump took the stage on the first night of the Republican National Convention on Monday (July 15) with a bandage on his right ear, which was grazed by a bullet during the assassination attempt. The former president also announced Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his running mate Monday. To this point, authorities are still searching for a motive for the shooter, a 20-year-old registered Republican, who was killed by Secret Service snipers after firing off several rounds using an AR-15 rifle. Black and Gass formed Tenacious D in 1994 when both were members of The Actors’ Gang theater company. The duo has released a total of four studio albums and also starred in their own self-titled HBO series that ran from 1997 to 2000.","summary":"Michael Greene of Greene Talent confirmed that he no longer represents the musician/comedian.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/tenacious-d-kyle-gass-agent-trump-assassination-joke/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kyle-gass-billboard-pro-1260.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:03:38","author":"Chris Eggertsen","authors":["Chris Eggertsen"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":251936052,"title":"Biden says cooling political rhetoric doesn’t mean he’ll ‘stop telling the truth’ about Trump","text":"LAS VEGAS (AP) — President Joe Biden returned to the campaign trail on Tuesday for the first time since the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, continuing his calls to calm the divisive rhetoric on both sides but also arguing that doing so “doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth” about his Republican rival. Addressing the NAACP convention in Las Vegas, Biden said curbing political violence in the country should mean combating all kinds of bloodshed — including reducing police brutality and banning weapons like the AR-style rifle used in the weekend attack on the former president. “Our politics have become too heated,” Biden said. That didn’t stop him from tearing into Trump, though, listing why the former president’s administration was “hell” for Black Americans, including his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, skyrocketing unemployment amid early lockdowns and attempts to, as Biden put it, erase Black history. “Just because we must lower the temperature in our politics as it relates to violence doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told the crowd that often broke into chants of “Four more years!” The president is aiming to showcase his administration’s support for Black voters who are a tentpole of the Democratic coalition and of his personal political support. As part of his swing in Nevada, he’ll also participate in an interview with BET and address the Hispanic advocacy group UnidosUS, another crucial Democratic-leaning bloc. For the NAACP crowd, Biden seized on Trump recently referencing “Black jobs,” drawing big applause by joking, “I love the phrase.” “I know what a Black job is. It’s the vice president of the United States,” Biden said of Vice President Kamala Harris, who he added “could be president.” He also referenced Barack Obama as the nation’s first Black president, and his own appointment to the Supreme Court of its first Black and female justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Biden’s trip comes as Democrats have been engaged in a weeks-long crisis of confidence over his candidacy after his devastating debate with Trump last month. The president’s shaky performance inflamed voter concerns about his age, fitness for office and capacity to defeat Trump once again. Republicans, for their part, are demonstrating that they are more coalesced than ever around Trump amid their national convention in Milwaukee. The 81-year-old Biden has rejected a flurry of calls from within his party to step aside, restating his belief that he is the best-positioned Democrat to beat Trump. He has relied heavily on his support among Black and Latino elected officials, and was set to appear with many of them in Nevada. The president made indirect reference to unrest in his own party on Tuesday, recalling President Harry S. Truman famously saying, “If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.” “After the last couple of weeks, I know what he means,” Biden said. He said later, “hopefully, with age, comes a little bit of wisdom.” Biden also promised to use the first 100 days of a second term to oversee congressional approval of a dramatic expansion of voting rights — something he’s been unable to so far. He also renewed earlier promises to “end medical debt,” saying he was working with states to settle outstanding bills for care for “pennies on the dollar.” “I know the good Lord hasn’t brought us this far to leave us now,” Biden told the convention, offering overtly religious tones. Trump has tried to appeal to both Black and Latino voters, hoping to capitalize on Biden’s sagging favorability. While it’s not clear that the loss of enthusiasm for Biden has helped Trump’s approval with those groups, any marginal loss of support for Biden could prove pivotal in a close race. The president and his campaign hit pause on their criticisms of Trump in the immediate aftermath of the shooting Saturday at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate was injured in the ear, a rallygoer was killed and two others seriously injured. In an Oval Office address on Sunday night, Biden called on Americans to reject political violence and for political leaders to “cool it down.” In a Monday interview with NBC News he allowed that he made a “ mistake ” when he told campaign donors that he wanted to put a “bull’s-eye” on Trump, but argued that the rhetoric from his opponent was more incendiary. “Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?” Biden said. “Do you just not say anything because it may incite somebody?” NAACP President Derrick Johnson, in an interview with the AP, sidestepped questions about whether Biden should step aside as the Democratic nominee and whether the president, who often credits his place in the Oval Office to Black voters, could still inspire people to turn out for his candidacy. Johnson instead focused on the need for Black voters to hear “solutions” on issues like inflation, education and attacks on civil rights, which are among the top concerns for Black communities in this election. “We want to focus on the policy goals of whoever occupies the White House in the next term,” Johnson said. He added that Black voters would dismiss candidates “concerned with personality and sound bites.” Later, speaking at an economic summit hosted by Congressional Black Caucus Chair and Rep. Steven Horsford at the College of Southern Nevada’s campus in North Las Vegas, Biden announced that the regional housing authority and municipal officials would receive a $50 million federal grant to build 400 affordable housing units — playing up his attempts to lower rents in a state where housing costs are a critical political issue. The president also talked about his administration’s efforts to ease the effects of extreme heat on the workforce, while continuing to lay into his opponent in November’s election. “Trump says he doesn’t believe climate change is real. Maybe he should step out here in Vegas, where it’s 120 degrees, in his bare feet,” Biden said as the crowd hooted. Biden is also proposing to cap rent increases at 5% for tenants whose landlords own over 50 units. If landlords hiked rents by more than that, they would lose access to some tax write-offs. But doing that would require congressional approval that Biden is unlikely to receive with a House Republican majority. Trump has also used Nevada to float new economic policies. He said he would end taxes on the tips received by workers in the service-industry focused state, a concept that has since been endorsed by Nevada’s Democratic senators, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto.

The proposals under serious consideration include legislation to establish term limits for justices and establishing an updated code of ethics that would be binding and enforceable, a source said. The policies, which haven’t been finalized, may be rolled out in the coming weeks, which would be a new approach for a president who has long been skeptical of restructuring the Supreme Court. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. Biden told lawmakers in the Congressional Progressive Caucus during a virtual meeting Saturday that he had been consulting constitutional scholars on the matter for more than a month, according to a person familiar with the discussion. “I’m going to need your help to and advice on how we should be doing what I’m going to be doing there.

Two other sources told NBC News that Biden told the lawmakers he will come out for big reforms, without giving them details, but that members on the call understood him to be referring to term limits and ethics rules. The call took place Saturday before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. “Look, it’s not, it’s not hyperbole to suggest Trump is literally an existential threat, an existential threat to the very constitution of democracy we, we say we care about. And I mean if this guy wins, he’s not, and now, especially with that Supreme Court giving him the kind of breadth of — I don’t need to get into the Supreme Court right now — anyway, but I need your help,” Biden said. Changing the structure of the Supreme Court would require Congress to make a new law. That’s extremely unlikely while Republicans control the House, as the party is pleased with the 6-3 conservative majority it has built on the high court. But the proposals could become a useful messaging device for Biden on the campaign trail. And if Democrats sweep the election, they may have a fighting chance of passing. Democrats have rallied voters against the Supreme Court, citing unpopular rulings like the elimination of federal abortion rights and a spate of recent reports detailing apparent ethical lapses among some of the justices. Last month, Senate Democrats sought to pass Supreme Court ethics legislation but ran into Republican opposition. In the House, Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Don Beyer, D-Va., have lintroduced legislation that would impose 18-year term limits for future justices, ultimately creating vacancies to fill during every four-year presidential term and preventing retirements for partisan reasons. Khanna praised Biden for warming up to the idea, noting that he first introduced term limits legislation in 2020. “Since then, we have been advocating for the president to champion this reform,” Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday. “It is a big step for him to now call for commonsense term limits for the court and a judicial code of ethics.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is preparing to endorse significant proposals to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden informs lawmakers he is considering significant Supreme Court changes first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-informs-lawmakers-he-is-considering-significant-supreme-court-changes/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Biden-tells-lawmakers-he-is-weighing-big.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:02:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":251936306,"title":"US rock band cancels tour after Trump assassination joke (VIDEO)","text":"US actor and musician Jack Black claimed he was “blindsided” by his bandmate Kyle Gass’s controversial remark on stage in Australia, after public backlash forced him to put the group’s “creative plans” on hold indefinitely. The comedy rock duo Tenacious D, composed of Jack Black and Kyle Gass, was giving a concert in Sydney on Sunday when Gass was presented with a cake for his 64th birthday and Black asked him to “make a wish.” “Don’t miss Trump next time,” Gass replied, eliciting several bursts of laughter and applause from the audience. Black said “thank you” but later claimed he was “blindsided” by the comment. The video of the incident went viral, sparking an avalanche of angry reactions. X owner Elon Musk called it “evil,” and United Australia Senator Ralph Babet demanded the band be deported immediately. On Tuesday, Black announced that he felt it was no longer “appropriate” to continue the tour and has put the group’s other “creative plans” on hold. ”I would never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form,” the comedian said, adding that he was “grateful to the fans for their support and understanding.” Gass, who was already dropped by his talent agency, apologized for his “improvised” line, calling it “highly inappropriate, dangerous, and a terrible mistake.” “I don’t condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone,” he stated in an Instagram post. “What happened was a tragedy, and I’m incredibly sorry for my severe lack of judgment.” The former US president and newly nominated Republican candidate Donald Trump narrowly escaped death at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, when an assassin’s bullet injured his ear. One spectator was killed, and two more were wounded before the attacker was fatally shot by Secret Service agents. Many Republicans argued that the violence was incited by his critics’ reckless remarks.","summary":"US actor and musician Jack Black has put Tenacious D’s “creative plans” on hold after his bandmate Kyle Gass’s controversial remark on stage \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/pop-culture/601182-jack-black-trump-assassination-joke/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.07/article/669709b82030271aef318c94.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:01:58","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.07},{"id":251935550,"title":"Biden, addressing NAACP, bashes Trump in bid to move beyond age questions","text":"LAS VEGAS — President Biden sought to turn his broader critique of political violence into a direct denunciation of Donald Trump on Tuesday, suggesting how he plans to move forward in the wake of an assassination attempt against the Republican presidential nominee that has upended an already tumultuous presidential race. “Just because we must lower the temperature in our politics … doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth,” Biden told hundreds of Black supporters in an animated speech that regularly bashed Trump on race issues. “Who you are, what you’ve done, what you’ll do — that’s fair game.

In an interview with ABC News's Jonathan Karl, Trump appreciated Biden and deemed their chat \"very nice.\" \"He couldn’t have been nicer,\" the Republican leader remarked. In an interview with Lester Holt of NBC on July 15, Biden was also questioned over his phone call—which he characterized as \"very cordial\"—with Trump following the shooting. \"I told him how concerned I was and wanted to make sure I knew how he was actually doing. He sounded good. He said he was fine. And he thanked me for calling him. I told him he was literally in the prayers of Jill and me, and I hoped his whole family was weathering this,\" Biden disclosed. Subsequently, Karl asked Trump if the near-miss gunshot wound to his right ear \"changed him.\" The former president, responded, \"I don’t like to think about that, but, yes, it has an impact.\" Trump expressed his amazement at the number of people, who had contacted him following the assassination attempt, including well-known figures who had previously criticized him. Although he assured that his right ear was healing well, Trump hoped that the bandage would come off before he had to speak at the RNC. Meanwhile, his opponents have called for unity and peace in the aftermath of the terrible shooting. Biden addressed the country on July 14 with a message emphasizing the need to be calm and collected, as per Variety. “We cannot...we must not go down this road in America. The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated,” Biden said in the Oval Office address, adding, “It’s time to cool it down.” Additionally, he conveyed his concerns for Trump and extended condolences to the family of Corey Comperatore, the 50-year fireman who passed away after trying to protect his family from stray bullets. The horrific political violence is just one more startling incident in an unprecedented presidential contest between Biden and Trump. “Politics must never be a literal battlefield — or god forbid, a killing field,” Biden added. He also referenced other instances of political violence, such as the Jan 6 Capitol riots and the attack on former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband. Biden and his allies have also pulled down campaign commercials that targeted Trump and urged Americans to be calm, as reported by ABC 7. On Truth Social on July 15, Trump also appealed for unity, but went on to ditch the messaging as he started to write about the legal difficulties against him, using terms like 'witch hunt', 'January 6th hoax', and 'the Manhattan D.A.'s Zombie Case'.","summary":"In an interview with Lester Holt of NBC on July 15, Biden was also questioned over his phone call, which he characterized as &#34;very cordial.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/heres-what-trump-said-about-biden-when-he-called-in-to-check-on-him-post-assassination-attempt","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/705350/uploads/0cc526b0-434b-11ef-b97e-af2436dbcabf_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:01:01","author":"INQUISITR,Suchitra B","authors":["INQUISITR","Suchitra B"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":251936008,"title":"Greek-American Elected Officials on the Attempted Assassination of Trump","text":"NEW YORK – The Greek-American elected official, regardless of party affiliation, made condemnatory statements regarding the assassination attempt against the former U.S. president, Donald Trump. In her extensive statement to the media, Republican Congresswoman representing the 11th District of New York Nicole Malliotakis spoke of the “shocking and heartbreaking” event and also thanked the Secret Service for their efforts. “It is both shocking and heartbreaking that someone attempted to assassinate President Trump,” Rep. Malliotakis said. “In the process, innocent bystanders were also shot, including one who sadly succumbed to injuries. While we are still waiting to learn more about the shooter and a full investigation into how this horrifying act was able to occur, we are thankful for the Secret Service officers who ushered President Trump to safety and neutralized the situation in a matter of seconds. The way President Trump has been targeted and vilified has gone too far. This act of political violence and pure hatred is unacceptable. As Americans, we can disagree but should respect opinions from across the political spectrum and engage in respectful dialogue about the important issues facing our country today. The attempted assassination of any political candidate is unacceptable and only further divides our nation.” For his part, Greek-American Republican Congressman Gus Bilirakis, in his initial post on X, expressed his support for Donald Trump and his family, also thanking, in turn, the Secret Service. “We are praying for President Trump and his family in the wake of a truly terrifying incident. Thank goodness he is safe, and thank you to the Secret Service for a quick response.” Democratic members of Congress Chris Pappas, John Sarbanes, and Dina Titus also expressed their shock at the incident, with a common point of reference being praise for the Secret Service and law enforcement officials who took immediate action. Rep. Sarbanes said: “We are all shaken by today’s tragic incident. Violence of this kind or any kind is unacceptable in America. We are grateful to law enforcement for their quick action to secure former President Trump’s safety and protect those attending the rally.” At the state level, Republican New York State Assemblyman and Staten Island GOP Chairman Michael Tannousis in his social media post said: “My thoughts and prayers are with President Trump and I applaud the brave men and women of the Secret Service and law enforcement who acted quickly in this instance and who put their lives on the line every day to protect the public.” New York State Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris, a Democrat and fierce critic of Trump, emphasized that violence has no place in American political life. “No matter how divided we are as a nation or how serious our differences, this cannot be the way. Our political disagreements should be resolved peacefully at the ballot box, not by violence. In this difficult moment, we must strengthen our commitment to democracy as a solution,” said Senator Gianaris.","summary":"NEW YORK – The Greek-American elected official, regardless of party affiliation, made condemnatory statements regarding the assassination attempt against the&#8230; Continue reading Greek-American Elected Officials on the Attempted Assassination of Trump\n\n\nThe post Greek-American Elected Officials on the Attempted Assassination of Trump appeared first on The National Herald.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/greek-american-elected-officials-on-the-attempted-assassination-of-trump/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/omogeneis-vouleytes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-17 00:00:41","author":"Antonis","authors":["Antonis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":251935836,"title":"Politics and potatoes: What Trump told Idaho delegates at GOP National Convention","text":"Donald Trump points to the Idaho delegation at the Republican National Convention. | Courtesy Doyle Beck MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Two days after surviving an attempt on his life by a would-be assassin, Donald Trump made a surprise appearance Monday night at the Republican National Convention and stood in front of the Idaho delegation. As delegates yelled, “Idaho loves Trump!” the former President pointed toward them and said, “Potatoes. I want some potatoes,” before smiling and flashing a thumbs up. Trump was flanked by his newly-announced vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, his sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump and conservative media host Tucker Carlson among others. “Our delegation had seats right next to where they brought him into the arena,” said Diane Jensen, an Idaho delegate to the Republican National Convention and former Bonneville County GOP Central Committee First Vice Chairwoman. “… I could have reached out and touched him. You know, Secret Service was being very cautious and keeping him very safe and secure, but he was so gracious, waving at everybody saying, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” Some members of the Idaho delegation had created a special flag combining the U.S. and Idaho flags with ‘We love Trump’ emblazoned across the bottom. “We held that flag up, and then we all yelled at him, and that’s when he pointed,” said Bonneville County resident Doyle Beck, a delegate to the Republican National Convention and one of four Idaho electors for the Electoral College. “It was spontaneous, particularly to him, but the delegation kind of planned (their yell).” Beck said there was a different feeling at the convention following the attempt on Trump’s life Saturday. “The people are more resolute, more determined, and very, very appreciative and thankful that we survived the attempt,” Beck said. “Can you imagine where we would be today had we lost Trump?” Several representatives from eastern Idaho are serving as delegates to the Republican National Convention – including Idaho National Committeeman Bryan Smith, National Committeewoman Cindy Siddoway, Jensen and Beck. Idaho has 32 total delegates. Jensen described the excitement palpable at the convention, “We had a great rally last night for Donald Trump. He made his first public appearance since his assassination attempt, and it looked like he was in good spirits. He was appreciative of the standing ovation and much applause that he received last night.” The delegates shared their reaction to the selection of Vance as Trump’s running mate. “We were excited to learn about his VP pick, and we think he’s going to be a great asset to the ticket,” Jensen said. “He’s new enough in the game, … but he’s very strong in what he believes, and I think he’s going to support President Trump all the way and help us carry out his agenda.” “He’s young, he’s teachable, and he’s improved,” Beck said. “He was a one-time a critic of Trump turned a fan. That’s impressive someone has that kind of character to form an opinion, see reality and change their opinion.” Jensen attended a National Federation of Republican Women luncheon Tuesday featuring Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “We’ve met lots of great, like-minded people from all over the country, and found out that, specifically, Bonneville County is not as extreme as people like to think that we are. We’re just right in line with the rest of the country,” Jensen said. She reported the changes to the Republican party platform were unanimously adopted. “The only thing that we knew was this (platform) was directly approved by President Trump. They wanted to make the platform simpler and more specific in some different areas,” she said. Trump will address the entire convention Thursday evening. “Whenever Trump’s mentioned, the arena erupts in applause — and whenever we talk about the assassination attempt and how he stood up after that attempt and raised his fist in defiance and said, ‘Fight! Fight! Fight!’” Jensen said. “That’s been the chant through the whole convention so far, you know, people raising their fists, saying, ‘Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight for freedom!’ You know, people have more resolve than ever to make this country great again.”","summary":"MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin — Two days after surviving an attempt on his life by a would-be assassin, Donald Trump made a surprise appearance Monday night at the Republican National Convention and stood in front of the Idaho delegation.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) warned in a recent private meeting that Democrats stand to lose everything this election so long as President Joe Biden remains at the top of the ticket. Schiff delivered his warning to donors during a meeting on Saturday, which occurred prior to the attempted assassination on former President Donald Trump’s life. Schiff feared not only that Democrats would lose the White House but that they would also lose the down-ticket races in the House and Senate. “I think if he is our nominee, I think we lose,” Schiff said at the meeting, according to a transcript obtained by the New York Times. “And we may very, very well lose the Senate and lose our chance to take back the House.” Since Schiff made these remarks before the attempted assassination on Trump, it remains unclear if he still holds to those views. As Breitbart News reported, the Democrats quieted all movements within the party to replace Joe Biden as the nominee following the failed assassination attempt, the focus now shifting toward unity in the wake of a historic moment unseen in over 40 years. “We’ve all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency,” one senior Democrat lawmaker was quoted as saying to Axios. Since that fateful day, President Biden has given no hint or indication that he plans to step down, with calls for him to do so only coming from social media. According to the New York Times, during the fundraiser attended by Schiff and other Democrats, the congressman said that Biden and his staff had “been generally unwilling to engage the views of outside pollsters and political experts and urged them to do so.” “At least one donor who attended the event and listened to Mr. Schiff’s remarks said he left dejected, believing that Mr. Biden’s chances of winning were now slim and that they should concentrate [on] giving their time and money to downballot candidates in the hopes of salvaging something for the party,” it added.

U.S. intelligence learned of an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump several weeks ago but have not found any ties with the shooting at a Pennsylvania rally where Trump was grazed by a bullet and a spectator was killed, three U.S. officials first told CNN, which was later reported by CBS and NBC News. \"Upon learning of the increased threat, NSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting,\" a national security official told NBC News. \"USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump,\" the official added. \"All of this was in advance of Saturday.\" Trump's campaign would not elaborate on whether it was made aware of the Iran threat. \"We do not comment on President Trump's security detail. All questions should be directed to The United States Secret Service,\" the campaign said Tuesday in a statement. The National Security Council added that there is no known link between the rally shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by Secret Service, and the Iran threat. \"The investigation of Saturday's attempted assassination of former President Trump is active and ongoing,\" NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement. \"At this time, law enforcement has reported that their investigation has not identified ties between the shooter and any accomplice or co-conspirator, foreign or domestic.\" Trump is not the only target of the Iranian assassination plot, according to reports. John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also receiving tightened U.S. government security detail due to threats from Iran, which are \"likely in retaliation\" for the U.S. military's January 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian military's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. On Tuesday, the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations denied the Iranian assassination plot, according to CNN. \"These accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. From the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani,\" a spokesperson for the mission told CNN. \"Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice.\" While Trump frequently holds outdoor rallies, the former president and his new vice presidential running mate J.D.

Biden was greeted by chants of \"four more years\" as he spoke to the NAACP's annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters. Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it - Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,\" Biden said. He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to \"Black jobs\" at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27. \"I am all in,\" said Biden. The attempt on Trump's life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity. \"Our politics got too heated,\" said Biden. The campaign's strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions. Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election. \"People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they're also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,\" Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics. On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a \"time of testing.\" In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term \"bullseye\" in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call. The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party's candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term. At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job. \"Hopefully today I've demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here's what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn't brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do,\" he said. On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party's nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump's running mate.

They did most of my USO tours,\" he added, which made it more comfortable for him. Greenwood said that on the opening night of the convention, \"which I was not advertised to be at, I wanted to make sure that I was able to excite, incite and electrify the room at the RNC.\" And \"when the president walked into the room, full of power, and then had his VP choice [Sen.

Reverence, he said, because at that point — after the shocking events of Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman fired at Trump during his rally and the U.S. Secret Service had to rush Trump off the stage — people recognized that \"he is alive.

The first was John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison died one month into his term. The most recent was Gerald Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon’s resignation. Now in 2024, the spotlight is growing on the two parties’ vice-presidential picks — Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, and Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio — due to the advanced ages of the two presidential candidates as well as an assassination attempt on GOP nominee Donald Trump on Saturday. The vice presidents who ascended to the top job have been behind some significant moments in U.S. history, including Reconstruction, the dropping of atomic bombs to end World War II, and the signing of the Civil Rights Act. “For most vice presidents, succession is something that you have to think about and plan for, but it doesn’t happen,” said Joel Goldstein, a historian and expert on the vice presidency. “But when it happens, you’ve got to be ready.” The four vice presidents during the 19th century who ascended to the top job were never elected to a presidential term in their own right, while in the 20th century, four of the five vice presidents who ascended would go on to win the White House as incumbents. Goldstein said early on, party leaders chose running mates and produced tickets that represented opposite wings of a party, or even different parties. That would change in the 20th century, when vice presidential picks had much more impressive resumes and political profiles of their own. Here are the 9 vice presidents who unexpectedly became president -- and their moments of power. John Tyler Tyler’s presidency is largely forgettable, but his path to the job had a major effect on American government. He became president when William Henry Harrison died of pneumonia a month after his inauguration in 1841. There was a brief debate over what the Constitution said should happen next. Was the vice president supposed to serve as acting president or as the actual president? Tyler believed the latter, and he took the oath of office, setting an important precedent. He was never elected to a full term, and he later supported the Confederacy in the Civil War. Millard Fillmore Fillmore was another accidental president, ascending to the job after Zachary Taylor became ill and died in 1850. Fillmore’s attempts to mediate disagreements over slavery led to the Compromise of 1850, which allowed California to join the union as a free state but also expanded efforts to recapture escaped slaves. Fillmore was never elected to a full term. Andrew Johnson Abraham Lincoln was fatally shot at Ford’s Theater in 1865 near the end of the Civil War, making Johnson the first of four vice presidents to ascend to the presidency after an assassination. Johnson oversaw Reconstruction, which was the reunification of the Confederate states into the Union. The process is widely viewed as falling short by failing to achieve equal rights for freed slaves. Johnson became the first president to be impeached during a controversy over removing the secretary of war. Although he wasn’t removed from office, his bid for a full term failed. Chester Arthur Arthur took office after the assassination of James Garfield in 1881. One of his legacies is the civil service system, which shielded some federal government positions from being used for political patronage. He also signed legislation banning the immigration of people from China. Arthur was not nominated for a full term of his own. Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt became the youngest person to serve as president at 42 years old when William McKinley was shot and killed in 1901. Roosevelt became known as one of the country’s most impactful and energetic presidents, pushing forward construction of the Panama Canal and expanding protection of national forests. He won a full term in 1904 and later tried unsuccessfully to win another term in 1912 by creating his own political party. Calvin Coolidge Coolidge became president after Warren Harding died of a heart attack in 1923. He became known for his circumspect leadership, limiting government intrusion into the economy during years of growth. Coolidge was reelected in 1924 but chose not to run for another term in 1928. Harry Truman Harry Truman had been vice president for only a few months when Franklin Delano Roosevelt died in 1945. He soon learned a grave secret — the U.S. government had developed atomic weapons. Truman oversaw the dropping of two bombs on Japan and the end of World War II. He narrowly won reelection in 1948 but dropped out of the race in 1952 when he was on track to lose the Democratic primary. Lyndon Johnson Johnson became president after John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade through Dallas in 1963. He finished Kennedy’s term and won the election in 1964. Johnson enacted sweeping legislation to expand civil rights and social services, but he became increasingly unpopular because of the Vietnam War. Johnson surprised the nation by deciding not to seek reelection in 1968. Gerald Ford Ford was appointed vice president by Richard Nixon in 1973 when his first vice president, Spiro Agnew, resigned after pleading guilty to tax evasion. The following year, Ford became president as Nixon stepped down when it appeared likely that Congress was going to impeach him and remove him from office over the Watergate scandal. In his first speech after taking the oath of office, Ford told Americans that “I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers.” Ford is remembered for the controversial decision to pardon Nixon of any crimes he committed. Ford never had an opportunity to serve a full term, and he was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election. —- Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.","summary":"Why vice presidential picks matter: significant moments in history and transfers of power&nbsp;&nbsp;The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/vice-presidents-kamala-harris-jd-vance-ford-23ff742679273d6ab134664959588088","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/f6b7f87/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+293/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F%5B1%2F19%2F%2C%20104%2C%2093%2C%2051%2C%2016%2C%2024%2C%2053%2C%2054%2C%20-104%2C%20103%2C%2037%2C","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:52:00","author":"Chris Megerian","authors":["Chris Megerian"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":251936130,"title":"Exclusive — Majority Whip Tom Emmer Details How Republicans Will Expand House Majority","text":"House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), the former NRCC chairman, told Breitbart News in an interview on Tuesday how Republicans will expand their House majority. Emmer spoke to Breitbart News Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Boyle at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. During the interview, Emmer, the former National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chairman, explained how Republicans will expand the House GOP majority with former President Donald Trump leading the way. He first explained that many traditionally Democrat demographics are increasingly becoming receptive to Republican messaging and GOP candidates. “Republicans are at 220, let’s manage people’s expectations. While this could change, because traditional Democrat voters, black voters, Hispanic voters, Asian voters, liberal Jews, are now available to a Republican message and a Republican candidate. That’s going to take time for that transition to take place,” Emmer said. The Minnesota Republican explained that there used to be roughly 85 swing congressional districts, meaning that it could swing five points in favor of Republicans or Democrats, depending on the election cycle. Now, he said, there are roughly 51 swing districts, and a large House majority would consist of roughly 230-plus members. However, Emmer said that Republicans have many seats that could very well play into Republican hands with Trump leading the way, and a more favorable electoral environment. Emmer listed many possible swing districts that could very well flip in Republicans’ favor, including: New York’s 18th congressional district, which is represented by Rep. Pat Ryan (D-NY). Alison Esposito, a New York City police officer, who ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, won the district by three points during the gubernatorial election two years ago. Maine’s second congressional district, which is represented by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME). Austin Theriault, a state senator and former NASCAR driver, “fits” the district, according to Emmer. Connecticut’s fifth district is represented by Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-CT), and Emmer said was the “closest race last cycle.” George Logan lost by .4 percent last cycle. Emmer said Logan has raised lots of money for this cycle, and Hayes is bad at constituent services. Emmer emphasized that many of these seats are “Trump seats,” or seats that Trump won, which includes Maine’s second district and Pennsylvania’s eighth district, which is represented by Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-PA). Boyle said that even if a “quarter” of these districts go in Republicans’ favor, they will boost their majority. “We’re going to expand our numbers,” Emmer said. Emmer also credited Trump for hosting many tele-town halls during the midterm elections, which helped flip 15 swing districts. The Minnesota Republican said that Trump has “incredible energy.” Follow Breitbart News for more coverage of the 2024 Republican National Convention.","summary":"House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), the former NRCC chairman, told Breitbart News in an interview on Tuesdayt how Republicans will expand their House majority.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive — Majority Whip Tom Emmer Details How Republicans Will Expand House Majority appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/07/16/exclusive-majority-whip-tom-emmer-details-how-republicans-will-expand-house-majority/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/Tom-Emmer-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:51:15","author":"Sean Moran","authors":["Sean Moran"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.117},{"id":251935380,"title":"Will Rollins: We cannot allow violence to define America’s next chapter","text":"As a federal prosecutor, I volunteered to help the Secret Service protect President Trump twice on his visits to Southern California in 2019. I didn’t volunteer because I agreed with his politics. I volunteered because if our leaders aren’t safe, our Constitution and our democracy aren’t either. This past weekend, Americans witnessed an extraordinary display of these values — plus incredible courage — when several Secret Service agents put their bodies directly into the path of more potential bullets that could’ve struck former President Trump. The agents’ selfless act wasn’t motivated by the red and blue of our national politics. It was motivated by the red, white, and blue of our stars and stripes. I developed an even greater personal appreciation for that principle during my first Congressional campaign in 2022, when law enforcement detained a man who said he planned to assassinate me. After speaking to the detective, I wondered if I made the right decision to trade a career where I’d helped federal agents respond to death threats for a job where I now received them. I viscerally understood how fear can stifle speech, debate, and, perhaps worst of all, the willingness to serve. That is why the attack on former President Trump was an attack on all of us. So was the horrific attack on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, along with Congressman Steve Scalise, Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, President Ronald Reagan, the Kennedys, Dr. King, and far too many others throughout our history. Congress needs to take immediate steps to increase security for our leaders, enact common sense gun safety reforms, and fix a broken online ecosystem that maximizes profits by amplifying divisive, violent, and conspiratorial content. Fortunately, in the days after the attack, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are already discussing enhancements to Secret Service protection for presidential candidates. Congress should come together and pass these bills and fully fund federal law enforcement agencies like the FBI and Secret Service as they complete their investigations and increase protective measures. We need similar enhancements to security for members of Congress, federal judges, and even political candidates running for higher-level offices. Americans also deserve a federal red flag law to enable law enforcement, including the Secret Service, to obtain a court order to take assault rifles away from those who threaten political violence before it happens. The attempt on President Trump’s life was carried out with an AR-15; yet another shooting that underscores why we need this commonsense reform. business owners and news outlets sued out of existence. These reforms would also encourage more public servants — and fewer content creators — to run for the House of Representatives. Congressman Calvert and I disagree about a lot. We may have our divisions, and this campaign will be spirited. But loving your neighbor — and your fellow Americans — should never depend on whether they plan to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump, Will Rollins or Ken Calvert, or the red team versus blue. The path back to our collective humanity lies in one direction — forward, as one country — and we cannot allow this violence to define America’s next chapter.

The speech came just hours after former President Donald Trump announced that Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) would join him on the Republican presidential ticket. Vance has been one of a handful of Republican lawmakers who has consistently supported organized labor and taken a critical approach to corporate power. “Anti-union groups demanded the president rescind his invitation,” O’Brien said in his speech. “The Left called me a traitor. This is precisely why it’s so important for me to be here today. Think about this. I must be doing something correct if the extremes in both parties think I shouldn’t be on this stage.” O’Brien, the first leader of the Teamsters union to address a Republican convention, also noted that he has worked with several Republican lawmakers on legislation, including Vance, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), and Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY). “The Teamsters and the GOP may not agree on a lot of issues, but a growing group has shown the courage to sit down and consider points of view that aren’t funded by big money think tanks,” O’Brien said. The outreach to organizations like the Teamsters by a handful of members is evidence that the changes in the Republican Party’s coalition are driving real changes in policy. No longer is the party dominated by the highly educated white-collar class. Instead, it is a party that relies primarily on working-class blue-collar voters who were once the backbone of the Democratic Party’s coalition. Such an alliance requires the party to rethink its old views on trade, big business, and even its old hostility to organized labor. In an op-ed for Compact, Hawley noted that the Republican base is increasingly made up of union members and the party must listen to its voters rather than corporate benefactors. “​Republican elites may have sold out to Big Business in years past, but their voters never did,” Hawley wrote. “From Missouri to Ohio to Florida, states where Republicans compete and win are home to millions of working people who back the GOP. Many belong to unions or have friends and family who do. They get it: Unions are a vital piece of the fabric of a nation that depends on working people.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER If the GOP is going to be the party of the working class for the next generation and beyond, it must find room in its coalition for O’Brien, the Teamsters, and other labor unions whose members make up large swaths of the Republican electoral coalition.

It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further.","summary":"President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns that the justices are not held accountable\n\n\nThe post Biden seriously considering proposals on Supreme Court term limits, ethics code, AP sources say appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2024/07/16/biden-seriously-considering-proposals-on-supreme-court-term-limits-ethics-code-ap-sources-say/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Supreme_Court_Trump_Immunity_77623-669705b1a2685-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:47:43","author":"Associated Press,The Washington Post","authors":["Associated Press","The Washington Post"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":251934954,"title":"Trump’s Biggest Fans Ink Iconic Fist-Raising Photo on Their Bodies","text":"Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci’s photo of former President Donald Trump raising his fist just after surviving an assassination attempt has been a source of inspiration for many of Trump’s biggest supporters—with some going so far as to get the image inked onto their bodies permanently.

Dan said the moment was “emotional,” adding: “As an American it was gut-wrenching.” “It was like, I just hope he’s okay, you know, pray for him. “But when he put that fist in the air, that was it.

The hundred dollar bill blinding lady liberty signified the way money manipulates politicians—and the influence of companies like BlackRock, which Dan said “is pushing for something bigger than what’s going on with the war in Ukraine.” And finally, the handcuffs represent how “you’re pretty much enslaved to the government.” Dillon said Dan and him “wound up talking about [the assassination attempt] like the next day or so,” while working on the Statue of Liberty piece, “and he said he wanted it. ‘I was like, all right, bet, let’s do it.’” “It’s probably gonna wind up being one of the most iconic images ever. So definitely a good tattoo,” Dillion added. Dillon said his shop, Ink Therapy, tries to “stay away from a lot of political stuff because it’s inflammatory and the people we tattoo, we tattoo the extremes on both sides. I mean, like, we have people that get a bunch of 1776 tattoos and don’t tread on me. And then the next day, you know, we’re doing a bunch of rainbow equal signs, and so we tattoo both people.” Dan said he’s gotten a lot of compliments on the tattoo from fellow MAGA supporters online. “Of course, you have the, the other side that you know, will demonize me and look bad upon me,” he said, adding: “Their view doesn’t matter to me becauseI did this for America, I did this for Trump. I did this for a country.” “That’s what this statement is on my arm is, because I love America and I support Trump, and he supports America,” Dan concluded. James, who did not want to share his last name with the Daily Beast, also took the leap and had Trump’s visage permanently rendered on his body this week. He was hanging out on Saturday night with a friend, Tyler Jackson, when someone called them and told them of the news. “So then we had that on the news for probably, I would say 3-4 hours, and we kept seeing the same picture over and over and over,” said Jackson, who also happens to be a tattoo artist at Studio Ink in Maryland. “After that, I don’t know, the night got going, beers were kind of flowing to people and [James] was like, ‘hey, I would totally get that’ and I was like, ‘let's be one of the first ones to do it.’ So that’s what we did,” Jackson said. “We’re not that political. We just thought the picture went hard,” he added. “I said, he’s one of the greatest presidents we’ve ever had. And nobody in this world should have anybody attempt to assassinate them,” James said. “It’s not right.” An hour later, the picture was inked on James’s leg. The tattoo went viral. Jackson’s post on TikTok has over 386k views and his post on Instagram has over 28k likes, with both garnering thousands of comments. “Then the comments are, like, very political ... but it doesn’t bother me,” Jackson reflected. “You can’t shoot the messenger, you know what I mean?” “It’s my body,” James said of the comments criticizing him. “I had somebody comment on there and say, ‘hey, what about all the mass shootings and all this and that?’” “I said, you know what? Listen, I care about everything that happens like that when it comes to the children. I care about everything, if I could put every single child’s name on my body that that happened to, I would do it,” he added.","summary":"The Daily Beast/Joe Dillon/Tyler JacksonAssociated Press photographer Evan Vucci’s photo of former President Donald Trump raising his fist just after surviving an assassination attempt has been a source of inspiration for many of Trump’s biggest supporters—with some going so far as to get the image inked onto their bodies permanently.\n\nDan, who did not want to share his last name, is one of those Trump super-fans.

In turn, Orbis Business Intelligence is requesting damages, “double costs,” and attorney’s fees over what they complain is a “baseless” effort to keep them in a long-running private racketeering (RICO) lawsuit the 45th president originally filed against Hillary Clinton. The landscape in the litigation journey has taken a number of pitstops, sideways departures, and veering turns — but they all seem to be heading in the same direction. In 2022, Trump sued Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., former FBI Director James Comey, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, and several others, alleging a RICO scheme in which they targeted then-candidate Trump. The case was dismissed in September 2023, and Trump was subject to sanctions of roughly $1 million because the case should never have been brought to begin with, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks, a Bill Clinton appointee, ruled. The judge found that Trump’s lawsuit was nothing more than “a deliberate attempt to harass” a former political rival and those he perceived as enemies. Then came the appeals. In February of this year, Trump asked the 11th Circuit to toss the costly sanctions against him, arguing they were inapplicable and that the district court “abused its discretion” because he was never afforded the chance to remedy any of the various deficiencies in his claims. In June, Clinton and Orbis filed their own replies to the appeal. In those filings, the appellees variously argued the RICO lawsuit should finally and forever be bounced from the legal system — or that, in any event, the respective parties should be removed from the litigation — and that the sanctions award entered by the district court against Trump and his attorneys “was proper” and should stand. Trump filed a joint response to Clinton and Orbis in July. Now, Steele’s company has fired back once again. The sharply-worded second reply contains variations of a theme: repeatedly accusing Trump and his attorneys of fundamentally misunderstanding how the relevant law on point works. “Orbis is a unique party to this litigation insofar as it is the sole foreign party, and accordingly, using Trump’s own argument to the trial court, jurisdiction over it by the Florida federal court could only have been obtained through Florida’s long-arm statute or the RICO nationwide service provision,” the motion reads. “Orbis has singularly brought this Motion because of the frivolous appeal as to it given its unique situation, notwithstanding the utter lack of a legal or factual basis for Trump’s remaining arguments on appeal.” And, Trump knows his legal arguments are not going anywhere in legal terms, Steele’s company claims, but that’s not the point. The heart of the dispute, as Orbis sees it, is that Trump never served the company in the United States — but rather in London — as the U.S. Rules of Civil Procedure demand. Additionally, the company argues, they were improperly included in Trump’s appeal after the district court ruled they had never been properly included in the lawsuit in the first place. Finally, Orbis says, they did not waive any of those issues but rather “both permitted and required to address” the ongoing deficiencies in the arguments leveled by the former president. “Orbis is not challenging the effect of properly utilizing a nationwide service of process provision,” the second reply continues. “Rather, Orbis is arguing that Trump did not properly utilize a nationwide service of process where it did not serve Orbis in this nation. By attempting to serve Orbis in London, despite the dictates of the statute that it be served in the United States, the assertion that Trump will serve Orbis in another state is as remote as the assertion that Trump will state a RICO claim based on these facts.” On top of this, the company complains, Trump’s latest filing goes beyond procedural matters and “[i]n a final effort to deflect from his conduct in bringing a frivolous appeal, Trump attempts to argue the unproven allegations of his amended complaint.” All this, combined, Orbis argues, is a pattern of bad and intentionally bad behavior that supports additional sanctions on Trump. “Orbis remains focus[ed] on the issue upon which it moved — in a vexatious manner, Trump brought a frivolous appeal against it. Because Trump has not shown he did not, double costs remain warranted,” the filing concludes. “Orbis, respectfully requests that this Court award damages and double costs pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 and enter an Order for relief, including, but not limited to, an award of attorney’s fees.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft: A file photo from 04/05/23 shows former U.S. President Donald Trump.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump and Christopher Steele are once again engaging in a dispute. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/trump-and-christopher-steele-are-once-again-engaging-in-a-dispute/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-and-Christopher-Steele-are-slugging-it-out-yet-again.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:47:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.515},{"id":251935862,"title":"In NAACP speech, Biden denounces violence but resumes attacks on Trump","text":"United States President Joe Biden has returned to the campaign trail for the first time since his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, narrowly avoided an assassination attempt over the weekend. Speaking on Tuesday in Las Vegas, Nevada, Biden addressed the shooting directly, which killed a bystander and injured at least two others, as well as Trump himself. “Our politics have gotten too heated,” Biden said as he took the podium. “As I’ve made clear throughout my presidency, we all have a responsibility to lower the temperature and condemn violence in any form. We’ve gotta remember, in America, we’re not enemies. We’re friends. We’re neighbours. We’re fellow Americans.” But while he denounced political violence and polarisation, Biden nevertheless criticised Trump both implicitly and explicitly, calling out the Republican for his track record on the economy, reproductive rights, gun violence and other issues. “Just because our politics are very divided doesn’t mean we should stop telling the truth. Who you are, what you’ve done, what you will do — that’s fair game,” Biden said. Highlighting political violence Biden delivered his remarks on the fourth day of the national convention for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a prominent civil rights organisation in the US. The appearance came only three days after a 20-year-old gunman positioned himself on a roof in Butler, Pennsylvania, and fired an AR-15-style rifle at Trump as he spoke at a rally. The shooting heightened tensions ahead of a tightly fought US presidential race, set to culminate with election day on November 5. Biden, a Democrat, seeks to retain the presidency in a rematch of his 2020 race against Trump. But in the aftermath of the shooting, Biden temporarily suspended television advertisements attacking the Republican leader, as both candidates made calls for unity. The Democratic incumbent reprised that theme in his speech to the NAACP convention, albeit with some biting remarks for his Republican rival. “We have to say with one voice that violence is not the answer. That’s what we should rally around as a nation. That’s the unity I’m talking about,” Biden said. After repeating his offer of prayers to the Trump family, Biden quickly pivoted to the question of violence against the Black community — an issue he implied Trump was weak in. Biden drew a stark contrast between the outpouring of support after the Trump shooting and the vitriol that faced Black election workers after the 2020 election and Black police officers present at the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. He also blasted Trump for his response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man in Minnesota who died after a law enforcement official kneeled on his neck for more than nine minutes. “You understand, if you’re going to talk about standing against violence, you must stand against all violence. You must stand against violence perpetrated against presidential candidates in Pennsylvania,” Biden said. “The violence perpetrated against George Floyd in Minnesota. Against Black veterans and police officers like Eugene Goodman on January 6. And Black election workers, like Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in Atlanta. We have to stand against the violence and intimidation of white supremacy.” Biden particularly underscored Trump’s response to the Floyd murder. Speaking to the crowd at the NAACP gathering, he said: “When you peacefully protested George Floyd’s murder, Donald Trump called for the National Guard to go after you. What in the hell is the matter with this man?” A critical voting bloc Black voters represent a key constituency for the Democratic president. In 2020, Black residents in South Carolina were credited with reviving Biden’s campaign in the Democratic primaries, ultimately giving him the boost he needed to claim the party nomination. And in the general election that year, Black voters turned out overwhelmingly for Biden, with 92 percent casting their ballot for him. But in this year’s race, Trump has tried to chip away at that base of support, and critics have called on Democrats to do more to ensure the concerns of Black communities are prioritised in the party platform. In Tuesday’s speech, Biden played up the $16bn in funding his administration earmarked for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs). He also touted a dip in Black unemployment, warning that Trump’s economic policies could reverse those gains. The Democrat also reprised a much-mocked statement Trump made during the June 27 presidential debate, when the Republican referred to immigrants taking “Black jobs”. Critics, including at the NAACP, denounced that phrase as racist. “Folks, I know what a Black job is. It’s the vice president of the United States. I know what a Black job is. It’s the first Black president in American history, Barack Obama,” Biden told the NAACP convention, taking the moment to highlight the diversity of his administration. He also hinted at a greater role in the future for his vice president, Kamala Harris. “She’s not only a great vice president. She could be president of the United States.” Efforts to recover post-debate Biden, 81, has faced repeated calls to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, after a wobbly, stuttering performance at the June 27 debate. Harris has been floated as one of several possible replacements for him on the campaign trail. But Biden has maintained he will remain in the race, and he used the NAACP convention’s slogan this year — “all in” — to emphasise the point: “Are you all in? Because I’m all in.” Still, he acknowledged the pushback he has received on Capitol Hill, hinting that the criticism from within his own party has left him isolated. “[President Harry] Truman said, ‘You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.’ Well, guess what? After the last couple of weeks, I know what he means,” Biden said to the audience, which responded with chuckles. “So many of you had my back, and I think I’ve had yours as well, and I will never forget it.” Speaking from Las Vegas, Al Jazeera correspondent Rob Reynolds observed that Biden received a “very very warm and friendly reception” from the audience members in the convention centre, noting that they broke out in chants of, “Four more years! Four more years!” “It is clear that this is the constituency that Joe Biden needs,” Reynolds said of the speech. “This is an appeal to that crucial demographic, that crucial voting bloc, which has been by and large behind Biden for this period of crisis in his campaign. Very few if any Black public or elected officials have called upon Biden to step down, even when others were calling upon him to step down and abandon his candidacy after his somewhat disastrous June 27 debate performance against Donald Trump.” In the lead-up to the president’s remarks on Tuesday, NAACP president Derrick Johnson likewise underscored the Black community’s importance in the upcoming election. But he underscored that his group — considered the oldest civil rights organisation in the US — is fundamentally nonpartisan. “This election is not about candidate A versus candidate B, or political party A or political party B. We are nonpartisan, but we are political as hell, and we know this is a fight we must take on,” Johnson said in his speech. “Let’s stay focused not on the people but the policy priorities they represent and vote for those who align themselves with what’s in the best interest of our communities. And I can assure you, if you do that, it’s in the best interest of America.”","summary":"The Democratic president also made an impassioned appeal to Black voters, who have been a cornerstone of his campaign.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/16/in-naacp-speech-biden-denounces-violence-but-resumes-attacks-on-trump?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-16T221047Z_1389898788_RC2MW8AZETK1_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN-1721168506.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:47:04","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":251935984,"title":"Biden pledges he is ‘all in,’ criticizes Trump on policy","text":"LAS VEGAS >> President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was “all in” to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump’s record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival’s attempted assassination. Biden was greeted by chants of “four more years” as he spoke to the NAACP’s annual convention in Las Vegas, a major gathering of Black voters. Biden said he was grateful that Trump was not seriously hurt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday but roundly criticized him on a variety of fronts including his handling of the economy during the coronavirus pandemic. “Let me say it again because Trump is lying like hell about it – Black unemployment hit a record low under the Biden-Harris administration,” Biden said. He scolded Trump for initially contending that former President Barack Obama was not an American citizen and for his reference to “Black jobs” at the Trump-Biden debate on June 27. “I am all in,” said Biden. The attempt on Trump’s life on Saturday prompted the Biden campaign to pull its television ads, call off verbal attacks on the former president and focus instead on a message of unity. “Our politics got too heated,” said Biden. The campaign’s strategy previously was to focus on tough criticism of Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy and to highlight his failure to admit his 2020 election loss and his felony convictions. Now, it is trying to calibrate a less pugilistic message that still strikes a stark comparison between the two candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest U.S. civil rights organization, represents a key constituency for the Democratic Party. While Black voters turned out heavily for Biden in 2020, polls have shown waning support for him from the constituency in this election. “People are concerned about the price of gas, price of bread, but they’re also concerned with their growing knowledge around Project 2025,” Derrick Johnson, the NAACP president, told Reuters on Monday, referring to a set of conservative policy proposals that have become a lighting rod for Trump critics. On Sunday, Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office to ask Americans to lower the political temperature, and recommit themselves to resolving their differences peacefully. He said the Nov. 5 presidential election will be a “time of testing.” In an interview with NBC News, Biden said on Monday it was a mistake for him to use the term “bullseye” in reference to Trump during a recent donor campaign call. The president postponed a trip to Texas on Monday, where he was expected to speak on the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at the Lyndon B. Johnson presidential library. White House officials hope the Trump assassination attempt will ease pressure on Biden to step aside as his Democratic Party’s candidate in response to concerns about his mental acuity and stamina to govern for another four-year term. At the end of his remarks in Las Vegas, Biden addressed the criticism that he is too old for the job. “Hopefully today I’ve demonstrated a little bit of wisdom. Here’s what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job. And I know the good Lord hasn’t brought us this far to leave us now. We have more work to do,” he said. On Wednesday, Biden is scheduled to speak to Latino leaders at the UnidosUS Annual Conference also in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans are gathered in Milwaukee for the party’s nominating convention that kicked off Monday with the selection of U.S. Senator J.D. Vance as Trump’s running mate.","summary":"LAS VEGAS >> President Joe Biden promised Black voters on Tuesday that he was &#8220;all in&#8221; to seek reelection on Nov. 5 and assailed Donald Trump&#8217;s record as president, in his first political speech since his Republican rival&#8217;s attempted assassination.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/16/breaking-news/biden-pledges-he-is-all-in-criticizes-trump-on-policy/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_2024-07-16T233852Z_876246046_RC2NW8AVQYNZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:46:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":251935016,"title":"In Vance, Trump picks a like-minded isolationist on foreign policy","text":"Donald Trump’s selection of Sen.

Biden unveiled the proposal, which would require approval by Congress, following an earlier pledge during his State of the Union address in March to rein in soaring housing costs across the country. “Rent is too high and buying a home is out of reach for too many working families and young Americans, after decades of failure to build enough homes,” the president, fresh off a disastrous debate performance and looking to shore up support among Democratic voters, said in a statement. “I’m determined to turn that around.” Under the plan, landlords would either need to cap rent hikes at 5% a year or lose out on federal tax breaks. The rule, which would last through the end of 2026, would only apply to landlords who own more than 50 apartments. That works out to an estimated 20 million units, almost half the country’s rental market, officials said. It was unclear how many Bay Area apartments, many of which are already subject to state and local rent control laws, would be covered by the federal cap. The proposal, coming as Biden trails former President Donald Trump in the polls, is unlikely to get serious consideration during an election year. And even as high housing costs have become a growing concern for voters nationwide, Democrats would likely need to win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress this November for the plan to have a chance at becoming law. Still, local advocates, who’ve long railed against corporate landlords for what they describe as unfair rent hikes, lauded Biden’s plan. “In the Bay Area, where the housing crisis is acutely felt, these measures are crucial,” Kate O’Hara, executive director of the East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy, said in a statement. “We need robust rent control policies to protect our communities from the predatory practices of corporate landlords.” “I think it would help renters nationally,” agreed Donel Fontil, a renter in Contra Costa County “I absolutely support the proposal.” According to researchers with the Bay Area Equity Atlas, nearly half of renters in the region spend more than 30% of their income on rent, classifying them as “rent-burdened” by federal standards. The median cost of an apartment available for rent in the region tops $2,500 a month, according to data from Apartment List. Even so, Bay Area rents haven’t spiked nearly as quickly as in the rest of the country as inflation has taken hold, in part due to the region’s roughly 3% population decline since the start of the pandemic. In June, local rents rose 0.6% from the same time last year, compared to 5.1% nationwide, according to federal data. How big an effect Biden’s rent cap would have on Bay Area renters would largely depend on whether their city already has a local rent control law on the books. The region’s three major cities, San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco, all have rent restrictions, as do a handful of smaller cities, including Richmond, Mountain View and East Palo Alto. While most of those rent caps are at least as strict as the proposed 5% federal limit, California law mandates that local rent control can only cover older apartment buildings. Biden’s plan, however, would appear to cover many newer units. It would only provide an exemption for new construction. A state law enacted in 2020 also caps rent increases for older apartments in California at 5% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. The California Apartment Association, which opposes Biden’s plan, said adding additional renter protections would only further discourage developers from building more housing. Experts agree the state needs many more homes for people across a range of income levels if it hopes to bring down housing costs. “Rather than implementing a policy that has been shown to make housing shortages worse, leaders in Washington, D.C., should focus their efforts on ideas that will help fight our housing crisis,” said Tom Bannon, CEO of the association, in a statement, pointing to increasing federal rental subsidies and tax incentives for home builders. Opponents of rent caps also cite research showing such restrictions can reduce the number of available apartments and diminish overall affordability as tenants stay in rent-controlled units longer and some landlords decide to stop leasing properties. “Rent control is not a particularly effective way to help the families who need help with living expenses,” said Kelly Snider, a professor at San Jose State University’s Department of Urban and Regional Planning. “It’s sort of like a thin blanket that covers everyone when really you want thick blankets for the people who need it.” Biden’s proposal comes as local advocates have launched campaigns to put rent control on the November ballot in Berkeley, Redwood City, San Pablo, Pittsburg and Larkspur. At the state level, voters will be asked whether to repeal the law that prohibits cities from enacting rent control on newer apartment buildings and single-family homes. Snider with San Jose State said it was encouraging to see the president now also bringing housing policy up for debate after the federal government has largely ignored the issue in recent decades. “Anything that gets the conversation to go a little bit deeper is not a bad thing,” she said.

Biden did call anew for Americans to lower the temperature of their heated politics, and sought a ban on the type of gun used in the shooting at his Republican opponent’s political rally. But as he returned to the campaign trail with a speech to crucial black voters at the NAACP advocacy group in Las Vegas, Biden did not hold back against Trump, who was injured in the ear. Biden said Trump’s presidency had been “hell for black Americans”. Cheers erupted as the 81-year-old lashed out at the Republican for talking about “black jobs” during their recent debate – the same debate during which Biden gave a stumbling performance that has plunged his candidacy into crisis. “Folks, I know what a black job is – it’s the vice-president of the United States,” said Biden, referring to his running mate Kamala Harris, the first black and female VP. But he opened his speech by saying he was “grateful” that Trump was safe after the shooting, and said he wanted to renew efforts to ban the kind of semi-automatic rifle that shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks used. “Join me in getting these weapons of war off the streets of America. An AR-15 was used in the shooting of Donald Trump … It’s time to outlaw them,” Biden said. Biden’s renewed political focus on Trump comes as calls by some Democrats for him to step down after the debate, briefly silenced by the shooting, resumed. The Democratic National Committee meanwhile is pushing ahead with plans to rush through Biden’s own nomination ahead of its convention in August, despite calls to postpone the process. Biden’s campaign insisted the virtual roll-call was necessary before the August 19 convention, as Republican-led Ohio had moved its filing date to August 7 and Biden risked not being on the ballot there. “It is our obligation as a campaign to make sure that President Biden is on the ballot,” Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told a press conference in Milwaukee. At the NAACP meeting in Las Vegas, there was widespread support for Biden staying on. “I found President Biden very full of energy,” said Donna Jackson-Houston, an NAACP member from California. She admitted that “I and many others had doubts” about Biden’s age and gaffes after the debate, but “he did a great job today convincing me”. Tony Fields from New Jersey said Biden’s speech was “very insightful,” adding that the bad debate was “just a moment that the President had that evening.” Biden, who says he “screwed up” due to jet lag and illness, forcefully defended his ability to do the job in a major US network interview on Monday night. “I’m old,” Biden told NBC. “But I’m only three years older than Trump, No 1. And No 2, my mental acuity has been pretty damn good.” Biden also defended his rhetoric about Trump after Republicans accused him of stoking divisions, although he admitted it was a “mistake” to tell donors in a call last week that it was “time to put Trump in the bullseye”.","summary":"The US president called for a ban on the type of gun used in the assassination bid, but did not hold back from political attacks on Trump.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3270722/joe-biden-back-campaign-mode-against-donald-trump-after-shooting","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/17/52c1006b-4325-402f-8d75-0f0f2e24ff81_c7ed7860.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/16/160724-Trump%20Tshirts%20NY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:39:57","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.055},{"id":251934692,"title":"Biden is carefully reviewing suggestions on Supreme Court term limits and ethics code, according to sources from the Associated Press.","text":"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for U.S. Supreme Court justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law amid growing concerns that the justices are not held accountable, according to three people briefed on the plans. It would mark a major shift for Biden, the former head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who has long resisted calls to reform the high court, though since taking office he has been increasingly vocal about his belief that the court is abandoning mainstream constitutional interpretation. The details were first reported by The Washington Post. Any changes would require congressional approval, which would be unlikely in a divided Congress. But with Republican nominee Donald Trump bragging about putting the three justices on the high court who are now part of the conservative majority, Biden’s call for major changes could help animate his voters. Biden is also considering calling for a constitutional amendment that would eliminate the broad immunity for presidents granted by the court in its most recent term, after Donald Trump claimed he was immune from prosecution for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters violently descended on the U.S. Capitol. The people were not authorized to speak publicly about proposals that have not been finalized and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The consideration of such proposals comes in response to growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that had stood for decades. There have also been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Clarence Thomas had accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposal. Biden, speaking in a weekend call with the Congressional Progressive Caucus, talked about the possibility, the people said. Biden often tells voters they need more Democrats in Congress and a Democrat in the White House to counter the impact of the conservative-leaning court, but these proposals would go much further. “And by the way, I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out. I don’t want to prematurely announce it, but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court and what we do and — I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” he said, according to a transcript of the call. About 2 in 3 Americans say they favor term limits or a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices, according to a 2022 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. According to June survey on the court, confidence remains low: 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the people running the Supreme Court. The survey found that 7 in 10 Americans think the high court’s justices are more influenced by ideology, while only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults think the justices are more likely to provide an independent check on other branches of government by being fair and impartial. In November, the court adopted its first code of ethics. The policy, agreed to by all nine justices, does not appear to impose any significant new requirements and leaves compliance entirely to each justice. Republicans have focused for years on remaking the federal judiciary and Supreme Court. When Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the majority leader, he refused to even meet in 2016 with Obama’s pick for the high court — current Attorney General Merrick Garland, a federal judge at that time. The nomination stalled until a Republican president, Trump, took over. Establishment GOP operatives backed Trump because of his pledge to name as many judges to the bench as possible. Their gamble worked. Trump ended up with three Supreme Court nominees and 54 federal appeals court judges, reshaping the courts for a generation. Democrats are now finally understanding the power of judges as a voting tool, and Biden has made judicial nominations a priority, appointing a record number of judges for a president at this point in his first term, including some of the most diverse picks yet to the judiciary. Biden often speaks about those accomplishments during his reelection campaign, but Democrats have pushed him to go further.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is seriously considering proposals to establish term&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden is carefully reviewing suggestions on Supreme Court term limits and ethics code, according to sources from the Associated Press. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/biden-is-carefully-reviewing-suggestions-on-supreme-court-term-limits-and-ethics-code-according-to-sources-from-the-associated-press/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/ZEzqDoSjgIrUU1-KSd7Nvrq7mbY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/5T7GH6XIHFA6ZIX2VCZBIABBRA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-16 23:36:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179}]}
