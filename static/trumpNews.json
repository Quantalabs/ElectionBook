But the margin for error is razor thin.\n\nHere are four potential hold-ups for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president’s desk for signing into law.\n\nA key sticking point throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a renewal of tax credits that make health insurance less expensive for 24 million Americans.\n\nSenate Republicans instead only agreed to grant Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the subsidies – something they had already offered weeks ago.\n\nAnd House Speaker Mike Johnson would not commit on Monday to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits.\n\nThis entails a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they torpedo the subsidies, health coverage premiums could rocket, handing Democrats a ready-made campaign issue for next year’s midterm elections.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, a conservative Republican congresswoman from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to warn that her party must ensure health insurance premiums do not spike.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the subsidies expiring by the end of December, Republicans are working out their plan.\n\nThey want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are proposing the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals – although the details are unclear.\n\nOut of power in Washington, where Trump’s Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their sails after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City.\n\nBut those victories, like the shutdown fight, have accentuated strategic tensions between the pragmatic and progressive, or left-wing, factions of the party.\n\nThe Democratic left is furious at defectors who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a capitulation to Trump.\n\nFrom that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a “horrific mistake”. California Governor Gavin Newsom called it “surrender”.\n\nCongressman Greg Casar of Texas, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, warned: “A deal that doesn’t reduce healthcare costs is a betrayal of millions of Americans counting on Democrats to fight for them.”\n\nHowever, centrist lawmakers like Jared Golden of Maine, who represents one of the most conservative districts in the nation held by any Democrat, may cross the aisle.\n\nGolden, who recently announced he won’t run for re-election, is likely to vote for the package, his office indicated to Axios, a political outlet, on Monday.\n\nAnother moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, could help get the Republicans’ spending plan over the line.\n\n“It’s past time to put country over party and get our government working again for the American people,” he posted on social media on Sunday.

But what stole the spotlight wasn’t just the setting -- it was the unexpected 20-minute call-in from President Donald Trump. The ESPN show, known for its blend of humor, sports insight, and spontaneity, suddenly became the center of national attention. McAfee, known for his unapologetic approach, faced both praise and criticism for putting Trump on air during such a symbolic broadcast.The conversation between McAfee and Trump stretched beyond football. While much of it revolved around the holiday, the military, and sports, the president also mixed in political jabs, personal boasts, and comments on the Washington Commanders’ name change. There was light-hearted sports talk too -- Trump discussed his Ryder Cup experience, expressed his dislike for the NFL’s new kickoff rules, and even joked about coaching strategies. The show had a pep rally feel, with McAfee prompting Trump to shout “oorah!” to the Marines, which he enthusiastically did.Pat McAfee defends his Veterans Day Trump interviewAfter wrapping up the segment, McAfee directly addressed the critics who questioned his decision to host Trump. His defense was firm and unapologetic. “I would like to say though, for the media people that are going to be mad about that happening, that’s the President of the United States. It’s Veterans Day. He’s the Commander-in-Chief. Obviously, if we’re going to have the opportunity to talk to him, we’re going to,” McAfee said.He further revealed that he had also reached out to former President Barack Obama to join the show, but scheduling issues prevented it. “As soon as we found out this was an opportunity, I reached out to President Obama as well and his team to potentially come on. Because of scheduling and conflicts, they were very kind and obviously sent incredible hope for the veterans and were thankful… but because of his schedule, he wasn’t able to do that. But I did reach out.”McAfee later added that he hopes Obama will appear in the future, and made clear that Trump’s inclusion was not about politics but about honoring the day. “Listening to him talk about sports is cool. Because I think he is a legit sports fan,” he said.Despite the online backlash - including one fan calling it “trash” - McAfee stood tall. As he put it, “It’s Veterans Day. He’s the Commander-in-Chief. Obviously, if we have the opportunity to talk to him, we’re going to... and he’s hilarious!”More NFL coverageWhy Jaire Alexander is stepping away from football after joining the Eagles in a shocking midseason twistAntonio Brown’s legal nightmare deepens with shocking Miami comeback and new mugshot revealCatch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

The strike force also includes guided-missile destroyers and various other vessels.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that the force will “bolster US capacity to detect, monitor and disrupt illicit actors and activities that disrupt the safety and prosperity” of the US and will help “disrupt narcotics trafficking” and criminal groups in the region.\n\nThe carrier group is joining substantial military forces already deployed in the region, including thousands of troops, a nuclear-powered submarine and military aircraft based in Puerto Rico.\n\nCollectively, they form the largest US presence arrayed in and around Latin America in decades.\n\nThe US has continued to launch strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. The Trump administration says the attacks are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.\n\nEarlier this week, the US announced it had conducted two additional strikes in the Pacific, killing six people.\n\nThe boat strikes have caused tensions to rise with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela, and led to concerns from some observers about violations of human rights and due process.\n\nEarlier in November, Trump downplayed suggestions he was planning to topple the Venezuelan government or start a war.\n\nIn an interview with CBS – the BBC’s US news partner – Trump said that “every single boat that you see that’s shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.”\n\nPushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: “I wouldn’t be inclined to say that I would do that… I’m not gonna tell you what I’m gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn’t going to do it.”\n\nAdvertise with the mоѕt vіѕіtеd nеwѕ ѕіtе іn Antigua!

In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.\n\nUntil February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.\n\nAlthough transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.\n\nA transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.\n\n“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.\n\nMittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.\n\nTSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.\n\nThe legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.\n\nOther transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.\n\nKai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.\n\nWorried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.\n\nRegan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.\n\n“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.\n\n“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.\n\nThe DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.\n\n“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”\n\nAirport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.\n\nTravellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.\n\nDeciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.\n\n“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.\n\nThe TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.\n\nFor passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.\n\nThe documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.\n\n“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”\n\nBeing unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.\n\nIt adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.\n\n“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/lawsuit-challenges-us-ban-on-transgender-tsa-officers-conducting-pat-downs/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/20101027125245133833_20-vp82xO.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 01:06:21","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":0.054},{"id":378043406,"title":"Lawsuit challenges US ban on transgender TSA officers conducting pat-downs  - Puerto Rico Tribune – Daily","text":"A Virginia transportation security officer has accused the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of sex discrimination over a policy that bars transgender officers from performing security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) news agency obtained internal documents explaining the policy change from four independent sources, including one current and two former TSA workers.\n\nThose documents explain that “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveller’s and officer’s biological sex.

The collectivist ideology stems from “The Communist Manifesto,” written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848.\n\nCommon principles of communist rule include the destruction of family structures, the abolition of traditional societal morals, and the outlawing of religions and spiritual liberty.\n\nIn the proclamation, Trump honors individuals “taken by regimes that sought to erase faith, suppress freedom, and destroy prosperity earned through hard work, violating the God-given rights and dignity of those they oppressed.”\n\n“As we honor their memory, we renew our national promise to stand firm against communism, to uphold the cause of liberty and human worth, and to affirm once more that no system of government can ever replace the will and conscience of a free people,” Trump wrote in the proclamation.\n\nHe highlighted the progress made since the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, ending the decades-long Cold War, while also cautioning against the subversive and persistent nature of tyranny.\n\n“New voices now repeat old lies, cloaking them in the language of ‘social justice’ and ‘democratic socialism,’ yet their message remains the same: give up your freedom, place your trust in the power of the government, and trade the promise of prosperity for the empty comfort of control,” the proclamation reads.\n\nStandard attempts to infiltrate Western societies include the use of disinformation campaigns, divisive rhetoric, the polarization of issues, and the manipulation of political movements to amplify pro-communist messaging, among other tactics.\n\nSigns promoting communist ideologies were visible at the recent No Kings rallies in Washington, and The Epoch Times also observed dozens of pro-communist banners and placards in protests surrounding the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nSome activists are calling for the elimination of private property and the dissolution of existing social structures. The messaging echoes the communist notion that political discord and chaos are necessary to create order.\n\nSlogans depict the movement as one for the workers and common people, a theme used to generate support, though the historical record repeatedly demonstrates the trajectory of communism toward totalitarian control.\n\nApproximately 1.5 billion people in five countries currently reside under communist regimes, with the majority in China and others in Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam.\n\nChinese Communist Party leaders have maintained strict control of the society since 1949, using imprisonment, forced organ harvesting, and murder, among other methods, to keep citizens in line.\n\nCommunist authorities uniformly seek to eradicate traditional values, aiming to elevate the regime to the highest authority on moral matters and to consolidate power at the top of the regime’s hierarchy.\n\nThe United States “rejects this evil doctrine,” and demonstrates a commitment to its founding principles, the president’s proclamation states.\n\n“No ideology, whether foreign or domestic, can extinguish them,” the proclamation reads.\n\n“We honor the victims of oppression by keeping their cause alive and by ensuring that communism and every system that denies the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will find their place, once and for all, on the ash heap of history.”\n\nAmong many nonprofit groups addressing communism, the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation is advocating for a “world free from the false hope of communism.”\n\n“Communism has always been, and will always be, incompatible with liberty, prosperity, and the dignity of life,” the organization said in a statement. “We remember that while it always promises equality and liberation, it has only ever robbed people of their most basic rights and freedoms.”","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/white-house-declares-anti-communism-week-honoring-100-million-lives-lost","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/image_92%28204%29.jpg?itok=b8TLoAPT","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.375},{"id":378042220,"title":"Morning Digest: G7 talks open in Canada amid Trump trade tensions; woman doctor arrested in J&K terror case linked to Delhi car blast, and more","text":"Top diplomats from G7 countries meet in Canada as trade tensions rise with Trump\n\nTop diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialised democracies are converging on southern Ontario as tensions rise between the U.S. and traditional allies like Canada over defence spending, trade and uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan in Gaza and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBihar registers 67% polling after Phase 2, highest since 1951\n\nBihar recorded nearly 67% turnout after the two phases of polling, 9.6% more than the previous Assembly election, the Election Commission of India said.

Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025, for the G7 foreign ministers meeting. (Mandel Ngan/Pool via AP)\n\nTop diplomats from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies are converging on southern Ontario as tensions rise between the U.S. and traditional allies like Canada over defense spending, trade and uncertainty over President Donald Trump's ceasefire plan in Gaza and efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war. Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in an interview with The Associated Press that \"the relationship has to continue across a range of issues\" despite trade pressures as she prepared to host U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday.\"We're tackling a range of critical issues with one main focus: putting the safety and security of Americans FIRST,\" Rubio said in a social media post. Anand also invited the foreign ministers of Australia, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and Ukraine.Anand said critical priorities for discussion Tuesday night include talks on advancing long-term peace and stability in the Middle East.Live Events\"The peace plan must be upheld,\" Anand said. The diplomats will meet with Ukraine's foreign minister early Wednesday. Britain says it will send 13 million pounds ($17 million) to help patch up Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches and Russian attacks intensify. The money will go toward repairs to power, heating and water supplies and humanitarian support for Ukrainians.U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who made the announcement before the meeting, said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"is trying to plunge Ukraine into darkness and the cold as winter approaches,\" but the British support will help keep the lights and heating on.Canada recently made a similar announcement. Canada's G7 hosting duties this year have been marked by strained relations with its North American neighbor, predominantly over Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports. But the entire bloc of allies is confronting major turbulence over the Republican president's demands on trade and various proposals to halt worldwide conflicts.One main point of contention has been defense spending. All G7 members except for Japan are members of NATO, and Trump has demanded that the alliance partners spend 5% of their annual gross domestic product on defense. While a number of countries have agreed, others have not. Among the G7 NATO members, Canada and Italy are furthest from that goal.Anand said Canada will reach 5% of GDP by 2035. There have also been G7 disagreements over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with Britain, Canada and France announcing they would recognize a Palestinian state even without a resolution to the conflict. With the Russia-Ukraine war, most G7 members have taken a tougher line on Russia than Trump has.The two-day meeting in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Lake Ontario near the U.S. border comes after Trump ended trade talks with Canada because the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S. that upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump's insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologized for the ad and said last week that he's ready to resume trade talks when the Americans are ready. Anand said she will have a meeting with Rubio but noted that a different minister leads the U.S. trade file. The U.S. president has placed greater priority on addressing his grievances with other nations' trade policies than on collaboration with G7 allies.\"Every complex relationship has numerous touch points,\" Anand said in the interview, \"On the trade file, there is continued work to be done - just as there is work to be done on the numerous touch points outside the trade file, and that's where Secretary Rubio and I come in because the relationship has to continue across a range of issues.\" Anand said Rubio asked her during a breakfast meeting in Washington last month to play a role in bringing countries to the table to ensure that Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan has longevity, including with a future Gaza reconstruction conference.U.S. officials said Rubio, who also may have meetings with other G7 counterparts and at least one of the invited non-G7 foreign ministers, would be focused on initiatives to halt fighting in Ukraine and Gaza, maritime security, Haiti, Sudan, supply chain resiliency and critical minerals.Canada's priorities include ending the war in Ukraine, Arctic security and security in Haiti. There will be a working lunch on energy and critical minerals that are needed for anything from smartphones to fighter jets. Canada has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onG7 SummitCanada Foreign Minister Anita Anandtrade tensions with TrumpUkraine energy supportdefense spending NATO\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

As first reported by The 74, Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Agriculture have announced the Arkansas Plate Initiative, a farm-to-table pilot program that aims to improve student nutrition while strengthening connections between schools and local farmers.The program will begin in 2026 with five public schools across the state and could later expand based on its success, according to a release from the governor’s office.Locally grown food, classroom lessonsThe Arkansas Plate Initiative will introduce “Arkansas Plate Days” each month, where participating schools serve meals made with food grown or raised within the state — including rice, poultry, and fresh produce.“Arkansas students deserve access to healthy, nutritious foods at school,” Sanders said in a statement. “This initiative supports both student health and our farmers while helping young people learn about what it takes to feed our state.”Beyond meals, the pilot will also provide Meet the Farmer profiles, posters, and classroom materials to help students understand how local agriculture contributes to their daily lives and the state economy.A state-level spin on federal farm-to-school programsAs The 74 noted, the new program resembles federal initiatives like the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm to School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs, which help schools source ingredients from nearby producers. Those federal efforts faced major funding cuts during the early years of President Donald Trump’s second term, even as agriculture leaders — including Arkansas Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward — voiced support for continuing them.When asked by The 74, the Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not specify whether the Plate Initiative would receive federal funding or rely solely on state resources.Part of a broader nutrition push in Arkansas schoolsThe pilot follows a series of child-nutrition measures advanced by the Sanders administration in 2025. Earlier this year, Sanders signed Act 123, ensuring free school breakfasts for all Arkansas students. The state also announced a partnership with the Department of Corrections, which now supplies locally harvested produce from inmate-run farms to schools in the Marion district.Together, these efforts mark a shift toward expanding access to healthy school meals while supporting the state’s agricultural base.Students learn food literacy as farmers face pressureThe program comes at a challenging moment for Arkansas’ agriculture sector, which has been hit hard by declining commodity prices and rising production costs. For students, however, the initiative offers more than a fresh meal — it’s also a lesson in sustainability, food literacy, and community economics.By linking classrooms to farms, the Arkansas Plate Initiative aims to remind young Arkansans that their next meal might just start a few miles down the road.Ready to navigate global policies?

In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.\n\nUntil February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.\n\nAlthough transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.\n\nA transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.\n\n“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.\n\nMittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.\n\nTSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.\n\nThe legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.\n\nOther transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.\n\nKai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.\n\nWorried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.\n\nRegan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.\n\n“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.\n\n“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.\n\nThe DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.\n\n“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”\n\nAirport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.\n\nTravellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.\n\nDeciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.\n\n“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.\n\nThe TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.\n\nFor passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.\n\nThe documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.\n\n“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”\n\nBeing unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.\n\nIt adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.\n\n“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.","url":"https://stluciachronicle.com/lawsuit-challenges-us-ban-on-transgender-tsa-officers-conducting-pat-downs/","image":"https://stluciachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/20101027125245133833_20-dwtwXn.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:48:16","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.054},{"id":378041752,"title":"Supreme Court extends order blocking full SNAP payments, with shutdown potentially near an end","text":"The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended an order blocking full SNAP payments, amid signals that the government shutdown could soon end and food aid payments resume.\n\nThe order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing.\n\nThe order, which is three sentences long and comes with no explanation on the court’s thinking, will expire just before midnight Thursday.\n\nThe Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it’s not clear how quickly full payments would resume.\n\nRuling follows path of least legal resistance\n\nThe justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn’t otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments.\n\nThe court’s action doesn’t do anything to settle uncertainty across the country.\n\nBeneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments.\n\nHow quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it’s easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones.\n\nCarolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount.\n\nAn urgent need for beneficiaries\n\nIn Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday.\n\nMalliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year.\n\nThat stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen.\n\n“It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.”\n\nThe political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help.\n\n“I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York.\n\nSNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court\n\nThe Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans.\n\nThe administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order in a ruling late Sunday.\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments.\n\nCongressional talks about reopening government\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.”\n\nStill, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts.\n\n“The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.”\n\nAfter Tuesday’s ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: “Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.”\n\nThe coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion.\n\n“The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,” they said, “not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/11/11/supreme-court-blocking-snap-payments","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/48c126f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5000x3333+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F75%2F62e01f614da4b01e19a8d4a492fb%2Fsnap.","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:46:03","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":378043608,"title":"“It's so demeaning”: Donald Trump blasts NFL’s new kickoff rule, urges Roger Goodell to bring back football’s traditional excitement","text":"Donald Trump has once again inserted himself into the heart of an NFL controversy, this time over the league’s revamped kickoff rule. Speaking candidly on The Pat McAfee Show, the 79-year-old President expressed his deep frustration with the NFL’s decision to alter one of football’s most iconic plays. Donald Trump, who has long prided himself on defending American sports traditions, argued that the new “dynamic kickoff” model strips away the energy, unpredictability, and excitement that defined the sport for generations. His remarks come as players, fans, and analysts continue to debate whether the league’s safety-driven reforms are eroding football’s identity.Donald Trump reignites debate on tradition versus safety in football’s evolving identityDonald Trump didn’t hold back, saying, “I do have to say and I'll probably get myself into a little trouble for this - I hate the kickoff in football. I think it's so terrible, I think it's so demeaning. I think it hurts the game. I think it hurts the pageantry. I told that to Roger Goodell.”He added that despite the NFL’s claims of improved player safety, “you still have guys crashing into each other,” calling the reform “the opposite of what the game should be.” The President emphasized that the traditional kickoff represented “the power of the game,” a symbolic and thrilling start to every matchup that should never have been altered.Under the 2024 rule changes, players are lined up closer together, and no one can move until the ball is caught or hits the ground, measures designed to reduce high-speed collisions. Yet Trump argues these tweaks have “hurt the game’s pageantry,” transforming what was once a dynamic, adrenaline-fueled play into a controlled formality.The NFL has yet to respond to Donald Trump’s comments, but his criticism has revived a long-standing debate among fans and former players. While some applaud the league’s effort to protect athletes, others believe the game’s spirit is being sanitized beyond recognition. For Donald Trump, the issue goes beyond rule, it’s about preserving football’s essence, unpredictability, and “beautiful chaos” that made America fall in love with the sport in the first place.More coverage on NFL:Antonio Brown’s legal fight intensifies as he pleads not guilty just days after being extradited back to the United StatesJoe Alwyn’s secret London date sparks buzz as Taylor Swift enjoys her engagement bliss with Travis KelcePatrick Mahomes’ mom Randi melts hearts with emotional reaction to Brittany’s latest accomplishmentCatch Lovlina Borgohain's inspiring story on Game On, Episode 5.

The Sensex opened lower, dropping 411.32 points or 0.49% to 83,124.03. Similarly, the 50-share Nifty 50 fell by 125.1 points, or 0.48%, to 25,449.25 in early trading.Nevertheless, both indices staged a robust comeback and ended the session on a high note. The Nifty 50 increased by 0.47% to close at 25,694.95, while the Sensex gained 0.4% to reach 83,871.32.Investors reacted positively to comments from U.S. President Donald Trump indicating that a trade agreement with India is imminent.

Nevertheless, it made a significant recovery and finished at the day's high, buoyed by global developments as the U.S. Senate passed a bill to conclude the longest federal shutdown in history.Further, Nair said that notably, the Q2 earnings season is approaching its conclusion and is anticipated to wrap up positively, aided by a stronger-than-expected performance from the broader market. The rally was bolstered by gains in the IT, automotive, metal, and FMCG sectors.“Investors are now looking forward to the upcoming domestic inflation figures, with hopes of continued moderation driven by a consistent drop in food prices—heightening the likelihood of further policy easing by the RBI. Moving forward, earnings are projected to show a strong rebound in the third quarter, supported by various domestic advantages, although success will largely depend on the finalization of a trade agreement with the U.S,” said Vinod Nair.Stocks to buy todayRegarding stocks to buy today, market experts—Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, recommended these eight intraday stocks for today: Ashok Leyland Ltd, National Aluminium Company Ltd (NALCO), Housing & Urban Development Corporation Ltd (HUDCO), SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC), Hero MotoCorp Ltd, VA Tech Wabag Ltd, and Marksans Pharma Ltd.Sumeet Bagadia's stock picksAshok Leyland Ltd: Bagadia recommends buying Ashok Leyland share price at ₹146 keeping a stoploss at ₹141 with a Ashok Leyland share price target of ₹156.Sumeet Bagadia said that Ashok Leyland share price was currently trading at 146 and has recently made an all-time high of 146.78, reflecting strong bullish momentum.

Britain says it will send £13 million ($17 million) to help patch up Ukraine’s energy infrastructure as winter approaches. The money will go towards repairs to power, heating and water supplies and humanitarian support for Ukrainians. \n\nU.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper made the announcement ahead of the meeting. She said Russian President Vladimir Putin “is trying to plunge Ukraine into darkness and the cold as winter approaches,” but the British support will help keep the lights and heating on. \n\nCanada’s G7 hosting duties this year have been marked by strained relations with its North American neighbour, predominantly over Mr. Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports. But the entire bloc of allies is confronting major turbulence over the Republican president’s demands on trade and various proposals to halt worldwide conflicts. \n\nOne main point of contention has been defence spending. All G7 members except for Japan are members of NATO, and Mr. Trump has demanded that the alliance partners spend 5% of their annual gross domestic product on defence. While a number of countries have agreed, others have not. Among the G7 NATO members, Canada and Italy are furthest from that goal. \n\nMs. Anand said Canada’s recent budget includes $80 billion Canadian (US$57 billion) in defence spending. “We are going to reach 2% this year and 5% of GDP by 2035,” Ms. Anand said. \n\nThere have also been G7 disagreements over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with Britain, Canada and France announcing they would recognise a Palestinian state even without a resolution to the conflict. With the Russia-Ukraine war, most G7 members have taken a tougher line on Russia than Mr. Trump has. \n\nThe two-day meeting in Niagara-on-the-Lake on Lake Ontario near the U.S. border comes after Mr. Trump ended trade talks with Canada because the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S. that upset him. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Mr. Trump’s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. \n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologised for the ad and said last week that he’s ready to resume trade talks when the Americans are ready. \n\nMs. Anand said she will have a meeting with Rubio but noted that a different minister leads the U.S. trade file. The U.S. president has placed greater priority on addressing his grievances with other nations’ trade policies than on collaboration with G7 allies. \n\n“Every complex relationship has numerous touch points,” Ms. Anand said in the interview, “On the trade file, there is continued work to be done — just as there is work to be done on the numerous touch points outside the trade file, and that’s where Secretary Rubio and I come in because the relationship has to continue across a range of issues.” \n\nMs. Anand said Rubio asked her during a breakfast meeting in Washington last month to play a role in bringing countries to the table to ensure that Mr. Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan has longevity, including with a future Gaza reconstruction conference. \n\nU.S. officials said Rubio, who also may have meetings with other G7 counterparts and at least one of the invited non-G7 foreign ministers, would be focused on initiatives to halt fighting in Ukraine and Gaza, maritime security, Haiti, Sudan, supply chain resiliency and critical minerals. \n\nCanada’s priorities include ending the war in Ukraine, Arctic security and security in Haiti. There will be a working lunch on energy and critical minerals that are needed for anything from smartphones to fighter jets. Canada has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/top-diplomats-from-g7-countries-meet-in-canada-as-trade-tensions-rise-with-trump/article70269603.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ll91dg/article70269605.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-11-11T225517Z_495810387_RC2LUHAKNWDA_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-G7.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:39:29","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.362},{"id":378038216,"title":"'Deeply disappointing': Council mishap sees unauthorised removal of 46 trees","text":"A﻿ Perth council says it \"deeply regrets\" a mishap that saw 46 trees mistakenly cut down at a popular park during an $8.1 million redevelopment.\n\nThe 4.6-hectare ﻿Elizabeth Baillie Park is being upgraded to include 43 new trees and 23,160 new plants, while the accompanying heritage-listed house is being transformed into a hospitality and entertainment district.\n\nAs construction nears its end, the Town of Victoria Park has reviewed the works only to find that ﻿dozens more trees have been removed than the 30 that had been authorised.\n\nREAD MORE: ﻿Money troubles push more and more Aussies into side hustles\n\nIt is unclear exactly how it happened, but the town believes it is likely due to the poor condition of some trees, inadequate site management, and the need to accommodate new infrastructure within the park.\n\nThe town said the removals fell short of expectations and accepted full responsibility. ﻿\n\n﻿\"The town deeply regrets this outcome and takes full responsibility,\" it said in a statement this week.\n\n\"We pride ourselves on environmental stewardship, responsible planning, and community trust.

Trump officials have also accused Maduro of masterminding the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with a relatively modest presence in the US.\n\nBut Maduro and his allies have accused the US of “imperialistic” aims.\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether Venezuela is equipped to fend off any US military advances.\n\nExperts say the Maduro government has sought to project an image of military preparedness in the face of a large buildup of US forces in the Caribbean, but it could face difficulties from a lack of personnel and up-to-date equipment.\n\nWhile the government has used possible US intervention to rally support, Maduro is also struggling with widespread discontent at home and growing diplomatic isolation following a contested election in 2024, marred by allegations of widespread fraud and a crackdown on protesters.\n\nThe military buildup in the Caribbean region began after the start of a series of US military strikes on September 2.\n\nThe US has carried out at least 19 air strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nTrump has suggested that land strikes “are going to be next”. But when asked in late October whether he was considering attacks within Venezuela, Trump replied, “No”.\n\nLegal experts say that a military attack on Venezuela would likely violate international law, and recent polling from the research firm YouGov suggests that about 47 percent of people in the US would oppose land attacks on Venezuelan territory. About 19 percent, meanwhile, say they would support such attacks.\n\nWhile Venezuela’s armed forces have expressed support for Maduro and said they would resist a US attack, the Reuters news agency has reported that the government has struggled to provide members of the armed forces with adequate food and supplies.\n\nThe use of additional paramilitary and police forces could represent an effort to plug the holes in Venezuela’s lacklustre military capacity. Reuters reported that a government memo includes plans for small units at about 280 locations, where they could use sabotage and guerrilla tactics for “prolonged resistance” against any potential US incursion.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/venezuela-prepares-massive-deployment-of-forces-in-case-of-us-attack/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25315691559458-1762894737-ANGUYa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:32:19","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":0.231},{"id":378041228,"title":"Lawsuit challenges US ban on transgender TSA officers conducting pat-downs  - Guyana Inquirer – Daily Guyana","text":"A Virginia transportation security officer has accused the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of sex discrimination over a policy that bars transgender officers from performing security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) news agency obtained internal documents explaining the policy change from four independent sources, including one current and two former TSA workers.\n\nThose documents explain that “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveller’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.\n\nUntil February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.\n\nAlthough transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.\n\nA transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.\n\n“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.\n\nMittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.\n\nTSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.\n\nThe legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.\n\nOther transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.\n\nKai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.\n\nWorried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.\n\nRegan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.\n\n“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.\n\n“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.\n\nThe DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.\n\n“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”\n\nAirport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.\n\nTravellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.\n\nDeciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.\n\n“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.\n\nThe TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.\n\nFor passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.\n\nThe documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.\n\n“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”\n\nBeing unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.\n\nIt adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.\n\n“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/lawsuit-challenges-us-ban-on-transgender-tsa-officers-conducting-pat-downs/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/11/20101027125245133833_20-N8tr4Z.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:32:17","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":0.054},{"id":378038756,"title":"US-Saudi investment summit set for Washington during MBS visit","text":"Saudi Arabia is expected to host a US-Saudi investment summit in Washington on 19 November during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nThe crown prince will be in Washington to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on November 18, a White House official said last week.\n\nThe summit will be held on the sidelines of bin Salman's visit and will not be a part of his official schedule, the source said, declining to be identified because the event is not yet public.\n\nTrump and Bin Salman may drop in, but their participation was not currently part of the programme, the source added.\n\nNews of the summit was first reported by CBS News, which, citing an invitation, reported that the event would be held at the John F Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts and co-hosted by the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia and the US-Saudi Business Council.\n\nThe crown prince will visit Washington as Trump pushes Saudi Arabia to join the list of nations that have joined the Abraham Accords normalising relations between Israel and Muslim-majority nations.\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms, and Trump and bin Salman may also discuss a US-Saudi defence agreement.\n\nThe Financial Times reported last month that there were hopes the two countries could sign such an agreement during bin Salman's visit.","url":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1357310-us-saudi-investment-summit-set-for-washington-during-mbs-visit","image":"https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2025-11-12/1357310_053445_updates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:31:32","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":378039110,"title":"Letters: Let’s hold the government accountable for SNAP fiasco","text":"Hold the government\naccountable on SNAP\n\nOur government is starting to reflect “The Hunger Games.” While the wealthy are having balls, citizens are going hungry.\n\nThe recent shutdown of the government has prevented many SNAP recipients from receiving their funds, which allow them to purchase food.

On the contrary, President Trump has donated his presidential salary.\n\nAnother example, “He uses the courts to his advantage.” Wow — the Democrats do not use courts against Trump to their advantage? More hypocrisy.\n\nI think I have pointed out enough of the hypocrisy and untruth in Thornton’s letter.\n\nEBT seems to display mediocre journalistic practice, manifested by printing such a “Banzinga” letter.

He won’t be taking power as an elected president. He will declare his continuing rule a necessity because of a great emergency that he will have created.\n\nIs this too outlandish an idea? Maybe not. Both Trump and Steve Bannon seem to have inferred the same thing, and Trump continues to act as if unrestrained by law.\n\nMaya Angelou warned: “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”","summary":"Also: Nation's values &#124; Similar spirit &#124; Nonsensical attack &#124; Unelected term.

Podjasek is also a member of SEIU Healthcare. \n\n“The attacks are to divide and conquer working people, going after Brown, Black, Spanish-speaking, low-income and people needing and using services, which also includes veterans and VA staff members, and then going after unions because that’s how workers have power.”\n\nAdelena Marshall, a provider at the VA and a member of National Nurses United, said that although nurses and doctors were dedicated to veterans, she said many have been retiring under pressure from the Trump administration.\n\n“Our nurses are leaving.

I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other.”\n\nOften referred to as the “dynamic kickoff,” the NFL’s new kickoff rule – introduced in 2024 – is designed to reduce the dangerous high-speed collisions often associated with kickoff returns.\n\nIt requires that the defensive team start on the offensive team’s 40-yard line, closer than previously, when the ball is kicked and must wait until the ball is caught or touches the ground to advance.\n\n“The ball is in the air and nobody is moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to be moving,” Trump continued. “The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt. The NFL, they do what they want to do. \n\n“I don’t think they’ll change. I hope college football doesn’t change, because the power of the kickoff was so beautiful.”\n\nTrump, who has attended multiple high-profile games, including the 2025 Super Bowl, has often criticized the NFL and changes to the game. His remarks on Tuesday echoed a post on Truth Social in September in which he also criticized the new kickoff.\n\n“It’s at least as dangerous as the ‘normal’ kickoff, and looks like hell. The ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what football is all about,” the president wrote. “‘Sissy’ football is bad for America, and bad for the NFL!

Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) to censure and strip the Minnesota Democrat of committee assignments, claiming she had mocked slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-donald-trump-cant-read_n_69137e4fe4b0d0f8e6ce7bf7?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6913b23217000079779c5424.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:17:32","author":"Jazmin Tolliver","authors":["Jazmin Tolliver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":378038048,"title":"California Push for Transgender Sports Inclusivity May Face Olympic Setback","text":"California’s support for transgender sports inclusivity may be on set to clash with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nSports organizations across the globe continue grappling with the question of transgender athletes. Critics have pushed for rules barring transgender women from participating alongside other women, raising questions of fairness and safety. Others, however, have argued that those policies would be unfair to transgender athletes and have accused conservatives of using the issue to attack the transgender community.\n\nThe issue has become political, with conservative states implementing those rules, while more Democratic states like California allow transgender girls and women to participate based on their gender identity, sparking criticism in some instances where transgender athletes have competed. Some elected officials and political candidates in California have expressed support allowing inclusion based on gender identity—though divisions do exist among the state’s Democrats. \n\nPolls suggest that a majority of Americans oppose allowing transgender girls and women to compete with female athletes. A Pew Research Center poll from February found that 66 percent of Americans support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThe International Olympic Committee is moving forward with rules that would prohibit transgender women from participating in female events, although it has not been formally announced, according to the British publication The Times. This is a break from current rules that allow each sport’s international federation to make its own determination.\n\nThe Olympic rings display above the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland on April 1, 2016.\n\nAn IOC spokesperson told the BBC that a review on the matter is “continuing its discussions on this topic and no decisions have been taken yet.”\n\nIf the IOC moves forward with the ban, it could lead to a cultural clash with California, a liberal bastion that is set to host the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The state currently allows transgender girls in high school to participate on female teams, though adult sports organizations can make their own rules.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, has sought to strike a more centrist approach on the issue, saying on an episode of his podcast earlier this year that he agrees there is a question of fairness. Those remarks drew criticism from other California Democrats, including state legislator Scott Wiener, who described it as “profoundly disturbing.”\n\n“Trans people are just trying to live their lives. They’re facing a level of political hostility that leads to violence and homelessness. They need their allies to stand with them — especially when it’s hard,” Wiener, who is running for Congress, wrote in a statement in March.\n\nAny decision by the IOC could reveal divisions within the state on transgender athletes. It could also loom over the state’s 2026 gubernatorial race as both Democrats and Republicans vie to replace Newsom. President Donald Trump has already called for gender testing at the Olympics in 2028.\n\nBetty Yee, a Democrat who formerly served as the state comptroller and is running for governor, told Newsweek that any decision should be left to the appropriate governing agencies, rather than the state government.\n\n“With respect to this current issue, I am not a qualified decision-maker, nor is any politician,” Yee said. “I believe it should be determined by the appropriate athletic governing agencies. The topic demands a thoughtful and deliberative approach where dignity, respect, and fairness are upheld along the way – the same foundational principles we appreciate and treasure in the world of sports.”\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidates, on the other hand, celebrated the reports.\n\nChad Bianco, Riverside County sheriff and Republican gubernatorial candidate, told Newsweek that the fact that the IOC has to consider “such a common sense policy is absurd.\n\n“There are only two sexes. In any sport, a man competes against another man and a woman competes against another woman. It is as simple as that. Any person incapable of a common-sense, factual position on this decision has no business being in a leadership position,” he said.\n\nGOP candidate Steve Hilton also told Newsweek he agrees with the decision.\n\n“As governor of California, I will take immediate legal steps to end the obscene gender discrimination of allowing biological boys and men to compete in female sports. That’s not equity, it’s injustice. It strips young women of their hard-earned opportunities, scholarships, and dignity. Girls’ sports exist for a reason: to give girls a level playing field,” he said.\n\nIOC President Kirsty C...","summary":"A potential IOC decision on transgender athletes could clash with California&#039;s culture in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/california-push-transgender-sports-inclusivity-may-face-olympic-setback-11031247","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-531449688.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:17:18","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.095},{"id":378034770,"title":"\"Pageantry of the game is so badly hurt\": Donald Trump calls puts Roger Goodell on the spot over NFL's controversial kickoff rule","text":"Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the NFL's \"dynamic kickoff\" ever since it was introduced in 2024, and he did not miss a chance to condemn it again on Tuesday.During Tuesday's episode of Pat McAfee's eponymous ESPN show, the US President said about the rule via phone call:“I hate the kickoff in football.

Trump officials have also accused Maduro of masterminding the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with a relatively modest presence in the US.\n\nBut Maduro and his allies have accused the US of “imperialistic” aims.\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether Venezuela is equipped to fend off any US military advances.\n\nExperts say the Maduro government has sought to project an image of military preparedness in the face of a large buildup of US forces in the Caribbean, but it could face difficulties from a lack of personnel and up-to-date equipment.\n\nWhile the government has used possible US intervention to rally support, Maduro is also struggling with widespread discontent at home and growing diplomatic isolation following a contested election in 2024, marred by allegations of widespread fraud and a crackdown on protesters.\n\nThe military buildup in the Caribbean region began after the start of a series of US military strikes on September 2.\n\nThe US has carried out at least 19 air strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nTrump has suggested that land strikes “are going to be next”. But when asked in late October whether he was considering attacks within Venezuela, Trump replied, “No”.\n\nLegal experts say that a military attack on Venezuela would likely violate international law, and recent polling from the research firm YouGov suggests that about 47 percent of people in the US would oppose land attacks on Venezuelan territory. About 19 percent, meanwhile, say they would support such attacks.\n\nWhile Venezuela’s armed forces have expressed support for Maduro and said they would resist a US attack, the Reuters news agency has reported that the government has struggled to provide members of the armed forces with adequate food and supplies.\n\nThe use of additional paramilitary and police forces could represent an effort to plug the holes in Venezuela’s lacklustre military capacity. Reuters reported that a government memo includes plans for small units at about 280 locations, where they could use sabotage and guerrilla tactics for “prolonged resistance” against any potential US incursion.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/venezuela-prepares-massive-deployment-of-forces-in-case-of-us-attack/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25315691559458-1762894737-tAAMbL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:15:23","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":0.231},{"id":378037082,"title":"Lawsuit challenges US ban on transgender TSA officers conducting pat-downs  | Barbados Gazette –","text":"A Virginia transportation security officer has accused the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of sex discrimination over a policy that bars transgender officers from performing security screening pat-downs, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which operates under the DHS, enacted the policy in February to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring two unchangeable sexes: male and female.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) news agency obtained internal documents explaining the policy change from four independent sources, including one current and two former TSA workers.\n\nThose documents explain that “transgender officers will no longer engage in pat-down duties, which are conducted based on both the traveller’s and officer’s biological sex. In addition, transgender officers will no longer serve as a TSA-required witness when a traveller elects to have a pat-down conducted in a private screening area”.\n\nUntil February, the TSA assigned officers work consistent with their gender identity, based on a 2021 management directive. The agency told the AP that it rescinded this directive to comply with Trump’s January 20 executive order.\n\nAlthough transgender officers “shall continue to be eligible to perform all other security screening functions consistent with their certifications” and must attend all required training, they will not be allowed to demonstrate how to conduct pat-downs as part of their training or while training others, according to the internal documents.\n\nA transgender officer at Dulles international airport, Danielle Mittereder, alleged in her lawsuit filed on Friday that the new policy, which also bars her from using TSA facility restrooms that align with her gender identity, violates civil rights law.\n\n“Solely because she is transgender, TSA now prohibits Plaintiff from conducting core functions of her job, impedes her advancement to higher-level positions and specialised certifications, excludes her from TSA-controlled facilities, and subjects her identity to unwanted and undue scrutiny each workday,” the complaint says.\n\nMittereder declined to speak with the AP, but her lawyer, Jonathan Puth, called the TSA policy “terribly demeaning and 100 percent illegal”.\n\nTSA spokesperson Russell Read declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But he said the new policy directs that “male Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on male passengers, and female Transportation Security Officers will conduct pat-down procedures on female passengers, based on operational needs”.\n\nThe legal battle comes amid mounting reports of workplace discrimination against transgender federal employees during Trump’s second administration. It is also happening at a time when the TSA’s ranks are already stretched thin due to the ongoing government shutdown that has left thousands of agents working without pay.\n\nOther transgender officers describe similar challenges to Mittereder.\n\nKai Regan worked for six years at Harry Reid international airport in Las Vegas before leaving in July, in large part because of the new policy.\n\nWorried that he would be fired for his gender identity, he retired earlier than planned rather than “waiting for the bomb to drop”.\n\nRegan, who is not involved in the Virginia case, transitioned from female to male in 2021. He said he had conducted pat-downs on men without issue until the policy change.\n\n“It made me feel inadequate at my job, not because I can’t physically do it but because they put that on me,” said the 61-year-old.\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organisation that has repeatedly challenged the second Trump administration in court, called the TSA policy “arbitrary and discriminatory”.\n\n“There’s no evidence or data we’re aware of to suggest that a person can’t perform their duties satisfactorily as a TSA agent based on their gender identity,” Perryman said.\n\nThe DHS pushed back on assertions by some legal experts that its policy is discriminatory.\n\n“Does the AP want female travellers to be subjected to pat-downs by male TSA officers?” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin asked in a written response to questions by the AP. “What a useless and fundamentally dangerous idea, to prioritise mental delusion over the comfort and safety of American travellers.”\n\nAirport security expert and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor Sheldon H Jacobson, whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck, said that the practice of matching the officer’s sex to the passenger’s is aimed at minimising passenger discomfort during screening.\n\nTravellers can generally request another officer if they prefer, he added.\n\nDeciding where transgender officers fit into this practice “creates a little bit of uncertainty”, Jacobson said. But because transgender officers likely make up a small percent of the TSA’s workforce, he said the new policy is unlikely to cause major delays.\n\n“It could be a bit of an inconvenience, but it would not inhibit the operation of the airport security checkpoint,” Jacobson said.\n\nThe TSA’s policy for passengers is that they be screened based on physical appearance as judged by an officer, according to internal documents. If a passenger corrects an officer’s assumption, “the traveller should be patted down based on his/her declared sex”.\n\nFor passengers who tell an officer “that they are neither a male nor female”, the policy says officers must advise “that pat-down screening must be conducted by an officer of the same sex” and contact a supervisor if concerns persist.\n\nThe documents also say that transgender officers “will not be adversely affected” in pay, promotions or awards, and that the TSA “is committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination and retaliation”.\n\nBut the lawsuit argues otherwise, saying the policy impedes Mittereder’s career prospects because “all paths toward advancement require that she be able to perform pat-downs and train others to do so”, Puth said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mittereder started in her role in June 2024 and never received complaints related to her job performance, including pat-down responsibilities. Supervisors awarded her the highest-available performance rating, and “have praised her professionalism, skills, knowledge, and rapport with fellow officers and the public”, the lawsuit said.\n\n“This is somebody who is really dedicated to her job and wants to make a career at TSA,” Puth said. “And while her gender identity was never an issue for her in the past, all of a sudden, it’s something that has to be confronted every single day.”\n\nBeing unable to perform her full job duties has caused Mittereder to suffer fear, anxiety and depression, as well as embarrassment and humiliation by forcing her to disclose her gender identity to co-workers, the complaint says.\n\nIt adds that the ban places an additional burden on already-outnumbered female officers who have to pick up Mittereder’s pat-down duties.\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees national president Everett Kelley urged the TSA leadership to reconsider the policy “for the good of its workforce and the flying public”.\n\n“This policy does nothing to improve airport security,” Kelley said, “and in fact could lead to delays in the screening of airline passengers since it means there will be fewer officers available to perform pat-down searches”.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/lawsuit-challenges-us-ban-on-transgender-tsa-officers-conducting-pat-downs/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/20101027125245133833_20-ryZqwh.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:15:21","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":0.054},{"id":378039816,"title":"CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews The Eubanks: Like Father, Like Son: An hour of hero-worship that felt like a PR campaign for the Eubanks","text":"The Eubanks: Like Father, Like Son (BBC3) \n\nBalance and impartiality is not, sadly, something we expect from the BBC any more.

Data shows that was happening before they arrived.","text":"CHICAGO — President Donald Trump mocked local officials last month, calling the city a “war zone” after they touted a drop in crime that brought the safest summer the city had seen since 1965. Now, his administration wants to take credit. On Tuesday, a Department of Homeland Security official cited a drop in crime in Chicago, when asked for comments on reports that Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino was sunsetting Operation Midway Blitz, as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Chicago is called. “We aren’t leaving Chicago,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin posted on X. She then listed percentages related to a drop in murders, shootings, robberies and tied it to the arrival of immigration agents. “It is great to hear that the Trump administration acknowledges, as we have been saying for months, that crime is significantly down in Chicago,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. “However, they have nothing to do with that work. While CBP agents have been here, they have tear-gassed our police officers on two separate occasions, bragged about shooting a U.S. citizen five times, and, over the weekend, they pepper-sprayed a one-year-old child.” In August, the month before Operation Midway Blitz started, numbers were down across the board. Compared to the same month in 2024, homicides were down 24%, shootings were down 24%, robberies were down 41% and car thefts were down 28%, according to Chicago Police Department data. DHS arrived in September — after July and August, which are traditionally the months that see the highest criminal activity. “That strains credibility to make such a claim,” Alderman Brian Hopkins said of DHS attributing a decrease in crime to its immigration operations. But Hopkins, who heads the Chicago City Council’s public safety committee and said public safety officials briefed him on the downscaling of the Chicago operation, added that the mayor shouldn’t take credit for crime dropping either, pointing instead to Chicago following a national downward trend. “Having Storm Troopers come in, kicking doors down and arresting nannies and construction workers can do nothing but set back the cause of promoting support for law enforcement in general. And that’s exactly what’s happened,” Hopkins said. “So whatever the end result of this is, it nets out in a negative fashion.” McLaughlin, who did not respond to follow-up questions about the status of the operation, on Monday was quoted in a USA Today article saying: “Thanks to DHS law enforcement, Chicago has experienced the fewest summer murders since 1965!” The 1965 statistic McLaughlin cited was the same one that the city and state officials have repeatedly held up as they said there was no emergency situation necessitating the deployment of National Guard troops in the city. Trump is currently asking the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of those troops there. “Why are they calling for troops in our cities? Why?” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a recent interview with NBC News. “It doesn’t make any sense. Literally, crime has gone down everywhere, seemingly, and certainly by a whole lot in Chicago, more than most places.” The governor has repeatedly rejected the need for the National Guard and instead said he wanted more FBI and ATF agents to assist on targeted missions. Hopkins added that the city isn’t opposed to having targeted federal law enforcement assist in tackling crime. “I’ve said consistently all along, there’s some things that we could use from the federal government. I’m not adverse to having the federal government come in and help us make our streets safer. This is not how to do that.” In Chicago, the back and forth between the administration and local officials, have only exacerbated an already contentious relationship. And the broader discussion over taking credit for a drop in crime comes at a moment when the city has been gripped by a Saturday double murder caught on surveillance camera. The graphic scene of a father and son lying in the street with fatal gunshot wounds as traffic goes by has been widely shared on social media. A suspect is still at large. McLaughlin pointed to the statistics showing a decrease in crime after CBS News reported that Bovino was leaving the Chicago area. A source with knowledge of the details confirmed the report with NBC News, adding that Bovino’s departure didn’t mean all immigration agents were leaving. A second source who is a senior DHS official confirmed reports that Bovino’s next stop may be Charlotte, North Carolina, where Border Patrol agents are expected to begin an immigration enforcement operation, a senior DHS official tells NBC News. The exact timing of the operation is still unknown, but it will come after Bovino’s exit from Chicago, which is planned for this week, the official said. Charlotte would be the first city that Border Patrol has spearheaded an operation on their own without ICE focusing attention on the same location. ICE has been making arrests in Charlotte, but they are not currently coordinating with Border Patrol to ramp up arrests in the area, the official said. In Chicago, which Trump called “a killing field” in late August, crime dropped by a double digit percentage in that same month.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dhs-takes-credit-crime-chicago-data-shows-was-happening-arrived-rcna243258","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251111-border-patrol-chicago-mb-1649-29dcd6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:14:54","author":"Natasha Korecki","authors":["Natasha Korecki"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":378036604,"title":"Madres contra la Guerra denuncia falta de atención a veteranos puertorriqueños  - Puerto Rico Tribune –","text":"La organización Madres contra la Guerra marcó este martes la conmemoración del Día del Veterano con un llamado de atención sobre las condiciones que enfrentan soldados y exmilitares puertorriqueños, al denunciar “discrimen, abusos y deficiencias” en los servicios de salud que reciben.\n\n“Honramos la calidad humana de los veteranos y denunciamos los abusos a los que se enfrentan los soldados en la milicia”, expresó la portavoz de Madres contra la Guerra, Sonia Santiago Hernández, en declaraciones escritas.\n\nLa organización incluyó el testimonio de Zuleyka Morales Rivera, quien sirvió siete años y medio en la Marina de Guerra. \n\n“Firmé un contrato militar por mi situación de pobreza. El reclutador te describe un mundo ideal para salir de la pobreza, solo te habla de los beneficios. La realidad es otra. Te usan como militar para invadir otros países. Hay mucho discrimen y abusos en las fuerzas armadas”, señaló Morales Rivera.\n\nTambién se destacó el relato de Jorge Rodríguez, egresado de la academia militar de West Point y exteniente del Ejército. “Por mucho que quieran presentar a la milicia como una gran oportunidad, es todo lo contrario. Los reclutadores están habilitados dentro de la ética de su profesión a exagerar y mentir, hablan de beneficios y bonos. De mis soldados, ninguno recibió bono y los beneficios venían con costos que seguirán pagando toda su vida”, dijo Rodríguez.\n\nRodríguez añadió que vivió “siete años de deshumanización, humillación y aislamiento” y que, en 2017, intentó quitarse la vida. “Eran muchachos y muchachas de 19, 20, 21 años que ya tenían problemas de la espalda o de las rodillas o de la mente, llenándose de sustancias para lograr sentir algo.

No dijeron que luego me negarían el dinero para la universidad porque la ley cambió cuando salí”, dijo Ríos.\n\nSantiago Hernández sostuvo que el sistema de salud de veteranos ha sido afectado por la privatización de servicios impulsada bajo la administración de Donald Trump mediante el Mission Act. “Hemos llamado varias veces para obtener cita para varios veteranos y no las conceden. Nos dicen que el Hospital de Veteranos no ha subido los expedientes a la nube virtual. Ese sistema fracasó”, afirmó.\n\nLa portavoz exhortó a la juventud a no firmar contratos militares y a mantenerse alerta sobre los esfuerzos de reclutamiento en las escuelas. “A la población veterana en Puerto Rico les decimos que les apoyaremos siempre.

But there are still calls for him to step aside from Democrats who think he should have fought harder.\n\nIt’s a now-familiar position for the Democratic leader, who was pilloried by the liberal base in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. This time, he’s getting blowback for the actions of the moderate senators in his caucus who allowed the shutdown to end without the extension of health care subsidies that Democrats had demanded for more than six weeks.\n\n“The American people asked us over and over to fight for health care and to lower our costs overall,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who declined to say if she still had confidence in Schumer. “Obviously that broke apart at the end. Our job is to deliver for the American people. We need to do that more effectively.”\n\nNo senator has explicitly called for his resignation as leader, and his job appears safe despite the criticism from outside. But it’s been a tough year for Schumer as the unexpected, overwhelming anger from base voters at his March vote has turned more of a spotlight on his leadership, and as he and his party have struggled to counter President Donald Trump. And he could face new challenges ahead as riled up voters demand results even though Democrats have little power.\n\n“It’s an impossible job,” said Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, who like Schumer voted against reopening the government. “In my view, he did it well.”\n\nWelch said he doesn’t blame Schumer for the small group of moderates who broke the stalemate and voted with Republicans to reopen, sending the bill to the House. He says he believes Democrats succeeded in elevating the issue of the health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year as Republicans refused to negotiate on the issue.\n\n“We have to remember that the leader is one of many,” Welch said. “He’s first among equals, but there’s independent agency for senators.”\n\nSchumer has not yet publicly responded to the criticism, instead trying to keep the focus on Republicans.\n\n“Americans will remember Republican intransigence every time they make a sky-high payment on health insurance,” he said on the Senate floor just before the final Senate vote on Monday.\n\nCriticism as the shutdown nears an end\n\nDemocrats inside and outside the Senate were furious on Sunday when the moderate senators broke ranks. Senate Majority leader John Thune, R-S.D., promised a mid-December vote on extension of the subsidies, but there is no guaranteed outcome.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., posted on X that “Chuck Schumer has not met this moment and Senate Democrats would be wise to move on from his leadership.” Mallory McMorrow, a Michigan state senator and U.S. Senate candidate, told the AP she would not support Schumer remaining in his role if elected next year.\n\n“We need new leadership,” McMorrow said, adding that it’s “a new moment.”\n\nConnecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, one of the most vocal Democrats pushing his colleagues to keep the shutdown going, said that Schumer had tried but “didn’t succeed.”\n\nAfter the final vote on Monday, several Senate Democrats declined to comment on Schumer’s role in the shutdown’s end or whether he should remain as leader.\n\n“I’m not going to get into that right now,” said Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.\n\nNew Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich and New Jersey Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester also declined to comment.\n\nSchumer is still ‘solid in the caucus’\n\nSchumer, who is known for frequently dialing up the members of his caucus on his flip phone, worked hard to recover his image after the March vote, talking to senators individually and hearing them out in meetings. And when the time came, he voted with the majority of his caucus to shut down the government and made demands on health care — an issue that Democrats believe is a weakness for Republicans.\n\nWhile it’s unclear how the year’s saga will affect Schumer’s political future — he’s up for re-election in 2028 — his Senate colleagues appear to have little interest in an ouster.\n\n“He handled a very tough situation very well,” said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat and among the small group who switched their votes to reopen the government. “I think he’s solid in the caucus.”\n\nWelch said that even though Democrats won big in last week’s elections, “we get into the Capitol and the reality of us having 47 votes doesn’t change, and that puts some limitations on what we can accomplish.”\n\nThat’s “a dilemma that any leader faces,” he said.\n\nSchumer has also repaired his relationship with House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who in March had declined to express confidence in his New York colleague.\n\nAware that the Sept. 30 funding deadline was approaching, Schumer and Jeffries appeared several times together and said they were united in pushing for the health care subsidies. After the Senate vote on Monday, Jeffries said he’s still supportive of Schumer and focused his ire on Republicans instead.\n\n“Donald Trump and the Republican Party own the toxic mess they have created in our country and the American people know it,” Jeffries said.\n\nHealth care fight ahead\n\nSchumer’s next test will be the health care vote promised by Thune. The COVID-era subsidies for coverage in the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act expire on Jan. 1, threatening sharp premium increases for millions of Americans. A bipartisan agreement on extending the tax credits is likely to be a steep climb as Republicans have demanded changes or an overhaul of the ACA.\n\nColorado Sen. John Hickenlooper says the caucus is united on that issue, and “let’s keep our eye on the ball.”\n\n“It’s not about whether Schumer did a good job or a bad job,” Hickenlooper said Monday. “We’ve got to stay focused on this health care issue.”\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who led the negotiations among moderates and was one of the five who switched their votes, said Democrats need to focus on Republicans instead.\n\n“It’s President Trump, it’s Speaker Johnson, it’s the Republican majorities that have failed to address health care,” Shaheen said. “That’s what we need to stay focused on.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report.","summary":"Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer led his caucus, and the country, into a record-breaking government shutdown and voted against reopening when a small group of his members defected.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/11/schumer-faces-criticism-as-shutdown-nears-end-but-his-job-appears-safe/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Government_Shutdown_Photo_Gallery_07981_aa821e.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:13:52","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":378038738,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Donald Trump and Right-Wingers Accused of Launching 'Hitler-Style Attack' on 'Weak-Minded' BBC to 'Dismantle Democracy'","text":"Donald Trump is being accused of orchestrating a \"Hitler-style assault\" on the BBC as right-wing figures in the U.S. and U.K. step up attacks on the broadcaster following the resignation of its director general Tim Davie, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nDavie, 58 and Deborah Turness, also 58, and the BBC's head of news, both quit their jobs on Sunday, November 10, after an internal report found a BBC Panorama documentary had used a misleading edit of Trump's January 6, 2021 speech.Trump Leads Renewed OffensiveTrump condemned the \"corrupt\" BBC, calling its journalists \"very dishonest\" after the report emerged. \n\nOn Truth Social, he ranted: \"The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught 'doctoring' my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\" \n\nTrump's renewed offensive against the BBC was echoed by right-wing commentators and political allies, who have accused the corporation of bias and call for it to be defunded. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the corporation was \"anti-Trump fake news,\" while former British prime minister Boris Johnson praised Davie's resignation as \"long overdue.\"Historic Parallels and WarningsBut senior media figures and historians have warned the campaign against the BBC mirrors the methods of authoritarian regimes. \n\n\"This is straight from the Nazi playbook–attack public institutions, brand them enemies of the people, and replace them with loyal propaganda,\" said one industry source. \n\n\"Trump's approach is about discrediting any independent voice that challenges him.\"Panorama Report Sparks ResignationsDavie's resignation followed the publication of a 19-page internal report by Michael Prescott, a former adviser to the BBC's editorial standards board.

Instead of standing firm against an orchestrated campaign from Trump and his right-wing nutters, it folded. This is all clearly about dismantling democracy, not protecting it.\" \n\nCritics have also accused the British government of caving to pressure from Trump-aligned politicians and media outlets. Jane Martinson, a professor of financial journalism at City St George's University, London, said: \"The resignations of Davie and the BBC head of news, Deborah Turness, have shown that baying for blood gets results.\" \n\nOne senior producer warned: \"We're watching a page torn straight from history – intimidate the press, rewrite the story, then claim victory for democracy.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump and right-wing figures have been accused of targeting BBC to erode democracy.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/donald-trump-right-wing-attack-bbc-dismantle-democracy/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/jfeA9Xgbb/0x0/donald-trump-and-right-wing-nutters-accused-of-launching-hitler-style-attack-on-weak-minded-bbc-pp-1762794903663.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:13:34","author":"Aaron Tinney","authors":["Aaron Tinney"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":378037224,"title":"RBA interest rates: Why rate cuts are unlikely anytime soon, explained by deputy governor Andrew Hauser","text":"John Kehoe is economics editor at Parliament House, Canberra.

Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments.Beneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments.How quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it's easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones.Carolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount.AN URGENT NEED FOR BENEFICIARIES In Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday.Malliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year.That stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen.“It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.”The political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help.“I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York.SNAP HAS BEEN THE CENTER OF AN INTENSE FIGHT IN COURT The Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans.The administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere.The US Supreme Court agreed to pause that order.An appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments.CONGRESSIONAL TALKS ABOUT REOPENING GOVERNMENT The US Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans.President Donald Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.”Still, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts.“The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.”After Tuesday's ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: “Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.”The coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion.“The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,\" they said, \"not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.”- EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Nov 12, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-supreme-court-extends-order-blocking-full-snap-payments-as-government-shutdown-nears-end-2817819-2025-11-12","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/a-snap-ebt-information-sign-is-displayed-outside-of-a-convenience-store-in-baltimore--monday--nov-1-12090140-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=7ipkNQceAuos2UjCviKR9LRE3ewy8QB5?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:12:51","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":378038010,"title":"Trump congratulates Republican leaders for ‘big victory’ of ending shutdown  - Grenada Chronicle – Daily","text":"United States President Donald Trump has called the looming end of the government shutdown a “great victory” after the Senate passed a bill to fund federal agencies.\n\nTrump congratulated Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday for the soon-to-be-approved funding bill.\n\n“Congratulations to you and to John and to everybody on a very big victory,” Trump said, addressing Johnson at a Veterans Day event.\n\n“We’re opening up our country — should have never been closed.”\n\nThe US president’s comments signal that he views the shutdown crisis as a political win for his Republican Party, which is set to end the budgeting impasse in Congress without meeting the Democrats’ key demand: extending healthcare subsidies.\n\nThe Senate passed the funding bill late on Monday in a 60-40 vote that saw eight members of the Democratic caucus backing the proposal.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to pass the budget in the coming days to end the shutdown, which has been the longest in US history. Assuming the House approves the bill, it will then go to Trump’s desk, and the president is expected to sign it into law.\n\nIn the US system, Congress is tasked with funding the government.\n\nIf lawmakers fail to pass a budget, the federal government goes into shutdown mode, where it stops paying most employees and sends non-essential workers home.\n\nThe current shutdown started on October 1.\n\nRepublicans control the House, Senate and White House, but their narrow majority in the Senate had previously prevented them from passing a continuing resolution to keep the government funded.\n\nIn the 100-seat Senate, major legislation must generally be passed with at least 60 votes to overcome the filibuster, a legislative procedure that allows the minority party to block bills it opposes.\n\nThe Democratic caucus holds 47 seats in the chamber, which allowed it to successfully wield the filibuster until this week’s divisive vote.\n\nUntil Monday, Democrats had largely been united in opposition to the Republicans’ funding bill. They had previously maintained they would only approve government funding if the bill included provisions to extend healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nThose subsidies, Democrats argued, help millions of Americans afford their medical insurance.\n\nBut Trump had threatened to ramp up the pressure against Democrats by cutting programmes he associated with their party.\n\nDuring the shutdown, for example, Trump tried to withhold food benefits for low-income families – a policy that is being challenged in the courts.\n\nThe shutdown crisis has also led to flight delays and cancellations across the country due to a shortage of available air traffic controllers, who have been working without pay.\n\nMonday’s Senate vote paved the way for a resolution to the crisis. But it has sparked infighting amongst Democrats, with segments of the party voicing disappointment with senators who backed the bill.\n\nThe issue has also intensified criticism against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the proposal but failed to keep his caucus united in opposition to it.\n\n“Sen. Schumer has failed to meet this moment and is out of touch with the American people. The Democratic Party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people,” Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib said in a social media post on Monday.\n\n“Schumer should step down.”\n\nSenator John Fetterman, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, defended his vote on Tuesday.\n\n“When you’re confronting mass, mass chaos, you know, I don’t think you should respond with more chaos, or fight with more chaos,” Fetterman told the ABC talk show The View. “It’s like, no, we need to be the party of order and logic.”","url":"https://grenadachronicle.com/trump-congratulates-republican-leaders-for-big-victory-of-ending-shutdown/","image":"https://grenadachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-11T174149Z_1108630558_RC2HUHA29RQH_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1762890999-G63wwh.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:12:20","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gd","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":378036582,"title":"Erika Kirk Criticised For Being 'Everywhere But With Her Kids' After Oval Office Sighting","text":"Erika Kirk has been more visible in various events following the death of her husband, Charlie Kirk, in September.

Trump officials have also accused Maduro of masterminding the activities of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with a relatively modest presence in the US.\n\nBut Maduro and his allies have accused the US of “imperialistic” aims.\n\nQuestions remain, however, about whether Venezuela is equipped to fend off any US military advances.\n\nExperts say the Maduro government has sought to project an image of military preparedness in the face of a large buildup of US forces in the Caribbean, but it could face difficulties from a lack of personnel and up-to-date equipment.\n\nWhile the government has used possible US intervention to rally support, Maduro is also struggling with widespread discontent at home and growing diplomatic isolation following a contested election in 2024, marred by allegations of widespread fraud and a crackdown on protesters.\n\nThe military buildup in the Caribbean region began after the start of a series of US military strikes on September 2.\n\nThe US has carried out at least 19 air strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing approximately 75 people.\n\nTrump has suggested that land strikes “are going to be next”. But when asked in late October whether he was considering attacks within Venezuela, Trump replied, “No”.\n\nLegal experts say that a military attack on Venezuela would likely violate international law, and recent polling from the research firm YouGov suggests that about 47 percent of people in the US would oppose land attacks on Venezuelan territory. About 19 percent, meanwhile, say they would support such attacks.\n\nWhile Venezuela’s armed forces have expressed support for Maduro and said they would resist a US attack, the Reuters news agency has reported that the government has struggled to provide members of the armed forces with adequate food and supplies.\n\nThe use of additional paramilitary and police forces could represent an effort to plug the holes in Venezuela’s lacklustre military capacity. Reuters reported that a government memo includes plans for small units at about 280 locations, where they could use sabotage and guerrilla tactics for “prolonged resistance” against any potential US incursion.","url":"https://grenadachronicle.com/venezuela-prepares-massive-deployment-of-forces-in-case-of-us-attack/","image":"https://grenadachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25315691559458-1762894737-h1sqdz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:12:17","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gd","sentiment":0.231},{"id":378039100,"title":"Supreme Court extends halt on using child nutrition funds for SNAP as House set to vote on reopening government","text":"The Department of Justice had asked the high court to extend the block on the lower court’s order mandating that Section 32 Child Nutrition Funds be moved to fund SNAP, arguing it injects “the federal courts into the political branches’ closing efforts to end this shutdown” by attempting “to reallocate resources without lawful authority.”\n\nThe DOJ also noted in its Monday brief to the Supreme Court that Congress appeared to be on the verge of reopening the government, which would automatically fund SNAP benefits and render the lawsuit moot.\n\nThe Senate passed legislation to reopen the government Monday evening, with the House set to reconvene Wednesday.

Beck | Associated Press\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday extended an order blocking full SNAP payments, amid signals that the government shutdown could soon end and food aid payments resume.\n\nThe order keeps in place at least for a few more days a chaotic situation. People who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed their families in some states have received their full monthly allocations, while others have received nothing.\n\nThe order will expire just before midnight Thursday.\n\nThe Senate has approved a bill to end the shutdown and the House of Representatives could vote on it as early as Wednesday. Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it’s not clear how quickly full payments would resume.\n\nThe justices chose what is effectively the path of least resistance, anticipating the federal government shutdown will end soon while avoiding any substantive legal ruling about whether lower court orders to keep full payments flowing during the shutdown are correct.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only one of the nine justices to say she would have revived the lower court orders immediately, but didn’t otherwise explain her vote. Jackson signed the initial order temporarily freezing the payments.\n\nBeneficiaries in some states have received their full monthly allocations while in others they have received nothing. Some states have issued partial payments.\n\nHow quickly SNAP benefits could reach recipients if the government reopens would vary by state. But states and advocates say that it’s easier to make full payments quickly than partial ones.\n\nCarolyn Vega, a policy analyst at the advocacy group Share Our Strength, also said there could be some technical challenges for states that have issued partial benefits to send out the remaining amount.\n\nAn urgent need for beneficiaries\n\nIn Pennsylvania, full November benefits went out to some people on Friday. But Jim Malliard, 41, of Franklin, said he had not received anything by Monday.\n\nMalliard is a full-time caretaker for his wife, who is blind and has had several strokes this year, and his teenage daughter, who suffered severe medical complications from surgery last year.\n\nThat stress has only been compounded by the pause in the $350 monthly SNAP payment he previously received for himself, his wife and daughter. He said he is down to $10 in his account and is relying on what’s left in the pantry — mostly rice and ramen.\n\n“It’s kind of been a lot of late nights, making sure I had everything down to the penny to make sure I was right,” Malliard said. “To say anxiety has been my issue for the past two weeks is putting it mildly.”\n\nThe political wrangling in Washington has shocked many Americans, and some have been moved to help.\n\n“I figure that I’ve spent money on dumber stuff than trying to feed other people during a manufactured famine,” said Ashley Oxenford, a teacher who set out a “little food pantry” in her front yard this week for vulnerable neighbors in Carthage, New York.\n\nSNAP has been the center of an intense fight in court\n\nThe Trump administration chose to cut off SNAP funding after October due to the shutdown. That decision sparked lawsuits and a string of swift and contradictory judicial rulings that deal with government power — and impact food access for about 1 in 8 Americans.\n\nThe administration went along with two rulings on Oct. 31 by judges who said the government must provide at least partial funding for SNAP. It eventually said recipients would get up to 65% of their regular benefits. But it balked last week when one of the judges said it must fund the program fully for November, even if that means digging into funds the government said need to be maintained in case of emergencies elsewhere.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court agreed to pause that order.\n\nAn appeals court said Monday that full funding should resume, and that requirement was set to kick in Tuesday night before the top court extended the order blocking full SNAP payments.\n\nCongressional talks about reopening government\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Monday passed legislation to reopen the federal government with a plan that would include replenishing SNAP funds. Speaker Mike Johnson told members of the House to return to Washington to consider the deal a small group of Senate Democrats made with Republicans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has not said whether he would sign it if it reaches his desk, but told reporters at the White House on Sunday that it “looks like we’re getting close to the shutdown ending.”\n\nStill, the Trump administration said in a Supreme Court filing Monday that it shouldn’t be up to the courts.\n\n“The answer to this crisis is not for federal courts to reallocate resources without lawful authority,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in the papers. “The only way to end this crisis — which the Executive is adamant to end — is for Congress to reopen the government.”\n\nAfter Tuesday’s ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi posted on social media: “Thank you to the Court for allowing Congress to continue its swift progress.”\n\nThe coalition of cities and nonprofit groups who challenged the SNAP pause said in a court filing Tuesday that the Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP, is to blame for the confusion.\n\n“The chaos was sown by USDA’s delays and intransigence,” they said, “not by the district court’s efforts to mitigate that chaos and the harm it has inflicted on families who need food.”\n\nAssociated Press reporter Cara Anna in Carthage, New York, contributed.","summary":"Reopening the government would restart the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries, but it’s not clear how quickly full payments would resume.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/11/snap-payments-supreme-court-government-shutdown-trump/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-SNAPRULE-1111.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:05:35","author":"Kristen Crowe","authors":["Kristen Crowe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":378035814,"title":"Caitlyn Jenner backs IOC move to ban transgender women from Olympics after review finds unfair advantage","text":"The International Olympic Committee is preparing to ban transgender women from female Olympic events. The Times of London reported Monday that the policy decision comes after a scientific review that found \"permanent physical advantages of being born male.\" Former Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, has long advocated for restricting transgender women from competing in female sports categories. \"I am a trans woman, but I am still biologically male,\" said Jenner Tuesday on \"America Reports.\" \"I’m XY. There’s nothing I can do to change that. Males do have a better advantage, a big advantage in sports over women.

If we don’t stop it now, it will just destroy women’s sports,\" Jenner said.

MAINE TOWN OFFICIAL REFUSES TO APOLOGIZE AFTER CALLING OPPONENTS OF TRANS ATHLETE POLICY ‘PEDOPHILIC’ Kirsty Coventry, the IOC’s first female president, has signaled she is willing to take a firmer stance on fairness in women’s sports. In June, Coventry said the IOC must \"protect the female category, first and foremost to ensure fairness.\" Jenner, who won Olympic gold at the 1976 Montreal Games before her transition, voiced her support for Coventry.

Two boxers, Algeria’s Imane Khelif and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-Ting, won gold medals despite earlier disqualifications at the 2023 World Championships for failing gender-eligibility criteria. President Donald Trump has also taken a tough stance on women’s sports. He signed an executive order earlier this year prohibiting schools and colleges that receive federal funding from allowing biological men onto women’s sports teams and into women’s locker rooms. If institutions fail to comply, they could risk losing federal funds.","summary":"IOC prepares to ban transgender women from female Olympic events following scientific review showing permanent male physical advantages in sports competition.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/caitlyn-jenner-backs-ioc-move-ban-transgender-women-from-olympics-after-review-finds-unfair-advantage","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/caitlyn-jenner-olympics-transgender-women-sports-fox-news.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-12 00:03:20","author":"Madison Colombo","authors":["Madison Colombo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":378043614,"title":"America’s Spy Network COLLAPSES In Caribbean; NATO Allies CUT Intel Ties After ‘Drug-Boat’ Strikes","text":"President Donald Trump vows a $2,000 “dividend” for Americans funded by his new tariffs on foreign goods.
