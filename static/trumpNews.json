IAEA inspectors have been demanding conclusive explanations from Tehran for years regarding indices indicative of secret nuclear facilities and past nuclear activities. Should Tehran continue to withhold answers, Grossi’s report could, according to Western diplomats, provide the basis to involve the UN Security Council.\nIn a joint statement, the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom called on Iran to cooperate and resolve outstanding issues.\n“We hope Iran will take the opportunity between now and that report to finally provide the information and cooperation needed to resolve these issues, the statement said.\nCurrently, Iran enriches uranium to a purity level of up to 60 per cent, while experts said more than 90 per cent is required for nuclear weapons.\nThe Iranian government said its nuclear programme is used solely for civilian purposes. The Vienna nuclear pact, intended to limit Iran’s programme and, in return, ease sanctions, was unilaterally abandoned by then-US President Donald Trump in 2018. Since then, the Islamic Republic has not strictly adhered to the stipulations.","summary":"According to media reports, Tehran plans on installing the devices within the next 4 to 6 months.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3287886/iran-plans-activate-thousands-centrifuges-after-iaea-dispute","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/24/e1ccdefa-4dcc-4c88-b967-c5a6b1db3e55_9ae2bbc1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 01:12:16","author":"dpa","authors":["dpa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":266762286,"title":"Global climate talks forge deal on money after bitter fight","text":"BAKU, Azerbaijan >> Negotiators at this year’s United Nations climate summit struck an agreement early Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan, to triple the flow of money to help developing countries adopt cleaner energy and cope with the effects of climate change. Under the deal, wealthy nations pledged to reach $300 billion a year in support by 2035, up from a current target of $100 billion.\n\nIndependent experts, however, have placed the needs of developing countries much higher, at $1.3 trillion a year. That is the amount they say must be invested in the energy transitions of lower-income countries, in addition to what those countries already spend, to keep the planet’s average temperature rise under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Beyond that threshold, scientists say, global warming will become more dangerous and harder to reverse.\n\nThe deal reached at the annual U.N.-sponsored talks calls on private companies and international lenders such as the World Bank to cover the hundreds of billions in the shortfall. That was seen by some as a kind of escape clause for rich countries.\n\nAs soon as the Azerbaijani hosts banged the gavel and declared the deal done, Chandni Raina, the representative from India, the world’s most populous country, tore into them, saying the process had been “stage managed.”\n\n“It is a paltry sum,” Raina said. “I am sorry to say that we cannot accept it. We seek a much higher ambition from developed countries.” She called the agreement “nothing more than an optical illusion.”\n\nSpeakers from one developing country after another, from Bolivia to Nigeria to Fiji, echoed Raina and assailed the document in furious statements.\n\nThe financing negotiations were complicated by the election of Donald Trump less than a week before the summit’s opening day. Trump is widely expected to renege on any commitments negotiated in Baku and has said he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, the landmark 2015 climate accord that aims to curb global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAnother difficultly was the expectation that the Republican-led Congress will curtail funding for Ukraine, placing a greater burden on that country’s European allies and leaving less money available for climate efforts.\n\nMany negotiators and diplomats said, however, that Trump’s election also created a sense of urgency around the need to speed the transformation of increasingly interconnected economies around the world, many of which are still largely dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nThe agreement, which is not legally binding and will function largely through diplomatic peer pressure, comes after two weeks of divisive debate over who should pay and how much.\n\nUnder U.N. rules written in 1992, certain wealthy countries, mostly in the West, are considered developed, while other nations, including China and Saudi Arabia, are considered developing. Countries in the developing group are “invited” to provide financial aid but not expected to do so.\n\nToday, however, many wealthy nations say the distinction no longer makes sense and that China, Saudi Arabia and others should be compelled to provide a share of climate financing. Western efforts to move those countries into the developed category met with fierce resistance and were ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nDeveloping countries have also accused Western nations of betraying their past commitments by failing to hit the previous $100 billion target until years after the deadline set under that agreement. They also accused rich countries of using domestic politics as an excuse to contribute less.\n\nThe negotiations, which had been scheduled to end on Friday evening but ran more than a full day into overtime, took place near the end of another year of record-breaking heat. Global greenhouse gas emissions soared to a record 57 gigatons last year, and they are not on track to decline much, if at all, this decade, according to a U.N. report issued just before the summit.\n\nCollectively, nations have been so slow to curtail their use of fossil fuels that many scientists regard the 1.5 degree Celsius goal as practically unattainable. If nations follow through on their current pledges to reduce their domestic emissions, according to the U.N. report, the world would still be on track for around 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming.\n\nCountries are expected to submit updated emissions-reduction pledges in the coming months, before a February deadline. All eyes are on China and the United States, the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, though for different reasons.\n\nChina is responsible for 30% of global emissions and for nearly all the world’s growth in emissions over the past decade. The U.S. pledge will signal the extent to which President Joe Biden’s administration thinks its signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, can withstand environmental rollbacks promised by Trump.\n\nAt last year’s climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, nations acknowledged for the first time the link between fossil fuels and global warming, and agreed to “transition away” from fossil fuels by midcentury.\n\nIn Dubai, the Saudi delegation in particular worked hard to prevent the summit’s final declaration from mentioning fossil fuels at all. Reporting by The New York Times found that the Saudis have continued those efforts, in particular by working at five U.N. forums this year to kill any language that affirms the pledge. Several Western officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with diplomatic protocol, said Saudi negotiators did the same in Baku, in essence trying to reverse last year’s agreement. Saudi officials at the summit declined to comment.\n\nDecisions at COP summits must be reached by unanimous consent. That means geopolitical blocs, or even individual countries, can drive hard bargains that threaten to derail talks.\n\nIn Baku, the Azerbaijani hosts were responsible for building consensus, and throughout the summit negotiators expressed frustration with a process that, for the two weeks leading up to Friday’s deadline, seemed either deliberately slow or simply disorganized.\n\nThe conference was rancorous from its outset. Azerbaijan’s authoritarian president, Ilham Aliyev, used his opening speech to upbraid Western governments and media, whom he accused of hypocrisy. He pointed out that Europe buys much of Azerbaijan’s gas and still wants more while “lecturing” Azerbaijan on transitioning away from the fuel.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"BAKU, Azerbaijan >> Negotiators at this year&#8217;s United Nations climate summit struck an agreement early Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan, to triple the flow of money to help developing countries adopt cleaner energy and cope with the effects of climate change.

Meeting this mandate is required for brands to sell handsets in the country, which has the largest economy in Southeast Asia.\nStill, Oppo wants to go further, according to de Haan. “We are looking for good suppliers for all of our components, and we communicate and cooperate closely with the Ministry of Industry and local governments to find the right suppliers and vendors for us,” he said during a media tour of the factory on Tuesday, which the company sponsored.\nIndonesia banned the sale of Apple’s latest iPhone last month, saying the US tech giant failed to meet the TKDN requirement and fulfil its investment commitment to the market. Days later, Google’s Pixel phones were also banned for sale in the country for similar reasons.\n\nIndonesia is leveraging its rapidly growing economy to boost foreign investment in local manufacturing, a trend that has been growing globally. India, for example, has been pushing a “Make in India” campaign for a decade, significantly growing its manufacturing base.\nOppo’s Indonesian factory produces all the smartphones it sells across the archipelago, from low- to high-end handsets, including its latest Find X8 flagship phone. Its monthly production output varies from 1 million to 2 million units, based on market demand, according to de Haan.\nOppo’s local commitment comes as it looks to embed itself further in Southeast Asia’s largest and fastest-growing smartphone market. Smartphone shipments in Indonesia grew 11 per cent in the third quarter, and Oppo was the top-ranked vendor making up 19 per cent of the market, according to research firm IDC. It came ahead of Chinese rival Transsion and South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics, which each had an 18 per cent market share.\n“The Indonesian market is a very important market for us. We have established very comprehensive capabilities in sales, marketing and production in the market,” Oppo vice-president Billy Zhang said after the global launch of Find X8 in Bali. “The essence [of the local factory] is to increase efficiency, and bring our latest technologies and products to our local consumers as fast as possible.”\nOther Chinese smartphone makers have also established their own manufacturing facilities in the country to comply with regulations and sell to local consumers. Oppo’s crosstown Dongguan-based rival Vivo has its own facilities in Tangerang. Xiaomi, which set up plants in the industrial zone of Batam Island, also locally manufactures all the smartphones it sells in Indonesia.\n“International relations in recent years have urged all manufacturers to rethink their supply chain strategy, but Oppo started setting up overseas manufacturing before the geopolitical issues between China and the US,” Andy Shi, Oppo’s Asia-Pacific president, said in a media briefing on Wednesday. Oppo built its first factory in Indonesia in 2015, more than a year before Donald Trump became US president in 2017 and kicked off a trade war the following year.\nWhile Oppo’s Indonesian facility currently produces just for the domestic market, it was designed to be able to cover more Southeast Asian countries, according to Shi.\n“It’s possible for us to build out more factories across Southeast Asia, or supply other countries from the Indonesia facility,” Shi said. “We haven’t decided yet.”\n\nOppo’s plant in Tangerang, just west of Jakarta, has been operational since 2022, when the company expanded its manufacturing facilities to meet growing demand for smartphone devices during the Covid-19 pandemic, de Haan said.\nCovering an area of over 100,000 square metres, the facility has hired more than 1,000 employees, making it Oppo’s second-largest overseas manufacturing hub behind India. Around 99 per cent of the factory’s workforce is local, according to de Haan.\nOppo currently has seven manufacturing hubs outside China, including Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil and Egypt.\nFuture manufacturing expansion will depend on local demand and regulations, according to Zhang. “We have the manufacturing capabilities, and when there’s demand, we will roll out locally,” he said.","summary":"Oppo already uses slightly more than the 35 per cent of local smartphone components required by Indonesian law, but it is looking to scale up.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3287743/chinese-smartphone-maker-oppo-boost-indonesian-manufacturing-bet-southeast-asia","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/22/96247044-5acb-4c4f-a01f-689e17a28f40_1a117589.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 01:00:15","author":"Iris Deng","authors":["Iris Deng"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":266762370,"title":"Elon Musk has a 'serious conflict of interest' due to xAI and his relationship with Trump, LinkedIn cofounder says","text":"LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said Elon Musk has a \"serious conflict of interest\" when it comes to guiding a second Trump administration on AI policies in the US.In an op-ed published Friday with The Financial Times, Hoffman said the advisory role Musk has taken up with Donald Trump could pose a conflict of interest if the xAI founder is guiding the president-elect on laws around artificial intelligence.\"With direct ownership in the fledgling AI start-up xAI, Elon Musk, who is advising Trump in many domains, has a serious conflict of interest in terms of setting federal AI policies for all US companies,\" Hoffman wrote. \"Using his position to favor xAI in any way, such as awarding it government contracts, encouraging federal agencies to unfairly target AI companies, or imposing new regulations that limit exports will come at the expense of US technological, economic and cultural security and competitiveness.\"Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk, who has gradually shifted to the Republican Party over the years, has been a vociferous supporter of Trump.

No?' the soap star asked, before traipsing off to help Jane himself after she confessed: 'I can’t do it on my own'.\nDean then later joined them and told Alan 'You can go back now', before the actor explained: 'I was trying to wake you up as soft as I could.'\nDean then hit back: 'Listen to me. If you're gonna wake me up, you need to give me a minute, alright? It takes a couple of minutes for my contact lenses to get back working again, alright, so you don't need to turn around to me and say \"Do you not fancy it, Ok?\" And then turn around and walk away.'\n'I've listened to you, Jane was halfway down here, that's why I went' Alan replied as the pair got into a heated back and forth. \nIt comes after a a body language expert has revealed 'highly sensitive' Dean could soon quit the ITV show, after being chosen by viewers to face three Bushtucker Trails in as many days.\n\nMelvin continued: 'This eating no food, bruv, your body fat's gone' before removing his own shirt, which is when Danny spotted he too was sporting a new buff look \n\nDanny proudly showed off his newly toned figure (Right in 2011)\n\nMelvin couldn't wipe the smile off his face (right in 2015)\n\nEarlier this week Danny showed off his physique as he braved an ice cold shower in white swimming shorts \nThe Radio 1 star, who also paired up with GK Barry for one challenge earlier this week, has quit every one which has even annoyed host Ant McPartlin, who later apologised for his unprofessional behaviour after fans clocked his 'furious' reaction.\nTeaming up with Mecca Games expert Nicole Greenfield-Smith said: 'If Dean flunks many more trials, it could leave him susceptible to walking.'\n\n I'm A Celebrity's Danny Jones is the first in the jungle shower as he strips down to a pair of white swimming shorts to brave the ice cold water \n'Firstly, Dean and GK Barry in a Bushtucker Trial proved to be a disastrous combo'\n'Even though they went in with the best intentions. We all have 'mirror neurons' which enable us to connect and empathise with others'. \n'This means we are highly sensitive to the mood, tone of voice and body language of those around us. So, if we hear someone screaming and panicking it intensifies our own fear,' \n'Wwhich is exactly what happened with the hapless duo and why they left the trial with zero stars.'\n'If Dean continues to be selected for trials and lets his fear dominate, it's likely that some of the other campmates will lose patience with him for not delivering the goods'. \nGoing on to say: 'Our brains are wired for social connection and cooperation.

A former car salesman in the Cleveland area, his only prior experience in politics was a losing bid for Ohio’s other Senate seat in 2022.\n\nMoreno has since accomplished the once unthinkable. \n\nOn Nov. 5, as part of the election that swept Donald Trump back into the White House, Moreno defeated Democratic incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown, who was first elected to the House in 1992, before winning his Senate seat in 2006 and chairing the powerful Banking Committee since 2021.\n\nMoreno’s rise from unsung Ohio businessman to prominent political leader was no accident. His campaign was backed by $40 million from the cryptocurrency industry as part of a highly targeted effort to get friendly candidates elected and, perhaps more importantly, its critics removed. Moreno’s victory was one of the Senate seats Republicans flipped to take control of the chamber. \n\nIn total, crypto-related PACs and other groups tied to the industry reeled in over $245 million, according to Federal Election Commission data. Crypto accounted for nearly half of all corporate dollars that flowed into the election, according to nonprofit watchdog Public Citizen. Advocacy group Stand With Crypto Alliance, which Coinbase launched last year, developed a grading system for House and Senate races across the country as a way to help determine where money should be spent.\n\nCrypto execs, investors and evangelists saw the election as existential to an industry that spent the past four years simultaneously trying to grow up while being repeatedly beaten down. Nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers will take seats in the House and Senate, according to Stand With Crypto, giving the sector unprecedented influence over the legislative agenda.\n\nThe crypto political lobby worked so well this cycle because it made something complicated, like campaign finance, simple: Raise a ton of cash from a handful of donors and buy ad space in battleground states to either support candidates who back crypto or smear the candidates who don’t. It also required thinking of candidates as a bit of a binary: They were either with the industry or against it.\n\nCrypto companies and their executives mobilized rapidly, and they successfully figured out how to deploy their cash through a sophisticated ad machine across the country. They also took cues from what big tech got wrong. Rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying legislators post-election, the crypto industry invested in targeting their opponents ahead of the election so they wouldn’t have to deal with them at all the next few years.\n\nFor over a year, Moreno was grilled by Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and David Sacks about blockchain technology, digital asset policy and the shifting terrain of global finance.\n\n“They didn’t just jump in head first,” Moreno said, describing the scores of meetings that stretched back to his run in the primary. “We had to build a lot of trust.”\n\nMoreno also met with Coinbase co-founders Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam as well as policy chief Faryar Shirzad. Armstrong and Ehrsam did not respond to CNBC’s request, through Coinbase, for comment about the meetings.\n\nCoinbase is the largest digital asset exchange in the U.S. and has been battling the Securities and Exchange Commission in court for over a year. The company was the crypto kingmaker in the 2024 cycle, giving more than $75 million to a super PAC called Fairshake. It was one of the top spending committees of any industry this cycle and exclusively gave to pro-crypto candidates running for Congress. Fairshake’s candidates won virtually every race that it funded in the general election.\n\n“Being anti-crypto is simply bad politics,” Coinbase’s Armstrong wrote on X following Moreno’s victory. \n\nAs the price of bitcoin has multiplied by about sixfold in the past four years, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has taken major crypto players like Coinbase and Ripple to court for allegedly selling unregistered securities and has avoided working with companies to develop new specialized regulations.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Brown sided with the expressly anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in targeting crypto for allegedly funding terrorist organizations, including Hamas. Brown became more vocal in calling for crackdowns of the industry after the failure of crypto exchange FTX in late 2022. \n\nAs FTX was spiraling into bankruptcy, Brown on Nov. 10 retweeted a post from the Senate Banking Committee calling the event “a loud warning bell that cryptocurrencies can fail” and can “have a ripple effect on consumers and other parts of our financial system.”\n\nThe bipartisan Fairshake won all but three races in the general election, spending big on Republicans and Democrats gunning for key seats. Protect Progress, a PAC affiliated with Fairshake, gave more than $10 million apiece to Democratic candidates for the Senate in Arizona and Michigan. Both won. Defend American Jobs, another one of Fairshake’s affiliated PACs, spent more than $3 million to support Republican Jim Justice in West Virginia, who will take the former seat of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin when the new session gets underway in 2025.\n\nIn California, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter lost a Senate primary after Fairshake spent more than $10 million on ads against her. \n\n“I was, like, ‘What the heck is Fairshake?’” Porter told The New Yorker.\n\nHow tech bros made their pick\n\nThose vetting Moreno wanted to understand what he would do differently than the current administration and regulatory regime, the senator-elect told CNBC in an interview.\n\n“These are people who know how to vet investments, know how to vet people and they took that same discipline” with me, Moreno said.\n\nIt helped that he’d built a blockchain startup, a company called Champ Titles that digitizes automobile ticketing and registration.\n\n“What they didn’t want was to put time, effort and energy behind somebody who, at the end, would be a disappointment,” Moreno said.\n\nA spokesperson for Andreessen and Horowitz, who are co-founders of a venture firm bearing their names, declined to comment. Sacks, founder of Craft Ventures, didn’t respond to CNBC’s request for an interview.\n\nCoinbase’s Shirzad met Moreno over breakfast in Washington in the spring. Moreno wasn’t an expert on the details of the policy issues he’d be pursuing but had a clear understanding of crypto technology and how it could be applied, Shirzad told CNBC in an interview. \n\n“It was a really great meeting of minds between me as a policy guy and him as kind of a business guy that saw the potential of the technology,” Shirzad said. \n\nMoreno was out of cash after spending all he had on a tough and expensive primary, said David McIntosh, an early backer of Moreno’s Senate bid and president of the Club for Growth, a conservative organization that focuses on American economic issues. Fairshake played a crucial role for Moreno’s campaign starting in the summer, McIntosh said. \n\nMoreno’s victory over Brown “sent a really strong signal to Washington that the voters are going to support candidates who are pro-blockchain,” McIntosh said.\n\nMcIntosh noted that the Club for Growth spent $6.5 million to help Moreno with advertising in the primary through its different super PACs, including the Bitcoin Freedom Fund.\n\nBrown’s office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBrown told Politico he hasn’t ruled out running for Vice President-elect JD Vance’s open Senate seat in Ohio, which will be filled by special election in 2026.\n\nMoreno benefited from branding himself as the “change” candidate while Brown “became a defender of the status quo,” Shirzad said.\n\n“Crypto thematically is a change issue,” Shirzad said. “It appeals to not only a younger demographic, but it also appeals to voters who want to change.”\n\nFairshake declined to comment on whether it would spend to block another Brown Senate run, but the super PAC has already raised $78 million for the 2026 midterms.\n\n“We stuck to our core strategy from Day 1, supported pro-crypto candidates and opposed those who played politics with jobs and innovation, and won,” Fairshake told CNBC in a statement.\n\n‘Most pro-crypto Congress ever’\n\nThe past two election cycles featured spending from the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March for stealing more than $8 billion worth of customer money through FTX. \n\nThis year’s contributor list was more robust but saw large sums of funding come from companies that have been at odds with SEC Chair Gensler for years. That includes Coinbase and blockchain giant Ripple Labs. Prominent venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has a large portfolio of crypto companies, was one of the other primary contributors.\n\nA lot of crypto’s big names also gave significantly in 2024. \n\nFEC filings show Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were among the largest individual crypto donors this election cycle, giving a combined $10.1 million. Top executives from Ripple contributed millions, led by billionaire founder Chris Larsen, who gave around $12 million this cycle.\n\nCoinbase CEO Armstrong gave over $1.3 million to a mix of PACs including Fairshake and JD Vance for Senate Inc. He also gave directly to Democrats and Republicans running for House and Senate seats. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal attended at least two Trump fundraisers, including one in Nashville, Tennessee, on the sidelines of the biggest bitcoin event of the year.\n\nKraken Chairman Jesse Powell donated over $1 million to the Trump campaign.\n\nOther individual crypto contributors include ex-Bitfinex strategy chief Phil Potter (over $1.6 million), Multicoin Capital’s Kyle Samani ($878,600), Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam ($735,400), Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson ($1,4 million), Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla ($198,500), BitGo CEO Mike Belshe ($119,825), Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko ($67,100), and Xapo Bank founder Wences Casares ($374,899).\n\nThis week, Armstrong reportedly met with the president-elect to discuss appointments. Within a day, conversations swirled about the potential for the White House’s first crypto czar. By the end of the week, SEC Chair and longtime crypto foe Gensler, whose term doesn’t expire until June 2026, announced he was retiring on inauguration day.\n\nOne of Trump’s promises to his crypto fans on the campaign was that he would fire the SEC head and choose crypto-friendly regulators if elected. Gensler may have taken a look at the pressure that faces him across Washington and decided it just wasn’t worth trying to stick it out.\n\n“Welcome to America’s most pro-crypto Congress ever,” Armstrong wrote on X on Nov. 5.","summary":"Prior to announcing his Senate candidacy in April 2023, Bernie Moreno was&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/how-technology-enthusiasts-purchased-a-congress-that-strongly-supports-cryptocurrency/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-How-tech-bros-bought-‘Americas-most-pro-crypto-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 00:46:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":266760148,"title":"How The Trump Administration Could Reshape The Defense Industry In 2025","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nBUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 05: Elon Musk embraces Republican presidential nominee, former ... [+] President Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on October 05, 2024 in Butler, Pennsylvania. This is the first time that Trump has returned to Butler since he was injured during an attempted assassination on July 13. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nDonald Trump’s argument that the government is rigged and the deep state is out of control resonates with a significant part of his base.\n\nFor example, President-elect Trump launched a harsh critique of the state of the defense industry at a September 2024 campaign stop in Wisconsin, where he said the following:\n\n“I will expel warmongers. We have these people, they want to go to war all the time. You know why? Missiles are $2 million apiece. That’s why. They love to drop missiles all over the place.” And then he added, referring to his previous presidency, “I had no wars.”\n\nIt is an open question as to whether the president-elect will follow through on this hard-hitting rhetoric. In his 2016 campaign for president he criticized defense contractors for overcharging the government but built an alliance with the industry once he took office.\n\nThe partnership began during preparations for Trump’s first foreign trip, to Saudi Arabia. One of the president’s goals for the trip was to conclude a massive arms deal with the Saudi regime, in part to burnish his image as a deal maker, and in part to create jobs in America.\n\nThe administration consulted some industry leaders in assembling the arms package. Most notably, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner called the CEO to give Saudi Arabia a discount on an $18 billion THAAD missile defense system.\n\nMORE FROMFORBES VETTED\n\nThis Viral Smart Bassinet Is 30% Off With The Snoo Black Friday Sale\n\nJordan Thomas\n\nForbes Staff\n\nThe 50 Best Black Friday Deals So Far, According To Our Deals Editors\n\nKara Cuzzone\n\nForbes Staff\n\nArms sales to Saudi Arabia during Trump’s first term were far less than advertised -$22 billion versus a promised level of $110 billion. But that didn’t prevent Trump from claiming that sales to Saudi Arabia supported 500,000 jobs in America. A survey of experts by Washington Post fact checking columnist Glenn Kessler suggested that the real figure was likely about one-tenth of what the president was claiming. But most Americans never saw the Post’s correction, so President Trump’s image as a job creator was enhanced by sales to the Kingdom.\n\nThe ultimate test of Trump’s loyalty to arms makers came in the wake of the Saudi government’s brutal murder of U.S.-resident dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, when there was widespread pressure to suspend U.S. arms transfers to the regime. Trump put out a statement saying that he didn’t want to suspend sales because it would reduce business for “Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors.” Can President Trump change course and police the behavior of firms that he defended so doggedly last time he was in power?\n\nThe other issue that could impact the Trump administration’s approach to the defense sector involves the close ties of key officials to Silicon Valley military tech firms. It is now known that Peter Thiel, the founder of up and coming emerging military tech firm Palantir, has been a mentor and financial supporter of vice-president J.D. Vance, employing him at one of his firms and donating millions to support his successful run for the Senate from Ohio. And then there’s Elon Musk, who spent $119 million on activities designed to get Donald Trump elected and\n\nis now slated to co-chair Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DoGE). Musk’s firm, Space-X, launches all of the U.S. military’s satellites, as well as ensuring internet access to Ukrainian soldiers attempting to fend off Russian invaders, using his company's Starlink system. Space-X recently received a contract to develop a version of Starlink adapted to the needs of the U.S. military.\n\nWhether or not the new administration launches a campaign to reduce the influence of defense contractors, there is another equally consequential issue at hand — whether it takes sides in the impending battle for funds between legacy firms like Lockheed Martin, that make large weapons platforms like ships and combat aircraft, and firms like Palantir and Anduril, that make smaller, more nimble systems that use complex software and often incorporate AI. Anduril, founded by Palmer Luckey, a protege of Peter Thiel, has published a manifesto entitled “Rebooting the Arsenal of Democracy” that basically argues that the current crop of military mega-firms are ill-suited to develop the weapons of the future and should therefore step aside and make room for a new generation of innovative, tech savvy firms that can get the job done.\n\nPentagon officials have spoken enthusiastically about emerging tech, but it has yet to match its rhetoric with significant funding. The bulk of the Pentagon’s investment funds still go to large platforms like aircraft carriers, bombers, fighter planes, and armored vehicles, and the members of Congress from states and districts where these systems are built want to keep it that way. If the Trump administration weighs in heavily on one of the two sides — legacy systems versus emerging tech — it could help determine the shape of the defense sector for decades to come.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nWilliam Hartung\n\nEditorial Standards\n\nForbes Accolades","summary":"If  the Trump administration weighs in heavily in the fight between legacy defense contractors and emerging tech firms it could determine the shape of the defense sector for decades to come.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/11/23/how-the-trump-administration-could-reshape-the-defense-industry-in-2025/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/673bef5685b3bb00a3f71950/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 00:40:27","author":"Contributor,William Hartung","authors":["Contributor","William Hartung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":266760624,"title":"Lt.

While 42 percent said inflation would rise.\n\nOne proposal that did enjoy widespread popularity was eliminating taxes on tips and overtime, with 66 percent saying they somewhat or strongly agree with the policy. \n\nNearly half of the respondents, 45 percent, also approved of new tariffs on imported goods that Trump has frequently touted.\n\nThere is also a strong support for moving to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, with 78 percent backing peace talks. \n\nWhile Trump has not clarified the scope or implementation of the potential pardons, lawyers are already making moves by filing the necessary paperwork. \n\nApproximately 547 defendants were charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees. \n\nAround 163 individuals have also been accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious injury to an officer, according to the US Attorney’s Office.\n\nIn addition, 140 police officers were assaulted at the Capitol on January 6, and about 11 individuals faced charges for assaulting members of the media. \n\nThose pardons would be determined on a ‘case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House,’ campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt had said. \n\nAt least one convicted rioter has also argued that the former president’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris is a vindication of their actions. \n\nAmong those hoping to be pardoned is Christopher Carnell, whose lawyers asked a federal judge to delay a hearing in his case hours after the election was called.\n\n‘Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump made multiple clemency promises to the Jan. 6 defendants, particularly to those who were non-violent participants,’ the attorneys wrote, according to the New York Times. \n\n‘Mr. Carnell, who was an 18-year-old nonviolent entrant into the Capitol on Jan. 6 is expected to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.’\n\nFederal judge Beryl A Howell swiftly rejected the motion, without offering an explanation.\n\nAttorneys for other January 6 rioters have said they will file similar motions – with even the lawyers for former Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio suggesting they would fight his conviction once Trump is back in office.\n\nThe lawyers released a statement following Trump’s victory saying they wanted to ‘explore every possible avenue’ to win Tarrio’s release. He is currently behind bars, serving 22 years in prison for his role in the insurrection.\n\n‘We look forward to what the future holds, both in terms of the judicial process for our client and the broader political landscape under the new administration,’ the lawyers said.\n\nSome rioters say they are confident they will be pardoned, with Edward Jacob ‘Jake’ Lang posting on Wednesday: ‘I’M COMING HME!!!! THE JANUARY 6 POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE FINALLY COMING HOME!!!!’\n\n‘In just 75 days, on January 20, 2025, when Donald J Trump is inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States, he will pardon all of the J6 Hostages,’ Lang asserted.\n\nHe is currently serving time in jail, after federal prosecutors charged him with wielding a dangerous weapon against Capitol Police officers and obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nFootage from the mayhem shows him hitting officers with a bat ‘multiple times,’ according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nDerrick Evans, who was sentenced to three months behind bars in June 2022, also told Newsweek he is ‘100 percent confident’ Trump will pardon at least the nonviolent offenders.\n\n‘And you might even see J6ers joining the administration or going back to DC as members of Congress, or Senate even,’ he suggested. \n\nMeanwhile, convicted rioter Zachary Alam told a federal judge on Thursday he deserved a new classification of pardon, which he called a ‘full pardon of patriotism,’ ABC News reports. \n\nHe argued it should come with monetary compensation, expungement of the charges on his criminal record and assurance he would never be charged again – characterizing anything less as a ‘second-class pardon.’\n\nAlam has not denied his participation in the Capitol riot, but has defended his actions by saying he was doing the right thing to protect democracy.\n\n‘True patriots do the right thing in spite of everything else,’ he argued, claiming his fellow rioters ‘fought, cried, bled and died for what is right.’\n\nHe then asked whether the insurgency was truly a threat to democracy if the American people re-elected the former president.\n\n‘Sometimes you have to break the rules to do the right thing,’ Alam claimed.\n\nBut federal judge Dabney Friedlich said Alam’s actions on January 6, 2021 were a ‘full-throated’ attack on the US Constitution and ‘not the acts of a patriot.’ \n\nShe went on to call him one of the ‘most violent and aggressive rioters’ that day, after law enforcement officials testified that he told them, ‘I’m going to f*** you up.’\n\nFederal prosecutors also accused Alam of knocking out the glass door of the Speaker’s Lobby and pushing up against three Capitol Police officers who were trying to keep the angry mob from entering the floor of the House of Representatives – where Congressmembers were certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nAlam also allegedly scaled four floors of the Capitol, kicked doors and threw a velvet rope over a balcony in an attempt to hit officers below, the Department of Justice alleged.\n\nHe then allegedly shouted to his fellow rioters they ‘need guns’ before he fled the scene.\n\nAlam was ultimately sentenced to eight years in prison with three years supervised release – despite Trump’s win.","summary":"New polling has suggested Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to president-elect Donald Trump&#8217;s&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/public-opinion-on-trumps-pardon-plan-for-january-6-protesters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-What-America-REALLY-thinks-of-Trumps-plan-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 00:24:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":266759374,"title":"MSNBC contributor trashes network, shreds ‘Morning Joe’ colleagues over Trump meeting: ‘This is not working’","text":"MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin went on an unprecedented tear against her own network as well as her “Morning Joe” colleagues Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski on her podcast, defiantly criticizing her employer’s business model and ratcheting up her attacks towards the duo for revealing their meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. \n\nOn Friday’s installment of “Jen Rubin’s Green Room,” Rubin accused Scarborough and Brzezinski of “forgetting” that their audience “despises Trump” and that viewers wanted them to “hold the line against Trump” instead of engaging with the incoming president. \n\n“What were they thinking? Who do they think their audience was?” Rubin asked. “Well, perhaps this wasn’t about their audience. Perhaps this was them trying to defend themselves or avoid retribution that they thought was coming their way. But really, these are rich, famous people. What have they got to worry about? It was just an appalling example at how eager so many elites are to fall in line, to curry favor, to deflect attention, to deflect any kind of incoming criticism that might come their way from the White House.”\n\n“So they are getting hammered for it. They are hemorrhaging their audience. And this, of course, only exacerbates the reason and the problem why MSNBC and its other cable networks are being spun off. And that is, cable television is dying,” Rubin said. “Most of you probably haven’t watched MSNBC since the election either, and not understanding your audience and continuing to serve up the same chewed-over talking points with the same panels, essentially same program day, after day, after day, hour after hour, is no longer working. So Comcast has said, ‘Fine, spin you off. You guys go fend for yourselves. And the question after the spin-off is completed will be whether that’s a viable business model. Can they afford to pay Rachel Maddow, God bless her, 20 plus million dollars a year? Is there advertising to support that? Are there cable fees to support that? We don’t know. We don’t know if MSNBC, a year from now, is gonna exist, or whether it’s gonna be in some slim down fashion.”\n\nRubin, also a Washington Post columnist, went on by offering suggestions on how MSNBC can “rethink their model.” \n\n“Get rid of the pattern of chewing over the same three or four stories all day long with a shuffling of panelists all parroting back the same line to the host, this is not working. It’s boring. It’s not good TV. They need to do something else, and they should look to models that are successful,” Rubin said. “They should look to people like The Onion. Hey, they’ve purchased Info Wars. I can’t wait to watch what they’re gonna program. They should look to shows that, yes, are perhaps lighter on the news, but actually have much more information than they do.” \n\nShe went on to say that viewers “get more from a John Oliver monologue” than they do “from a day or two of watching CNN or MSNBC.”\n\n“And by the way, I’m an MSNBC contributor,” Rubin reminded her liberal audience. “At least I have the honesty, I have the candor, to tell you this is not gonna work, and this is not continuing to work. And what’s more, by hanging on to these legacy outlets that are failing, I think Democrats fail to explore other options. They fail to look for other avenues to communicate with the public. They are relying on dying outlets in a dying industry, cable TV news, and they have to be way more innovative, way more creative in figuring out ways to reach people, including people who don’t like politics all that much, and that’s the big challenge. Those were the people who, frankly, went along voting for Trump because they did not know too much about what he had in mind and what he had planned, and really his threat to their well-being.” \n\n“So I think once we get past a stage in which we are doing the same thing over and over again, otherwise known as the definition of insanity- if you expect a different result, then perhaps we can experience some innovation, and maybe we can expect something better from news… But you know one thing, you can always come here, because I’m gonna tell you what I think. I’m gonna be provocative… We’re gonna tell the truth. We’re gonna talk to you. I want to hear from you, because unlike Mika and Joe, I care about my audience, and I wanna hear what you think,” Rubin added. \n\nRubin did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. A spokesperson for MSNBC declined to comment.\n\nWhile Rubin is currently urging MSNBC to get rid of the formula of “panelists all parroting back the same line to the host,” she was notably vocal against NBC’s hiring of former RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel (she was fired following swift backlash from the network’s liberal stars). \n\nRubin previously fueled a boycott against “Morning Joe.”\n\n“The market works great. You can stop watching Morning Joe anytime,” Rubin wrote on social media Monday.\n\nShe then added on the social media site BlueSky:, “On MJ: If you don’t appreciate the audience you have, betray that audience and lose their trust you are [going] to lose lots of them. I have seen this movie.”\n\nRubin was also outspoken against her other employer The Washington Post and its billionaire over Jeff Bezos over his decision to halt the paper’s endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the election. \n\n“First of all, I do not believe the reason stated. I don’t believe they have suddenly decided — he has suddenly decided that we should endorse everybody except presidential candidates, and that of all the elections, this is the one to start with this new policy,” Rubin said on her podcast last month. “We endorsed a presidential candidate in 2020 no problem. And I perceive this, and even if it’s not intended, it is inevitably perceived as bending the knee to Donald Trump at the worst possible moment when democracy is on the line.”\n\n“You have a billionaire who has a business aside from the Post that does business with the federal government deciding not to run afoul of a man who has declared war on democracy and on the free press, and I still find it absolutely inconceivable that someone who owns a newspaper would do this,” she continued.”","summary":"\"What were they thinking?

On the one hand, Trump has indicated that he will be resorting to tariffs to — according to him — settle the United States trade accounts with other countries and economic blocs, in particular, the People’s Republic of China and the European Union. Trump suggested that he is contemplating a base tariff of between 10% and 20% on the entry of products to the United States, a rate that for China could be raised to between 40% and 60%.\n\nAn environment of rising tariffs—the tax that some products must pay to enter a country — is unfavorable for Panama, both because of its impact on the returns generated by the Canal and the logistics sector, as well as because of the increase in the price of goods that usually follows. For example, trade tensions between the United States and China could put pressure on the trans-Pacific route that connects the production centers of Asia — in China, Japan and South Korea — with the Atlantic coast of the United States, moving everything from cars and electronics to clothing. The Panama Canal is a key part of this route and a trade decline would increase the possibility of lower incomes.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has been characterized by having a transactional attitude – his first book, published in 1987, was called The Art of Deal – and the president-elect has shown himself willing to renegotiate trade agreements that other administrations had no interest in reviewing, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1994. It was replaced in 2020, during Trump’s first presidency, by the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement. Such an attitude opens the door to the possibility of effective diplomacy by Panama to review its trade relationship with the United States and even to have fresh discussions on expanding the Trade Promotion Treaty, signed in 2007 between the two countries. It entered into force in 2012.\n\nThe value of exports from Panama to the United States under the treaty has increased since it came into force, rising from $51,000 in 2013 to nearly five million in 2017 and more than nine million at the end of last year. And the increase was also seen in the other direction: in 2013, the first full year of the Trade Promotion Agreement with the United States, Panama imported —specifically under this agreement — a value in dollars of $587 million. By 2022, the value of imports under the agreement almost doubled, exceeding one billion dollars. However, these figures must be seen in the light of the general figures for foreign trade between the two countries, including trade that does not fall under the parameters of the treaty. For reference, the value of total imports from the United States to Panama in 2012—both overall and under the treaty—was nearly $3 billion, a level around which it has remained since then. It fell due to the pandemic, but recovered robustly in 2022. In contrast, the value of exports from Panama to the United States — in general — fell from $160 million in 2012 to $121 million in 2022. A potential trade conversation between Panama and the United States under Trump’s new leadership would necessarily include multiple topics. Perhaps of greatest interest would be Panama’s participation in U.S. nearshoring efforts — bringing production historically shifted from China to American allies — particularly through Panama’s inclusion in the semiconductor and electronic component supply chain. Another necessary issue would be the continent’s energy security and the distribution of American liquefied natural gas there, in the face of growing geopolitical turbulence at the international level.\n\nHowever, before being able to develop any trade talks with the United States, Panama will have to define precisely what its foreign trade policy for goods will be for the next decade, in which areas it wishes to specialize and how it will achieve the efficiencies necessary to have competitive production. For reference, imports of goods from the United States to Panama in 2023 were worth $2.7 billion, while from China they were worth $1.762 billion and from Mexico they were $625 million, being the three countries from which the most was imported to Panama. In contrast, the country to which Panama exported the most in 2023 was China, with a value of $1,316 million in exports. It was followed by Japan with $442 million and South Korea with $233 million. The United States is the sixth country in the export table, with $148 million. And after all, what does Panama import and export? In 2023, Panama’s top three exports — by value, not weight — were copper for $2.469 billion, bananas for $148 million and fish for $129 million. That same year, Panama’s three main imports — by value — were fuel and oils for cars and machinery for $2,694 million, medicines for $640 million and corn for $160 million.","summary":"Panama City, Panama: The arrival of Donald Trump to the White House in the United States in January, represents the opening...","url":"https://newsroompanama.com/2024/11/23/trump-tariffs-and-panamas-foreign-trade/","image":"https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/trump-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 00:01:45","author":"Newsroom Panama","authors":["Newsroom Panama"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pa","sentiment":0.155},{"id":266761648,"title":"Explaining the right: Why they hate liberals fleeing to Bluesky","text":"Following the 2024 election, many users have left Elon Musk’s X and the main beneficiary has been the Bluesky social network. For the first time, Bluesky reported that it had surpassed 20 million users.\n\n On paper, this would seem to be a great development for the right wingers on X. The liberals they detest are moving out of the digital neighborhood and their leader has the ear of the incoming president, Donald Trump. All is well, one would think.\n\nInstead, conservatives are whining about the exodus and some, like Joel Berry of the (not very funny) conservative satire site Babylon Bee, are fuming that their attempts to join Bluesky are being met with opposition. Why is this happening?\n\nOver the last decade-plus, conservatism has adopted a culture best described as “owning the libs.” The overriding drive behind this is to publicly demonstrate some sort of dominance over liberals as a way (they think) of exhibiting the superiority of conservatism. One would think that if conservative ideas are so great that they could merely win any argument—cutting taxes for the wealthy, deregulating big business, supporting discrimination, what’s not to like?\n\nFor the right, it’s a lot easier to try and point and laugh, eternally arguing that conservative ideas and memes are so good, so powerful, so correct that liberals are constantly “triggered” and having “meltdowns.” The way conservatives seek to demonstrate this is through cruelty, and as writer Adam Serwer brilliantly articulated at The Atlantic, “the cruelty is the point.”\n\nIn right-wing media like Fox News, a staple of content is extended recapping of purportedly liberal programming like “The View” to document liberal anger at conservatism.\n\nTrump is the perfect avatar of this way of looking at the world. While he could not make a cogent argument on policy to save his life, Trump is quite good at hurling a barrage of insults or ignorance that upsets people who truly care about things.\n\nThis was why Trump had such a good time on Twitter before he was banned for inciting the insurrection on Jan. 6, and it is the kind of behavior Musk has fostered since he took over the company and removed Trump’s ban.\n\nConservatives on the social network, taking their lead from Musk and his troll army of devoted followers, live to “own the libs.”\n\nBluesky has said they value community over harassment and have put in tools and functions that—while flawed—are more in line with the tools available on Twitter before Musk took over. So if the “libs” move somewhere else, like Bluesky, there aren’t any liberals to own.\n\nWithout liberals to dogpile on and demonstrate their dominance, conservatives have to tolerate their own company. This is the problem that has faced other conservative social media networks in the past, including Parler and Trump’s own Truth Social. Parler was more useful as a tool to organize terroristic attacks than as a traditional social media network for this reason.\n\nIt turns out that these people need the liberals they hate so much to give meaning to their (apparently) sad online lives.\n\nThe shift to Bluesky could be a temporary blip or a long-term trend, but right now people are using one of the most valuable weapons one can wield online—attention—and turning it away from Musk’s pro-Trump horror show. Many people have decided that no matter the global reach and breadth of X, it just might not be worth it to empower a bigot like Musk.\n\nNot having the libs to own, after making the behavior such a big part of their lives, has created a vacuum for the right. In that way, the libs have now owned them.\n\nAre you sick and tired of Elon Musk? Click this link for instant access to Daily Kos and staff accounts on Bluesky.

She said this shared apprehension had prompted Japan and South Korea to strengthen their trilateral cooperation with the US.\nOn Tuesday, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated the transatlantic security alliance’s commitment to Ukraine and support for its use of Western-supplied weapons without restrictions, while stressing the importance of flexibility as the war entered its 1,000th day.\nThe deployment of North Korean troops has raised fears that the conflict’s reach could extend from Europe to the Indo-Pacific, particularly as reports surface of military technology flowing from Moscow to Pyongyang, Curtin University’s Takao said.\n\nNorth Korea lacks experience in modern combat, having avoided large-scale warfare since the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean war.\nHowever, its involvement in the Ukraine conflict presents a rare opportunity “to gain practical combat experience”, Takao said – even as Japan continues to grapple with the unresolved issue of North Korea’s abduction of its citizens.\nIn a parliamentary address last month, Ishiba said that resolving the abduction issue remained his government’s “most important task”, framing it as a humanitarian crisis as the families of the abductees age.\nTokyo maintains that 17 Japanese citizens were abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, with 12 believed to still be in the North. For its part, Pyongyang insists that eight of the abductees have died and the other four were never kidnapped, effectively arguing that there is no case to answer.\nJapan’s attempts to seek cooperation from the US and South Korea on the matter have been hindered by the uncertain geopolitical landscape, particularly with Donald Trump’s re-election casting doubt on future negotiations.\n“While Trump is seen as capable of engaging [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un in negotiations, his transactional approach could complicate matters,” Takao warned.\n“If North Korea secures a steady supply of resources and technology from Russia, it might reduce its willingness to negotiate, leaving Japan with fewer bargaining tools.”","summary":"With thousands of North Korean troops deployed to support Moscow, Japan’s commitment to Ukraine is being put to the test like never before.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3287760/will-japan-arm-ukraine-north-korea-reinforces-russia","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/11/22/720d517f-0f42-40f0-a1f7-f65d14d62f05_33ae41a6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-24 00:00:09","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.397},{"id":266760214,"title":"Hochul criticizes reduction in border crossing hours","text":"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, strongly criticizes the Biden administration for cutting back office hours at four border crossings in the northern region due to a continuous increase in immigration.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials announced that hours will be reduced at 38 sites—including four in New York state—beginning Jan. 6 in collaboration with the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nThe federal agency said it would allow customs officers to be shifted to other, busier ports of entry.\n\nBut Hochul said she “opposes” the move and is calling on the Biden administration to boost staffing along the U.S.-Canadian border, which has seen an uptick in illegal crossings over the past year. \n\n“While the Biden-Harris Administration has achieved measurable success in enhancing southern border security, New York is experiencing a dramatic increase in irregular crossings along our northern border,” she said in a statement. “We need to expand enforcement at the northern border today and I call on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to reverse this decision.”\n\nNew York has redirected $5 million in federal State Homeland Security Program funding to enhance security efforts along the state’s border with Canada, Hochul said, including by purchasing additional tools to support investigations into transnational criminal organizations. \n\n“While these important resources will help keep New Yorkers safe and manage the spike in illegal border crossings, greater federal support is crucial to meet the magnitude of migration we are seeing,” she said.\n\nHochul also criticized Republicans in Congress for failing to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill earlier this year “that would have given states like New York greater resources to handle the influx of migrants nationwide, and New York can no longer afford to wait for federal lawmakers to act.” \n\nNew York Republicans, including Rep. Elise Stefanik — whose district shares a border with Canada — have long been calling for stepped-up scrutiny of the northern border. \n\n“Enough is enough,” Stefanik said in a recent statement. “Our rural communities are struggling due to the America Last policies of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Kathy Hochul, and Chuck Schumer.”\n\nTo be sure, northern border crossings are rising, with U.S. Customs and Border Protection data for fiscal 2024 showing a record-breaking 198,929 apprehensions and encounters, up from the previous fiscal year, which also broke records.\n\nThat figure is still dwarfed by the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw more than 1.5 million such apprehensions during the same timeframe, according to the federal agency. \n\nRepublicans and others have pointed to New York City’s “sanctuary” status and other Democratic-backed policies they say have encouraged more than 230,000 migrants to flood the city over the past two years. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s incoming border czar, Tom Homan, has pledged to oversee the “largest immigration crackdown in U.S. history” and has put New York City officials on notice that ICE will be ramping up their presence if the sanctuary city doesn’t begin cooperating with enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nMayor Eric Adams has signaled a willingness to work with the incoming Trump administration on the migrant crisis but has insisted that the city will remain a sanctuary city.","summary":"New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, strongly criticizes the Biden administration&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/hochul-criticizes-reduction-in-border-crossing-hours/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hochul-blasts-move-to-cut-border-crossing-hours-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:59:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":266757510,"title":"Following his disproval of Project 2025, Trump is now appointing the individuals who created and influenced the project to important positions.","text":"WASHINGTON – As a former and potentially future president, Donald Trump hailed what would become Project 2025 as a road map for “exactly what our movement will do” with another crack at the White House.\n\nAs the blueprint for a hard-right turn in America became a liability during the 2024 campaign, Trump pulled an about-face. He denied knowing anything about the “ridiculous and abysmal” plans written in part by his first-term aides and allies.\n\nNow, after being elected the 47th president on Nov. 5, Trump is stocking his second administration with key players in the detailed effort he temporarily shunned. Most notably, Trump has tapped Russell Vought for an encore as director of the Office of Management and Budget; Tom Homan, his former immigration chief, as “border czar;” and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of policy.\n\nThose moves have accelerated criticisms from Democrats who warn that Trump’s election hands government reins to movement conservatives who spent years envisioning how to concentrate power in the West Wing and impose a starkly rightward shift across the U.S. government and society.\n\nTrump and his aides maintain that he won a mandate to overhaul Washington. But they maintain the specifics are his alone.\n\n“President Trump never had anything to do with Project 2025,” said Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in a statement. “All of President Trumps’ Cabinet nominees and appointments are whole-heartedly committed to President Trump’s agenda, not the agenda of outside groups.”\n\nHere is a look at what some of Trump’s choices portend for his second presidency.\n\nAs budget chief, Vought envisions a sweeping, powerful perch\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget director, a role Vought held under Trump previously and requires Senate confirmation, prepares a president’s proposed budget and is generally responsible for implementing the administration’s agenda across agencies.\n\nThe job is influential but Vought made clear as author of a Project 2025 chapter on presidential authority that he wants the post to wield more direct power.\n\n“The Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President’s mind,” Vought wrote. The OMB, he wrote, “is a President’s air-traffic control system” and should be “involved in all aspects of the White House policy process,” becoming “powerful enough to override implementing agencies’ bureaucracies.”\n\nTrump did not go into such details when naming Vought but implicitly endorsed aggressive action. Vought, the president-elect said, “knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State” — Trump’s catch-all for federal bureaucracy — and would help “restore fiscal sanity.”\n\nIn June, speaking on former Trump aide Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, Vought relished the potential tension: “We’re not going to save our country without a little confrontation.”\n\nVought could help Musk and Trump remake government’s role and scope\n\nThe strategy of further concentrating federal authority in the presidency permeates Project 2025’s and Trump’s campaign proposals. Vought’s vision is especially striking when paired with Trump’s proposals to dramatically expand the president’s control over federal workers and government purse strings — ideas intertwined with the president-elect tapping mega-billionaire Elon Musk and venture capitalist Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency.”\n\nTrump in his first term sought to remake the federal civil service by reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers — who have job protection through changes in administration — as political appointees, making them easier to fire and replace with loyalists. Currently, only about 4,000 of the federal government’s roughly 2 million workers are political appointees. President Joe Biden rescinded Trump’s changes. Trump can now reinstate them.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s and Ramaswamy’s sweeping “efficiency” mandates from Trump could turn on an old, defunct constitutional theory that the president — not Congress — is the real gatekeeper of federal spending. In his “Agenda 47,” Trump endorsed so-called “impoundment,” which holds that when lawmakers pass appropriations bills, they simply set a spending ceiling, but not a floor. The president, the theory holds, can simply decide not to spend money on anything he deems unnecessary.\n\nVought did not venture into impoundment in his Project 2025 chapter. But, he wrote, “The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”\n\nTrump’s choice immediately sparked backlash.\n\n“Russ Vought is a far-right ideologue who has tried to break the law to give President Trump unilateral authority he does not possess to override the spending decisions of Congress (and) who has and will again fight to give Trump the ability to summarily fire tens of thousands of civil servants,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat and outgoing Senate Appropriations chairwoman.\n\nReps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, leading Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, said Vought wants to “dismantle the expert federal workforce” to the detriment of Americans who depend on everything from veterans’ health care to Social Security benefits.\n\n“Pain itself is the agenda,” they said.\n\nHoman and Miller reflect Trump’s and Project 2025’s immigration overl\n\nTrump’s protests about Project 2025 always glossed over overlaps in the two agendas. Both want to reimpose Trump-era immigration limits. Project 2025 includes a litany of detailed proposals for various U.S. immigration statutes, executive branch rules and agreements with other countries — reducing the number of refugees, work visa recipients and asylum seekers, for example.\n\nMiller is one of Trump’s longest-serving advisers and architect of his immigration ideas, including his promise of the largest deportation force in U.S. history. As deputy policy chief, which is not subject to Senate confirmation, Miller would remain in Trump’s West Wing inner circle.\n\n“America is for Americans and Americans only,” Miller said at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27.\n\n“America First Legal,” Miller’s organization founded as an ideological counter to the American Civil Liberties Union, was listed as an advisory group to Project 2025 until Miller asked that the name be removed because of negative attention.\n\nHoman, a Project 2025 named contributor, was an acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director during Trump’s first presidency, playing a key role in what became known as Trump’s “family separation policy.”\n\nPreviewing Trump 2.0 earlier this year, Homan said: “No one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”\n\nProject 2025 contributors slated for CIA and Federal Communications chiefs\n\nJohn Ratcliffe, Trump’s pick to lead the CIA, was previously one of Trump’s directors of national intelligence. He is a Project 2025 contributor. The document’s chapter on U.S. intelligence was written by Dustin Carmack, Ratcliffe’s chief of staff in the first Trump administration.\n\nReflecting Ratcliffe’s and Trump’s approach, Carmack declared the intelligence establishment too cautious. Ratcliffe, like the chapter attributed to Carmack, is hawkish toward China. Throughout the Project 2025 document, Beijing is framed as a U.S. adversary that cannot be trusted.\n\nBrendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, wrote Project 2025’s FCC chapter and is now Trump’s pick to chair the panel. Carr wrote that the FCC chairman “is empowered with significant authority that is not shared” with other FCC members. He called for the FCC to address “threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,” specifically “Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.”\n\nHe called for more stringent transparency rules for social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube and “empower consumers to choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any.”\n\nCarr and Ratcliffe would require Senate confirmation for their posts.","summary":"WASHINGTON – As a former and potentially future president, Donald Trump hailed&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/following-his-disproval-of-project-2025-trump-is-now-appointing-the-individuals-who-created-and-influenced-the-project-to-important-positions/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/rewrite-this-title-After-Trump039s-Project-2025-denials-he-is-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:59:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":266757462,"title":"'Never-Trump' columnist ridiculed for calling Trump's Cabinet '1,000 shades of white'","text":"Never-Trump' columnist ridiculed for calling Trump's Cabinet '1,000 shades of white'\n\nREAD MORE: Bill Maher laughs as he brutally roasts Trump's cabinet picks\n\nFollow DailyMail.com's politics live blog for all the latest news and updates\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:50 GMT, 23 November 2024 | Updated: 23:57 GMT, 23 November 2024\n\nWashington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin is being ridiculed for calling Donald Trump's cabinet nominations '1,000 shades of white'. \n\nRubin, 62, a former conservative commentator at the Jeff Bezos-owned paper, now largely advocates for Democrats and on her podcast, 'Jen Rubin's Green Room.'\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Rubin did not hold back as she ripped Trump's nominations over the color of their skin. \n\n'Many of these people including Tulsi Gabbard have backgrounds that would never make them eligible for any government post, let alone for secretaries of these important government agencies,' Rubin began.\n\n'But I do think there are a couple of things going on.

In line to lead the Department of Health and Human Services secretary is environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine organizer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nTrump’s choices don’t have experience running large bureaucratic agencies, but they know how to talk about health on TV.\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid pick Dr. Mehmet Oz hosted a talk show for 13 years and is a well-known wellness and lifestyle influencer. The pick for the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Marty Makary, and for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, are frequent Fox News contributors.\n\nMany on the list were critical of COVID-19 measures like masking and booster vaccinations for young people. Some of them have ties to Florida like many of Trump’s other Cabinet nominees: Dave Weldon, the pick for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, represented the state in Congress for 14 years and is affiliated with a medical group on the state’s Atlantic coast. Nesheiwat’s brother-in-law is Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., tapped by Trump as national security adviser.\n\nHere’s a look at the nominees’ potential role in carrying out what Kennedy says is the task to “reorganize” agencies, which have an overall $1.7 trillion budget, employ 80,000 scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials, and effect Americans’ daily lives:\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nThe Atlanta-based CDC, with a $9.2 billion core budget, is charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.\n\nKennedy has long attacked vaccines and criticized the CDC, repeatedly alleging corruption at the agency. He said on a 2023 podcast that there is “no vaccine that is safe and effective,” and urged people to resist the CDC’s guidelines about if and when kids should get vaccinated. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past 50 years, and that 100 million of them were infants.\n\nDecades ago, Kennedy found common ground with Weldon, 71, who served in the Army and worked as an internal medicine doctor before he represented a central Florida congressional district from 1995 to 2009.\n\nStarting in the early 2000s, Weldon had a prominent part in a debate about whether there was a relationship between a vaccine preservative called thimerosal and autism. He was a founding member of the Congressional Autism Caucus and tried to ban thimerosal from all vaccines. Kennedy, then a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, believed there was a tie between thimerosal and autism and also charged that the government hid documents showing the danger.\n\nSince 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Meanwhile, study after study after study found no evidence that thimerosal caused autism.\n\nWeldon’s congressional voting record suggests he may go along with Republican efforts to downsize the CDC, including to eliminate the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, which works on topics like drownings, drug overdoses and shooting deaths. Weldon also voted to ban federal funding for needle-exchange programs as an approach to reduce overdoses, and the National Rifle Association gave him an “A” rating for his pro-gun rights voting record.\n\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nKennedy is extremely critical of the FDA, which has 18,000 employees and is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, vaccines and other medical products, as well as overseeing cosmetics, electronic cigarettes and most foods.\n\nMakary, Trump’s pick to run the FDA, is closely aligned with Kennedy on several topics. The professor at Johns Hopkins University who is a trained surgeon and cancer specialist has decried the overprescribing of drugs, the use of pesticides on foods and the undue influence of pharmaceutical and insurance companies over doctors and government regulators.\n\nKennedy has suggested he’ll clear out “entire” FDA departments and also recently threatened to fire FDA employees for “aggressive suppression” of a host of unsubstantiated products and therapies, including stem cells, raw milk, psychedelics and discredited COVID-era treatments like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nMakary’s contrarian views during the COVID-19 pandemic included questioning the need for masking and giving young kids COVID-19 vaccine boosters.\n\nBut anything Makary and Kennedy might want to do when it comes to unwinding FDA regulations or revoking long-standing vaccine and drug approvals would be challenging. The agency has lengthy requirements for removing medicines from the market, which are based on federal laws passed by Congress.\n\nCenters for Medicaid and Medicare Services\n\nThe agency provides health care coverage for more than 160 million people through Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, and also sets Medicare payment rates for hospitals, doctors and other providers. With a $1.1 trillion budget and more than 6,000 employees, Oz has a massive agency to run if confirmed — and an agency that Kennedy hasn’t talked about much when it comes to his plans.\n\nWhile Trump tried to scrap the Affordable Care Act in his first term, Kennedy has not taken aim at it yet. But he has been critical of Medicaid and Medicare for covering expensive weight-loss drugs — though they’re not widely covered by either.\n\nTrump said during his campaign that he would protect Medicare, which provides insurance for older Americans. Oz has endorsed expanding Medicare Advantage — a privately run version of Medicare that is popular but also a source of widespread fraud — in an AARP questionnaire during his failed 2022 bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania and in a 2020 Forbes op-ed with a former Kaiser Permanente CEO.\n\nOz also said in a Washington Examiner op-ed with three co-writers that aging healthier and living longer could help fix the U.S. budget deficit because people would work longer and add more to the gross domestic product.\n\nNeither Trump nor Kennedy have said much about Medicaid, the insurance program for low-income Americans. Trump’s first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.\n\nSurgeon general\n\nKennedy doesn’t appear to have said much publicly about what he’d like to see from surgeon general position, which is the nation’s top doctor and oversees 6,000 U.S. Public Health Service Corps members.\n\nThe surgeon general has little administrative power, but can be an influential government spokesperson on what counts as a public health danger and what to do about it — suggesting things like warning labels for products and issuing advisories. The current surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, declared gun violence as a public health crisis in June.\n\nTrump’s pick, Nesheiwat, is employed as a New York City medical director with CityMD, a group of urgent care facilities in the New York and New Jersey area, and has been at City MD for 12 years. She also has appeared on Fox News and other TV shows, authored a book on the “transformative power of prayer” in her medical career and endorses a brand of vitamin supplements.\n\nShe encouraged COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, calling them “a gift from God” in a February 2021 Fox News op-ed, as well as anti-viral pills like Paxlovid. In a 2019 Q&A with the Women in Medicine Legacy Foundation, Nesheiwat said she is a “firm believer in preventive medicine” and “can give a dissertation on hand-washing alone.”\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nAs of Saturday, Trump had not yet named his choice to lead the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research through grants to researchers across the nation and conducts its own research. It has a $48 billion budget.\n\nKennedy has said he’d pause drug development and infectious disease research to shift the focus to chronic diseases. He’d like to keep NIH funding from researchers with conflicts of interest, and criticized the agency in 2017 for what he said was not doing enough research into the role of vaccines in autism — an idea that has long been debunked.\n\nAssociated Press writers Amanda Seitz and Matt Perrone and AP editor Erica Hunzinger contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The rest will have to come from private investors and a range of potential new sources of money, such as possible levies on fossil fuels and frequent flyers, which have yet to be agreed.\n\nMohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: “This [summit] has been a disaster for the developing world. It’s a betrayal of both people and planet, by wealthy countries who claim to take climate change seriously. Rich countries have promised to ‘mobilise’ some funds in the future, rather than provide them now. The cheque is in the mail. But lives and livelihoods in vulnerable countries are being lost now.”\n\nSome of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries fought hard during two weeks of fraught negotiations at the Cop29 UN summit in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku for a bigger slice of the money to come directly from developed countries. They also wanted more of the available finance to go to the countries most in need, instead of being shared with bigger emerging economies, such as India.\n\nTwo groups of particularly vulnerable nations, the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries, walked out of one meeting in protest late on Saturday afternoon, but later returned.\n\nThe talks were high-stakes from the start, as they opened just days after Donald Trump won re-election as US president. Trump intends to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement when he takes office in January and is likely to be hostile to providing any climate finance to the developing world.\n\nFaced with the prospect of reconvening next year with a Trump White House in place, many countries decided that failure to agree on a new financial settlement in Baku was too much of a risk.\n\nDeveloped countries insisted they could not offer any more, owing to their own budgetary constraints. “We will shoulder all the risk” if the US fails to contribute to climate finance in future, pointed out one negotiator.\n\nMany developing world countries, including India, Bolivia, Cuba and Nigeria, reacted furiously to the deal.\n\nGreen campaigners also slammed the deal. Claudio Angelo, of the Observatorio do Clima in Brazil, said: “Rich countries spent 150 years appropriating the world’s atmospheric space, 33 years loitering on climate action, and three years negotiating [a financial settlement] without putting numbers on the table. Now, with the help of an incompetent Cop presidency and using the forthcoming Trump administration as a threat, they force developing countries to accept a deal that not only doesn’t represent any actual new money but also may increase their debt.”\n\nIndia raised last-minute objections but failed to prevent it from being gavelled through by the Cop president, Azerbaijan’s environment minister Mukhtar Babayev. The country said it “could not accept” the settlement.\n\nThe host country was strongly criticised for its running of the Cop. Oil and gas make up 90% of Azerbaijan’s exports and fossil fuel interests were highly visible at the talks.\n\nSaudi Arabia also played a highly obstructive role, according to many insiders. In one extraordinary development, a Saudi official attempted to alter one key text without full consultation. The petro-state also tried repeatedly to remove references to the “transition away from fossil fuels” which was agreed at last year’s Cop28 summit.\n\n“It was clear from day one that Saudi Arabia and other fossil fuel-producing countries were going to do everything in their power to weaken the landmark Cop28 agreement on fossil fuels. At Cop29 they have deployed obstructionist tactics to dilute action on the energy transition,” said Romain Ioualalen, of the pressure group Oil Change International.\n\nThe US and China – the world’s two biggest economies, and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases – are normally key nations at the annual “conference of the parties” (Cop) under the UN framework convention on climate change. But neither played much of a public role in Baku, allowing other countries to drive the talks. The US delegation is still made up of officials from Joe Biden’s administration, but the looming presidency of Donald Trump cast a pall over their participation.\n\nThe deal will mean China will contribute to climate finance for the poor world voluntarily, unlike rich countries which are obliged to provide cash.\n\nAni Dasgupta, chief executive of the US-based World Resources Institute thinktank, said: “Despite major headwinds, negotiators in Baku eked out a deal that at least triples climate finance flowing to developing countries [from a previous longstanding goal of $100bn a year]. The $300bn goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future. The agreement recognises how critical it is for vulnerable countries to have better access to finance that does not burden them with unsustainable debt.”","summary":"Deep divisions remain after high-stakes talks end with agreement to help developing world shift to low-carbon economy\n\nRich and poor countries concluded a trillion-dollar deal on the climate crisis in the early hours of Sunday morning, after marathon talks and days of bitter recriminations ended in what campaigners said was a “betrayal”.\n\nThe developing world will receive at least $1.3tn (£1tn) a year in funds to help them shift to a low-carbon economy and cope with the impacts of extreme weather, by 2035.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/23/cop29-agrees-13tn-climate-finance-deal-but-campaigners-brand-it-a-betrayal","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84137661c7b2b21da55900df07f67769d456128d/662_1022_4088_2453/master/4088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGct","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:47:59","author":"Damian Carrington,Dharna Noor","authors":["Damian Carrington","Dharna Noor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.585},{"id":266758152,"title":"Democracy – Is It Worth The Fight?","text":"In light of recent elections, it’s very tempting to look at the argument that was once put forward that, as half the population is below average in intelligence and/or political awareness, that democracy is a flawed model and that we’d be better off adopting the model where only the elite got to vote…\n\nAh, those bloody inner city elites. Woke nonsense. Thank god we have a few people with their feet on the ground who can vote in a man of the people like Donald Trump, who’ll be taking advice from such down-to-earth people as Robert Kennedy Jnr and Elon Musk… (admittedly the latter is planning to establish a colony on Mars so that we don’t have to worry about staying “down-to-earth” or even it, but there ya go…)\n\nI still have some faith that a system where we all get a say is a much better system than one where a few special people get to make all the decisions, however the problem is that politics has rarely been an area where people put forward potential solutions and sensibly debate possible outcomes. Instead it resembles a gladiatorial contest where the winner gets to make the decisions and the losers are left with just tossing rocks until the next election.\n\nIf we take the problem of wars, I have put forward a perfect solution which none of the politicians want to know about. In a time where we should be concerned about global emissions, instead of send ships, planes and armies to another country at great extent, once war has been declared, Country A could simply say to Country B that it wanted to bomb a particular area of their country and Country B could bomb it much more cheaply because they already have troops and equipment there. In return, Country B could then say, “Well, now we’d like to retaliate and we’d like you to blow up your munitions factory with about fifty nearby civilian houses destroyed…” At this point, Country A could escalate and ask Country B to destroy an energy plant, leading to Country B retaliating by asking Country A to destroy some vital piece of infrastructure…\n\nWhen I suggested this, someone said that it was absurd and wanted to know why any country would be prepared to blow up it’s own areas and kill its own citizens, I shrugged and said that it was pretty much what happens now, except that each country has to destroy the other one’s things and then wait for the country to retaliate; my way just saves on the shipping costs. “But,” the person objected, “what would happen if one country didn’t follow through? This might mean that the whole thing would stop and before you know it, you’d have peace breaking out!” \n\nAnyway, back to democracy…\n\nThe fundamental problem is that we don’t have the various sides of politics saying that we have a big problem and we don’t know what to do about it; we have everyone arguing that they’re the only ones with the solution and the various other sides are just wrong.\n\nIf we take the recent cap on student numbers as a prime example, we have Peter Dutton telling us in his budget reply that we need to put a cap on student numbers. Now, whatever your position on this issue, I’d suggest that you’d believe that Mr Dutton is in favour of a cap. However, when Labor put forward their bill proposing a cap, the Coalition announce that they’ll oppose Labor’s bill because it’s not the cap that they want and it won’t solve the problem of housing or Mexicans or inflation or Labor’s inability to manage money. (Yes, Labor have produced two surpluses but they’re the ones who can’t manage money!)\n\nThen, of course, there’s the misinformation bill. Of course, there are two sides to the banning of misinformation. The first is that there’s a danger if it’s the government deciding what is and isn’t misinformation. We could end up in the classic Orwellian nightmare of Newspeak. However, there is also the fact that there is a genuine problem with misinformation. I mean, we’re talking about something that’s misinformation by it’s very nature and surely – just as there are laws against slandering a person – it’s reasonable to expect that people should not be able to say whatever without consequences. Does free speech give you the right to shout “Fire” in a crowded theatre, etc? Well, obviously, yes if there is a fire, but surely you should have to explain yourself if you did it for some other reason. Rather than a mature debate about what we should do about misinformation, we end up with political point scoring.\n\nActually, I did find it refreshing during the Voice debate to hear so many Coalition MPs tell us that – not only did they oppose the Voice and Treaty – but they were dead against truth telling as well. One of the few times we’ve had honesty from that bunch of liars!\n\nWhile scepticism about what the media and the politicians tell us is a sign of a healthy democracy, this doesn’t meant that cynicism is the next logical step. And that’s the trouble with the whole fake news schtick of Donald Trump: anything that threatens our world view can be dismissed as fake news, while we’re happy to believe the anecdote about some outrageous happening and generalise it to all schools, all politicians, all churches, all LGTBI groups, all inner city people, all Americans.\n\nAnd this isn’t good for healthy debates about real problems that nobody has the complete answer for. It doesn’t help when people don’t know the difference between “communist” and “totalitarian” as in the comment about Jeff Bezos which I put at the top. It’s pretty hard to believe that the richest man in the world is running Amazon like a socialist collective in any way.\n\nPerhaps Winston Churchill got it right when he said: “Democracy is the worst form of government apart from all the others.”","summary":"In light of recent elections, it&#8217;s very tempting to look at the argument that was once put forward that, as half the population is below average in intelligence and/or political awareness, that democracy is a flawed model and that we&#8217;d be better off adopting the model where only the elite got to vote&#8230; Ah, those&#8230;\n\n\nThe post Democracy &#8211; Is It Worth The Fight? appeared first on The AIM Network.","url":"https://theaimn.com/democracy-is-it-worth-the-fight/","image":"https://theaimn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump_morrison-e1610603378839.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:40:47","author":"Denis Hay Description,Rossleigh","authors":["Denis Hay Description","Rossleigh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":266759044,"title":"The US Recognizes Edmundo González Urrutia as Venezuelan ‘President-Elect’","text":"Antony Blinken makes a Statement, months after President Nicolás Maduro claimed to have won the July contest. Blinken, the US secretary of state, recognized González in a post on X in which he also demanded “respect for the will” of Venezuelan voters. Joe Biden’s administration had previously said González earned the most votes in the disputed 28 July election, but fell short of acknowledging him as president-elect. “The Venezuelan people spoke resoundingly on July 28 and made González the president-elect,” wrote Blinken, pictured below.\n\nGonzález fled to exile in Spain earlier this month, later telling reporters that he had been coerced into signing a letter recognizing Maduro as the winner of the disputed election as a condition for letting him leave Venezuela. Venezuela’s national electoral council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, had declared Maduro the election winner hours after polls closed. Unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. But the opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation’s electronic voting machines and posted them online. González and opposition leader María Corina Machado, pictured below, said the voting records showed the former diplomat won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. \n\nEarlier this month, Maduro appeared to extend an olive branch to Donald Trump, calling for a new era of “win-win” relations and prompting speculation of possible rapprochement between the two leaders.’ “In his first government, Trump wasn’t good to us but this is a new start,” said Maduro, pictured below, during a live TV broadcast. Addressing Trump, Maduro said: “Your slogan is ‘Make America Great Again’. And, paraphrasing your slogan, I’d say that our slogan is to make the united Venezuela, Latin America and the Caribbean great.” \n\nEarlier, Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, who has friendly relations with Maduro, reversed his support for the July elections, calling them a “mistake”. Petro spoke in an interview with Brazilian news outlet Globo News, which released excerpts online that Petro’s office shared on social media. Petro told the news outlet while visiting Brazil for the G20 summit that he initially had been in favor of Venezuela holding the elections, but that he later decided that the vote was not “free”. “I think the elections were a mistake,” Petro, pictured below, said.","summary":"Edmundo González Urrutia speaks from exile in the Spanish city of Malaga.","url":"https://newsroompanama.com/2024/11/23/the-us-recognizes-edmundo-gonzalez-urrutia-as-venezuelan-president-elect/","image":"https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Edmundo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:39:46","author":"Newsroom Panama","authors":["Newsroom Panama"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pa","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":266756936,"title":"Cop29 ends with US$300 billion deal on climate finance, saving talks from brink of collapse","text":"Nearly 200 countries agreed to more than triple the amount of money available to help developing countries confront rapidly warming temperatures.\nBut the deal reached at the close of the two-week Cop29 summit in Azerbaijan resulted from fractious and at times openly hostile negotiations, producing an agreement that even its supporters may see as insufficient and disappointing.\nThe process of global climate cooperation will lurch forward from here under the weight of heavier existential questions.\nRich countries have pledged to provide at least US$300 billion annually by 2035, through a wide variety of sources, including public finance as well as bilateral and multilateral deals.\nThe agreement also calls on parties to work toward unleashing a total of US$1.3 trillion a year, with most of it expected to come through private financing.\n\nDeveloped and developing countries entered the negotiations far apart on what was necessary yet realistic.

His academic credentials have also been questioned, as Bolton suggested on CNN. \n\n“Obviously he’s not the expert he claims to be — obviously,” Hungarian newspaper editor Gabor Horvath told NBC News in 2017.\n\n“He got his master’s degree and his PhD from the Corvinus University in Hungary. The Corvinus University is not a center for national security studies, certainly not internationally recognized studies of this kind,” he added. \n\nAn op-ed inThe New York Times once referred to him as “The Islamophobic Huckster in the White House.”\n\nTrump’s then-White House chief of staff John Kelly reportedly pulled Gorka’s security clearance when he was on vacation, making it impossible for him to do his job, HuffPost noted at the time.\n\nThis time around, Trump has suggested sidestepping the background check process usually conducted by the FBI to get his nominees and appointees into their expected roles. \n\nGorka has dismissed the threat of white nationalism, and instead argued that Islamist extremists constituted the biggest threat to the US.\n\nHis supposed ties to the Nazi-connected Hungarian political group Vitezi Rend have also worried some during his first short stint in the White House. The group collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War and reformed following the end of the country’s Communist government in 1989, according to HuffPost. \n\nJewish outlet The Forward reported in March 2017 that Gorka was a member of the group. Gorka wore the group’s insignia at Trump’s first inaugural ball, later saying that the medals he wore belonged to his father, who was handed them as “a declaration for his resistance to [Communist] dictatorship,” Gorka told Breitbart, one of his former employers.\n\nBefore coming to the US in 2008, Gorka moved to Hungary in 1992 and worked for the country’s Ministry of Defense before becoming an adviser to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in 1998.\n\nGorka ran for mayor in the small town of Piliscsaba in 2006, coming in third place. Several members of the community told NBC News that he was a member of Vitezi Rend; one of the group’s leaders told CNN that the organization was never connected to the Nazis and that Gorka was not a pledged member. \n\nGorka became a US citizen in 2012, which made it possible for him to work for the federal government. \n\nHe lasted about eight months in the White House before he was forced to leave. He claimed he resigned, a version of events disputed by the Trump White House. \n\n“Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,” a White House official told several news outlets at the time. \n\nAfter his departure, Gorka became a political and counterterrorism commentator on right-wing media, with his own radio show and frequent appearances on Fox News and Newsmax.\n\nThe 54-year-old pugilist is well-known for his aggressiveness towards the press, often telling reporters to “take a long jump off a short pier,” as Politico noted. \n\n“I wouldn’t have him in any US government,” Bolton told CNN.\n\n“Fortunately, it’s not the highest position he had been mentioned for,” he added. “But I don’t think it’s going to bode well for counterterrorism efforts when the [National Security Council’s] senior director is somebody like that. ... But the questions of who are the deputy secretaries, who are the undersecretaries, and so on, is also going to tell us a lot about who’s actually running the government.”","summary":"Former Trump national security adviser calls right-wing personality the ‘perfect example of somebody who owes his position purely to Donald Trump’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/sebastian-gorka-trump-john-bolton-b2652612.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/23/23/2024-11-02T012213Z_1217422494_RC2IWAAAAVH3_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nHpfAxCn-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:36:01","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.248},{"id":266756710,"title":"GOP senator blocks promotion of general involved in Afghanistan withdrawal","text":"The promotion of a three-star general who was part of the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has been paused by Republican Sen.

Christopher Donahue was slated to be promoted to a four-star rank and take command of the U.S. Army in Europe. However, he was not included in a batch of nearly 1,000 promotions that moved through the Senate Armed Services Committee this week despite receiving a Pentagon recommendation.Mullin has put a hold on the promotion. The intention is to allow for the new Republican-controlled Congress and President-elect Donald Trump to weigh in on the promotion given Donahue's involvement in the Afghanistan withdrawal, two sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.Behind the scenes, there is an effort underway by the Army and other allies to convince Congress to move forward and lift the hold, which appears to be politically motivated, sources said.During the campaign, Trump frequently mentioned his surprise that no officers were consequently fired by President Biden for the chaotic withdrawal.Military officers execute U.S. policy but do not create it.

The U.S. evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its withdrawal, during which dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul.The U.S. underestimated the speed with which the Taliban would capture Kabul and the well-documented U.S. logistical and planning failures have been a focus of multiple internal probes at the Pentagon, State Department, and in Congress.An extensive State Department report released last year found that \"insufficient\" planning, communication failures and an inability to grasp \"the scale and scope of the operation\" contributed to the chaotic operation.CBS News has reached out to Mullin's office but did not receive a response. It is not clear whether Trump is aware of the hold.","summary":"Lt. Gen.

She always defended Margaret to the hilt.\"The reason behind Trump's alleged comment remains unclear, but he may have been influenced by watching the Netflix series The Crown.\n\nThe series depicted Princess Margaret as rebellious, volatile, and resentful of her older sister.In typical fashion, the president-elect said the remarks were \"totally false\".\n\nHe told the DailyMail: \"I heard I was her favorite president. I had a great relationship with the Queen. She liked me and I liked her. She was an amazing woman.\"Queen Elizabeth, who passed away in September 2022 aged 96, once blasted Trump as \"very rude\" after he visited Buckingham Palace for the first time.\n\nIn his book A Voyage Around The Queen, Craig Brown claimed the late monarch confided in a guest that she had \"particularly disliked\" how Trump seemed to look over her shoulder as if \"searching for someone more interesting\".She was also reported to have speculated that Trump \"must have some sort of arrangement\" with Melania after hosting him during one of his two visits.\n\nTrump, now 78, visited Buckingham Palace two times during his sole term as president from 2017 to 2021.The first was for a \"working visit\" in 2018 one year after his inauguration, and the second was in June 2019 for a state banquet following the 75th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nHe faced backlash during his first visit for keeping the British monarch waiting for 10 minutes in 80°F heat. Trump also raised eyebrows when he suddenly stopped walking and forced the queen to sidestep around him.But according to the president-elect, things were great between him and Queen Elizabeth – even if she did call him \"very rude\" shortly after his first visit to Buckingham Palace in 2018.\n\nHe once told Fox News: \"We were laughing and having fun. And her people said she hasn't had so much fun in 25 years.\"Then I got criticized for it because they said we were having too much fun. I feel I know her so well and she certainly knows me very well right now, but we have a very good relationship with the United Kingdom.\"\n\nTrump also spoke highly of Queen Elizabeth upon her passing on September 8, 2022.He called the late monarch a \"grand and beautiful lady\" and remembered her \"generous friendship, great wisdom, and wonderful sense of humor\".\n\nHe said in a statement: \"Melania and I are deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\"What a grand and beautiful lady she was – there was nobody like her! Our thoughts and prayers will remain with the great people of the United Kingdom as you honor her most meaningful life and exceptional service.\"\n\nAs RadarOnline.com reported, Queen Elizabeth was not the only royal to criticize Trump behind his back upon his first visit to Buckingham Palace six years ago.King Charles, who was still only a prince at the time, and his son Prince William, now 42, were said to have \"snubbed\" the then-president – forcing Queen Elizabeth to meet Trump alone.\n\nA source said: \"The royal father and son apparently shared their desire to not take part in the arrangements during informal discussions regarding the president's four-day tour.\"This business of Prince Charles and Prince William not being there for the Trump visit was a snub.\"\n\nHave a tip?

Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Joe Biden’s agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition.\n\nRollins, an attorney who graduated from Texas A&M University with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as White House domestic policy chief during his first presidency. The 52-year-old is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration. Rollins previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. She worked as a litigation attorney in Dallas and also clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas after earning her law degree from the University of Texas.\n\nThe pick completes Trump’s selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just two and a half weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the small business administration.\n\nRollins, speaking on the Christian talk show “Family Talk” earlier this year, said Trump was an “amazing boss” and confessed that she thought in 2015, during his first presidential campaign that he would not last as a candidate in a crowded Republican primary field.\n\n“I was the person that said, ‘Oh, Donald Trump is not going to go more than two or three weeks in the Republican primary. This is to up his TV show ratings. And then we’ll get back to normal,’” she said. “Fast forward a couple of years, and I am running his domestic policy agenda.”\n\nTrump didn’t offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The USDA oversees multiple support programs for farmers; animal and plant health; and the safety of meat, poultry and eggs that anchor the nation’s food supply. Its federal nutrition programs provide food to low-income people, pregnant women and young children. And the agency sets standards for school meals.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has vowed to strip ultraprocessed foods from school lunches and to stop allowing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries from using food stamps to buy soda, candy or other so-called junk foods. But it would be the USDA, not HHS, that would be responsible for enacting those changes.\n\nIn addition, HHS and USDA will work together to finalize the 2025-2030 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. They are due late next year, with guidance for healthy diets and standards for federal nutrition programs.","summary":"Rollins is a longtime Trump associate who served as White House domestic policy chief during his first presidency.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/11/23/trump-brooke-rollins-agriculture-secretary-usda-cabinet-nominations/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP24328778032238.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:22:06","author":"Adriana Gomez Licon,Bill Barrow,The Associated Press,Zeke Miller","authors":["Adriana Gomez Licon","Bill Barrow","The Associated Press","Zeke Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.335},{"id":266761932,"title":"Rich nations raise COP29 climate finance offer in bid to break deadlock","text":"BAKU — Countries agreed on Sunday to an annual finance target of $300 billion to help poorer countries deal with impacts of climate change, with rich countries leading the payments, according to a hard fought deal clinched at the COP29 conference in Baku. The new goal is intended to replace developed countries’ previous commitment to provide $100 billion per year in climate finance for poorer nations by 2020. That goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. The agreement was criticized by developing nations, who called it insufficient, but United Nations climate chief Simon Steill hailed it as an insurance policy for humanity. “It has been a difficult journey, but we’ve delivered a deal,” Steill said after the agreement was adopted. “This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. It will help all countries to share in the huge benefits of bold climate action: more jobs, stronger growth, cheaper and cleaner energy for all.” “But like any insurance policy — it only works — if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.” The COP29 climate conference in the Azerbaijan capital had been due to finish on Friday, but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus on the climate funding plan for the next decade. At one point delegates from poor and small island nations walked out in frustration over what they called a lack of inclusion, worried that fossil fuel producing countries were seeking to water down aspects of the deal. The COP29 climate conference in the Azerbaijan capital had been due to finish on Friday, but ran into overtime as negotiators from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus on the climate funding plan for the next decade. At one point delegates from poor and small island nations walked out in frustration over what they called a lack of inclusion, worried that fossil fuel producing countries were seeking to water down aspects of the deal. The summit cut to the heart of the debate over financial responsibility of industrialized countries — whose historic use of fossil fuels have caused the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions — to compensate others for worsening damage wrought by climate change. It also laid bare divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from costs of storms, floods and droughts. Countries also agreed Saturday evening on rules for a global market to buy and sell carbon credits that proponents say could mobilise billions more dollars into new projects to help fight global warming, from reforestation to deployment of clean energy technologies. Countries are seeking financing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels — beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur. The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1C (5.6F) of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 U.N. Emissions Gap report, with global greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels use continuing to rise. What counts as a developed nation? The roster of countries required to contribute — about two dozen industrialized countries, including the U.S., European nations and Canada — dates back to a list decided during U.N. climate talks in 1992. European governments have demanded others join them in paying in, including China, the world’s second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states. The deal encourages developing countries to make contributions, but does not require them. The agreement also includes a broader goal of raising $1.3 trillion in climate finance annually by 2035 — which would include funding from all public and private sources and which economists say matches the sum needed to address global warming. Securing the deal was a challenge from the start. Donald Trump’s victory this month has raised doubts among some negotiators that the world’s largest economy would pay into any climate finance goal agreed in Baku. Trump, a Republican who takes office in January, has called climate change a hoax and promised to again remove the U.S. from international climate cooperation. Western governments have seen global warming slip down the list of national priorities amid surging geopolitical tensions, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and expanding conflict in the Middle East, and rising inflation. The showdown over financing for developing countries comes in a year that scientists say is destined to be the hottest on record. Climate woes are stacking up in the wake of such extreme heat, with widespread flooding killing thousands across Africa, deadly landslides burying villages in Asia, and drought in South America shrinking rivers. Developed countries have not been spared. Torrential rain triggered floods in Valencia, Spain, last month that left more than 200 dead, and the U.S. so far this year has registered 24 billion-dollar disasters — just four fewer than last year.","summary":"Developed nations should pay $300 billion a year by 2035 to help poorer countries deal with climate change, according to a new draft deal from U.N. climate talks published early on Sunday, after an earlier target of $250 billion was rejected.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/climate-action-cop29-deal-rcna181508","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-11/241123-COP29-wm-315p-66d067.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:16:42","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":266755284,"title":"Trump's New Pick for Attorney General Rallied Against OJ Simpson for a Reason Not Many Know About","text":"In an intriguing twist of political history, Donald Trump's latest pick for Attorney General, Pam Bondi, once fought enthusiastically against OJ Simpson's lawyers—not over his infamous murder trial but over his desire to relocate to Florida after prison. Back in 2017, Bondi, then the Attorney General of Florida, was strongly opposed to Simpson's plans to relocate to the Sunshine State after his release from a Nevada prison. \"Our state should not become a country club for this convicted criminal,\" Bondi said in one notably strongly-worded statement that captured national attention.\n\nThat ignited a remarkable war of words between Bondi and Simpson's attorney Malcolm LaVergne, who initially labeled the AG as \"possibly the stupidest person on the planet,\" according to the Tampa Bay Times. LaVergne also said Bondi was attempting to 'gain political favor' rather than address legitimate issues surrounding Simpson's relocation.\n\nThe dispute between the two legal professionals highlighted Bondi's trademark aggressive style, which has seemingly made her so valuable later to Trump as one of his most indefatigable defenders. After all, she, in a three-page, single-spaced letter to Florida's Department of Corrections, painstakingly outlined Simpson's 'disturbing history of arrests and destructive behavior,' including citations for speeding his powerboat through a manatee zone, to make her case. Bondi's crusade against Simpson's Florida residency ultimately proved futile, as state corrections officials noted they would have to accept his transfer if Nevada's request met the established criteria. \n\nBut the controversy nonetheless cemented Bondi's reputation as a relentless prosecutor unfazed by high-profile confrontations. Now, years later, with Trump considering Bondi for the major role, LaVergne hopes things will be different. \"I hope she takes her position very seriously not just as a Trump loyalist but as an American,\" he recently told reporters, adding that he's 'wishing her the best' despite still considering her 'vindictive.'\n\nMoreover, the timing of Trump's announcement holds a certain poignancy, coming only months after Simpson's death in April 2024 at age 76 in Las Vegas. Bondi, now 59 years old, steps into the national limelight following Matt Gaetz's withdrawal amid heavy drug usage and sex trafficking allegations, though, as per AP News, he has denied the accusations. Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor, said that Bondi is \"without question, qualified to be Attorney General,\" given her twenty years as a prosecutor in Florida. \n\nBut many critics have highlighted that Bondi was picked despite her controversial positions, including her early support of Trump's 2020 election fraud claims, when she said, during a press conference featuring Rudy Giuliani, \"We've won Pennsylvania.\" Trump's statement announcing the nomination of Bondi also focused on loyalty: \"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore. Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.\"\n\nBondi's own relationship with Trump has similarly been no stranger to controversy. As Attorney General of Florida, Bondi faced fierce criticism for deciding not to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump University, despite complaints from students claiming they were defrauded. The decision took on particular overtones when it emerged that she had accepted a $25,000 donation from Trump before the case was closed, as per Daily Mail.","summary":"That kicked off a wild war of words, with O.J.&#39;s attorney calling the new attorney general pick &#34;the stupidest person on the planet.&#34;","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-new-pick-for-attorney-general-rallied-against-oj-simpson-for-a-reason-not-many-know-about","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/725688/uploads/e2066ed0-a98d-11ef-9364-81669c00aba1_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:15:00","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.026},{"id":266754814,"title":"San Diego agregó 12,200 nuevos empleos el mes pasado y estos son los sectores que más crecieron","text":"San Diego agregó 12,200 empleos el mes pasado, y todos los sectores excepto uno, el manufacturero, experimentaron un crecimiento.\n\nLas ganancias fueron lideradas por los servicios de educación y salud, así como la contratación minorista antes de la temporada navideña.\n\nLa tasa de desempleo fue del 4.7% en octubre, frente al 4.6% en septiembre, dijeron el viernes los funcionarios laborales estatales. Eso fue más alto que el promedio nacional del 3.9%, pero más bajo que el 5.4% de California.\n\nGenine Wilson, directora ejecutiva del grupo de consultoría de personal laboral Lotus Rising, dijo que las ganancias laborales han aumentado de manera constante desde la pandemia, pero las ganancias no han sido uniformes.\n\n“Es la pendiente lenta que esperaba”, dijo. “Pero depende de la industria específica”.\n\nLos empleos gubernamentales, principalmente la educación, lideraron la contratación en octubre con 3.800 nuevos empleos. Le siguieron el sector de transporte y servicios públicos (venta minorista, almacenamiento) con 2.400 empleos; los servicios de educación y salud privados (enfermería, asistencia social) con 2.200 empleos; los servicios profesionales y empresariales (jurídicos, científicos, gestión de residuos, arquitectura) con 1.300 empleos; y la construcción agregó 1.100 empleos.\n\nSolo dos sectores no se sumaron a la fiesta. La industria manufacturera perdió 1.000 empleos, y los empleos en el sector de la información (periódicos, publicaciones y telecomunicaciones) se mantuvieron estables mes a mes.\n\nParte de la razón de la tasa de desempleo ligeramente elevada del condado de San Diego es un crecimiento constante de la fuerza laboral, adultos que tienen un trabajo o están buscando uno activamente, en los últimos meses. Ahora hay 1,59 millones de personas en la fuerza laboral. Si bien se trata de una disminución de 12.100 en comparación con esta época el año pasado, compensa las grandes pérdidas a principios de 2024.\n\nLa fuerza laboral del condado alcanzó un pico de más de 1,6 millones en marzo de 2023, aumentando lentamente después de perder miles durante la pandemia. Si bien la fuerza laboral ha estado subiendo y bajando durante gran parte de este año, está en camino de alcanzar otro pico si las tendencias se mantienen en 2025.\n\nWilson dijo que un problema único que ha visto en los últimos meses es que los trabajadores más jóvenes pierden sus puestos de trabajo a manos de trabajadores más experimentados que han decidido regresar a la fuerza laboral después de meses, o más, de desempleo.\n\nDaniel Enemark, economista jefe del Centro Regional de Política e Innovación de San Diego, dijo que el panorama del desempleo en el condado no ha cambiado bastante desde el verano. Como gran parte de la nación, dijo que el condado de San Diego estaba mostrando signos de una economía fuerte.\n\n“Dado que tanto el desempleo como la inflación se mantienen bastante bajos”, dijo, “esto es más evidencia de que la Reserva Federal está logrando un aterrizaje suave”.\n\nEnemark dijo que la tasa de desempleo del condado de San Diego estaba más cerca del 4,6% cuando se ajustaba a las oscilaciones estacionales. Eso se compara con el promedio nacional ajustado estacionalmente del 4,1% y el 5,4% en California.\n\nEn términos anuales, los servicios de educación y salud privados han crecido más con 12.000 nuevos empleos. La categoría ha visto la mayor parte de su crecimiento en la asistencia social y los servicios de atención médica ambulatoria durante el último año.\n\nOtros sectores que crecieron fueron la construcción con 2.100 nuevos empleos; el gobierno con 1.400 empleos; el comercio, el transporte y los servicios públicos con 1.100 empleos, y el ocio y la hospitalidad (trabajo en hoteles, casinos, restaurantes) con 800 empleos.\n\nLa información perdió 1.200 empleos y los servicios profesionales y comerciales perdieron 1.600. La industria manufacturera perdió la mayor cantidad de empleos con 4.500. El crecimiento de los empleos manufactureros en los EE. UU. es una prioridad del presidente electo Donald Trump, quien ha propuesto un agresivo programa arancelario que dice que aumentará la industria manufacturera en el país.\n\nA nivel nacional, se perdieron aproximadamente 178.000 empleos en el sector manufacturero durante el primer mandato de Trump, según un análisis de CBS News, pero gran parte de ello se atribuyó a la pandemia. La economía añadió alrededor de 137.000 nuevos empleos en el sector manufacturero entre febrero de 2020 y septiembre de 2024. Los expertos han culpado en gran medida a la globalización, no a ninguna administración, por la disminución de la industria manufacturera.\n\nLa mayoría de las vacantes de empleo en el condado de San Diego en octubre fueron para vendedores minoristas, según los datos estatales que agregan las ofertas de trabajo durante el mes. Hubo 2.266 ofertas de trabajo para trabajadores minoristas, seguidas de las de enfermeras tituladas con 1.840, ocupaciones informáticas con 1.094, supervisores de primera línea de trabajadores minoristas con 1.082 y representantes de atención al cliente con 1.057.\n\nLos principales empleadores, por ofertas de trabajo, fueron UC San Diego, Scripps Health, Apple, Intuit, Starbucks y General Atomics.\n\nLos funcionarios estatales no ajustan estacionalmente las tasas de desempleo de los condados individuales.

He denied knowing anything about the “ridiculous and abysmal” plans written in part by his first-term aides and allies.\n\n\r\n Now, after being elected the 47th president on Nov. 5, Trump is stocking his second administration with key players in the detailed effort he temporarily shunned. Most notably, Trump has tapped Russell Vought for an encore as director of the Office of Management and Budget; Tom Homan, his former immigration chief, as “border czar;” and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of policy.\n\n\r\n Those moves have accelerated criticisms from Democrats who warn that Trump's election hands government reins to movement conservatives who spent years envisioning how to concentrate power in the West Wing and impose a starkly rightward shift across the U.S. government and society.\n\n\r\n Trump and his aides maintain that he won a mandate to overhaul Washington. But they maintain the specifics are his alone.\n\n\r\n “President Trump never had anything to do with Project 2025,” said Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt in a statement. “All of President Trumps' Cabinet nominees and appointments are whole-heartedly committed to President Trump's agenda, not the agenda of outside groups.”\n\n\r\n Here is a look at what some of Trump's choices portend for his second presidency.\n\n\r\n As budget chief, Vought envisions a sweeping, powerful perch\n\n\r\n The Office of Management and Budget director, a role Vought held under Trump previously and requires Senate confirmation, prepares a president's proposed budget and is generally responsible for implementing the administration's agenda across agencies.\n\n\r\n The job is influential but Vought made clear as author of a Project 2025 chapter on presidential authority that he wants the post to wield more direct power.\n\n\r\n “The Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President’s mind,” Vought wrote. The OMB, he wrote, “is a President’s air-traffic control system” and should be “involved in all aspects of the White House policy process,” becoming “powerful enough to override implementing agencies’ bureaucracies.”\n\n\r\n Trump did not go into such details when naming Vought but implicitly endorsed aggressive action. Vought, the president-elect said, “knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State” — Trump’s catch-all for federal bureaucracy — and would help “restore fiscal sanity.”\n\n\r\n In June, speaking on former Trump aide Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, Vought relished the potential tension: “We’re not going to save our country without a little confrontation.”\n\n\r\n Vought could help Musk and Trump remake government's role and scope\n\n\r\n The strategy of further concentrating federal authority in the presidency permeates Project 2025's and Trump's campaign proposals. Vought's vision is especially striking when paired with Trump's proposals to dramatically expand the president's control over federal workers and government purse strings — ideas intertwined with the president-elect tapping mega-billionaire Elon Musk and venture capitalist Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a “Department of Government Efficiency.”\n\n\r\n Trump in his first term sought to remake the federal civil service by reclassifying tens of thousands of federal civil service workers — who have job protection through changes in administration — as political appointees, making them easier to fire and replace with loyalists. Currently, only about 4,000 of the federal government's roughly 2 million workers are political appointees. President Joe Biden rescinded Trump's changes. Trump can now reinstate them.\n\n\r\n Meanwhile, Musk's and Ramaswamy's sweeping “efficiency” mandates from Trump could turn on an old, defunct constitutional theory that the president — not Congress — is the real gatekeeper of federal spending. In his “Agenda 47,” Trump endorsed so-called “impoundment,” which holds that when lawmakers pass appropriations bills, they simply set a spending ceiling, but not a floor. The president, the theory holds, can simply decide not to spend money on anything he deems unnecessary.\n\n\r\n Vought did not venture into impoundment in his Project 2025 chapter. But, he wrote, “The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”\n\n\r\n Trump's choice immediately sparked backlash.\n\n\r\n “Russ Vought is a far-right ideologue who has tried to break the law to give President Trump unilateral authority he does not possess to override the spending decisions of Congress (and) who has and will again fight to give Trump the ability to summarily fire tens of thousands of civil servants,” said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat and outgoing Senate Appropriations chairwoman.\n\n\r\n Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, leading Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, said Vought wants to “dismantle the expert federal workforce” to the detriment of Americans who depend on everything from veterans' health care to Social Security benefits.\n\n\r\n “Pain itself is the agenda,” they said.\n\n\r\n Homan and Miller reflect Trump's and Project 2025's immigration overlap\n\n\r\n Trump’s protests about Project 2025 always glossed over overlaps in the two agendas. Both want to reimpose Trump-era immigration limits. Project 2025 includes a litany of detailed proposals for various U.S. immigration statutes, executive branch rules and agreements with other countries — reducing the number of refugees, work visa recipients and asylum seekers, for example.\n\n\r\n Miller is one of Trump's longest-serving advisers and architect of his immigration ideas, including his promise of the largest deportation force in U.S. history. As deputy policy chief, which is not subject to Senate confirmation, Miller would remain in Trump's West Wing inner circle.\n\n\r\n “America is for Americans and Americans only,” Miller said at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27.\n\n\r\n “America First Legal,” Miller’s organization founded as an ideological counter to the American Civil Liberties Union, was listed as an advisory group to Project 2025 until Miller asked that the name be removed because of negative attention.\n\n\r\n Homan, a Project 2025 named contributor, was an acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director during Trump’s first presidency, playing a key role in what became known as Trump's “family separation policy.”\n\n\r\n Previewing Trump 2.0 earlier this year, Homan said: “No one’s off the table. If you’re here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder.”\n\n\r\n Project 2025 contributors slated for CIA and Federal Communications chiefs\n\n\r\n John Ratcliffe, Trump's pick to lead the CIA, was previously one of Trump's directors of national intelligence. He is a Project 2025 contributor. The document's chapter on U.S. intelligence was written by Dustin Carmack, Ratcliffe's chief of staff in the first Trump administration.\n\n\r\n Reflecting Ratcliffe's and Trump's approach, Carmack declared the intelligence establishment too cautious. Ratcliffe, like the chapter attributed to Carmack, is hawkish toward China. Throughout the Project 2025 document, Beijing is framed as a U.S. adversary that cannot be trusted.\n\n\r\n Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, wrote Project 2025's FCC chapter and is now Trump's pick to chair the panel. Carr wrote that the FCC chairman “is empowered with significant authority that is not shared” with other FCC members. He called for the FCC to address “threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions in the market,” specifically “Big Tech and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.”\n\n\r\n He called for more stringent transparency rules for social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube and “empower consumers to choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any.”\n\n\r\n Carr and Ratcliffe would require Senate confirmation for their posts.","summary":"After being elected the 47th president on Nov. 5, Donald Trump

‘legal notes’ in a single episode spent trashing Trump’s cabinet pick","text":"“The View” doesn’t want anyone to sue. \n\nThe co-hosts of the controversial ABC talk show were forced to issue four “legal notes” during Friday’s broadcast after they discussed allegations leveled at several of President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet nominees. \n\nThe legal notes — which are disclaimers provided by the subjects’ lawyers — pertained to remarks made on-air by the show’s stars Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Ana Navarro, Sunny Hostin and Alyssa Farah Griffin.\n\nDuring a segment discussing George Santos, Behar brought up the former congressman’s 23 criminal charges, including wire fraud. \n\nSeveral minutes later, she was forced to read a message from show producers that was sent to her iPhone. \n\n“One minute, I just got a note,” Behar told the audience looking down at her device. “We have to clarify that Santos eventually reached a plea deal after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.”\n\n“Is that a legal note?” co-host Haines quizzed. \n\n“Kind of, it’s a clarification,” Behar responded. \n\nIn the same segment, “The View” stars discussed sexual assault allegations made against Trump’s first attorney general pick Matt Gaetz and his defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth. \n\nCo-host Hostin was subsequently forced to read out denials provided by both men’s lawyers. \n\n“I have a legal note,” she stated. “Matt Gaetz has long denied all allegations and has not been charged with any crime.”\n\n“Also, another legal note,” Hostin continued. “Pete Hegseth’s lawyer said he paid the woman [his assault accuser] in 2023 to head off the threat of a baseless lawsuit. He has denied any wrongdoing. “\n\nSeveral minutes later, Hostin — a one-time prosecutor — issued a fourth legal disclaimer pertaining to Pam Bondi, Trump’s new nominee for attorney general. \n\n“I’m sorry everyone, I have another legal note,” Hostin told the audience, to which Behar could be heard groaning: “Oh my God.”\n\n“Both Trump and Bondi have denied allegations of a quid pro quo that his past donation played any role in her office’s decision not to take legal action against Trump University when she was attorney general of Florida,” Hostin stated. \n\n“This show is just going to be legal notes and things we’re selling,” a frustrated Navarro chimed in. \n\n“We’re going to call it [the show] ‘The Legal Note,'” Behar quipped. \n\nHowever, some X users were far less amused by the group’s series of disclaimers. \n\n“Sunny Hostin had to read ANOTHER legal retraction on ‘The View,” right-wing comedian Tim Young raged. “She had to correct for their lies about Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth… Someone needs to sue these people into oblivion already.”\n\n“The View was forced to issue Four ‘Legal Notes’ today for their lies against, Matt Gaetz, Pam Bondi, George Santos, and Pete Hegseth,” another angry viewer claimed. “There is a pattern… They knowingly spread lies about Donald Trump and his allies… only to issue a ‘legal note’ minutes later to avoid the truth and legal repercussions.”\n\nEarlier this week, Hostin hit headlines after she issued a “legal note” with a deadpan expression","summary":"\"The View\" doesn't want anyone to sue.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/11/23/entertainment/the-view-hosts-forced-to-issue-four-legal-notes-in-a-single-episode-spent-trashing-trumps-cabinet-pick/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/newspress-collage-8rbr9sbuk-1732402603844.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1732384624&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:02:41","author":"Andrew Court","authors":["Andrew Court"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.464},{"id":266753336,"title":"Europe Has Run Out Of Time","text":"With Trump’s Return, the Continent Must Take Charge of Its Own Security—and Quickly\n\nFor decades, the transatlantic al-liance has been the bedrock of European security. But today, Europe’s partnership with the United States is at a critical juncture. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, there is a genuine risk that U.S. engagement in Europe could drop precipitously. If the United States halts its military aid to Kyiv, the con-sequences will be profound, both for the war in Ukraine and for the rest of Europe’s defenses against exter-nal threats, a revanchist Russia chief among them.\n\nAlthough Trump’s second term will most likely usher in a radical break from previous U.S. policy, the reality is that discontent with the European contribution to the transatlantic rela-tionship has been simmering in the United States for years. Europe, howev-er, squandered the time it should have spent investing more heavily into the relationship—including by building up its own defenses. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 should have been the final wake-up call, creating real momentum behind Europe’s effort to become a credible security actor in its own right. Instead, once again, it relied on the United States to take the lead in a European war. Now, that fall-back option is at risk of disappearing, and European leaders cannot simply shift the blame for their predicament to Washington.\n\nEuropean leaders must act deci-sively to advance a unified strategy to ensure the continent’s peace and stability. They must quickly ramp up their economic and military support for Ukraine, begin a serious effort to create an integrated European defense industry, and demonstrate to the Unit-ed States that Europe is prepared to hold up its side of a mutually beneficial partnership. From now on, Europe’s security will have to be European—or it won’t exist at all.\n\nNo Turning Back\n\nSince the United States entered World War II, it has considered Eu-ropean security to be a fundamental U.S. interest. Only with the support of a stable, peaceful Europe could the United States project power glob-ally. Washington’s engagement with Europe was never only about strat-egy, however. The alliance was also values-based, grounded in a shared commitment to defend democracy against dictatorship. During the Cold War, the transatlantic partnership strengthened further. The formation of NATO, in 1949, created an American security umbrella that enabled Europe to rebuild and thrive, and the U.S.-Eu-ropean economic and military partner-ship over the next several decades was an overwhelming success.\n\nWith the end of the Cold War and the beginning of a new era of U.S. unipolar power, however, a danger-ous sense of complacency set in on both sides of the Atlantic. The rela-tive stability of this period led many European countries to reduce their defense spending, assuming that war had been banished from the continent for good. Most European armies were restructured to focus on interventions abroad, and in the process neglected their ability to accomplish homeland defense. Meanwhile, the United States became entangled in costly conflicts in the Middle East that stretched its resources thin.\n\nDuring those years, Europe and the United States ignored or downplayed rising threats. Starting roughly a de-cade ago, Russian and Chinese chal-lenges to the U.S.-led international order began to grow. In 2014, Russia an-nexed Crimea and launched a war in the Donbas region of Ukraine. After Xi Jinping assumed leadership of China, in 2012, he overhauled China’s econom-ic and foreign policy and positioned the country as a global power determined to stand on equal footing with the Unit-ed States. At home, Western countries grappled with the negative effects of globalization, including industrial de-cline, diminished competitiveness, an erosion of social cohesion, and discon-tent with the political status quo.\n\nIn his 2016 U.S. presidential cam-paign, Trump effectively channeled the public grievances that arose from these problems. Many Americans had become disillusioned with global leadership, angry that large amounts of taxpayer money were spent on U.S. activities abroad while parts of the country struggled. Trump’s vow to put “America first” and demand that allies pay up resonated. What many on the other side of the Atlantic understood too late was that although Trump’s voice may have been the loudest, the underlying sentiment—at least as it applied to Europe—was widespread within the U.S. political establishment. Even Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, had concluded that the United States should reduce its footprint in Europe and the Middle East in order to shift its focus to the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe misguided hope, which many European leaders have held since 2016, that Europe can simply wait out the Trump presidency must be consigned to the dustbin of history. Although the Russian war against Ukraine led the Biden administration to reprioritize European security, this was only a tem-porary deviation, not a general change in U.S. strategy. Today, not all U.S. lead-ers would draw back Washington’s commitment to Europe as quickly— or speak of the alliance with as harsh a tone—as Trump may be inclined to do. But these differences aside, they will likely agree with Trump’s basic demand that Europe take significant-ly greater responsibility for its own security.\n\nFor Europe, then, there is no time left to waste. Trump has repeatedly ex-pressed his support for an immediate halt to any U.S. military aid to Ukraine, and Europe must prepare for the possi-bility that for the first time since World War II, it will be the principal party tasked with ending a major conflict on the continent. An even bigger risk is that Trump might pursue a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to freeze the fighting. Putin understands that once Trump enters negotiations, he will face domestic pressure to close a deal—a constraint that Putin does not share. This imbalance gives Putin leverage, and any deal that emerg-es from such negotiations would be highly unlikely to include adequate protections for Ukraine—and thus for Europe—against future Russian ag-gression. For Washington to essential-ly accommodate Moscow’s war aims would critically undermine NATO’s credibility, shaking the foundations of Europe’s security architecture.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nEurope now has no choice but to manage its own security. There is no doubt that it has the economic poten-tial to do so; the combined GDP of the European Union is roughly ten times that of Russia. What holds Europe back is a lack of political will. That deficiency of will is glaringly obvious when it comes to military support for Ukraine: the technologically backward and economically decrepit North Ko-rea is estimated to have supplied more artillery shells to Russia during the past year than the entire EU has pro-vided to Ukraine over the same period. This pitiful state of affairs has arisen even though the EU has a strong indus-trial base and counts four of the world’s ten largest arms exporters among its members.\n\nEurope needs to step up its de-fense capabilities—and fast. But this project requires political leadership, which is currently hard to come by. In Germany, the coalition government has collapsed, and the country’s poli-ticians will spend the coming months occupied by snap elections scheduled for February 23 and the coalition-build-ing process that will follow. In France, President Emmanuel Macron lost his parliamentary majority this summer, leaving him politically weakened. Meanwhile, the EU’s relationship with the United Kingdom, one of Europe’s most formidable military powers, re-mains fraught, even as both sides make sincere efforts to improve cooperation.\n\nFortunately, other EU members such as Poland, the Baltic states, and the Nordic countries are willing to take the lead. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is already trying to bring togeth-er leading European NATO states to improve coordination on Ukraine and ramp up support for Kyiv. But any substantial defense buildup will need Germany’s economic power and political clout to succeed, which means that the new government in Berlin will need to take the continent’s security challenges seriously and be willing to put money behind a broader European effort.\n\nAnticipating a withdrawal of U.S. support, Europe also needs to signifi-cantly increase its financial and mili-tary support for Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Econ-omy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, the combined military aid that Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have supplied to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war is less than half what the United States has contributed. Al-though it may not be feasible to imme-diately and completely fill the gap left by the United States, the goal should be to come as close as possible. For a start, EU countries will need to turn to inter-national markets, including the United States, to purchase weapons systems and ammunition that Europe cannot yet produce in sufficient quantities it-self. Germany in particular should also take steps that it has been delaying for far too long: sending long-range Tau-rus missiles to Ukraine and removing the remaining restrictions on Kyiv us-ing Western weapons to strike military targets deep inside Russia. The United States recently lifted these restrictions on the use of its ATACMS missiles, and France and the United Kingdom, which have already delivered their own cruise missiles to Ukraine, seem to be following suit.\n\nIn the medium to long term, the EU will need to overhaul its defense capabilities and industry if Europe is to meaningfully backstop its own secu-rity. Right now, Europe purchases the lion’s share of its arms from abroad; this practice must come to an end. A credible security provider must be able to meet most of its own defense needs. Europe will have to overcome the national self-interests that treat defense industries as mere extensions of domestic industrial policy. Instead, these industries must be reshaped to serve Europe’s collective security inter-ests. This will require the continent’s foremost military powers—France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the Unit-ed Kingdom—to lead the development of a joint European strategy. In prac-tice, the process will involve scaling up production and cutting costs by integrating every part of the produc-tion cycle, from capability planning to development to procurement. If this integration is managed successfully, the European defense industry can compete on the level of the U.S. defense sector.\n\nSecuring Europe’s Future\n\nA failure to prioritize defense efforts now will leave Europe deeply vulner-able to continued Russian aggression. Any reluctance to take on more of the continental defense burden, moreover, will strain transatlantic relations at a critical time. Retaining the United States as a security partner is unde-niably in Europe’s interest. But to do so requires that Europe be proactive, constructively engaging Washington to work out a new balance of respon-sibilities and to discuss shared security goals.\n\nThis includes improving transat-lantic cooperation on issues beyond Europe. First and foremost, the Eu-ropean Union—including both the European Commission and national capitals—and the United States must align their strategies for addressing the axis of hostile powers that are working to challenge the internation-al order. China, Iran, and North Korea are supporting the Russian war in Ukraine by providing weapons and dual-use goods, while Russia is sup-porting the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. On top of this, China has exploited the West’s distraction to ex-pand its power in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Beijing is taking a close look at the Western response in Ukraine, contemplating Russia’s invasion as a potential blueprint for an attack on Taiwan. It would be shortsighted for the United States and Europe to view these threats in isolation or to attempt to counter them alone. If leaders on both sides of the Atlantic want the international liberal order to endure, with the United States at its core, they must tackle these challenges together.\n\nIt is now up to Europeans to fulfill the continent’s potential as a credi-ble security actor, thereby salvaging transatlantic relations and checking Russia’s imperialist ambitions. Should this effort fall short—and should U.S. support fall away—the price will be steep. Without strong defenses stand-ing in his way, Putin will have no rea-son to stop at Ukraine. After decades of relative peace, war could once again become a fixture of European politics.\n\nSource: FOREIGN AFFAIRS (www. foreignaffairs.com), November 22, 2024.","summary":"With Trump’s Return, the Continent Must Take Charge of Its Own Security—and Quickly For decades, the transatlantic al­liance has been the bedrock of European security.

Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.\nRollins’ nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office on January 20, 2025.\nShe would succeed Tom Vilsack, US President Joe Biden’s agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programmes related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition.\n\nThe pick completes Trump’s selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just 2½ weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally cabinet-level remain, including US trade representative and head of the small business administration.\nRollins, a lawyer who graduated from Texas A&M University with an undergraduate degree in agricultural development, is a long-time Trump associate who served as White House domestic policy chief during his first presidency.\nThe 52-year-old is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration.\nRollins previously served as an aide to former Texas governor Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation. She worked as a litigation lawyer in Dallas and also clerked for a federal judge in the Northern District of Texas after earning her law degree from the University of Texas.\nSpeaking on the Christian talk show Family Talk earlier this year, Rollins said Trump was an “amazing boss” and confessed that she thought in 2015, during his first presidential campaign that he would not last as a candidate in a crowded Republican primary field.\n“I was the person that said, ‘Oh, Donald Trump is not going to go more than two or three weeks in the Republican primary.

Other ways exist to raise those funds — such as private capital, and carbon credit trading whose rules also reached a final deal Saturday. But representatives of poor and vulnerable countries such as Malawi, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives said the sum was simply insufficient to meet their needs.\n\nThe financial agreement also comes with a pile of uncertainty about the final amount any rich country would pay — especially as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who calls climate change a hoax, prepares to take power in Washington. The EU, already by far the largest donor bloc, expects to have to shoulder more of the burden as U.S. participation recedes.\n\nThe deal was broadly in line with the expectations set by a U.N. report last week, which estimated the amount of public finance and related cash transfers needed to protect climate-threatened countries and finance their clean industries. It also largely meshed with the $200 billion to $300 billion in annual funding that EU nations had discussed in private, as POLITICO reported on Monday.\n\nIn the lead-up to the talks, the U.S. and the EU pressured China and other wealthy, but technically developing, countries to join them as a donor nation.\n\nThe deal opened up the possibility for developing nations such as China to contribute, or not, on a voluntary basis — potentially allowing both sides to claim a win.","summary":"The pledged financing from the U.S., EU and other wealthy governments includes hopes for private money — and a Trump-sized asterisk.","url":"https://www.politico.eu/article/climate-summit-approves-divisive-300b-deal/","image":"https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=675,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/23/GettyImages-2184288478-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 23:00:22","author":"Karl Mathiesen","authors":["Karl Mathiesen"],"language":"en","source_country":"eu","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":266753420,"title":"Trump picks former White House aide Brooke Rollins to lead the USDA","text":"President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he will nominate former White House aide Brooke Rollins to be his agriculture secretary, the last of his picks to lead executive agencies and another choice from within his established circle of advisers and allies.\n\nThe nomination must be confirmed by the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans when Trump takes office Jan. 20, 2025. Rollins would succeed Tom Vilsack, President Biden’s agriculture secretary who oversees the sprawling agency that controls policies, regulations and aid programs related to farming, forestry, ranching, food quality and nutrition.\n\nRollins, who graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in agricultural development, is a longtime Trump associate who served as his former domestic policy chief. She is president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a group helping to lay the groundwork for a second Trump administration.\n\nRollins, 52, previously served as an aide to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and ran a think tank, the Texas Public Policy Foundation.\n\nRollins’ pick completes Trump’s selection of the heads of executive branch departments, just two and a half weeks after the former president won the White House once again. Several other picks that are traditionally Cabinet-level remain, including U.S. Trade Representative and head of the Small Business Administration.\n\nTrump didn’t offer many specifics about his agriculture policies during the campaign, but farmers could be affected if he carries out his pledge to impose widespread tariffs. During the first Trump administration, countries like China responded to Trump’s tariffs by imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports like the corn and soybeans routinely sold overseas. Trump countered by offering massive multibillion-dollar aid to farmers to help them weather the trade war.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms.

He was a big supporter of the Prince’s Trust when Charles was Prince of Wales.\n\n‘They became extremely close after Princess Diana died and Scott was part of the plan to improve Camilla’s image.\n\n‘She came to the US in 1999 and stayed with him and he introduced her to everyone who is anyone in New York society. They remain close and Scott often attends private fundraisers at the Palace.’\n\nThe President-elect made the announcement on Friday night, saying: ‘Scott will help me usher in a new golden age for the United States.’\n\nMr Bessent who has been out since his 20s, will be the first gay Republican Cabinet member. Democrat Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden’s Transportation Secretary, was the first-ever gay Cabinet pick.\n\nThe Wall Street source added: ‘President Trump has been branded homophobic by his detractors but that couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nDonald Trump's choice for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is friends with King Charles and Queen Camilla\n\nThe President-elect announced Mr Bessent's appointment on Friday night, saying he would help usher in a 'golden age' for America\n\n‘He’s been friends with Scott for years and his sexuality was never an issue. The President doesn’t care about things like that, in fact he and Melania actively support LGBT Republican groups and often have them to Mar-a-Lago. It’s not a big deal.’\n\nMr Bessent, who has two children with his lawyer husband, will be in charge of key financial decisions, including Mr Trump’s controversial plan to implement tariffs of up to 60 per cent on imported goods.\n\nHe will also be responsible for slashing America’s record-high national debt of $36 trillion while implementing tax cuts for the middle classes, and oversee the allocation of federal funds to support Mr Trump’s plans to deport millions of illegal immigrants, which will start on January 20, the day the President-elect takes office. \n\nMr Bessent, who spent decades working for Left-wing investor George Soros, one of the biggest Democratic Party donors, switched his alliance when Mr Trump first ran for the White House in 2016.\n\nA source said that Mr Bessent had known the King 'for years' and was a big supporter of the Prince's Trust\n\nHe is often called a ‘financial genius’ and made his name by betting against the pound during the 1992 ‘Black Wednesday’ crash, which netted his firm $1 billion.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who was born in South Carolina, has talked about being driven to succeed after watching his father, a real estate investor, struggle.\n\n‘I’ve known financial hardship and I don’t want that for any family,’ he said.\n\nThe financier launched the hedge fund Key Square in 2015, and has since given away millions to\n\nDonald TrumpNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRevealed: Donald Trump's new Treasury Secretary billionaire Scott Bessent is close friend of King Charles and Queen Camilla\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Billionaire Scott Bessent has been a long-time supporter of the King's charities, while Camilla stayed at his sprawling home in the Hamptons, New York, in 1999 during her first solo trip to the US.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14118831/Donald-Trump-Treasury-Secretary-Scott-Bessent-friend-King-Charles.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/23/22/92417501-0-image-m-38_1732402177091.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-23 22:54:57","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.096}]}
