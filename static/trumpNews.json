That diversified production allowed the company to proactively respond to potential tariffs.By the time Trump announced a 145% tariff on goods from China last week, the company had already largely shifted production to its facilities elsewhere.Cook said that over the past few months the company decreased its China-based production from over 50% of its total to about 30%, a move that was possible due to the production that was already ongoing in other countries.\"We want to do everything in our power not to pass anything on to the customer,\" Cook said, adding that as of last week, David's Bridal had not raised prices as a result of tariffs.The majority of bridal gowns sold in the US are produced in China, making the industry highly susceptible to the impacts of Trump's trade war. Independent bridal shops recently told BI that about 90% of their gowns were made in China and that, in some cases, wholesale wedding dress prices were already rising as a result of tariffs.The average wedding dress sold in the US retails for around $2,000 according to wedding planning website The Knot, so the steep tariffs on China could result in brides or bridal shops being hit with a hefty additional cost. And for couples getting married, that increase would be on top of the average cost of a wedding in the US, which The Knot puts at $33,000. In addition to moving its own production out of China, David's Bridal is also helping some of the manufacturers it partners with move their operations out of the country and to some of its other facilities.Cook said the company also has about 300,000 gowns already state-side in its 193 stores located throughout the US, so they wouldn't be subject to tariffs.\"We are very focused on ensuring that that level of inventory stays voluminous so we can anticipate needs like this,\" she said.Cook added that with so much uncertainty around tariffs, David's Bridal is focusing on the factors it can control — \"optimizing, looking at cost controls, moving production,\" she said. \"We'll just continue to stay focused on that until the dust settles on all of the tariffs.\"David's Bridal is also exploring the possibility of producing gowns in the US. Cook said the company is visiting a potential manufacturing location in June to evaluate if production could occur stateside.The National Bridal Retailers Association, which represents about 6,000 independent bridal shops, recently told BI that the US does not currently have the infrastructure to produce the quality of dresses at scale that can be produced in China.\"There's no doubt that we can find the labor and the talent in the US to do the same thing,\" Cook said. \"It's about timing and location and other economic factors like capital and so forth that we will evaluate.\"","summary":"Kelly Cook, the CEO of David's Bridal, told Business Insider the company started moving dress production out of China months ago.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/davids-bridal-ceo-wedding-dress-production-china-tariffs-raising-prices-2025-4","image":"https://i.insider.com/67feee77a466d2b74ab344a0?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 01:04:46","author":"Kelsey Vlamis","authors":["Kelsey Vlamis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":311551006,"title":"Trump made it ‘clear’ social security benefits will not be cut, says Steve Forbes","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air April 15, 2025 09:08 \n\n Trump made it ‘clear’ social security benefits will not be cut, says Steve Forbes \n Forbes editor-in-chief Steve Forbes discusses President Donald Trump’s initiatives to protect social security on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOSPOLITICS","summary":"Forbes editor-in-chief Steve Forbes discusses President Donald Trump’s initiatives to protect social security on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371539395112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/458e7618-d2e8-4fc5-85fa-cfea8c68d08c/9fec4957-0e19-4f6f-a705-9060247b9174/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 01:03:44","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":311551136,"title":"Tariff tensions: World oil demand, US supply to grow more slowly: IEA","text":"LONDON: Global oil demand will grow at its slowest rate for five years in 2025 and US production rises will also taper off, due to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on trading partners and their retaliatory moves, the International Energy Agency said.\n\nTrump’s tariffs, along with a supply hike by OPEC+ producers, have driven a steep slide in oil prices this month, cutting revenue for producers.

However, off the course, that final winning putt also instantly re-branded a year that - just 11 months ago - seemed like it might be the worst of the golfer and his wife Erica Stoll's lives. \n\nRe-wind to May last year and Rory, 35, was in a very different place. The global star shocked the golfing community when he announced that he and his glamourous New Yorker wife Erica Stoll, mother to the couple's four-year-old daughter Poppy, were bound for the divorce courts, citing an 'irretrievably broken' union.\n\nHowever, the couple, who wed in County Mayo in Ireland 2017, dramatically U-turned on the decision a month later, saying differences had been 'resolved' and they welcomed 'a new beginning'.\n\nOn Sunday, that new beginning began in earnest - with Erica, 37, who's been stoically by her husband's side on golf courses around the world during the fragile rebuilding of their marriage, now apparently keen on re-setting their relationship far from the 'stifling' Florida golfing community, with a move to the UK on the cards. \n\nDespite the sportsman, worth £225million, and his wife enjoying a gilded life in a nine-bedroom £17million mansion on the gated Bear's Club golf estate in Jupiter Island, a glitzy east coast enclave in Florida, the filing of divorce papers at Palm Beach County Court signalled their relationship had hit the bunker. \n\nIt's become clear since that city girl Erica has been itching to start afresh, away from the Florida's resoundingly Republican east coast - President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate is just 30 minutes south of the couple's palatial home. \n\nSo, with the one trophy that has eluded Rory now in his silverware cabinet, could Erica finally get to call the shots on where the family-of-three call home, as reward for her loyalty in the face of both that stinging divorce statement and unproven rumours of Rory's close friendship with a US sports reporter. \n\nMcIlroy, 35, joined the illustrious Grand Slam club after his victory at Augusta on Sunday, bringing a jubilant end to what has been a turbulent year; he and wife Erica Stoll, pictured with their daughter Poppy, four, were set to divorce in May 2024, before changing their minds\n\nNew Yorker Stoll, 37, mother to Poppy, four, has been frank about how life in Florida - less than 20 miles from Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago estate - isn't to her liking, saying she doesn't enjoy the oppressive heat of the Sunshine State, where she resides most of the time while her husband is out on tour\n\nThe 'new beginning' the couple alluded to in their 'back-on' statement in June 2024 could be a new-build home on UK soil, thousands of miles away from the cliquish Sunshine State community where the couple currently reside. \n\nIn Netflix's golfing series Full Swing, Rory was candid about his wife's desire to escape Florida's sweltering summers, saying: 'If it was up to her [Erica], she wouldn't move to England straightaway, but she definitely wants to spend more time there.' \n\nGerman golfer Martin Kaymer, chatting to Rory about his wife's hatred of the Florida weather, revealed how Erica once told him during a chance meeting in a local Starbucks 'I really don't like the sun' - Kaymer revealed that he joked back: '\"Your state's called the Sunshine State, right?\"' \n\nAnd another fellow player, JJ Spaun, has also hinted at the fact that Rory and Erica could move to the UK - and be just a short flight from the close-knit Holywood community that Rory left behind to pursue global sporting stardom.\n\nSpeaking on the Fore Play podcast, US golfer Spaun said after he had been defeated by Rory in the Players Championship, the golfing great had hinted at a permanent London base as he and Erica continue to try and re-find the spark in their relationship. \n\nSpaun said: 'He's super cool. We were talking about the UK. I know he's Northern Irish, but I asked him if he ever hangs out in London. Because my wife has got a really good friend that lives out there and loves going there.'\n\nHe continued: 'I asked him about that, and he said, \"Oh yeah, I'm building a house out there\". He kept it really friendly and light, and then we chatted a lot until the back nine, and that was it.'\n\nA move to the UK would also certainly take the heat out of some of the rumours that have dogged the couple since they announced they were getting their marriage back on track - and put Erica in a vibrant city that feels more spiritually inline with her native New York than the more conservative confines of Florida. \n\nAcross the Pond? Could the couple now swap their luxe Florida home for a London new-build in a bid to leave Florida's stifling golfing community behind?\n\nHappier times: The couple pictured in 2018, just a year after their County Mayo wedding. According to Rory's fellow pro players, Erica is now keen on a new life in London - and her husband is seemingly happy to uproot his family in pursuit of a fresh start\n\n Loyal: The glamorous New Yorker has been by her man's side at tournaments since they dramatically reversed the divorce papers filed in May last year\n\nErica looked stoic as she watched her husband receive the traditional green jacket after winning the 2025 Masters in Augusta\n\nMcIlroy and Stoll's ranch-style family home is believed to have nine bedrooms and 10 bathrooms on the entire property\n\nExperts reveal the Masters items every golfer must have to take their game to the next level - including £9.99 Amazon essential\n\nThose rumours? Also in the stands in Georgia to see Rory kiss the green was CBS sports reporter Amanda Balionis, who would later take to Instagram to praise the golfer's 'legacy' achievement this weekend. \n\nAmanda's comments come just months after rumours that she and Rory had been having some form of a relationship while they were both out on tour. \n\nNone of these rumours have been proven and neither Amanda nor Rory have outright addressed them.\n\nThe journalist wrote: 'It took 17 Masters starts, 11 years of attempting to complete the career Grand Slam and 73 this week but Rory McIlroy has his Green Jacket and has solidified his legacy alongside Tiger, Jack, Gary, Hogan and Sarazen. What a week and a battle down to the very end.'\n\nAfter Rory finally made history - joining five other illustrious names in golf's Grand Slam club, he may also decide that it's time to be closer to his childhood roots. \n\nWhen the golfer first made serious money, winning the the US Open in 2011 and the PGA Championship in 2012, he promptly splashed out on his 'dream home' in Northern Ireland. \n\nThe then £2million pound home was set in 14 acres and had its own green and driving range. \n\nHowever, the lure of a home in a base with year-round warmth - Florida's Jupiter Island - eventually wooed Rory west across the Atlantic and he sold the property in his hometown to TV presenter Gary McCausland.\n\nCBS sports reporter Amanda Balionis congratulated Rory McIlroy after his success at the Masters\n\nCould Rory McIlroy and Erica Stoll's Jupiter Island home - in a gated golfing community - soon be on the market?\n\nMcIlroy and his wife are seen together during a golf demonstration event on the Aletsch glacier on Jungfraujoch saddle in the Swiss alps in 2018\n\nThe couple's current home, bought in 2017 for $11million, is everything a golf millionaire could dream of - with 2.4 acres of land, an infinity pool, tennis court, gym and recording studio. But with Rory travelling for most of the year, Erica and Poppy are the ones rattling around in the palatial mansion. \n\nAt Augusta on Sunday, New Yorker Erica played the supportive spouse as she posed with her husband and their four-year-old daughter for official photos and congratulated him with a kiss after his victory.\n\nHowever, according to one body language expert, the resounding impact of that humiliating divorce announcement is apparently still weighing heavily on Erica. \n\nReaching out to Erica, Rory shared an emotional hug with the mother-of-one after his victory - but Erica appeared 'more polite, subdued and tempered', said Judi James.\n\nThe body language expert explained: 'Erica uses back pats, which are firstly a gesture of gentle affection but which also usually signal a desire to break from an embrace, while Rory appears much more clingy.\n\n'Rory looks overwhelmed and clingy, while Erica’s response appears a little more polite, subdued and tempered.'\n\nLast year, rumours suggested that Balionis and McIlroy had been having some form of a relationship while they were both out on tour\n\nRory being interviewed by CBS reporter Amanda Balionis at a previous tournament \n\nThe current family home - but New Yorker Erica Stoll has been vocal about not enjoying the Florida heat\n\nRory poses with daughter Poppy and wife Erica Stoll holding the Masters trophy\n\nRory finally slayed his demons at Augusta National on Sunday to complete the career Grand Slam after 11 years of trying, pipping Justin Rose to the Green Jacket in a dramatic playoff. \n\nAfter his winning birdie putt dropped to seal the victory over his Ryder Cup teammate, Rory rushed to his wife of eight years and their daughter Poppy.\n\nJudi told FEMAIL: 'Rory rushes over to share his emotional state with his wife and his display here mimics one of a needy child looking for a more nurturing response, which is exactly what he gets from Erica. \n\n'Rory throws both arms out towards her like a toddler looking for a hug, then he clings round Erica’s neck, showing his vulnerable side.\n\n'While Rory clings Erica pats his back and then strokes it in a tender-looking ritual. As he pulls back she also strokes his face to display gentle affection. \n\n'Their ritual suggests a message of \"we did it\" as though acknowledging they both overcame challenges to reach this peak of success.'\n\nThe freshly crowned five-time major winner later paid tribute to his family during his Green Jacket ceremony. \n\n'Last but not least, over to my left, my family, my team,' he said, trailing off as the tears threatened to spill again. \n\nRory kisses wife Erica during the Par Three Contest prior to the 2025 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on Wednesday\n\nThe couple share a moment during the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Club in 2016\n\n'They've been on this journey with me the whole way through. They know the burden that I've carried to come here every year and try and try and try again,' he continued after recomposing himself. \n\n'The one thing I would say to my daughter Poppy, never give up on your dreams. Never ever give up on your dreams. Keep coming back. Keep working hard.'\n\nRory sent shockwaves through the sporting world when he filed for divorce from his wife last May. \n\nA petition was served on her at their £10million mansion in Jupiter, Florida, on May 13, asking for shared parental custody of their little girl and for a judge to enforce a pre-nuptial agreement the couple signed prior to their marriage in 2017. \n\nThere was then speculation of a potential romance with Balionis after the pair appeared to enjoy a strong rapport during a flirtatious interview at the Wells Fargo Championship. \n\nBut a month later, with the golf world still reeling from news of the split, came an equally unexpected twist as it emerged Rory and Erica had reconciled their differences, with the divorce petition voluntarily dismissed. \n\nRory's attorney Thomas Sasser filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal on his behalf on June 11 in Palm Beach County Courthouse after he and Erica reportedly held secret meetings at their Florida home for a month in a bid to salvage their marriage. \n\nThe meetings were initially focused on how they would co-parent their daughter Poppy, but the conversations eventually led to them reuniting, according to Irish outlet RSVP Live.\n\nRory addressed the speculation surrounding his relationship status in a statement to The Guardian - two days before the opening round of the US Open.\n\n'There have been rumors about my personal life recently, which is unfortunate. Responding to each rumor is a fool's game,' McIlroy said.\n\n'Over the past weeks, Erica and I have realized that our best future was as a family together. Thankfully, we have resolved our differences and look forward to a new beginning.'\n\nThe couple pose with their four-year-old daughter Poppy, who wowed spectators by sinking a 25ft putt on the final hole of the Augusta National course during the family-friendly event\n\nRory and his wife Erica share a joke during the traditional par-three Masters curtain raiser at Augusta National on Wednesday\n\nRory embraced his wife of almost eight years following a turbulent year off the course as he celebrated his win on Sunday \n\nOne source close to the sportsman told The Daily Mail's Alison Boshoff in June 2024 that the real reason driving the reconciliation was that McIlroy ‘can’t be on his own for more than five minutes’, adding that, quite simply, he ‘needs the stability’.\n\nAnother said he believes the multimillionaire golfer was told by his team that he had been too hasty in his divorce filing and should give his marriage ‘another six months’.\n\nA friend also told Alison: ‘[Rory] definitely can’t be on his own for more than about five minutes. Rory is a nice guy. He’s a good friend and a great golfer, but he’s not a great partner. \n\n'I’m not party to the details of his marriage, but I do know that it’s very unbalanced, with him having all the power and her running in circles after him like a 1950s wife.’ \n\nThe friend said Erica ‘does provide the stability that he desperately wants and needs. He won’t cope without anyone at all, but perhaps he thought at the time [of filing for divorce] that she wasn’t the right person.’\n\nThe source added: ‘Could I be really cynical and say perhaps this is a way of him avoiding a massive payment to her?\n\n‘There are lots of rumours swirling that he’s done this because he realised how much money he would lose. He’s definitely a man who likes his money. \n\n‘His wealth is a sign to him of how good he is as a golfer, and he won’t be keen to start splitting that. I think it could be a mixture of the realisation that he won’t see as much of his daughter and will lose half of his money that has made him rethink.\n\n‘Also, he’s really not very good on his own. That could’ve been in the thinking as well.’\n\nThe couple, who called off their divorce last year, share a laugh during Wednesday's round\n\nErica smiles as Rory cradles his daughter at Augusta. The couple looked to be on the brink of divorce last May when McIlroy filed a divorce petition in Florida, but they quickly reconciled\n\nRory - who married Erica in 2017 - enjoys a laugh during the annual competition at Augusta\n\nErica Stoll looks on during the Par Three Contest prior to the 2025 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club, pictured left. Pictured right, Erica after Rory's Masters win\n\nMeanwhile, another friend said: 'Perhaps the cold realisation of exactly how much the divorce could cost him hit hard.\n\n'McIlroy has amassed a fortune of more than £200m and his projected earnings in his career are predicted to be more than double that figure. Surely he didn't want to see all that money he's accrued diminish.\n\n'It would have felt like a huge waste if millions ended up in the pockets of lawyers.' \n\nThe friend added: 'There is also their three-year-old daughter Poppy to consider. Rory is a doting dad and he has strong family values.'\n\nThe New York Post reported that the couple had signed a prenup agreement prior to their star-studded April 2017 wedding at Ashford Castle in County Mayo.\n\nPrenuptial agreements are not legally binding in Ireland - or in England and Wales - but they are in the US where it is believed the legal agreement side of the marriage was taken care of before the ceremony. However, conditions vary from state to state.\n\nAn insider said: 'Under Florida law, there are a number of legal challenges that can be made to a prenup, it's not a 'done deal'.\n\n'For example, a key issue would be is the prenup unfair to Erica - is it 'unconscionable' under Florida's Uniform Premarital Agreement Act and it may not be enforceable on those grounds.\n\n'Basically, you could be looking at the potential for a protracted, extremely messy and expensive legal battle and clearly that is something Rory would want to avoid. It seems like he was headstrong and rushed into this without thinking it through.'\n\nMcIlroy and his wife are seen at the All England Club on day nine of the Wimbledon fortnight in 2018. The golfer was once engaged to former world No 1 tennis player Caroline Wozniacki \n\nRory McIlroy and Caroline Wozniacki, pictured together at the Masters in 2013, shortly before the golfer broke off their engagement after wedding invitations had been sent \n\nWozniacki opted against picking her ex-fiancee to win during an ESPN interview\n\nIn May 2024, McIlroy was revealed as Northern Ireland's richest person under 40, with the Sunday Times Rich List reporting his wealth at £225m - up £25m in 2024.\n\nHe was also listed at 19 in the Forbes annual list of the world's highest paid athletes - a total yearly earning of $80.1 million which makes him the second highest paid golfer in the world. \n\nA source told U.S. Weekly in May that year that there were other issues, too. Apparently Erica had been feeling ‘lonely’ in the marriage as the couple were effectively leading separate lives. \n\nThe source said: ‘She knew what she was getting into with his profession, but once they had Poppy things really changed and she had a new perspective. Erica was usually absent for most of his tournaments and was really focused on Poppy.’ \n\nAfter his victory at the recent DP World Tour Championship in Dubai, Rory admitted that he had been through 'a lot this year, professionally and personally'.\n\n'To have Erica and Poppy here, it means a lot,' the golf player said in November.\n\n'It's the first one they've been at in a while and for Poppy to be old enough now to sort of understand what is going on. I had to ask her if I did win, would she come out onto the 18th green with me?\n\n'Their support means the world to me and to be able to show Poppy what happened and some of the reasons maybe why I'm not around all of the time because I'm working or practising.\n\n'Hopefully she realises or thinks it's worthwhile that I'm not there every night for dinner or for bedtime or whatever it is.\n\n'It's incredible that they were here with me this week and I'm excited to go and celebrate with them.'\n\nRory first met New York state native Erica during the 2012 Ryder Cup while she was working for the PGA of America.\n\nHe missed his alarm but she helped him make his tee time at Medinah in Illinois by arranging a police escort.\n\nThey began dating several months after he abruptly called off his engagement with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in 2014, with the couple adopting a low profile initially.\n\n'I am very happy in my love life,' he said the following summer.

'She has a calming presence, a sereneness, and that’s not just on me; it is noticeable in any company.\n\n'She never wants to be the centre of attention and is always very comfortable in the background. \n\n'She has been a great influence on me and has given such a great balance to my life - between who I am when people see me out here, and who I am at home.'\n\nThe Northern Irishman held his nerve on Sunday to see off Justin Rose to complete a career Grand Slam and end 11 years of heartbreak since his 2014 PGA Championship victory. \n\nAfter his winning birdie putt dropped to seal the victory over his Ryder Cup teammate, Rory collapsed to the ground with his head in hands as his shoulders wracked with sobs.\n\nThe player joined Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only golfers to capture the four major championships in the Masters era.\n\nRory McIlroyMastersFlorida\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nErica Stoll's reward for loyalty revealed: How Rory McIlroy is eyeing up huge change to satisfy loyal wife after divorce humiliation\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Less than a year ago, Rory, 35, announced he and wife Erica, 37, were to split - only for the golfer to change his mind a month later.

Email: shannon.mcguigan@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SHANNON MCGUIGAN \n Published:01:29 BST, 16 April 2025 |Updated:01:50 BST, 16 April 2025 \n\nAt the top of most parents' worries when their children first go to school is bullying, but the playground isn't the only place where toxic and concerning behaviour can emerge.\nA WhatsApp chat of parents seems innocent on the surface but, according to testimonies from parents across the nation, they are a place where clique conduct and humiliation run rife. \nIn a recent exclusive interview with MailOnline one mother, who wished to remain anonymous, revealed how she had been called a 's***' in a parents WhatsApp chat. \nLikening them to 'school bullying', she divulged that she was repeatedly left out by other mums, who wouldn't invite her to meet-ups, to the point where she would 'question herself'.\nElsewhere in Hertfordshire, a community of parents was left horrified when two parents were arrested after it emerged they had been complaining about the teacher recruitment process at their daughter's primary school.\nTimes Radio producer Maxie Allen and his partner Rosalind Levine were locked in a cell for eleven hours after making the remarks, in a move the father-of-two described as 'dystopian'.\nAfter a five-week investigation, Hertfordshire Constabulary finally concluded there was no case to answer.\nAnd now as schools across the UK ask lawyers to draw up codes of conduct to help police parent WhatsApp groups in a bid to reel parents in, some have revealed the true extent of the toxicity - where even teachers and children are named and shamed.\n\nTimes Radio producer Maxie Allen and his partner Rosalind Levine were arrested on suspicion of harassment and malicious communications after complaining about a teacher recruitment process at their daughters school\n\nSchools are now asking lawyers to draw up codes of conduct to help police parent WhatsApp groups\nA mother, who posted anonymously on Mumsnet, recalled how parents began hurling vile comments and 'ripping [a teacher's] character to shreds' because the educator gave a child a poor mark on a test.\nThe chaos was sparked by a parent, who had taken a swipe at the young tutor for her child's poor performance, arguing that the questions were 'ambiguous' and 'badly worded', branding the teacher 'an idiot'.\nAnd when another parent pointed out it was 'inappropriate' to discuss her child's teacher in such a way, citing it undermines the school authority, she was brutally shunned by the chat. \n'Several other women started having a go at me also stating concerns with the teacher due to her harsh marking and strictness,' the woman wrote.\n'They said the WhatsApp group was the place to discuss concerns about the teacher and if I did not like it, I could leave the group.'\nShe also noted several other vulgar comments about the teacher, including comments about the educator 'need[ing] a good s**g', as well as jibes that said: 'She looks like a frump'.\nTorn between the advantages of the group, such as staying informed on last minute school trip changes and more, and telling the teacher, the mother feared creating a 'bad feeling' between the mothers and the school.\n'I also don't know what it would achieve if I broach this with the school but I think that undermining a teacher is not the most appropriate use of the WhatsApp parents group,' she added. \nElsewhere, another distressed mother was on the verge of reporting her WhatsApp class' chat which includes other parents from her son's primary school. \n\n Moment father is arrested after complaining about school's teacher recruitment process on WhatsApp \nIn a similar tale, a group of guardians took an 'immense' dislike to a year six teacher, who they believed was 'expecting too much' from their children on an upcoming grammar test. \nThey took issue with the educator raising her voice with the students, warning them they could fail their upcoming exams. \nAccording to a parent, who was involved in the group chat, others began to 'pile on' the teacher, with the witch-hunt taking a nasty turn and another threatening to take the teacher on legally for 'gross misconduct'. \n'I thought it would blow over and didn't really want to get involved so kept my head down and didn't comment either way,' the concerned mother penned to the parenting advice site.\n'One parent seems hell bent on rallying the troops to get this teacher out, she has accused the teacher of gross misconduct, emotional abuse and is threatening legal action.\n'I wonder whether I should inform the school,' she added: 'I come from a family of teachers so this may be clouding my vision.'\nMore than four in five school leaders say they have been abused by parents in the past year, a survey conducted by the National Association of Head Teachers (NHAT) has revealed \nVerbal abuse was the most common suffered with 85 percent of school leaders saying they had experienced this in the past year.\nNearly half of educators said they experienced online abuse, with over a fifth having suffered discriminatory language.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: 'There is never any place for abuse of teachers, school leaders or any school staff by parents, but it is something our members tell us has increased in recent years.\n'We have heard reports of trolling on social media and in parent groups on WhatsApp and Facebook, as well as appalling instances of hate campaigns and harassment and intimidation.\n'While this abuse is perpetrated by a small minority of parents, it is completely unacceptable, and can have an enormous impact upon dedicated professionals trying to focus on delivering the best possible education for children.\n'Schools will not always get everything right, but concerns should always be raised respectfully, and where they cannot be resolved all schools have complaints processes.\n'We need the government to send a clear signal to parents that abuse – whether in person or on social media – will not be tolerated.'\nBut teachers aren't the only ones to receive flack in the world of school WhatsApp chats, some parents have had their child publicly humiliated in front of an entire group of caregivers. \n\nEXCLUSIVE I was bullied and called a s*** in the school mums' WhatsApp group - they should be banned \nA mother divulged how another parent, who also works at the school, shamed her young child by pointing out she had caused another child's concussion.\nThe conversation began with a caregiver of the injured child asking how to treat the bump on her child's head after the incident at school. \nHowever a staff member, who supervises the children at lunch, took it upon herself to share the name of the woman's daughter who had caused the young boy's concussion.\nThe girl's mother asked the parenting platform: 'Is she allowed to do this? Would this be a breach in confidentiality? \n'I'm upset not only because I found out about this incident this way, but that this could have an impact on my child's reputation,' she said whilst sharing that both children involved were 'best friends'.\nOther mums have taken to TikTok to warn others of the clique nature of such group chats, urging parents to avoid them altogether. \n'Don't join the WhatsApp groups. Stay out of it,' Leanne Grant told her following of 28,700 TikTok followers. \nWhile acknowledging the benefits, such as quick communication and information about her child's school, that came with the chats, she also unveiled the power struggles that go on behind the scenes between parents. \nDiscussing her experience in a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) group, she said: 'One time, head of the PTA sent a message into the group, in capital letters...basically shouting at us all saying 'Some of you lot aren't contributing enough.'\n'And I said \"hey not me getting shouted at by a woman I don't even know.\" There were loads of people in this WhatsApp group who had never spoken before and when they got that message everybody rose up.'\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nShe added: 'Safe to say that lady who sent that text was no longer in charge of the PTA after that message, she stepped down.' \nIt comes as 'Britain's most hated mother' called for a ban on parents WhatsApp groups after being called a 's***' in one of the group chats.\nOne mother, from Hertfordshire, likened the experience to 'school bullying' adding that she was repeatedly left out by other mums, who wouldn't invite her to meet-ups. \nThe former glamour model, 43, who has four children aged between three and 19, was previously dubbed 'Britain's most hated mum'.\nShe received the moniker for a series of controversial moves, which include faking depression to get a nose job on the NHS, as well as charging her family £150 per head for Christmas dinner.\nBut despite being unbothered by her moniker, Ms Bellucci says she was 'belittle[d]' in the group chat with other parents at her children's school.\nSpeaking to FEMAIL, she said mothers in the WhatsApp groups chats made her feel 'so small and not important', so she decided to leave them. \n'It was constant chit chats between them and just not including me almost like they wanted me to see they wanted to make me feel like s***,' she said.\nExplaining how her children were often left out of play dates, she added: 'It almost felt like school bullying. \n'I felt so silly and left out. It brought back school bullying vibes to where I dreaded the 'ping' noise, I didn't want to look.'\n'I think they are a place to belittle people and it makes no sense to have them. Woman just b**** – jealous nasty b****y childish remarks – all unnecessary. \n'No wonder why they cannot control their kids; maybe they should put the same amount of effort into their children as they do in bullying other mums on the groups.'\nDivulging alleged 'bullying' towards her, she revealed a birthday invite was sent into one of the group chats, but her youngest child, Blu, wasn't invited. \nWhen she asked why her child wasn't invited, the mother was told the party was being kept 'small'. \nIn another hurtful exchange, one mother invited the group chat to a 'get together' with wine and nibbles, a prospect she thought 'sounded nice'. \nBut she says things soon went awry, as other mothers began to make snide remarks calling her an 'ex glamour model' and a 's***', while another joked they should 'lock up their husbands'.\n'There's always constant arguments in it,' she said: 'I've had a mum call me a s*** because of my past.\n\n'They don't invite me round anymore – I'm surprised they've not kicked me out yet. I'm no longer part of a few of the mum groups, as I left myself.\nNow amid news there may be enforced rules for such groups, she believes they should be banned entirely, or schools should be stepping in to control them. \nShe says: 'I think people, especially grown a** women, should know how to behave.\nBranding the behaviour in the chats 'shameful', she said: ' I would be so ashamed to behave like that; a total embarrassment to their kids.\n'I think there is no need for the groups. In fact, I think they should be banned. And maybe schools should step in and teach the mums how to behave online.\n'I'm a strong person but the next mum they do it to may not be as strong,' she said.\n'I know at least three other mums who feel the same as me and have left the groups and a lot more feel the same way but feel pressured to stay in the groups.'\nShe now feels an immense relief after freeing herself from the chats, which would make her 'question' herself. \n'I'm so glad I am out of all that,' she said: 'I actually dread seeing other mums on the nursery runs now – that's just not right.\n'I think in a world where you can be anything, be kind – that goes for mums too! Set an example of how you want your kids to turn out!'\nDaniel Kebede, General Secretary of the National Education Union: 'WhatsApp groups can throw up some tricky issues for school leaders, although they can be really useful to publicise school news like fundraising or school events.\n'What’s key is that dialogue between parents and schools must be respectful. While parents will find WhatsApp groups useful, they aren’t the way to resolve concerns that families may have. \n'Schools always have clear procedures for dealing with parental questions or concerns about the school and these should be used, not whats app. \n'Resolution though the correct channels is to the benefit of all and it’s not good for children or young people if an individual situation is discussed publically”.\nLast March, Times Producer Maxie Allen and his partner Rosalind Levine were held in a police cell for eleven hours on suspicion of harassment and malicious communications after a 'trivial' dispute. \n\nThe couple had complained about recruitment process of a new headteacher at the primary school attended by their eldest daughter.\nIn their messages, the couple were disparaging of the hunt for a new head led by Jackie Spriggs, the chairman of governors.\nCCTV shows six uniformed police officers descending on their suburban home before they were led away in front of their crying daughter. \nAfter a five-week investigation, Hertfordshire Constabulary finally concluded there was no case to answer.\nMs Levine wrote in the WhatsApp group: 'Can you imagine what the 'action' is? Hello, 999, one of the school mums said something mean about me in a school mum WhatsApp group. Please can you arrest them?'\nMr Allen chipped in and wrote: 'No public body has the power to control what people say about it.'\nAnother parent replied: 'This should be a safe group where parents feel free to speak and share opinions about how they feel about the school and its actions and activities, nothing more or less, end of story.'\nSupporting her view, another parent wrote: 'Everyone's talking about it in the playground as well. It's ridiculous.'\nFriends of a couple have spoken of their 'shock and anger' at the couple's arrest for comments made in the WhatsApp group.\n\n'Don't join the WhatsApp groups. Stay out of it,' Leanne Grant (pictured) told her following of 28,700 TikTok followers.\nOne fellow mother-of-two, a former member of the same WhatsApp group, told MailOnline: 'I was utterly shocked when I heard that Maxie and Ros had been arrested – it was a hysterical reaction to the situation and I simply couldn't believe it.\n'I've known Ros for six years and she's the nicest person I know. They are both lovely, reasonable people, and for anyone thinking there must be more to this – there really isn't.\n'There was nothing in those WhatsApp messages to take offence at – last time I checked, people are allowed to voice their concerns and criticisms without being arrested in this country.'\nMr Allen, 50, a Times Radio producer, has branded the police action 'dystopian' and a 'massive overreach', and accused Cowley Hill Primary School of trying to 'silence awkward parents'.\nNow, schools have asked lawyers to draw up codes of conduct to help police parent the groups. \nThe Employment Rights Bill, which is currently being debated in the House of Lords, could make employers liable if they do not take 'all reasonable steps' to protect their staff from harassment.\nSuch a measure may mean that teachers can sue their employer if they receive abuse in parent WhatsApp groups.\nTo prevent possibly having to pay-out to suing employees, schools are now reportedly rushing to have lawyers draw up codes of conduct for the online chats.\nIt is thought that concern is growing amongst headteachers that they could actually be found liable if parent WhatsApp groups are used to spread false rumours or racist and homophobic abuse about staff. \nAnd those concerns have arisen when teachers are usually not even a part of these WhatsApp groups, which are routinely made by parents of pupils often in classes together.\nHead of the education group at the country's leading law firm, Mischon de Reya, told The Times that both independent and state schools have sought his company's advice over the possibility of drawing up a code of conduct for parent groups.\n'Schools are very concerned about the impact on staff and being held liable, for what's been said in class WhatsApp groups and are implementing codes of conduct for parents.\n'If a parent WhatsApp group was creating an intimidating or hostile environment for a teacher, for example horrendously homophobic statements, the school would in theory be expected to do something about it.'\nAs well as abusive exchanges, concerns have arisen over the possible spread of misinformation on these WhatsApp chats. \n\nHistory teacher Vanessa Brown said she suffered 'unspeakable devastation and trauma' after she was left to stew in a policy custody cell for more than seven hours \n\n Mothers reveal the types of women you'll encounter in EVERY school WhatsApp group - including 'the informer' and 'the wind-up merchant' (so which one are YOU?) \nAlistair Wood, chief executive of Edapt, which also offers legal support for teachers, said: 'We frequently support staff where issued have escalated after misinformation or misunderstanding shared online. \n'These situations can quickly erode trust and take significant time for school leaders to resolve, drawing them away from their core role of running the school.'\nIt comes after mother of two was left to stew in a police custody cell for more than seven hours after she confiscated two iPads belonging to her children - and was accused of theft.\nVanessa Brown, a 50-year-old history teacher, revealed the 'unspeakable devastation and trauma' she suffered after being taken to Staines police station.\nMs Brown was searched and had custody photographs and fingerprints taken after taking away her daughters' devices in an attempt to ensure they were not distracted from their studies.\nSurrey Police, who also visited the children's school, pulling one of Ms Brown's daughters out of class, have since acknowledged their error. The force said they swooped after getting a report of an alleged theft from a man in his 40s.\nMs Brown was apprehended at her mother's home in Cobham, Surrey. Officers said a tracking device showed the iPads were at the address and she was 'detained after refusing to cooperate.'\nShe was eventually returned home, only after a 12-hour ordeal that, due to her bail conditions, threatened to prevent her from seeing her children on Mother's Day.\n'I find it quite traumatic even talking about this now,' Ms Brown told LBC.\n'They were able to send a police car with police officers to my children's school, they were able to send another police car or two to arrest me.\n'I know people are making reports of thefts, of assaults and very violent crimes in and around our neighbourhood, and they're not getting a response for days.\n'I cannot get to the bottom of why it was done in such a quick turnaround, maybe less than an hour - all these police cars and police officers going to an address over a completely false report of a theft.'\nShe said the heavy-handed approach of police, who took more than 24 hours from the moment she was arrested to inform her that no further action would be taken, had left her in a 'catatonic state'.\n\nMs Brown was held at Staines police station, above, after a report concerning two stolen two iPads. In fact, the devices belonged to her children, from whom she had confiscated them \n\n DEAR JANE: I got kicked out of the school moms' group chat. The reason why makes me hate all women \n'At no point did they think to themselves, 'Oh, this is a little bit of an overreaction,'' said Ms Brown. 'It was thoroughly unprofessional. They were speaking to my mother, who is in her 80s, like she was a criminal.'\nThe Tory MP Anthony Stansfeld, the former police and crime commissioner for Thames Valley, called on police to apologise for their inexpert handling of the incident.\n'It seems to me incompetence and a certain amount of overzealousness at a junior level, which the local inspector should have put a rapid stop to,' he said.\n'It was quite unnecessary to put a reputable 50-year-old history teacher into a cell for seven hours.\n'It's hardly likely that she would have absconded abroad and I would hope that the chief constable goes and apologises personally to the poor lady.'\nMs Brown has been involved in fraught disputes with two different men in recent years after relationships broke down, it's understood, including the father of her children.\nShe is head of Theology, Philosophy and Ethics at school close to her home in Cobham, Surrey where she has lived for almost 20 years.\nAs well as her own two daughters she has two step-sons and a number of pets.\nShe is a keen rugby player and registered at her local club.\n'A tracking device on the iPads showed that they were at the address and a 50-year-old woman from Cobham was arrested on suspicion of theft,' said the spokesperson.\n'A search was then carried out using post-arrest powers and the iPads were located.\n'The woman was subsequently released on conditional bail while further enquiries were carried out.\n'The police bail conditions included not speaking to her daughters, who were connected to the investigation, while officers carried out their enquiries.\n'Following these enquiries, officers discovered that the iPads belonged to the woman's children and that she was entitled to confiscate items from her own children.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritain's 'bullying' school WhatsApps: How parents gang up on teachers, embarrass children and humiliate parents in cliquey group chats\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

(I share these selections in a seasonal 20 Under $20 article.) But this sweet spot is disappearing.\n\nThough President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause in enforcing retaliatory tariffs of 20% on all imports from the European Union along with tariffs of up to 30% on imports from other major wine-producing countries, the 10% percent universal tariff he imposed will make it harder to turn up fascinating wines in this price range.\n\nAside from the damage it will cause to the network of small importers and distributors, retailers and restaurants responsible for getting wine to American consumers, along with the associated shipping and warehousing concerns, the tariffs, especially if the retaliatory penalties are imposed, will limit the options of those consumers who lack ample amounts of disposable wealth.\n\nIs wine going to cost more?\n\nThe tariffs will drive up the cost of imported wines. By how much? It depends on who absorbs the tariff penalty. In some cases, each party in the chain from producer to consumer will accept a little pain and nobody will have to pay the full share. But some businesses can’t or won’t accept smaller profits, so in some cases those extra costs may be passed entirely on to the consumer.\n\nRegardless of how the tariff penalty is divvied up, lower-priced wines are going to feel the impact more than expensive wines. Why? Because in general, people who are willing to pay $85 for a bottle of village Burgundy or $200 for a Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon will not care if the Burgundy costs $99 and the Napa cabernet $250. These prices are partly set by demand and are paid by wealthy consumers.\n\nBut value-conscious wine drinkers willing to buy an $18 cava may balk at a $23 cava. When these wines become not such good values anymore, demand will decline and they may fall out of circulation. This will diminish the options available to consumers.\n\nBut I’ll still find good, affordable wines, right?\n\nFor as long as I’ve been making my 20 under $20 recommendations, I’ve argued that the $15 to $25 range offered the best quality-to-price ratio.\n\nTons of wines are in the market for less than $15 and even $10. But these are often processed wines, made from grapes grown in vast, chemically farmed vineyards in undesirable places, then vinified in factories with additives and technological manipulations.\n\nMany find these wines satisfying enough, though demand for such wines has been falling for several years. That’s fine, though I’d rather drink beer or water than wines like that. Have I ever found a decent wine at these low prices? Sure, but rarely. The odds are against it.\n\nThese are the wines that, because of the tariffs, will now be in that $15 to $20 range.\n\nHow do tariffs affect American producers?\n\nIsn’t one goal of the tariffs to support American businesses? The United States makes many wonderful wines, from the West Coast to the East Coast, Texas to Michigan. The cost of these wines is likely to rise as well. First, American winemakers rely on imported goods, whether barrels, bottles, corks or winemaking equipment. These costs will rise.\n\nSecond, almost all American wines reach the marketplace through distributors who work with imported wines as well. They may spread out the cost of the tariffs through their entire portfolio so that the imported segment does not have to rise as steeply.\n\nBut won’t tariffs level the playing field?\n\nFor many reasons, including the cost of labor and land, and the fact that European governments tend to invest in wine businesses while the American government does not, it’s difficult for American wines to compete with European wines of equivalent quality, especially at lower prices. The fixed costs of making wine in the United States are higher.\n\nTariffs may make it easier for American wines to compete, but there’s another, bigger problem.\n\nGood wines are distinctive. They speak of the place the grapes were grown and the people who made the wine. You cannot simply substitute, say, a Sonoma chardonnay for a chardonnay wine made in Chablis or in Meursault. A riesling made in Washington state will never have the character of one from the Mosel Valley of Germany.\n\nHow will wine selection be impacted?\n\nHistoric wine-producing countries often make wines of hundreds of different grapes, a legacy of centuries past when most wine was grown and consumed locally. Each valley had its own grapes and its own style, many of which have been revived over the past few decades to the delight of wine lovers.\n\nThe modern American wine industry did not evolve in this fashion. Its pioneers were entrepreneurs who sought to plant the grapes that they deemed the best in the world, primarily cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Their success with these grapes and a handful of others, like merlot, pinot noir, sauvignon blanc and zinfandel, led to hordes of imitators who planted the same set of grapes.\n\nFor years, people believed that eight varieties accounted for more than 90% of California wines. I don’t think the percentage is quite that high anymore, but you get the idea.\n\nThe variety of wines made in the United States is dwarfed by the vast assortment available from other countries. If you’ve enjoyed wines made with grapes like carricante, limniona, fer, saperavi, treixadura, aglianico or touriga nacional, you are unlikely to find American-made counterparts. The tariffs may diminish some of that glorious variety.\n\nIt’s true that American producers in the past 20 years have slowly been diversifying the wines they make. The driving forces for this has been American producers who have been inspired by European wines they’ve discovered. If access to these wines is reduced you are less likely to see the continued exploration in the United States of grapes like trousseau and assyrtiko.\n\nOne crucial reason for this wide variety of imported wines is that, unlike any other beverage businesses, wine comprises hundreds of small producers around the globe. These farmers and winemakers have often resisted efforts by bigger businesses to absorb their holdings, or entreaties by marketing agencies to simplify their output or conform to popular styles.\n\nThey are able to stay in business because of the demand for what they offer. A significant percentage of their business is often in the United States. Trump’s tariffs will make it more difficult for many of these small businesses to survive, just as they will squeeze many of the small American businesses that import and distribute these wines. We may see more consolidation in the wine growing and distribution businesses, which will further diminish diversity.\n\nUltimately, it’s irrelevant whether I can pull together enough bottles to write the 20 Under $20 articles going forward. The point is that these wines will no longer be available to anybody unless they are willing and able to spend more money per bottle.\n\nThe price of wine will never be a political talking point, like the price of eggs has been. Good wine is not a necessity, but it enhances life. For many, wine may no longer make the cut in their tariff-tightened household budgets.","summary":"For years, I’ve had no trouble finding distinctive, expressive wines that cost under $20 a bottle.

The rule doesn't stop the export of H20 chips but requires Nvidia to get a license to export them.A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Exporting the H20 chips themselves isn't costing the company up to $5.5 billion. According to the filing, the charges instead could include H20 chips that have already been manufactured and now may be more difficult to sell due to the new requirement. Nvidia is also accounting for costs related to producing the chip and additional funds that may be needed to cover potential future losses.The Trump administration has taken steps to pave a way for tariffs on chips, including probes led by the Commerce Department into semiconductor imports. The investigations seek to determine what impacts those imports have on national security, which could give President Donald Trump a reason to implement tariffs on key tech goods.In general, Trump has said that his tariff strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic manufacturing of key goods. The president is also hoping to use the levies to push China to negotiate a better trade deal with the US, although the specifics around his demands are not clear.On Monday, Nvidia reiterated its commitment to invest $500 billion over the next four years in the US, promising AI supercomputers and data centers.The White House promoted the announcement as a win, calling it \"the Trump Effect in action.\"","summary":"Nvidia expects up to $5.5 billion in charges as a result of the Trump administration's licensing requirement to export its H20 chips to China.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-h20-export-license-trump-administration-sec-filing-2025-4","image":"https://i.insider.com/67feec793fe8d39283632bb7?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:29:04","author":"Lloyd Lee","authors":["Lloyd Lee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.749},{"id":311549282,"title":"Xia Baolong slams US tariffs, accuses Washington of threatening China’s survival","text":"Beijing’s top official on Hong Kong and Macau affairs launched an attack on the United States yesterday, accusing Washington of threatening China’s very survival and labeling its trade policies as “arrogant and shameless.”\n\nXia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), made the remarks during a keynote speech via video at the National Security Education Day opening ceremony at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nThe speech, delivered in Mandarin and broadcast nationally, marked one of Xia’s strongest rebukes of U.S. policy to date.\n\nXia criticized the U.S. for imposing steep tariffs on goods from China and Hong Kong, despite Hong Kong not levying any tariffs itself and the U.S. enjoying a trade surplus with the city.\n\n“This is extremely arrogant and shameless,” Xia said. “The U.S. isn’t after our tariffs, it is after our very survival.”\n\nHe went on to describe the United States as “the biggest sinister manipulator” working to undermine human rights, the rule of law, and stability in Hong Kong, warning that Washington’s “attempts to suppress Hong Kong will backfire.”\n\nIn a sharp rebuttal to recent comments by U.S. Vice President J.D.

temporarily blocks Trump’s ‘personal vendetta’ against law firm","text":"April 15 (UPI) -- The Susman Godfrey law firm succeeded in temporarily stopping the Trump administration from blocking its access to federal facilities and revoking government contracts.\n\nU.S District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Loren AliKhan during an hour-long hearing on Tuesday called President Donald Trump's recent executive order targeting the law firm a \"personal vendetta\" and accused Trump of \"abusing the powers of his office,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nShe temporarily blocked most of the sanctions against the law firm pending the outcome of the federal lawsuit, including the ban on the law firm's attorneys entering federal buildings and requiring federal agencies to cancel contracts they might have with Susman Godfrey.\n\n\"Law firms across the country are entering into agreements with the government out of fear that they will be targeted next, and that coercion is plain and simple,\" AliKhan said as reported by the New York Times.\n\n\"I admire firms like Susman for standing up and challenging it when it does threaten the very existence of their business,\" she added.\n\nAliKhan also ruled the Trump administration must provide guidance for federal agencies to follow the court's temporary injunction against many of the sanctions that Trump ordered on Wednesday.\n\nWhite House spokesman Harrison Fields said the executive order targets \"rogue law firms\" by \"holding bad actors accountable.\"\n\n\"American taxpayers should not fund lucrative contracts with law firms whose actions harm national interests,\" Fields told the Washington Post in a prepared statement.\n\nTrump in the executive order accused the law firm of weaponizing the nation's legal system and removed security clearances for its attorneys, blocked their access to federal buildings and directed federal agencies to end all contracts with Susman Godfrey.\n\n\"Susman spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections,\" Trump said in the executive order.\n\n\"Susman also funds groups that engage dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military through the injection of political and radical ideology,\" Trump said, \"and it supports efforts to discriminate on the basis of race.\"\n\nHe said his administration is committed to ending illegal discrimination done \"in the name of 'diversity, equity and inclusion' policies.\n\n\"Those who engage in blatant discrimination and other activities inconsistent with the interests of the United States should not have access to our nation's secrets nor be deemed responsible stewards of federal funds,\" he added.\n\nThe law firm represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News and secured a nearly $778 million settlement over claims that the electronic voting systems were compromised during the 2020 election.\n\nSusman Godfrey has law offices in Houston, New York City, Los Angeles and Seattle.\n\nPresident Joe Biden appointed AliKhan to the federal court in 2022.","summary":"The Susman

Administration Presages Court Battles","text":"Now that Harvard University has rejected a list of conditions from the Trump administration implicating billions in future federal funding, the lines between campus free speech, racial policies, and federal oversight of higher education activities could ultimately be drawn in federal courts.\n\nThe federal Joint Task Force on Anti-Semitism announced on April 14 that it is freezing $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts in response to the university’s alleged refusal to take steps to combat campus anti-Semitism and end DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives.\n\nThat prompted responses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Education, on behalf of that task force, accusing the Ivy League school of violating civil rights laws by not taking anti-Semitism and discrimination on campus seriously.\n\n“Harvard’s statement reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation’s most prestigious universities and colleges—that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,” HHS said in an April 15 statement, which was emailed to The Epoch Times.\n\nAt this point, say policy experts, court battles are inevitable.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who initially warned that Harvard stands to lose about $9 billion due to noncompliance with his executive orders regarding campus anti-Semitism and DEI, has already compelled Columbia University to comply with similar conditions.\n\nAndrew Gillen, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, told The Epoch Times that “serious litigation” from Harvard is expected within days. The decisions will ultimately be based on legal merits, not on one side having more money for lawyers, he said.\n\n“Maybe not everything [the Trump administration is] asking schools to do in a case like this are related to Civil Rights. This is something courts should clarify, so it’s fundamentally a good thing,” he said.\n\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said “the fight of the century” is looming, especially considering that at least 111 U.S. federal judges and four Supreme Court justices are Harvard Law School graduates.\n\n“I think Harvard is looking at its chances in [the] Supreme Court,” he told The Epoch Times. “But I think the Trump administration will prevail.”\n\nStill, he wrote, the school lost the 2023 Supreme Court case that prohibits racial preferences in student admissions, and last year it was unable to defend former university president Claudine Gay against allegations of plagiarism and accusations that she didn’t do enough to stop the harassment of Jewish students following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by terrorist group Hamas.\n\n“Harvard is not going to admit defeat,” Wood said.\n\nHarvard’s loss of research funds was already exacerbated by the National Institute of Health’s recent decision to cap research grant overhead costs at 15 percent.\n\nWood said those administrative costs, which don’t cover the actual research labor and materials, were inflated by more than $28 billion on a national scale in 2023. The most elite schools, he added, use much of that extra money on administrative functions that promote progressive initiatives and are unrelated to scientific discovery.\n\nFederal research money is awarded through a very competitive process, he said, so if Harvard is disqualified from future funding, more than 180 other research universities are still eligible to work on medical breakthroughs and scientific innovation.\n\nThis fight has generated plenty of noise in Boston and the Beltway.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama was quick to applaud leaders of his alma mater.\n\n“It is not the constitutional right of any private university to receive federal funding in perpetuity,“ the club’s statement said. ”While some of the funding has been allocated to reasonable programs, Harvard has shown itself to be a partisan consumer of the American taxpayer dollar.”\n\n“Universities need to address legitimate criticisms with humility and openness. But the way to bring about constructive change is not by destroying the nation’s capacity for scientific research or through the government taking command of a private institution,” said the April 15 statement from President Jonathan Levin and Provost Jenny Martinez.\n\n“Harvard’s objections to the letter it received are rooted in the American tradition of liberty, a tradition essential to our country’s universities, and worth defending.”\n\n​Trump, in a Truth Social post, threatened to revoke Harvard’s status as a non-profit institution.\n\n“Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’” Trump posted.\n\n“Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST.”\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Harvard University for additional comment.","summary":"Federal agencies freeze $2.2 billion and accuse the university of reinforcing an entitlement mindset and violating civil rights laws.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harvards-standoff-with-trump-administration-presages-court-battles-5842379","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/14/id5650057-GettyImages-2151026628KO-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:24:41","author":"Aaron Gifford","authors":["Aaron Gifford"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":311547176,"title":"Beijing suspends Boeing imports due to trade war: Bloomberg","text":"The central government has ordered the country’s airlines to halt deliveries of Boeing jets and American-made aircraft equipment in retaliation against the US’ aggressive trade war, multiple news outlets have reported, naming Bloomberg as their source.\n\nThe move follows US President Donald Trump’s imposition of an effective 145 percent tariff rate on most Chinese imports, which Beijing has so far countered with 125 percent levies on all US imports to China along with restrictions on rare earth exports and other measures targeting US companies.\n\nAir China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines had planned to receive respective deliveries of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes between 2025 and 2027. Even if the reported suspension was not in place, Trump’s tariffs would make the US-made aircraft far more expensive than competing models from Airbus and the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).\n\n[See more: President Xi Jinping embarks on a Southeast Asian tour amid US tariff chaos]\n\nTen Boeing planes were reportedly being prepared for export to China before the latest tariff hike came into effect. Sources told Bloomberg that some of them may still be allowed to enter the country, depending on the status of their delivery paperwork and payments.\n\nAnalysts said that a short-term halt on deliveries to China won’t have a major impact on Boeing, as the company could redirect its jets to other markets. They also argued that Chinese airlines could face difficulties supporting their fleets without components usually sourced from the US.Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein told clients that COMAC’s C919 programme would be “halted or dead” if China stopped buying parts from the US. However, Beijing is reportedly considering ways to assist the country’s airlines currently leasing Boeing jets and facing higher costs due to the unpredictable tariff war.","summary":"Fresh imports from the US planemaker as well as US-made aircraft parts are reportedly being barred from entering China\n\n\nThe post Beijing suspends Boeing imports due to trade war: Bloomberg appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/greater-china/china-boeing-trade-war-tariffs-us/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Boeing-Trade-War-China-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:19:53","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":311548548,"title":"Trump Opens National Security Probe Into Critical Mineral Imports","text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on April 15, tasking the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the national security effects of the United States importing processed critical minerals and the products made from them.\n\n“The United States manufacturing and defense industrial bases remain dependent on foreign sources for processed critical mineral products,” the order stated. “Many of these foreign sources are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks.\n\n“Should the United States lose access to processed critical minerals from foreign sources, the United States commercial and defense manufacturing base for derivative products could face significant shortages and an inability to meet demand.”\n\nThe president’s order argues that the United States’s reliance on other countries to process these minerals exposes it to possible security risks due to vulnerabilities in the global supply chain or supplier nations looking to gain a superior position.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will have 90 days to conduct the analysis, which must include, among other things, “the distortive effects of the predatory economic, pricing, and market manipulation strategies and practices used by countries that process critical minerals that are exported to the United States, including the distortive effects on domestic investment and the viability of United States production.”\n\nAn initial report will then be due to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Senior Counselor to the President for Trade and Manufacturing Peter Navarro, and Assistant to the President for Economic Policy Kevin Hassett.

Their schools range from private universities like Harvard and Stanford to large public institutions like the University of Maryland and Ohio State University to some small liberal arts colleges.\n\nIn lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security, students have argued the government lacked justification to cancel their visa or terminate their legal status.\n\nVisas can be canceled for a number of reasons, but colleges say some students are being singled out over infractions as minor as traffic violations, including some long in the past. In some cases, students say it’s unclear why they were targeted.\n\n“The timing and uniformity of these terminations leave little question that DHS has adopted a nationwide policy, whether written or not, of mass termination of student (legal) status,” ACLU of Michigan attorneys wrote in a lawsuit on behalf of students at Wayne State University and the University of Michigan.\n\nIn New Hampshire, a federal judge last week issued a restraining order in the case of a Dartmouth College computer science student from China, Xiaotian Liu, who had his status terminated by the government. Attorneys have filed similar challenges in federal court in Georgia and California.\n\nHomeland Security officials did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nIn some high-profile cases, including the detention of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, President Donald Trump’s administration has argued it should be allowed to deport noncitizens over involvement in pro-Palestinian activism. But in the vast majority of visa revocations, colleges say there is no indication affected students had a role in protests.\n\n“What you’re seeing happening with international students is really a piece of the much greater scrutiny that the Trump administration is bringing to bear on immigrants of all different categories,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nHow do student visas work?\n\nStudents in other countries must meet a series of requirements to obtain a student visa, usually an F-1. After gaining admission to a school in the U.S., students go through an application and interview process at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad.\n\nStudents on an F-1 visa must show they have enough financial support for their course of study in the U.S. They have to remain in good standing with their academic program and are generally limited in their ability to work off-campus during their academic program.\n\nEntry visas are managed by the State Department. Once they’re in the U.S., international students’ legal status is overseen by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program under the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn recent weeks, leaders at many colleges learned the legal residency status of some of their international students had been terminated when college staff checked a database managed by Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.\n\nStudents are told to leave the country\n\nHistorically, students who had their visas revoked were allowed to keep their legal residency status and complete their studies.\n\nThe lack of a valid entry visa only limited their ability to leave the U.S. and return, something they could reapply for with the State Department. But if a student has lost legal residency status, they risk detention by immigration authorities. Some students already have left the country, abandoning their studies to avoid being arrested.\n\nHigher education leaders worry the arrests and visa revocations could discourage students overseas from pursuing higher education in the United States.\n\nThe lack of clarity of what is leading to revocations can create a sense of fear among students, said Sarah Spreitzer, vice president of government relations at the American Council on Education.\n\n“The very public actions that are being taken by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security around some of these students, where they are removing these students from their homes or from their streets, that’s not usually done unless there is a security issue when a student visa is revoked,” she said. “The threat of this very quick removal is something that’s new.”\n\nColleges are trying to reassure students\n\nIn messages to their campuses, colleges have said they are asking the federal government for answers on what led to the terminations. Others have re-emphasized travel precautions to students, recommending they carry their passports and other immigration documents with them.\n\nCollege leaders spoke of a growing sense of uncertainty and anxiety.\n\n“These are unprecedented times, and our normal guiding principles for living in a democratic society are being challenged,” University of Massachusetts Boston Chancellor Marcelo Suárez-Orozco wrote in an email. “With the rate and depth of changes occurring, we must be thoughtful in how we best prepare, protect, and respond.”\n\nSuárez-Orozco said the legal residency status had been canceled for two students and “five other members of our university community including recent graduates participating in training programs.” ANNIE MA, WASHINGTON, MDT/AP","summary":"Several international students who have had their visas revoked in recent weeks have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing the government denied them due process when it suddenly took away their permission to be in the U.S. The actions by the federal government to terminate students’ legal status have left hundreds of scholars at [&#8230;]\n\n\nThe post International students file legal challenges over visa revocations appeared first on MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報.","url":"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/international-students-file-legal-challenges-over-visa-revocations.html","image":"https://i0.wp.com/macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25093855003607.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:14:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":311546640,"title":"‘American Psycho’ Director Says “Wall Street Bros” Missed Point of Film: “A Gay Man’s Satire on Masculinity”","text":"American Psycho director Mary Harron said she’s “mystified” by the way the 2000 film has been “embraced by Wall Street bros.”\n\n The filmmaker recently chatted with Letterboxd Journal about the “sigma male” social media phenomenon and how some men have grown to look at Christian Bale‘s Patrick Bateman as a role model.\n\n “I’m always so mystified by it,” Harron said. “I don’t think that Guinevere [Turner, American Psycho writer-actress] and I ever expected it to be embraced by Wall Street bros, at all. That was not our intention. So, did we fail? I’m not sure why [it happened], because Christian’s very clearly making fun of them… But, people read the Bible and decide that they should go and kill a lot of people. People read The Catcher in the Rye and decide to shoot the president.”\n\n However, The Notorious Bettie Page director added that “Wall Street bros” actually missed the overall point of the film, which follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York City investment banking executive who hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.\n\n “It was very clear to me and Guinevere, who is gay, that we saw it as a gay man’s satire on masculinity,” Harron explained. “[American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis’] being gay allowed him to see the homoerotic rituals among these alpha males, which is also true in sports, and it’s true in Wall Street, and all these things where men are prizing their extreme competition and their ‘elevating their prowess’ kind of thing. There’s something very, very gay about the way they’re fetishizing looks, and the gym.”\n\n In Ellis’ novel, Patrick Bateman also idolizes Donald Trump, who is currently serving his second term as the U.S. president. While American Psycho is set during the Reagan era in the ’80s, when the AIDS Epidemic hit the LGBTQ community, the filmmaker was taken aback at how the story has aged over time, as transgender rights are now under attack by the Trump administration.\n\n “It was about a predatory society, and now the society is actually, 25 years later, much worse. The rich are much richer, the poor are poorer,” she said. “I would never have imagined that there would be a celebration of racism and white supremacy, which is basically what we have in the White House. I would never have imagined that we would live through that.”\n\n As American Psycho celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, Luca Guadagnino is set to helm a new film adaptation for Lionsgate.","summary":"The filmmaker said she never intended \"to be embraced by Wall Street bros\" as Christian Bale's \"very clearly making fun of them.\"","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/american-psycho-director-wall-street-bros-missed-film-point-1236192055/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/MCDAMPS_EC002-H-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:10:50","author":"Carly Thomas","authors":["Carly Thomas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":311548696,"title":"SNL star Sarah Sherman TROLLED by Aimee Lou Wood fans flooding her social media with angry comments","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Apr 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilling video from inside Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's home reveals their dog's heartbreaking act\n\nWhy Prince Harry's surprise Ukraine warzone trip frustrated Prince William and left him fuming at palace officials\n\nWynne Evans submits dossier of evidence friends claim will CLEAR him of vile sexual slur and 'gropegate' scandals with Strictly bosses\n\nChristine McGuinness reveals the devastating true toll of her divorce from Paddy, how she really feels about selling their £6.5m family home - and their co-parenting plans: RICHARD EDEN\n\nI was forced to cheat on my wife after having children wrecked our sex life... here's why my deceit is justified\n\nMelinda Gates stuns host as she reveals why she 'had to leave' ex-husband Bill in incredibly candid interview\n\nWhite Lotus star who complained about 'cruel' British teeth joke is ripped by SNL insiders\n\nAMANDA PLATELL: I must apologise to Ruth Langsford.

You’re personally attacking her and not her characters,' one angry Instagram user wrote under one of Sherman's posts. \nAnother wrote: 'Mocking a woman’s appearance? Do better.' \n'Will Aimee be getting an apology for your really unfunny impersonation?' A third asked.\nA fourth accused Sherman of not being a 'a girl's girl' for participating in bodyshaming in 2025.\n\nComedian Sarah Sherman has come under fire following her cruel impression of Aimee Lou Wood in a Saturday Night Live sketch, which mocked the actress' teeth\n'That Aimee Lou bit was a rare miss. Pointlessly cruel. We expect better,' a fifth chimed in. \nIn response to the comment, one Instagram user stepped in to defend Sherman as he reminded others that while it was in 'bad taste' it wasn't just 'Sarah’s choice.'\n\n White Lotus' Aimee Lou Wood SLAMS SNL over 'mean and unfunny' skit that mocked her teeth \n'There are writers and producers to consider as well. And for Sarah’s responsibility, Aimee literally posted that apologies were made and she has no hard feelings towards Sarah. So let’s bring a little peace to the comment section, please,' he continued. \nOn Sunday night, The White Lotus star shared a series of posts condemning the sketch show after Sherman wore huge prosthetic teeth while parodying Aimee. \nIn response to being mocked on the show, the Sex Education star took to her Instagram Story to slam SNL and address rumours about HBO. \nAfter the actress went viral for her takedown of the 'mean and unfunny' skit, she claimed that SNL had reached out to extend an olive branch.\nAlongside a selfie distorted to make her eyes and mouth larger, she penned: 'I've had apologies from SNL'.\nIn the sketch, named The White Potus, it imagined the Trump family and various political figures on holiday at the famous retreat.\n\nFans of the 31-year-old English actress, who most recently starred in the third season of HBO's hit series The White Lotus, have flooded her social media accounts to call out how she portrayed Wood\n\n'Mocking Aimee’s appearance is honestly so gross. You’re personally attacking her and not her characters,' one angry Instagram user wrote under one of Sherman's posts\n\nWalton Goggins' character Rick was reimagined as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who was seen on a rambling rant debating they take 'all the fluoride out of the water'.\nThe camera then cut to Aimee's character Chelsea - played by Sarah - with exaggerated buck teeth, who exclaimed: 'Fluoride? What's that?'\nIn response, Aimee took aim at the 'cheap' joke, as she wrote: 'Such a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple weeks ago. Yes, take the p**s for sure - that's what the show is about- but there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?'\nShe also shared messages of support from her followers and sister Emily, admitting she'd received 'thousands' of messages backing her up.\nAimee continued: 'Last thing I'll say on the matter. I am not thin skinned. I actually love being taken the p**s out of when it's clever and in good spirits. But the joke was about fluoride. I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\n'I don't mind caricature - I understand that's what SNL is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/ Chelsea was the only one punched down On... Okay end of.'\nTo conclude, she shared a comment from a fan that read: 'It was a sharp and funny skit until it suddenly took a screeching turn into 1970's misogyny', she added: 'This sums up my view'.\nEarlier in the day, Aimee shared more thoughts on the matter, admitting: 'Whilst in honest mode - I did find the SNL thing mean and unfunny,' she told her followers.\nAfter noting she was feeling 'righteous' but 'might delete' her post later, fans encouraged her not to remove it.\n'Don't delete it, one comment read. 'It was mean and unfunny and saying it out loud removes their power.\n\nAfter the actress went viral for her takedown of the 'mean and unfunny' skit, she claimed that SNL had reached out to extend an olive branch\n'You're unreal in every way, I have a big gap in my teeth and an overbite and you've genuinely made me feel so much better about myself.\n'I was going to spend thousands on fixing it all which I'm not doing now because I look at you and think how gorgeous you look so why not try and apply that logic to myself,' they concluded.\nAnother commenter wrote, 'I agree- everyone else in that parody was a political figure who was being mocked.\n'The only character who wasn't political was Chelsea, and they were clearly just taking the piss out of your appearance/accent, which is extremely c***y and uncalled for.'\nEarlier, she clarified that 'nobody at HBO called' her 'ugly.'\n'That was my own paranoid thought' she explained, referring to a recent interview, which she says was misconstrued.\nThe star continued: 'Nobody at HBO would say that. My point in the article was about how our mind plays tricks on us. Please read carefully before getting angry for me.'\n'So to conclude today's rant: @hbo - kind and supportive and never wronged me so leave them alone. @nbcsnl - mean.'\nMailOnline has contacted NBC for comment.\n\nShe insisted HBO had been 'super supportive' but she was suffering from 'imposter syndrome' \nIn a recent interview with British GQ, Aimee explained that White Lotus creator Mike White had to 'fight' to cast her, which made her feel insecure.\nShe continued: 'When someone (not a producer) told me Mike fought for me it was said in a nice way.\n'I just spiraled about it because of my own imposter syndrome. That was my point. Just really wanted to clear that up because hbo have been nothing but super supportive.\nIn the GQ article, Aimee dove into the insecurity, saying, 'My little head goes: \"HBO didn’t want me. And I know why HBO didn’t want me, it’s because I’m ugly.\"'\n'Mike had to say, \"Please let me have the ugly girl!\" That was the thing that was in my head,' she continued.\nElsewhere in the interview, Aimee spoke about the interest in her natural overbite and gapped buck teeth, which she worried had progressed to the point that it was stealing attention from her performance.\nShe worried that her teeth were now seen by some White Lotus fans as something 'goofy' that she hadn't yet had 'fixed.'\n'It makes me really happy that it’s symbolizing rebellion and freedom, but there’s a limit,' she said.\n\nAlongside a selfie distorted to make her eyes and mouth larger, she penned: 'I've had apologies from SNL'\n\nIn the sketch, named The White Potus, it imagined the Trump family and various political figures on holiday at the famous retreat\n'The whole conversation is just about my teeth, and it makes me a bit sad because I'm not getting to talk about my work.\n'They think it’s nice because they’re not criticizing,' she said of those focused on her smile, before pausing and suggesting that the whole discussion might be tied in with sexism.\n'And, I have to go there… I don’t know if it was a man would we be talking about it this much? It’s still going on about a woman’s appearance,' she added.\nAimee has been praised online for leaving her buck teeth natural, instead of caving into the artificial beauty standards of Hollywood.\nDuring an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show, the actress marveled: 'I can’t believe the impact my teeth are having. Americans can’t get over them.\n'Even the way White Lotus fans are talking about me and my teeth — that I don’t have veneers or Botox — it feels a bit rebellious.'\nSaturday Night LiveWhite LotusAimee Lou Wood\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSNL star Sarah Sherman TROLLED by Aimee Lou Wood fans flooding her social media with angry comments\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Each of these was brought on appeal by the Trump administration, which requested temporary halts of lower court rulings blocking certain executive actions. As such, they’ve prompted decisions by the high court that mostly offer narrow legal rulings rather than drawing firm conclusions of law, as Supreme Court cases more typically do.\n\n“In all, the administration has been largely successful in cases reaching the Supreme Court,” Joe Luppino-Esposito, federal policy chief at Pacific Legal Foundation, a libertarian legal group, told The Epoch Times.\n\n“There appears to be two clear trends—rejection of sweeping, overbroad lower court orders, and an affirmation of the idea of the unitary executive. Issues involving those employees or other appointees of the executive branch are particularly falling the president’s way.”\n\nWhile the court didn’t rule on the legality of Trump’s invocation of the 18th-century law, it did remove one of the lower court’s blocks on his deportations. In doing so, the high court allowed the deportations to proceed but required the Trump administration to provide notice to deportees before their removal flights.\n\nAt an Oval Office meeting on April 13, top Trump officials said it was ultimately up to El Salvador whether to return Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador citizen, to the United States.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it, meaning provide a plane.”\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio noted that foreign policy is an executive function. “No court in the United States has a right to conduct the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.\n\nPart of Trump’s agenda has involved sweeping cuts to government spending across multiple federal agencies and departments. Legal challenges have alleged that Trump violated the Constitution’s separation of powers by redirecting funds without approval from Congress, which is in charge of appropriating funds.\n\nOne of the administration’s counterarguments has been that the lawsuits were essentially disputes over contracts with the federal government. Like the deportations case, the administration contended that the suit belonged in a different tribunal—the Court of Federal Claims, which deals with federal contract disputes.\n\nThe high court pointed to the Tucker Act, which the administration raised in court. Enacted in 1887, the law allows entities to sue the federal government where the government has waived sovereign immunity for specific types of claims, including those founded on any “express or implied contract” with the United States. These cases need to be brought before the Court of Federal Claims in Washington.\n\nIn its decision, the court didn’t offer much of an explanation but said that the payments were “owed for work already completed.”\n\n“Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?” he wrote.\n\nAt the beginning of the Trump administration, the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board each received brief emails notifying them that the president had decided to fire them. They sued in response, claiming that Trump violated federal law in part by not providing a cause for removing them.\n\nThe case has led lower courts to wade into a debate over the president’s removal power, which has been addressed in historical and recent Supreme Court precedents.\n\nNeither that order nor another involving Trump’s termination of probationary employees offered much in the way of legal reasoning. In the latter case, the Supreme Court allowed Trump to terminate some probationary employees and indicated on April 8 that nine nonprofits that brought the action hadn’t done enough to establish standing, or a right to sue.","summary":"More than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration.

The sources stressed the discussions were only preliminary, and the plan is one of many being talked about as congressional Republicans work on advancing President Donald Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process. Trump and his White House have not yet taken a position on the matter, but the idea is being looked at by his aides and staff on Capitol Hill. Meanwhile House GOP leaders including Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have publicly opposed the idea of any tax hikes. TRUMP OPEN TO SENDING VIOLENT AMERICAN CRIMINALS TO EL SALVADOR PRISONS \"I'm not a big fan of doing that. I mean, we're the Republican Party and we're for tax reduction for everyone,\" Johnson said on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" One GOP lawmaker asked about the proposal and granted anonymity to speak candidly said they would be open to supporting it but preferred a higher starting point than $1 million. They said the reaction was \"mixed\" among other House Republicans. But not all House GOP lawmakers are privy to the discussions, and it's not immediately clear how wide the proposal has been circulated. Nevertheless, it signals that Republicans are deeply divided on how to go about enacting Trump's tax agenda. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and enacting his newer tax proposals is a cornerstone of Republicans' plans for the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, it allows the party in power to skirt opposition to pass a sweeping piece of legislation advancing its own priorities – provided the measures deal with tax, spending, or the national debt. Extending Trump's tax cuts is expected to cost trillions of dollars alone. But even if Republicans use a budgetary calculation to hide its cost, known as current policy baseline, they will still have to find a path forward for new policies eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay, and retirees' Social Security checks. Hiking taxes on the ultra-wealthy could also serve to put Democrats in a tricky political situation in forcing them to choose between supporting Trump's policies and opposing an idea they've pushed for years. The top income tax rate is currently about 37% on $609,351 in earnings for a single person or $731,201 for married couples. But raising the rate for millionaires could be one way to pay for Trump's new tax policies. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., one of the deficit hawks leading the charge to ensure new spending is paired with deep cuts elsewhere, said \"That's one possibility.\" \"What I'd like to do is I'd actually like to find spending reductions elsewhere in the budget, but if we can't get enough spending reductions, we're going to have to pay for our tax cuts,\" Harris told \"Mornings with Maria\" last week. \"Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the highest tax bracket was 39.6%, it was less than $1 million. Ideally, what we could do, again, if we can't find spending reductions, we say 'Okay, let's restore that higher bracket, let's set it at maybe $2 million income and above,' to help pay for the rest of the president's agenda.\" But Johnson's No. 2, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., again poured cold water on the idea Tuesday. \"I don't support that initiative,\" Scalise told \"Mornings with Maria,\" though he added, \"everything's on the table.\" \"That's why you hear all kind of ideas being bounced around. And if we take no action, then you'd have over 90% of Americans see a tax increase,\" Scalise warned. Bloomberg News was first to report House Republicans' 40% tax hike proposal. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When reached for comment, the White House pointed Fox News Digital to comments by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier on Tuesday when she said Trump had not made up his mind on another proposal to raise the corporate tax rate. \"I've seen this idea proposed. I've heard this idea discussed. But I don't believe the president has made a determination on whether he supports it or not,\" Leavitt said. Fox News Digital also reached out to Johnson's office for comment.","summary":"House Republicans are looking for ways to pass President Donald Trump&apos;s policies via the budget reconciliation process.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-quietly-floats-millionaire-tax-hike-proposal-congress-gop-leaders-signal-opposition","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/johnson-trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:03:30","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.07},{"id":311551798,"title":"Biden swipes at Trump without naming him in Social Security speech","text":"Biden regularly refused to say President Donald Trump’s name during his speeches as president, calling him “my predecessor” or “the former guy.” He continued that trend Tuesday while amplifying claims from the Democratic Party that the Trump administration wants to cut Social Security.\n\nAfter taking the stage accompanied by the Bruce Springsteen song “We Take Care of Our Own,” Biden made a speech that was similar in tone and approach to those he gave during his single term in the White House, which ended less than three months ago.\n\nHe began by recalling stories from his youth, talking about moving from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Delaware, and the struggles his father faced finding steady work. Biden also mentioned how schools were segregated during his childhood, a fact he said bothered him as a fourth grader.\n\nBut he soon homed in on the topic at hand.\n\n“Social Security is more than a government program. It’s a sacred promise we made,” Biden said. “Seventy-three million Americans receive Social Security. From the first paycheck through their entire life, they pay into Social Security, and in return, they count on Social Security to be for them when they’re going to need it. Folks, we must never, ever betray that trust.”\n\nTrump stated repeatedly on the 2024 campaign trail that he would not cut Social Security and has kept repeating that promise since taking office. Earlier on Tuesday, he signed a memorandum attacking what his administration claims is Social Security fraud.\n\nThe Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has nonetheless cut thousands of jobs from the federal workforce. While Musk says eliminating jobs will save taxpayer money and thus make government programs more efficient and financially sound, Democrats warn that services are already being affected.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has called on acting Social Security Administration Commissioner Leland Dudek to resign, accusing the Trump administration of using him to “hurt seniors.” \n\n“Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a hatchet man in Leland Dudek, an acting Commissioner with an emphasis on the ‘acting,’ because his real role is to dismantle the very office he is supposed to lead, make better, and protect,” Schumer said. \n\nBiden was introduced by his own Social Security administrator, Martin O’Malley, who said that Trump and Musk had “gutted” the SSA “with a chainsaw.”\n\n“Make no mistake about it, it’s the American people who are feeling the pain,” O’Malley added. “They’ll feel the pain in the additional wait times. They’ll feel the pain from being crammed into crowded waiting rooms. They’ll feel the pain from their field office being gutted and reduced by 25% or 50%.”\n\nBiden made similar warnings during his remarks. \n\nHe said that millions of seniors rely on Social Security as their only income and that many are scared that their checks may not arrive on time.\n\n“For many of these beneficiaries, it’s their only income,” Biden said. “If they were cut or taken away, it would be devastating, for millions of people. And the psychological pressure we put people under by having this debate, it’s absolutely devastating.”\n\nThough he did not name him either, Biden specifically referenced Musk’s comment that Social Security is a “Ponzi scheme.”\n\n“What the hell are they talking about?” Biden said. “People earn these benefits. They paid into that benefit, they rely on that benefit. And no one should take it away.”\n\nHe also said that in America “nobody is king,” a remark likely directed at Trump, and implied that Trump’s administration is driven by cruelty rather than care for common people. \n\n“These people get knocked down every day. They learned to get up,” Biden said. “The last thing they need from their government is deliberate cruelty.”\n\nTrump to sign memo combating Social Security fraud\n\nAhead of the speech, the White House defended Trump’s record on Social Security and took a shot at Biden’s age, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt expressing surprise that Biden would give an evening speech.\n\n“I would have thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight,” Leavitt said.\n\n“Let me make it very clear, ahead of former President Biden’s remarks, the president, this president, President Trump, is absolutely certain about protecting Social Security benefits for law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens and seniors who have paid into this program,” she added.","summary":"Former President Joe Biden slammed his successor without naming him in a speech on Social Security that marked his first major address since leaving the White House. &#8220;They&#8217;ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing an additional 7,000 employees, 7,000, out the door,&#8221; Biden said at a Chicago conference for disability advocates on [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3381585/biden-lashes-out-trump-without-naming-him-social-security-speech/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25105832111565.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:03:29","author":"Haisten Willis","authors":["Haisten Willis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":311545820,"title":"'Home Alone 2' director calls Trump cameo a 'curse,' jokes he'd be deported if he cuts it","text":"\"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York\" director Chris Columbus now considers President Donald Trump’s famous cameo in the film a \"curse\" and \"albatross\" around his neck. The 1992 film featured a brief cameo by the then-real estate mogul as himself giving directions to the movie’s main character, Kevin McCallister, played by Macaulay Culkin, at New York's Plaza Hotel, which he owned at the time. Though the appearance is considered an iconic moment in the film, Columbus told the San Francisco Chronicle on Monday that he now wishes it was gone. \"Years later, it’s become this curse,\" Columbus said. \"It’s become this thing that I wish it was not there.\" TRUMP’S CAMEO IN ‘HOME ALONE 2’ TOPS LONG LIST OF PRESIDENT-ELECT’S ACTING ROLES Columbus told Business Insider in 2020 that Trump \"bull[ied] his way\" into the film by saying, \"The only way you can use the Plaza is if I'm in the movie.\" In 2023, however, Trump claimed in a social media post that the filmmaker begged for his cameo, which Columbus now disputes. \"What’s going through this guy’s mind?

Ishiba retained power only by forming a fragile minority government in partnership with the LDP’s junior coalition ally, Komeito – but analysts say he has done little since to arrest the party’s downward spiral.\n“No one can understand what he is trying to do,” said Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor of politics and international relations at Tokyo’s Waseda University.\n“People are looking at each other and asking, ‘What are his policies?’. It is that fundamental … He just does not come across as a statesman.”\nJapan’s voters were “very disappointed” in the administration, Shigemura told This Week in Asia, adding that most Japanese sensed there had been a dearth of strong and decisive leaders since the late former prime minister Shinzo Abe stepped down in September 2020.\nIn the years since, prime ministers Yoshihide Suga and Fumio Kishida had failed to implement policies to boost the nation’s economy or improve people’s livelihoods, Shigemura said. Ishiba is likewise falling short of people’s expectations.\n\nA poll in the Mainichi newspaper over the weekend put support for Ishiba’s cabinet at just 24 per cent, below 30 per cent for a second consecutive month.\nThe cabinet did better in a poll by the conservative daily Yomiuri, coming in at 31 per cent, unchanged from a month earlier. National broadcaster NHK put support for the cabinet at 35 per cent, down one percentage point from March.\n“The No 1 issue for ordinary Japanese now is rising prices, but particularly of basic foodstuffs, like rice,” Shigemura said. “It’s something that affects everyone and requires leadership to solve, but we see none of that. Many people are saying that he just does what the bureaucrats tell him to do.”\nThere is also deep domestic concern about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Japan’s exports and the consequences for Japanese companies reliant on the US market.\nOther areas of concern for ordinary Japanese include wages failing to keep pace with inflation, worsening security concerns in northeast Asia, and the long-standing problem of a shrinking population. On Monday, the internal affairs ministry released a report stating that Japan’s overall population fell by 550,000 people last year, down for a 14th consecutive year, while the number of elderly people continued to grow.\n“It seems very likely that the LDP will be defeated in the Tokyo assembly election in June and then again in the Diet election in July. There is no way that Ishiba will be able to survive that after he lost the general election as well, although the biggest problem the party faces at present is the lack of a successor,” Shigemura said.\n\nThere have been rumblings on the backbenches that the party needs to replace Ishiba as quickly as possible to have any chance of avoiding crushing defeats at the ballot box, but the question remains: who could succeed him and effectively turn around a party that is on the wane?\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayasahi, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, House of Councillors member Hitoshi Kimura and conservative firebrand Sanae Takaichi have been named by analysts as potential candidates to succeed Ishiba. However, they do not appear to have inspired confidence in the LDP ranks and the party is sticking with Ishiba, according to Shigemura.\nMichael Cucek, a professor of politics at the Tokyo campus of Temple University, suggested that Ishiba was being positioned as the fall guy for a party hoping to wipe the slate clean.\n“No one wants to take over now and lead the party into another defeat in July so they want him to take the hits with the electorate,” he said.\nThe biggest winner in that election would likely be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), which Cucek described as “LDP-lite”. But given the fractured nature of Japanese politics – with nine parties in the present assembly – it would be unlikely for any single party to emerge with a simple majority, he added.\n\n“The DPP is likely to claim that the will of the people is for it to assume leadership, but it will not have a majority in the two houses and will need to build coalitions,” Cucek said. “At that point, it is less about ideological compatibility and more about just adding up the numbers.”\nWhile the outcome of political horse-trading was difficult to predict, a defeat for the LDP could allow the far-right wing of the party to rise in prominence, Cucek said.\n“I anticipate a vicious fight with the conservatives in the LDP saying it is their turn to lead because a succession of more liberal party leaders have messed up.”\nHarking back to Abe’s more hawkish leadership, Takaichi could take over the reins of the party and “marginalise the party’s moderates”, he added.","summary":"Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is struggling in opinion polls as voters fret about rising prices, stagnant wages and tense regional security.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3306640/support-japans-ishiba-dwindles-amid-talk-successor","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/15/9b143b20-ecb1-4367-a717-3dcffc2280fd_b4586599.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-16 00:00:09","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":311547880,"title":"In His First Public Speech Since Leaving Office, Biden Slams Trump Over Social Security Cuts, National Division","text":"In his first public remarks since leaving the White House on January 20, former President Joe Biden criticized the Trump administration’s approach to Social Security, warning that proposed cuts are placing the program — and its millions of beneficiaries — in jeopardy.\nSpeaking Tuesday before a quiet crowd of disability advocates at the Sofitel Hotel on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile, Biden addressed the conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled (ACRD), a group focused on safeguarding Social Security. Over a span of roughly 30 minutes, the former president delivered his speech in a calm and hushed tone, often barely audible to the attendees in the room.\n“So Much Damage and So Much Destruction”: Biden Targets Trump Without Naming Him\nWhile Biden did not mention President Donald Trump by name — referring to him only as “this guy” — he made clear his disapproval of the administration’s early actions.\n“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much ... damage and so much destruction. It’s kind of breathtaking,” Biden said.\nHe further reflected on the state of national unity, warning of unprecedented division.\n“We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are,” he said. “Like I said, I've been doing this a long time. It's never been this divided. Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart.”\nBiden did not specify which group the “30%” referred to, leaving the audience and observers to interpret the comment on their own.\nWhite House Responds to Biden With Sharp Rebuke\nThe Trump administration swiftly responded. White House spokesman Steven Cheung criticized Biden’s remarks and mental acuity in harsh terms.\n“His incoherent speech showed he had a feeble mind in a rapid decline to new lows,” Cheung said.\nCheung went on to defend President Trump’s record on Social Security, stating:\n“President Trump has repeatedly promised to protect Social Security and ensure higher take-home pay for seniors by ending the taxation of Social Security benefits. Anybody saying otherwise is either stupid or an all-out liar, or both in Biden’s case.”\nA Quiet Room, a Measured Tone\nTuesday’s speech was notable not just for its content, but for the atmosphere. Attendees at the ACRD conference remained still and attentive, straining to hear the former president as he delivered his remarks in a restrained and, at times, barely audible manner.\nThough Trump has continued to criticize Biden — calling him “the worst president in American history” and blaming him for issues ranging from border security to economic decline — Biden offered no direct rebuttal to the former president’s attacks. He also refrained from defending his own record during his presidency.\nFrom Model UN to Chicago: Biden Re-Emerges After Months of Silence\nPrior to Tuesday’s appearance, Biden’s only known public engagement was a speech at the National High Schools Model United Nations event last month — an event that was not open to the press.\nHis reappearance before the public comes after a prolonged period of political fallout. Biden left office after his own party urged him not to seek re-election, particularly in the wake of a disastrous debate performance against Trump last June. During that debate, Biden struggled to articulate his thoughts clearly, reinforcing long-standing concerns about his age and cognitive health.\nAlso Read: Hegseth’s Top Pentagon Advisor Dan Caldwell Placed on Leave Amid Investigation Into Leaked Classified Information","summary":"Joe Biden re-emerged from political silence to denounce what he called the “destruction” wrought on Social Security — stopping short of naming Donald Trump, but leaving little doubt.

Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) introduced a bill that would do just this. \n\nThe measure would also bar US sales of drugs made in China or with Chinese ingredients after 2030.\n\nTrump should also slap hefty tariffs on China’s medications. \n\nGeneric drug manufacturers here are more likely to invest in expansion if they know they won’t be blown away by cheap Chinese competitors.\n\nAnd we must shift the conversation in Washington, DC, away from shaving drug costs toward ensuring drug access.\n\nDomestic drug manufacturing will necessarily cost more, but the key to improving Americans’ health is the ability to get the drug you need to prevent a heart attack or dissolve a blood clot — whether China is on the warpath or not.\n\nChina’s President Xi Jinping claims, “there are no winners in a trade war, or a tariff war.”\n\nThat’s untrue. \n\nThe United States appears poised to win reciprocal tariffs, or no tariffs, with its friendly trading partners. \n\nTrump should take those wins. \n\nMeanwhile, China has shown its true colors as an adversary bent on bringing its trading partners to their knees. \n\nWe have been warned. \n\nTime to take action.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and co-founder of the Committee to Save Our City.","summary":"China has a death grip on America’s generic-drug market and the basic medical equipment our doctors rely on — and could weaponize that control at any time.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/15/opinion/chinas-chokehold-on-us-medicine-is-risking-american-lives/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/xiexiii.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 23:58:49","author":"Betsy McCaughey","authors":["Betsy McCaughey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":311544036,"title":"Review of decision not to award Space Command to Alabama inconclusive, with Trump reversal expected","text":"By TARA COPP\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — With the Trump administration expected to reverse a controversial 2023 decision on the permanent location of U.S. Space Command, a review by the Defense Department inspector general could not determine why Colorado was chosen over Alabama.\n\nThe inspector general’s report, issued Friday, said this was in part due to a lack of access to senior defense officials during the Biden administration, when the review began.\n\nThe location of U.S. Space Command has significant implications for the local economy, given the fast growth in national defense spending in space-based communications and defenses.\n\nIn 2021, the Air Force identified Army Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as the preferred location for the new U.S. Space Command due to cost and other factors.

US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, April 7, 2025. (credit: Avi Ohayon / GPO)In the wake of these developments, a crucial meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump took place in Washington last week. Yet, rather than providing clarity or resolution, the encounter left many questions unanswered.The Netanyahu-Trump meeting was anticipated as a pivotal moment at which to address the escalating tensions. Observers hoped it would lay the foundation for diplomatic talks to resolve the tariff dispute. However, instead of a robust dialogue on this pressing issue, the meeting was overshadowed by other agenda items. The two leaders discussed a range of topics, from regional security concerns to economic cooperation, as well as Trump flattering Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan and proposing direct talks with Iran for nuclear power, but the contentious tariff issue was conspicuously absent from the forefront of their discussions.A puzzling omission This omission has left analysts and diplomats puzzled. Not surprisingly, Netanyahu remained mostly quiet. Was it a strategic decision to avoid confrontation? Or perhaps a diplomatic oversight? Whatever the reason, the absence of any concrete discussion on the tariff has left a void in the conversation, one that continues to fuel speculation and concern.Economic analysts have been quick to weigh in on the potential repercussions of the tariff. Opinions are divided, with many predicting increased costs for consumers and businesses reliant on Israeli imports, while others see it as an opportunity for domestic industries to step in and fill the gap. The uncertainty surrounding the tariff’s future – what Trump will decide to do in 90 days – only adds to the complexity of the situation.The international community is watching closely, with many nations concerned about the broader implications for global trade and security alliances. The US-Israel relationship has long been a cornerstone of Middle Eastern diplomacy, and any strain could have far-reaching consequences. Yet, without a clear path forward, the situation remains precarious not just for Israel, nor the Middle East, but for the entire world.What did not happen during the Netanyahu-Trump meeting is as telling as what did. The lack of a direct conversation about the tariff suggests a hesitancy, perhaps from both sides, not often seen, to engage in a potentially contentious debate. This hesitancy could be attributed to various factors, including political pressures – both domestic and international – and perhaps a strategy to address the issue through backchannel negotiations.As the situation develops, the need for diplomatic engagement becomes increasingly urgent. The coming weeks may bring further negotiations or adjustments to the tariff policy, and the US president’s vision of the Middle East, depending on the outcomes of these quiet efforts and the political dynamics in both countries.Watchful waitingFor now, the international community remains in a state of watchful waiting. The US and Israel have a long history of overcoming challenges through dialogue and cooperation. Yet, the absence of a direct discussion on the tariff during the key Washington meeting and the digression to Turkey and Iran is a reminder of the complexities and nuances that define international relations.In the end, what did not happen during the Netanyahu-Trump meeting might prove to be as significant as any agreements or public statements that were made. As both nations navigate this diplomatic minefield, created by the imposed economic rigidity, the hope is that dialogue and cooperation will eventually prevail, leading to a resolution that upholds the integrity of the longstanding partnership.The writer is a psychologist specializing in trauma and abuse.

She was 65.\nA report obtained by DailyMail.com indicated that Arakawa had bookmarks on her computer suggesting that she had been researching medical conditions with symptoms similar to Covid-19 or the flu prior to her death.\n\nGene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa have finally been laid to rest after weeks after their shocking deaths. The Oscar-winning actor and his classical pianist wife had their funeral in Santa Fe, New Mexico, People reported on Tuesday; pictured together in 2003 in Beverly Hills\nHackman, who was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease at the time, is believed to have wandered around the couple's home alone after his wife's death.\nThe actor, who was 95, is believed to have died nearly a week later, around February 18, from severe heart disease, while Alzheimer's and kidney disease were contributing factors. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Chilling video inside Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's home reveals their dog's heartbreaking act \nOne of the couple's dogs, an Australian Kelpie mix named Zinna, was also found dead in their home in a crate, where it is thought to have died from dehydration and starvation. \nHackman and Arakawa's two other dogs were found alive on their property.\nSources shared that Hackman's son Christopher, 65, and his daughters Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58, were all in attendance at the couple's memorial service.\nHackman shared his three children with his first wife, Faye Maltese, who died in 2017. They were married from 1956 until their 1986 divorce. \nHe and Arakawa later wed in 1991 after being together for seven years.\nLate in life, Hackman admitted to having regrets about the amount of time he spent away from his family while shooting films.\n\nThe family farewell comes after Hackman and his wife's bodies were discovered in their Santa Fe home on February 26; police are pictured outside the house on February 27\n\nThe funeral was reportedly preceded by a private memorial service for an intimate group family — including Hackman's three children — and close friends; Hackman pictured in LA in 1996\n\nAmong those attending were 62-year-old daughter Elizabeth (L) and 58-year-old Leslie (R), as well as his son Christopher, 65; Hackman's daughters are pictured on February 27 near Burbank, Calif.\n\nLate in life, Hackman admitted to having regrets about the amount of time he spent away from his family while shooting films. He said he 'lost touch' with his son Christopher (L); Gene and his children at the Superman premiere in Washington, D.C., in December 1978\n\nHowever, he appeared to have made more of an effort to stay in touch with his younger daughters, who were occasionally seen with him at film premieres or were spotted on the set of his films; pictured at the Superman premiere in Washington, D.C., in December 1978 \nHe said he 'lost touch' with his son Christopher because he was 'gone so much' during the period when his son was at an 'age where he needed support and guidance.' \nHowever, he appeared to have made more of an effort to stay in touch with his younger daughters, who were occasionally seen with him at film premieres or were spotted on the set of his films.\nFollowing Hackman's death, his estate seems poised for a battle over his assets after he didn't appear to have written his children into his will.\nIt was revealed in March that the Unforgiven star had left his entire $80 million Hollywood fortune to his late wife Betsy.\nHowever, Hackman made a crucial mistake Hackman made late in life when planning out his estate.\nDocuments obtained by DailyMail.com in March revealed that a representative of his estate had filed a petition in court to appoint a new temporary successor trustee, as previous successor trustees he had listed — including Arakawa — had all died before him, leaving no one left that he had specified to run his trusts.\nEarlier this week, it was reported that Hackman and Arakawa's home was infested with rats that spread the deadly hantavirus that led to Arakawa's death.\nAlthough carbon monoxide poisoning was initially considered as a possible cause of death, it was later ruled out after investigators discovered two of the couple's dogs alive on the property, and the hantavirus soon emerged as a culprit.\n\nAuthorities have released law enforcement body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February. The outhouses were infested with rodents, TMZ reported\n\nThe house owned by actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa as it stood on February 27, 2025\n\nA week after the bodies were discovered, the New Mexico Department of Public Health conducted a health assessment on the property and discovered a severe rodent infestation\nHackman may have been unaware Arakawa was dead, investigators speculated, given his severe health condition at the time of her death. \nA week after the bodies were discovered, the New Mexico Department of Public Health conducted a health assessment on the property.\nThe department concluded that dead rodents and their nests were found in 'eight detached outbuildings' on the Hackman property, making it a 'breeding ground' for the hantavirus, TMZ reported. \n\n Warning to millions over rodent disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife \nThe deadly hantavirus typically spreads through rodent urine and droppings that one may come into contact with when cleaning a basement or an attic.\nThere were droppings found in three garages, two casitas, and three sheds on the property.\nAdditionally, there was a live rodent, a dead rodent and a rodent nest found in three more garages on the property, according to the inspectors.\nThere were also two vehicles seen on the estate that had evidence of rodents, and they even found traps in the buildings as well, suggesting this had been an ongoing issue for the Hackmans.\nThe health assessment was conducted to assess whether first responders or others who were on the property were safe from the virus.\n\nThere were droppings found in three garages, two casitas, and three sheds on the property; pictured in 1994 in West Hollywood\n\nThe results revealed that the primary residence was deemed 'low-risk' with no signs of a rodent infestation inside. \nThe hantavirus was first identified in South Korea in 1978 when researchers isolated the virus from a field mouse. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Gene Hackman's daughter breaks silence on her reclusive father after his mysterious death \nThe virus is rare in the US, with fewer than 50 cases reported yearly. For reference, there are roughly 2,000 cases of West Nile Virus reported in the US annually.\nHowever, after Arakawa's death, the virus claimed three more victims in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California. \nHackman's 1995 will listed Arakawa — whom he married in 1991 — as his sole inheritor.\nHowever, Arakawa's will indicated that if the spouses were to die within 90 days of each other, the proceeds from the estate would be donated to charity.\nHackman retired from acting after 2004's Welcome To Mooseport, and he was rarely seen in public during the final two decades of his life. \nThe body cam footage and details of the investigation into Hackman's property were made public by court order earlier this month. \n\nA health assessment was conducted to assess whether first responders or others who were on the property were safe from the hantavirus that killed Arakawa, but it was deemed to be a 'low-risk' setting; Hackman and Arakawa seen with their dogs Maisie and Roscoe in 2007\nThe ruling from a New Mexico judge allowed the release of redacted police body camera video and other investigative materials, including images of the couple's dead dog. \nAll photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order, to protect the Hackman family's constitutional right to privacy. \nAn attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued that the couple took great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death. \nBut judge Matthew Wilson permitted details to be released, provided they did not depict the bodies of Hackman or Arakawa. \n'There shall be no depiction of either body in any video production' or photographic image of the bodies, Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson said in response to questions from attorneys on his ruling.\nThe previously redacted body cam footage shows deputies talking with two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the Hackman home. \nWith no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn't see how that could have been the case.\n'Something's not right,' one of the workers said.\nAuthorities quickly determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, fuelling a mystery that captured the public's attention.\nBut the case was ultimately when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer´s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome took the life of his wife.\nGene HackmanNew Mexico\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa's bodies laid to rest in private family memorial\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 17\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s town hall, including two who were tased by police at the event, according to a report.\n\nTwo people were tased and at least six people were removed as the Republican Congresswoman spoke at a town hall at Acworth Community Center in her home state of Georgia on Tuesday, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Three individuals were charged in connection with the disruption, including one who was charged with disorderly conduct, police told the outlet.\n\nFootage posted on social media appeared to capture the moment one protester was tased.\n\nOne clip captured a man wearing a black hoodie surrounded by five officers in the corner of the room, appearing to resist arrest. The protester can be heard yelling an expletive before he’s caught on camera getting tased.\n\nThe crowd can be heard cheering and clapping after the stun gun went off.\n\nRep. Greene then says: “This is a peaceful town hall.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to Acworth Police for more information.\n\n“Are you really doing this?” another protester — a man in a gray hoodie — repeated as two police officers physically forced him out of the room, a separate video captured. The officers kept telling him to “stop” as the protester appeared to try to break free from their grips.\n\nAs the chaotic group nears the door to exit the town hall, one of the officers can be seen tumbling to the ground, bringing the gray hoodie-sporting man with him.\n\nIn a separate clip, a protester holding up a “Jail 4 inside traders” sign can be seen being escorted from the town hall.\n\nThe sign appeared to be alluding to Greene’s decision to heed President Donald Trump’s advice and buy stocks last week as the market tanked due to his sweeping tariff plan. Hours later, he issued a 90-day pause on most of the levies.\n\nThe congresswoman bought stock in big brands like Lululemon, Dell Computer, Amazon, and the parent of Restoration Hardware after they dropped by around 40 percent on average late last week, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAfter the event, Greene reportedly praised the protesters’ removal.\n\n“I’m glad they got thrown out,” she said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “That’s exactly what I wanted to see happen.”\n\nThe interrupted town hall comes two months after a 54-year-old veteran was escorted out of a town hall following a shouting match with North Carolina Rep. Chuck Edwards.\n\n“And you wonder why folks don’t want to do town halls anymore?” Edwards quipped during the event.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/protester-tased-marjorie-taylor-greene-233746709.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/cec1d8de07c8275ab60d78ce40b28ab6","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 23:48:27","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":311543148,"title":"Trump showdown with courts in spotlight at migrant hearing","text":"US President Donald Trump's showdown with the judicial system came into the spotlight Tuesday as a judge grilled his administration over its failure to return a migrant wrongly deported to El Salvador.\n\nThe Trump administration previously admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was living in the eastern state of Maryland and married to a US citizen, was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador due to an \"administrative error.\"\n\nA judge has ordered Trump to \"facilitate\" his return, an order upheld by the Supreme Court, but his government has yet to request El Salvador return Abrego Garcia.\n\nTrump has alleged that Abrego Garcia is \"an MS-13 Gang Member and Foreign Terrorist from El Salvador,\" while Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that he was \"engaged in human trafficking.\"\n\nBut Abrego Garcia's family has continued to proclaim his innocence, and Judge Paula Xinis -- before whom the Tuesday hearing was held -- has said she had seen no evidence Abrego Garcia was a gang member.\n\nDuring the high-stakes hearing -- widely seen as a test of the judiciary's ability to tame Trump's White House -- Xinis slammed the administration for sharing \"nothing\" on its plans for Abrego Garcia's return.\n\n\"There's so much daylight between what you're actually saying and where this case is,\" Xinis said, adding she would set in motion a process to discover if officials acted against court orders.\n\nIf so, it would mark a tipping point for the Trump administration, which has for months flirted with open defiance of the judiciary following court setbacks to its right-wing agenda.\n\nDozens of protestors carrying signs reading \"Defend democracy\" and \"Bring Abrego Garcia home\" gathered outside the courthouse in Maryland on Tuesday.\n\nThey were joined by Abreago Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who urged Trump and his ally, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, to \"stop playing political games with my husband.\"\n\nHoping to heap political pressure on Trump, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen said he will travel to El Salvador on Wednesday to check on Abrego Garcia's condition and discuss his return.\n\n\"He shouldn't have to spend another second away from his family,\" Van Hollen, a Democrat, said on X.\n\n- 'Alive and secure' -\n\nTrump and his administration have repeatedly clashed with the courts since he returned to office in January, criticizing rulings that curb the president's policies and power and attacking judges who issued them.\n\n\"No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result,\" Trump said on Truth Social last month.\n\nGovernment attorneys last week rejected Xinis's order to provide an update on Abrego Garcia's status by Friday, saying that \"foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has since partially complied with the judge's directives, providing a statement from a State Department official saying that Abrego Garcia is \"alive and secure\" in the Salvadoran prison.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a court filing Tuesday that it would take Abrego Garcia into custody and deport him again if he returned to the United States.\n\nBut El Salvador's Bukele on Monday, sitting next to Trump at the White House, rejected calls to repatriate Abrego Garcia, saying: \"I don't have the power to return him to the United States.\"\n\nThe case represents the only time the administration has acknowledged wrongly deporting anyone, though the Justice Department subsequently fired the lawyer who made that concession, saying he had failed to vigorously defend the government position.\n\nsst-wd/bjt/dw/des","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-showdown-courts-spotlight-migrant-160458180.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/367670924e2b1b948844f93b4c2f6ecf","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 23:46:09","author":"Selim Saheb Ettaba And W.g.

Oh my God, this is a lot. \n'Essentially, you have female, you have male. I’ve met a lot of females and love them but don’t feel like I’m them.

So, that’s probably why we were talking about it last night.' \nBig Brother praised the reality star: 'JoJo, thank you for being so honest and sharing with Big Brother.'\nJoJo replied: 'Of course. It’s important to be honest and I think it’s important to show that it’s ok to not know.'\nSome wrote on X: 'did big brother accidentally force jojo siwa to come out as non binary rn? #CBBUK', \n'Jojo feels like she might be non binary and she talked about it with chris?

I never thought twice about anything.' \nGoing on to explain her journey in more detail, JoJo shared: 'I remember having a best friend, and I was 16, and we met on a cruise ship. I asked her, \"So when did you know you were gay?\" And she was 15 at the time. And she said, \"Oh, I'm not. I have a boyfriend.\" And I was like, \"Dude, no way.\" \n\nJust hours before entering the iconic house, JoJo clarified her sexuality and gushed over her partner Kath \n\nDuring an appearance on Paul C Brunson's podcast, We Need To Talk, he said: 'Let's start about sexuality and identity, that journey'\n\nShe responded: 'One I'm still on for sure.

Anyways, we became best friends.\n'Six months later, she comes to me, and she's like, \"Hey, I think I have to tell you something.\" It was June, so it was Pride Month. '\n'She says, \"I think you were right.\" And I was like, \"that you're gay?\" She was like, 'Yeah, I think I might mostly like girls.' And I was like, \"Yeah, I know.\" Which is exactly what you're not supposed to do to somebody. You're not supposed to put that pressure and not supposed to assume anything. But I fully did. \n'And two months later, she became my first girlfriend.'\nJoJo went on to explain: 'At this point I'm straight and she asked me \"do you have a crush on anybody right now, will you tell me who it is\" and I said \"no\" and we played this game the whole week, she'd keep asking me.\n'And she said \"will you just tell me if it's a boy or a girl\" and she was the first person that I said \"I have a crush on a girl\". And she said \"I knew it, I knew you were gay too, that's why you cared so much about me being gay.\"\n'My mum said, \"Do you like her as a friend or as more than a friend\" and I can't lie to save my life so I said \"More than a friend\", and my mum was like \"I figured.\"'\nSpeaking about coming out publicly in 2021, she revealed: 'Elton John called me, got my phone number and called me… He just wanted to say how proud he was of me and congratulations.\n'I thought it was all positive… and then I scrolled, and I was like, holy s***. And my thought wasn't whoa, people are being so mean to me. it was whoa, people are really homophobic, still.'\nGushing over her current partner Kath, she added: 'I have the most amazing, beautiful partner, they are incredible human being who I don't know how I snagged them at all.'\n'With Kath, I just trust them beyond trust.'\nShe added her dream is to, 'have babies, I just want to be a mom… I've had a very maternal instinct for a very long time since I was 12.'\nCelebrity Big Brother airs on ITV1 and is available to stream on ITVX.\n\nCELEBRITY BIG BROTHER 2025: MEET THE LINEUP!\n\nMICKEY ROURKE - AXED\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The actor and former pro boxer is one of the show's biggest ever signings and after public feuds with Robert De Niro, two marriages and a string of high profile relationships, he will be bringing plenty of drama.\nDALEY THOMPSON\n\nFAMOUS FOR: The double Olympic gold-medallist is considered one of Britain's greatest athletes.

Angellica currently co-presents Hits Radio while Fleur East is on maternity leave.\n\nDANNY BEARD \n\nFAMOUS FOR: The RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner - whose real name is Daniel Curtis - has signed up as a late entry. Danny previously made headlines after swearing on Big Brother's Late & Live last March whilst doing an impression of housemate Louis Walsh.

They were there for the latest stop on Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Fighting Oligarchy” tour.\n\nSanders did speak here in 2016. But “Fighting Oligarchy” is a new beast — progressive Democrats zagging into what is mostly Republican territory. On Sunday, the two were in Salt Lake City, and Missoula, Montana, is on tap for Wednesday.\n\nGeri Lynn Green, who owns a salon in downtown Boise, said “a chance to be with Bernie and AOC is a once in a lifetime thing. Especially for Idaho.” She choked up talking about the Vermont senator.\n\nCollege student Charlotte Konkol, who came with her grandparents, was giddy to see her oft-ignored hometown embraced by her favorite politicians. “Boise is such a little blue dot and we get overlooked because we are one of the most red states,” she told me.\n\nSome, like nurse practitioner Ginger Jensen, traveled four hours to attend. Retired educator Carolyn Walpole, who is recovering from a knee replacement and ankle fusion, drove more than 100 miles because she is so worried about Social Security — a bogeyman fear stoked by MSNBC and Joe Biden himself.\n\n“Being here, being counted is going to make my heart feel a little better. Like I’ve done something,” said Walpole.\n\nThe crowd went wild when Sanders said, “We don’t accept this blue state-red state nonsense. We are one people.”\n\nIf arena rock is a thing, so now is arena politics. With his 2016 campaign, Donald Trump turned campaigning into a touring entertainment experience. He drew supporters to large venues to cheer and jeer. He obsessed over crowd size. The failed Kamala Harris campaign took up the same model — as well as the fixation on crowd size.\n\nAs a leadership vacuum plagues the Dems, others, like Minnesota governor Tim Walz and California Rep. Ro Khanna, are now “touring,” albeit to little fanfare.\n\nBut, for better or worse, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez’s left-wing populist evangelism sure is filling the pews. And I wanted to know why.\n\nBoise local Eric Knutson, who is unemployed, told me: “She is a rockstar, AOC. It’s like, Madonna and AOC.” Green hopes she runs for president. (Me too. I think the Republicans will run away with the next election.)\n\nDuring fiery speeches, the duo raged against the one percent with blistering rhetoric, drawing thunderous cheers — part religious revival, part free entertainment. And, as many folks told me, it was their chance to be in communion with like-minded people.\n\nHoward and Julie Wiley, both retired counselors from Boise, left feeling energized.\n\n“It’s encouraging to know there are other sane folks who live in this area and call this home,” said Howard. “It was encouraging to me, to see a unified voice.”\n\nIt also felt like, dare I say, a Trump rally — only with different heroes and villains.\n\nDifferent merch, too. One vendor said their most popular item was a “Gulf of Mexico” T-shirt — showing how the new Trump agenda is agitating the left, but also sparking a business opportunity for resourceful merchants.\n\nHere, the “oligarchs” — mostly DOGE master Elon Musk, along with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg —were on the stake. There was no mention of the left’s robust meddling billionaire class (Soros, Pritzker, Reid Hoffman) or the fact that Bezos and Zuckerberg aren’t, despite attending Trump’s inauguration, known conservatives.\n\nThere were boos for Space X and big cheers for free healthcare, migrants, kindness and any mention of the working class. Ocasio-Cortez lionized Columbia University pro-Palestinian protester Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nOne common refrain from both Trump and Bernie supporters is that they feel their guy is fighting for them, personally. “He’s for the people,” said Knutson of Sanders.\n\nAnd a very big distinction: In 2016, much of the media willfully ignored the momentum of Trump rallies; attendees were dismissed as deplorables. The right would be remiss to completely disregard our current moment’s traveling progressive-palooza — and its attendees — even this early.\n\nI sat next to a retired teacher and former Republican who previously believed Sanders was too far left, but now she’s rethinking things. She kindly served as my interpreter on local issues: keeping public land public and the now-viral story of a nearby middle school teacher ordered to remove her “Everyone is Welcome” classroom sign.\n\nYou could see that as a warning shot to the right, to not overplay their hand in the culture war they’re currently winning.\n\nAt one point during Sanders’ speech, a girl in a keffiyeh unfurled a “Free Palestine” banner over the American flag hanging high behind the stage, leading to a tug-of-war with cops. She was kicked out soon enough, but the place erupted into a “Free Palestine” chant so loud, Bernie struggled to regain the crowd.\n\nHaving already hit out at both Biden and Trump for financing “Netanayhu’s war machine,” he tried to gracefully pivot out of the disruption by comparing the plight of Gazans to that of the American working class. Hey, if we’re talking about freeing Palestinians from Hamas, I’m on board.\n\nMaybe it’s not a big deal in Boise, but as a New Yorker trying to clarify the future of the Democrat party, it was clear that this anti-Israel bent will be a major — and well-deserved — roadblock to gain moderate voters.\n\nAnd this crowd wasn’t just anti-Trump. After years of having their candidates chosen by party leaders instead of voters, they’re not feeling a lot of love toward the old establishment figures.\n\nWe’re witnessing a party molting its skin — and looking for its next form.","summary":"For better or worse, Sen.

I cried more than I've ever cried.' \nTom, a fellow member of The Wanted, shared his diagnosis of terminal brain cancer with fans in October 2020, revealing he had an inoperable tumour. \nAt the time, he posted a heartfelt message alongside a photo of himself with his wife Kelsey and daughter Aurelia Rose: 'Hey guys, you know that we've both been quiet on social media for a few weeks and it's time to tell you why.\n\nJay McGuiness reportedly broke down in tears and had to stop filming during BBC's Pilgrimage, after becoming emotional over the loss of bandmate Tom Parker (pictured Stef Reid, Daliso Chaponda, Harry Clark, Helen Lederer, Jeff Brazier, Nelufar Hedayat, and Jay)\n\nJay's bandmate Tom died in 2022 at the age of 33 following a two-year battle with brain cancer (pictured in 2021)\n'There's no easy way to say this but I've sadly been diagnosed with a brain tumour and I'm already undergoing treatment.\n'We decided, after a lot of thought, that rather than hiding away and trying to keep it a secret, we would do one interview where we could lay out all the details and let everyone know the facts in our own way.\n'We are all absolutely devastated but we are gonna fight this all the way. We don't want your sadness, we just want love and positivity and together we will raise awareness of this terrible disease and look for all available treatment options.\n'It's gonna be a tough battle but with everyone's love and support we are going to beat this. Tom and Kelsey xxx.'\nJay also revealed that after Tom's passing, he would still speak to him, wondering whether he could somehow hear \nHe admitted: 'I have yes… it's a conversation which always be coloured by the question of like \"can you even hear this?\" \nReflecting on Tom's diagnosis, Jay said: 'With Tom, they knew it was serious quite quickly and there wasn’t really lots they could do, and I think it felt really senseless.'\nThe star added that while his pal was sick he had moments where he would pray and then when he passed away he felt like 'I wonder if he can hear me now'. \n\nIn the second episode, Jay, 34, joins six other celebrities on a spiritual trek across the Alps but an emotional moment unfolds as he becomes teary-eyed and excuses himself from filming\n\nSpeaking ahead of the show's airing, Jay admitted he anticipated emotional moments: 'I knew I'd talk about Tom Parker at some point during filming.

But the former president returned this week to highlight the Democratic Party's concerns about the Trump administration's cuts to the Social Security Administration, threatening a critical program that 73 million elderly and disabled Americans rely on.Biden's comments on Tuesday came as the SSA is planning to lay off 7,000 employees. The agency also recently reneged on a plan to cut off phone services after public backlash over the cuts, which would have disproportionately affected elderly and disabled SSA recipients.President Donald Trump has publicly pledged to safeguard Social Security, which pays out $1.5 trillion every year to retirees, survivors, disabled and poor Americans.But SpaceX CEO and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk has denigrated the program, which Americans pay into, as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"Trump and Musk have also suggested, without evidence, that Social Security benefits are being fraudulently paid out to millions of dead people.What To KnowBiden's address in Chicago to the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled drew varying reactions from Democrats and Republicans alike.Call To Activism, a liberal group that tracks the Trump administration's moves, posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"BREAKING NEWS: A fiery Joe Biden delivers the first speech since leaving office and he calls for DIGNITY for every single person who lives in this country. 'It's who we are as Americans. That's what it's about.' I miss him.\"The Blaze, a right-wing media outlet, struck a different tone, writing on X: \"A confused and lost Joe Biden is already rambling into the microphone over blaring music during his first speech since leaving office.\"James Surowiecki, an economics reporter and contributor at The Atlantic, wrote before Biden's address: \"There is no one the country needs to hear from less right now than Joe Biden.\"Others echoed that sentiment.\"It takes a special level of chutzpah as the man most responsible for reelecting Donald Trump to decide it's your voice that is missing in this moment,\" a person who worked closely with the Biden campaign told Politico. \"The country would be better served if he rode off into the sunset.\"Biden drew the ire of members of his own party when he initially refused to bow out of the 2024 presidential race following a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Though Biden did eventually drop out and then Vice President Kamala Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee, many Democrats still blamed him for the party's loss in the 2024 election.The 46th president was joined on Tuesday by a bipartisan group of former lawmakers, including former Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, former Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and former Social Security Administrator Martin O'Malley.O'Malley, in his remarks, accused Trump and Musk of having \"gutted\" the SSA \"with a chainsaw.\" He also described Biden as \"the greatest defender of Social Security\" in the last 20 years.Biden, in his keynote address, described Social Security as a \"sacred promise\" from the government and touted his administration's efforts to make the agency more \"efficient and more effective\" at delivering on benefits.The former president also pointed to the fact that he signed the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act into law as one of his last actions before leaving office. The legislation restored benefits to public service workers, including firefighters, police officers, and teachers who had their payments reduced despite paying into the system.Among other things, Biden on Tuesday accused Trump and Musk of taking a \"hatchet\" to Social Security, referring to the Trump administration's steep cuts to the SSA that have imposed significant consequences on recipients across the country.The Washington Post published a lengthy report last month detailing how the agency has been hobbled by its website repeatedly crashing, long call wait times, overloaded servers and staffing shortages.Biden also referred to the Silicon Valley motto, espoused by Musk, to \"move fast and break things.\"\"Well, they're certainly breaking things,\" the former president said in his address, later adding, \"Who do they think they are?\"What People Are SayingThe official X account for the SSA wrote after Biden's address: \"Former President Joe Biden is lying to Americans.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt mocked Biden ahead of his address on Tuesday, telling reporters at a press briefing: \"I'm shocked that he is speaking at nighttime. I would have thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight.\"Let me make this very clear ahead of former President Biden's remarks: The president, this president, President Trump, is absolutely certain about protecting Social Security benefits for law-abiding, tax-paying American citizens and seniors who have paid into this program. He will always protect that program. He campaigned on it.\"David Axelrod, a key architect of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, wrote on X before Biden's speech: \"Of course Joe Biden has the standing as a former president and the right of every citizen to speak out. And his admonitions that Social Security is under threat are important. But you have to know Trump is excited to see his favorite foil back in the fray.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a call with reporters earlier Tuesday: \"This is an all hands on deck moment, which is why President Biden's voice in this moment is so important.\"O'Malley said before Tuesday's address: \"Social Security is a sacred promise between generations. We are deeply grateful to the President for joining us at ACRD to discuss how we can keep that promise for all Americans.\"Independent Senator Angus King of Maine, who typically caucuses with Democrats, told The Post: \"What's going on is the destruction of the agency from the inside out, and it's accelerating. I have people approaching me all the time in their 70s and 80s, and they're beside themselves. They don't know what's coming.\"What Happens NextA bipartisan group of lawmakers recently asked the SSA in a letter to clarify its retroactivity policy surrounding the Social Security Fairness Act, particularly for those who were wrongly advised by SSA staff in earlier years.The senators asked the agency to revise its policy and grant eligible Americans the full scope of back payments allowed by law, saying the SSA should issue \"maximum retroactivity payments to all spouses who were protected on prior applications.\"The SSA has not yet issued a formal response to the letter.The Associated Press contributed reporting to this story.","summary":"Biden drew mixed reactions from Democrats and Republicans alike when he resurfaced to defend Social Security on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-social-security-reactions-2060199","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2627919/joe-biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-15 23:38:44","author":"Sonam Sheth","authors":["Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":311544024,"title":"California's commercial salmon fishing will be closed for 3rd year in a row","text":"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The 2025 commercial salmon fishing season in California will be closed for an unprecedented third year running, and sportfishing will be restricted to only a few days due to dwindling numbers of fish, fishing regulators voted Tuesday.\n\nThe Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, warned earlier this year there would be limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all, because of a predicted low number of fall-run Chinook salmon, often known as king salmon, in the Sacramento River.\n\nMORE: New gear could help save California's crab season while keeping whales safe\n\n\"This closed commercial and token recreational fishing season is a human tragedy, as well as an economic and environmental disaster,\" Scott Artis, executive director of Golden State Salmon Association, said in a statement.\n\nSalmon fishing is wildly popular in California but has been off limits for the past two years to commercial and recreational fishing due to dwindling stocks. People who commercially fish blame the issue on a years-earlier drought that walloped waterways, as well as state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive.\n\nSacramento River fall-run Chinook, historically the largest contributor to the ocean salmon harvest off California and Oregon, have experienced dramatic declines over the last five years, according to the association.\n\nSalmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish then make their way out to the ocean through waterways that wind through the state. That's done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. Agricultural water diversions described as excessive by anglers led to warm river temperatures and low flows when baby salmon were trying to make it from their spawning beds to the ocean.\n\nThe closure comes a few months after President Donald Trump ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's fertile Central Valley and residents of its densely populated cities.\n\nMORE: Bay Area students helping to restore threatened steelhead\n\nThe ongoing battle over where to route the water and how much tends to pit California environmental groups and anglers against the state's farm industry, which produces much of the country's fresh fruit, nuts and vegetables.\n\nTrump contends too much water is being used to protect the tiny delta smelt, a federally threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of the Sacramento- San Joaquin River Delta, but salmon rely on the same water for their survival.\n\nCalifornia's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.

They've gotten them during wartime, during recessions, during the pandemic. No matter what, they got them. But now, for the first time ever, that might change. It would be calamity for millions of families, millions of people,\" he added. The ACRD conference was billed as the 46th president's first public speech since leaving the White House. Biden however, has delivered other public remarks since Jan. 20, Fox Digital found, including speaking before the National High School Model United Nations in March, which received little media attention, as well as joining an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers event this month. ACRD is an advocacy organization that works to equip \"disability professionals with the tools, technology, and training to lead the industry forward,\" according to its website. BIDEN AIDES ‘SCRIPTED’ EVERYTHING, ALLOWED HIS FACULTIES TO ‘ATROPHY,’ NEW BOOK CLAIMS Biden's keynote address, which ran less than an hour, overwhelmingly focused on his accomplishments with Social Security when he served as president, taking aim at how the Trump administration is allegedly keeping the elderly up at night with worry over their Social Security benefits, as well as cracking a few jokes about his decades in politics. MOST BIDEN RALLY APPEARANCES ARE SHORTER THAN A SITCOM, HELPING FUEL STAMINA CONCERNS CRITICISMS MOUNT THAT BIDEN IS A 'SHADOW' OF HIMSELF AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'NOT THE SAME MAN' FROM VP ERA \"Why are these guys taking aim at Social Security now?\" Biden asked, referring to the Trump administration. \"Well, they're following that old line from tech startups. The quote is ‘move fast, break things.’ They're certainly breaking things. They're shooting first, and aiming later.\" \"The result is a lot of needless pain and sleepless nights,\" Biden said. 'EMBARRASSINGLY WRONG': LIBERAL MEDIA FIGURES ADMIT BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE The Trump administration has cut about 7,000 Social Security Administration staffers since taking office as part of its mission to cut government fat and bureaucracy, and realign agencies with \"America First\" policies. Democrats have slammed President Donald Trump over the cuts, claiming he will cut Social Security benefits to seniors. The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the Trump administration will cut such benefits, vowing to \"always protect\" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits. Biden continued that the Trump administration is allegedly looking to \"wreck\" Social Security to \"rob it.\" \"My friend Gov. O'Malley knows what they're really up to. He says, and I love his quote, ‘They want to wreck it so they could rob it.’ They want to wreck it so they could rob it. Why do they want to rob it? In order to deliver huge tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations and keep it going. They want to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations. That's going to cost $5 trillion. Where are they going to get $5 trillion to pay for, when they continue to run the deficit up?\" \"What they always do … by running up the national debt, number one. Then by taking the money from someplace else. What are the two big pots of money out there in raw numbers? Social Security and Medicaid. …. Republicans, these guys are willing to hurt the middle class and the working class, in order to deliver significant, greater wealth to their already very wealthy. Who in the hell do they think they are?\" he said. Former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and former Democrat Maryland Gov. and Social Security Administrator Martin O’Malley also joined the event. O'Malley presented Biden with ACRD's \"beacon of hope award\" for his accomplishments as president, including his leadership during the pandemic and fighting for the \"dignity of every person.\" EX-BIDEN AIDE SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT WAS 'FATIGUED, BEFUDDLED, AND DISENGAGED' PRIOR TO JUNE DEBATE: BOOK Biden added during that the nation is \"divided\" under Trump and can't continue on the same path. \"We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. I said, I've been doing this a long time, it's never been this divided. Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart,\" he continued. The Trump administration's official Social Security X account hit back after the speech that \"Biden is lying to Americans,\" before providing a detailed list of \"facts,\" including that Trump has repeatedly pledged to protect benefits and that no field office has been closed since Jan. 20. \"SSA is taking commonsense steps to transform how we serve the public - last month, we spent $16.5 million to modernize telephone services nationwide. We’re developing cutting-edge, AI-powered tools to streamline simple tasks,\" the thread continued. \"SSA Inspector General report released while Joe Biden was President found $72 billion in improper payments from fiscal years 2015 through 2022.\" The event comes as political books investigating the 2024 campaign cycle hit the shelves, including \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History\" and \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.\" BIDEN'S TEAM HID THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS HEALTH ALL ALONG: WH PRESS SEC Excerpts from Chris Whipple's \"Unchartered\" reported that White House staffers allegedly kept Biden from socializing with others, including close allies and friends, out of fear the 46th president \"might say the wrong thing or might feed the mental acuity narrative.\" While he also appeared \"absolutely exhausted\" ahead of his ill-fated debate against Trump in June, according to the book, which opened the floodgates to public concern over Biden's mental acuity as he tripped over his words and lost his train of thought during the debate.

The post goes on to imply that a Conservative government in Canada would “capitulate to Trump’s every demand” including demolishing our healthcare system. \n\nLet’s break this down. \n\nThe International Democracy Union (IDU) is a conservative group that prizes individual liberties, low taxation and a free market. The group’s chairman is Conservative former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The Conservative Party of Canada is also listed as a “full member” of the IDU, with Poilievre listed as the chairman, and Randy Hoback, an MP from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, listed as the International Secretary. Poilievre even made an announcement at the 40th anniversary of the IDU, celebrating the organization’s work. \n\nThe group’s role in the US election is a bit fuzzy. Mike Roman, former treasurer of the IDU, was indicted in Georgia for conspiring to steal the 2020 US election, but the IDU itself is more informal in its organizing. It exists to help members connect and talk about fundraising, campaigning, polling, “assist each other to win the political argument,” and “win elections.” \n\nWould a Conservative government capitulate to the US and Donald Trump? Would we cut our healthcare system? Poilievre has already committed to keeping some social programs afloat, and he’s publicly come out in favour of other hot-button issues, like abortion rights. It’s impossible to say how any government might deal with Trump’s future whims, but these claims, compared to the party’s stated platform, appear overblown.","summary":"A reader asked our fact-checkers to dig in to a Facebook post that claims the Conservative Party of Canada played a role in Donald Trump's return to the White House.
