Lawmakers can request additional protection, but it’s only granted if Capitol Police assess a credible threat. To bolster safety, federal officials have authorized members to use office funds for home security systems and campaign money to hire private security.\n\n“The violence and threats against elected officials, including people in the Senate, have drastically increased,“ Schumer said Tuesday. “That means we need more protection. We need more money.”\n\nSchumer said there was bipartisan support for increasing funding for the Capitol Police and said Sens. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Dave McCormick (R-PA) asked about increasing the money available to protect lawmakers. \n\nData from the Capitol Police revealed a sharp increase in threats targeting members of Congress, their families, and staff, rising from 3,939 “concerning statements and direct threats” in 2017 to 9,474 in 2024.\n\nIn recent years, political violence has surged, fueling demands for stronger security protections for public officials. Advocates of enhanced measures point to assassination attempts against President Donald Trump as key examples.\n\nBeyond these high-profile attempts, other violent incidents have raised alarms: an arson attack on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s (D-PA)home, the fatal shooting of two staff members at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., the arrest of an armed individual near Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s residence on attempted murder charges, and a 2022 shooting in Wisconsin where a gunman killed a retired judge while carrying a list of additional political targets, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nOn Monday, a 25-year-old man appeared in court facing federal charges for sending messages that threatened sexual violence against Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Deb Fischer (R-NE). \n\nThe Capitol Police have ramped up security for members of Congress affected by the Minnesota shootings, providing around-the-clock protection to lawmakers whose names were reportedly found in writings linked to the alleged shooter. However, lawmakers believe more must be done. \n\n“There’s a lot being done that is not being reported and won’t be reported, but there’s more that has to be done,” Durbin said.\n\nBefore the weekend’s deadly shootings and a spike in threats against members of Congress, the Capitol Police had already requested $967.8 million for fiscal 2026, a 22% increase from their fiscal 2024 funding. Now, with lawmakers demanding even greater resources, the agency’s budget could surpass a billion dollars for the first time in the near future. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Rep. Joe Morelle (D-NY) called on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to raise lawmakers’ office budgets to help “support enhanced safety and security measures” in a letter sent on Monday.\n\nThe House Democrats also urged Johnson to instruct the House’s chief law enforcement officer to “take all necessary steps” to ensure the safety of members nationwide. In their letter, they emphasized, “Too many other patriotic public servants have left Congress because they no longer felt safe carrying out their duty as elected officials.” They added, “We must act to protect each other and preserve this great American institution.”\n\nSchumer and other Democrats argued that “reckless rhetoric” from GOP figures has helped create a volatile and dangerous environment. \n\nThey specifically cited a series of inflammatory posts from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) over the weekend regarding the Minnesota shooting. Facing growing backlash from his colleagues, Lee eventually deleted the posts, including one that said, “This is what happens when Marxists don’t get their way,” accompanied by an alleged photo of suspect Vance Boelter wearing the mask police say was used during the attack.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who has been in direct contact with the victims of the Minnesota shootings, spoke to Lee about the posts. \n\n“I’m glad that he took this down,” Klobuchar told the Washington Examiner. “This wasn’t funny to anyone in my state, and he understood that.”\n\n“I feel like a lot of the MAGA rhetoric, which is so threatening, or other kinds of fuel to the fire, is a clear and present danger,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) urged both parties to lower the political temperature, warning that extreme rhetoric, such as calling opponents fascists or threats to democracy, can incite violence.\n\n“The President of the United States has been shot at twice in the last year … egged on by the most unbelievable rhetoric calling him a fascist, calling him a threat to democracy, calling for him to be taken out, so I think we can work together to turn down the temperature here,” Hawley said, speaking with reporters on Tuesday.\n\n“We can disagree with each other without implying that the other person ought to have violence inflicted on them,” he added.\n\nRamsey Touchberry contributed to this report.","summary":"In the wake of the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, concern is mounting among elected officials in Washington over how to ensure the safety of the more than 500 federal lawmakers and their families amid rising political hostility and limited security resources.

Foreign policy hawks are teaming up with pro-Israel Democrats to support military action, while MAGA hardliners and progressive Democrats are unexpectedly aligned in opposing U.S. involvement in another Middle East conflict.President Donald Trump, who coined the America First policy, now finds himself pulled in opposite directions—by Israeli allies urging stronger U.S. support and by populist conservatives warning against another entanglement in the Middle East.His initial hesitation gave way to public praise for Israel's strikes, but the shift has triggered backlash from some of his most loyal media allies and exposed cracks within his political base. Tucker Carlson, the former Fox News host, was among the first to point out the emerging cracks in the MAGA base.The Anti-War Bloc: MAGA Meets Progressives\"I'm really afraid that my country is going to be further weakened by this,\" Carlson said during a June 17 interview with former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon. \"We are going to see the end of the American empire.\" Together, the two longtime allies of the president have become the loudest voices on the right pushing back against U.S. involvement in Israel's war with Iran.\"They're turning up the propaganda hose and trying to knock elderly Fox viewers off their feet,\" Carlson said, blaming his former network's hawkish stance on longtime personalities like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. Bannon went further, accusing Rupert Murdoch's media empire of pushing another unnecessary war and suggesting Fox had never fully backed Trump after 2020.President Trump, speaking at the G7 summit in Canada on Monday before his abrupt departure, brushed it all aside. \"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" the president told reporters. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\" Later, he referred to Carlson online as \"kooky.\"But Carlson and Bannon aren't the only ones raising red flags. In the House, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian-leaning Republican, introduced a War Powers resolution aimed at blocking any U.S. military involvement in the conflict. His unlikely ally? New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who responded simply: \"Signing on.\"Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, another Republican of Kentucky, warned that \"the same neoconservatives who sold us Iraq\" were back at it. \"The American people overwhelmingly oppose endless wars,\" he said, urging Trump not to let outside pressure dictate U.S. foreign policy.In Georgia, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene struck a more spiritual tone, posting, \"Pray that we aren't attacked on our homeland after our border was open for 4 years and millions of people and millions of gotaways came in.\" Greene, a steadfast Trump supporter, has nonetheless advised caution—urging the president not to rely too heavily on Israeli claims about Iran, citing past intelligence failures as a cautionary tale.\"War has bad consequences. We voted for America First,\" she added.Even Matt Gaetz, the former congressman from Florida and longtime MAGA loyalist, joined the opposition. \"This isn't 2003,\" he wrote on X. \"We're not going to be lied into another war. Not this time.\"Over on the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called Israel's offensive \"reckless and illegal\" and introduced legislation—the \"No War Against Iran Act\"—to block any unauthorized U.S. military funding. \"We will not be dragged into Netanyahu's war of choice,\" Sanders said.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, often targeted by Trump in speeches and posts, stood beside Sanders. \"The Constitution is clear—Congress decides when we go to war,\" she said. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut called the Israeli strike \"an effort to submarine the nuclear negotiations,\" while Representative Ro Khanna of California described the situation as \"a repeat of the same mistakes that brought us into Iraq.\"Though the two most powerful Democrats on the Hill, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have been relatively silent. Schumer did not sign onto the Sanders' resolution, even though he sponsored similar legislation as recently as 2020.On the right, Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist influential in MAGA circles, captured the mood from the base. \"There's a major schism in the MAGA online community,\" he said. \"Our people do not want war. They want their president focused on fixing this country—not fighting someone else's.\"The Pro-Strike Camp: Hawks and LoyalistsWhile ideological opposites on most domestic issues, foreign policy hawks in both parties are finding common ground over the Israel-Iran war. The new pro-intervention bloc stretches from Republican strongholds in the South to blue districts in New York and Pennsylvania—united by a belief that Iran's nuclear ambitions can no longer be contained through diplomacy.South Carolinas Senator Lindsey Graham and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman don't typically end up on the same side of a foreign policy debate. But both are backing Israel's military strikes and urging President Trump to follow through. \"Our commitment to Israel must be absolute,\" Fetterman said, while Graham insisted the U.S. must help \"finish the job\" if Iran refuses diplomacy.New York Democrat Ritchie Torres and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson issued near-identical defenses of the offensive. \"Israel IS right—and has a right—to defend itself!\" Johnson said. Torres echoed, \"Israel is not the aggressor. The true aggressor is the Islamic Republic and its empire of terror.\"Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Ohio Democrat Greg Landsman agreed that diplomacy had run its course. Cruz called Iran's defiance \"a direct insult to the Trump administration's efforts,\" while Landsman lamented, \"Diplomacy has been given every opportunity... force is now necessary.\"Complicating matters, some ascendent voices from the MAGA movement, exemplified by far-right commentator Laura Loomer, have turned on fellow conservatives who oppose military involvement. Loomer, who is fiercely backing Trump's authority to act, called on supporters to expose any right-wing critics of the president.\"Take screenshots of every single right winger who is s--t talking Trump right now,\" she posted to her 1.7 million followers on X. Her targets included fellow MAGA figures like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose anti-war positions she blasted as betrayal.President Trump, meanwhile, seemed to side with Loomer. He reposted replies supporting her call-out campaign and fired back at Carlson directly on Truth Social: \"Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\"Even former National Security Adviser John Bolton—often at odds with Trump in the past—was aligned with this emergent war coalition. He called Netanyahu's offensive \"20 years overdue\" and urged the U.S. to prepare for \"phase two—potential regime change.\"Whether Trump leans toward escalation or restraint, the fracture lines cut through both parties—and through the MAGA movement itself.","summary":"The Iran-Israel conflict has reshaped Washington, uniting hawks and pro-Israel Democrats, while MAGA and progressives oppose U.S. involvement.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/strange-political-coalitions-forming-amid-iran-israel-war-2087022","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2665244/anti-war-bloc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 01:15:13","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":332498846,"title":"Florida attorney general held in contempt after challenging court's block on immigration law","text":"A federal judge found Tuesday that Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was in civil contempt of court over her ruling to pause a new state law making it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to enter the state. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered on April 29 that Uthmeier show cause on \"why he should not be held in contempt or sanctioned\" for violating a temporary restraining order (TRO) from the court, though Williams ultimately decided he was unable to convince her otherwise. \"If being held in contempt is what it costs to defend the rule of law and stand firmly behind President Trump's agenda on illegal immigration, so be it,\" Uthmeier said Tuesday in a post on X. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation into law in February that made it a misdemeanor for illegal immigrants to enter the state as part of President Donald Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration. FEDERAL JUDGE SLAPS HOLD ON NEW OKLAHOMA IMMIGRATION LAW But on April 4, Williams issued a 14-day TRO in response to the law, following a lawsuit filed by the Florida Immigrant Coalition and other groups. She then extended the TRO another 11 days after learning the Florida Highway Patrol had arrested over a dozen people, including a U.S. citizen. The court said on April 18 that Florida law enforcement officers were bound by the TRO, preventing them from enforcing the criminal immigration law. The court also ordered the attorney general to provide notice to all law enforcement officers, which Uthmeier initially complied with. STAY IN YOUR LANE: FLORIDA AG FIRES NEXT VOLLEY AGAINST JUDGE HALTING STATE IMMIGRATION LAW But on April 23, he sent a follow-up letter telling the law enforcement community that \"no judicial order…properly restrains you from\" enforcing the immigration law, adding that \"no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce\" the statute. As a result, the court required Uthmeier to show cause as to why he should not be held in contempt for violating the TRO. FLA. AG TO REBUFF JUDGE WHO ORDERED HALT TO STATE IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT: 'THE COURT HAS OVERSTEPPED' Following his response, the court opined that litigants cannot change the meaning of words as it suits them, ruling that Uthmeier was in contempt of the court’s April 18 order to provide the TRO to law enforcement officers regarding the enforcement of the immigration law. As such, the court ordered Uthmeier to file bi-weekly reports detailing arrests, detentions or law enforcement actions when it comes to the immigration law prohibiting undocumented immigrants from entering the state of Florida, with the first being filed by July 1.

The comments follow anti-ICE and anti-Trump protests in Chicago that echoed demonstrations nationwide, prompting federal officials to reportedly monitor the situation closely—especially after the Trump administration deployed National Guard forces to Los Angeles. \"We will continue to resist,\" Johnson said. \"Whether it’s in the courts, in the streets, or through public policy, we’re going to stand up for working people.\" Mary Richardson-Lowry, the city’s Corporation Counsel, emphasized the legal limitations of such a deployment. \"We believe it is a violation of the Constitution to deploy troops or National Guard absent authority under the Constitution,\" she said.

However, only hours afterward, appellate judges issued a temporary halt on Breyer’s decision, setting the stage for their Tuesday session.\n\nPREVIOUS: Trump can keep National Guard in LA for now after appeals court blocks order\n\nThe lawsuit was filed last Monday after President Trump issued a Saturday memo to the Department of Defense ordering “at least” 2,000 National Guard members for 60 days minimum.\n\nBrett Shumate, a U.S. attorney representing Trump, said Breyer’s order interferes with the commander-in-chief’s executive power.\n\n“It upends the military chain of command. It gives state governors veto power over the president’s military orders,” he said. “Courts don’t just defer to the president’s judgment – they don’t review the president’s judgment.”\n\nThe panel of three judges – including two Trump appointees – pushed back on the DOJ’s assertion, asking the Trump administration hypothetical questions about how far this lack of judicial review could go.\n\n“If a hypothetical future president made the decision to call up in response the militia of every state and the District of Columbia, so 51 militia, would it also be your view that that decision by this hypothetical future president would be entirely unreviewable?” Judge Mark Bennett, a 2018 Trump appointee, asked.\n\n“Yes, because the statute says the president may call into federal service members and units of the guard of any state in such numbers that he considers necessary,” Shumate responded.\n\nSam Harbourt with the California Department of Justice argued Trump’s deployment was “extreme” and defies precedent.\n\n“Every day that this order remains in effect, it is causing harm to our nation’s broader democratic tradition of separation of the military from civilian affairs,” he said.\n\nMORE: CA Sen. Alex Padilla, Democrats write letter to Pres. Trump to remove military from Los Angeles\n\nAdditionally, California argued the president violated the law by not directly contacting Newsom about his deployment. The statute in question allows federal use of state National Guard troops under certain circumstances and that orders doing so shall be issued “through the governors” of such states. Judges appeared skeptical of this point.\n\n“Where does the statute say that issuing it ‘through the governor’ requires either the governor’s consent or requires consultation?” Bennett asked Harbourt.\n\n“We take it from the plain meaning of through the governor,” Harbourt responded. “We think at a minimum, that means that the governor needs to be informed of it and given the chance to issue it.”\n\nAdditionally, the state said Trump’s actions are harming California, since those National Guard members would otherwise be working on wildfire prevention efforts as the state heads into peak wildfire season – a point Newsom made in an earlier statement Tuesday.\n\nMORE: CAL FIRE is hiring: Newsom ramping up recruitment as Nat’l Guard firefighting capacity drops\n\n“President Trump’s illegal militarization of Los Angeles is sidelining crucial firefighting and prevention resources,” the governor said. “It’s time to end the chaos and get California’s National Guard back to this important work.”\n\nThe judges did not signal how soon they may issue a decision.\n\nConstitutional law professor Rory Little of UC Law San Francisco said the panel’s questions during Tuesday’s hearings were telling.\n\n“Honestly, I’m not sure the court is receptive to the California position. It sounded to me like this could be a reversal of the district court. This could be affirming of the Trump administration’s position, at least at this preliminary stage,” he said.\n\nLittle noted that all action in the courts so far has been preliminary. If the appellate court decides to permanently reverse Judge Breyer’s initial temporary restraining order, the National Guard would remain in Trump’s control for at least 60 days.\n\n“If California wins today, that case will go up to the Supreme Court,” he said. “I think if California loses today, it’ll still go to the Supreme Court.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (KGO) &#8212; During a courtroom session on Tuesday, federal judges&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Department of Justice Claims National Guard Deployment in LA Cannot Be Reviewed by Appeals Court first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trumps-department-of-justice-claims-national-guard-deployment-in-la-cannot-be-reviewed-by-appeals-court/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-DOJ-says-National-Guard-deployment-in-LA-is-unreviewable.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:51:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":332495954,"title":"Internet sleuths' bizarre theory linking Israel conflict to PIZZA is debunked","text":"A bizarre theory connecting the Israel and Iran conflict to a spike in pizza deliveries near the Pentagon has been rubbished. Internet sleuths believed they spotted signs of the initial Israeli bombardment days earlier - by tracking activity at pizzerias near the huge government building. The Pentagon Pizza Report, an online group, noted a surge in orders at District Pizza Palace, a takeaway two miles from the Pentagon, the night before the attack. Around one hour before the bombing began at about 7pm on Thursday (local time), the group, which has 100,000 followers, wrote on X: \"All nearby pizza establishments have experienced a HUGE surge in activity.\" For the group, it was confirmation of the long-held theory that global crises can be linked to an increase in takeaway orders for employees working late at the Pentagon. The White House has since said it knew about the bombardment in advance. Online detectives use live tools like Google Maps to track footfall. Spikes were noted last year before the April and October Iranian drone attacks on Israel , reports The Times . However, this theory has now been debunked. Experts say the data can be influenced by external events. Zenobia Homan, senior research fellow at King's College London's Centre for Science and Security Studies, told the publication: \"My initial thought is to be sceptical because it sounds like a case of confirmation bias. I'm not saying they're wrong, but I want to see way more data.\" A food vendor concession runs throughout the night for those working late at the Pentagon, The Department of Defence said. It added it does not track employees' meal choices. Donald Trump , meanwhile, has made a chilling threat against Iran's supreme leader , saying he is \"an easy target\" and that his location his known. The US president, though, claimed there are no plans to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"at least for now\".

The man is accused of shooting and killing former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs and wounding another lawmaker and his wife at their home. \n\nThe shooting renewed fears and stoked existing partisan tensions over the security of federal lawmakers when they are in Washington and especially when they are at home. Credible threats to members of Congress have more than doubled in the last decade. \n\nStill, it is unclear what more can be done amid yearslong disagreements over how much money should be spent to protect lawmakers. GOP Texas Sen. John Cornyn said after the briefing that they were told that threats against public officials are going up, but “it’s always a resource issue, and it’s trying to make sure that it’s proportional to the threat and not an overreaction.” \n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police’s threat assessment section investigated 9,474 “concerning statements and direct threats” against members of Congress last year, the highest number since 2021, the year that the Capitol was attacked by Trump’s supporters after he tried to overturn his 2020 presidential election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. Those numbers ticked down in 2022, but have risen again in the last two years, according to an annual threat assessment the department released earlier this year. \n\nIn 2017, there were 3,939 investigated threats, the Capitol Police said. \n\nThe numbers are a troubling tally of an era that has been marked by a string of violent attacks against lawmakers and their families. \n\nIn 2011, Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded at an event in her Arizona district. In 2017, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and three others were shot and wounded as they practiced for a congressional baseball game with other GOP lawmakers near Washington. In 2022, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, was attacked by a man who broke into their San Francisco home. And in 2024, two men separately tried to assassinate Donald Trump during his Republican presidential campaign.\n\nAll four survived, some with serious injuries. But those attacks, among others and many close calls for members of both major political parties, have rattled lawmakers and raised recurring questions about whether they have enough security and whether they can ever be truly safe in their jobs. \n\n“I just see so clearly that this current state of play is not sustainable,” said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, a friend of Hortman’s who paid tribute to her on the Senate floor Tuesday along with the state’s other Democratic senator, Amy Klobuchar. \n\nSmith, who received increased security after the shootings, said after the briefing that it was “productive,” and Capitol Police are “doing what they can do.” \n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said Monday that lawmakers are “clearly at the point where we have to adjust the options available to us.” \n\nAs threats have increased, members of Congress have had access to new funding to add security at their personal homes. But it is unclear how many have used it and whether there is enough money to keep lawmakers truly safe. \n\n“Resources should not be the reason that a U.S. senator or congressman gets killed,” Murphy said. \n\nIn the House, Democrats had their own security briefing on Tuesday, held virtually because the House is on recess. Lawmakers on the call shared their concerns and personal stories with Capitol Police and other security officials who reviewed the resources available to them, according to a person familiar with the briefing who requested anonymity because of its sensitive nature. The House is expected to have an in person briefing for all members when they return to Washington next week, the person said. \n\nDemocratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and New York Rep. Joe Morelle, top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, wrote Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday demanding better protections for members. \n\n“The responsibility starts with you,” Jeffries and Morelle wrote to Johnson. \n\nInstead of bringing lawmakers together, the Minnesota shootings have created some new internal tensions. \n\nIn the Senate, Smith confronted one of her fellow senators, Utah Republican Mike Lee, for a series of posts on X over the weekend. One mocked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who ran for vice president last year. Another post said of the killings, “This is what happens when Marxists don’t get their way.”\n\nFriends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press described Vance Luther Boelter, the man accused of killing Hortman and her husband, as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for Trump. Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota, where voters don’t list party affiliation. His attorney has declined to comment.\n\nSmith talked to Lee outside a GOP conference meeting as soon as she arrived in Washington on Monday. “I would say he seemed surprised to be confronted,” she told reporters afterward. \n\nLee later took down some of his posts. His office declined to comment, but Lee said in a brief hallway interview on Tuesday that he had a “quick conversation” with Minnesota’s other Democratic senator, Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSeparately, Trump said he had no plans to call Walz, describing the Democratic leader as “so whacked out.”\n\n“The guy doesn’t have a clue. He’s a mess,” Trump said. “So, you know, I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?”\n\nLawmakers were already on edge before the shootings, which came less than two days after Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in California. Officers restrained Padilla and put him on the ground, infuriating Senate Democrats who said it was part of a gradual assault on democracy by the Trump administration. \n\nAfter the briefing on Tuesday, some senators said they are even more concerned about the threat of violence against them. \n\n“I think it’s safe to say that members realize there’s a lot more going on than they knew,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. “We can’t just let it go unanswered.”\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said senators needed to be protected more thoroughly without interfering in their work.\n\n“There needs to be more resources and investigations of these threats in real time. And right now, very often, they are discounted as a prank or a joke,” Blumenthal said. “Political violence is spreading like a virus and it needs to be countered more effectively.”\n\nSome senators appeared less concerned. \n\n“You’ve got to press on,” said GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. He said he’s open to security upgrades, “but you’ve just got to focus on doing your job.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Joey Cappelletti contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) Threats to members of Congress are on the rise, security&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Security Officials Inform Senators of Escalating Threats to Lawmakers Following Minnesota Shootings first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/security-officials-inform-senators-of-escalating-threats-to-lawmakers-following-minnesota-shootings/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Threats-to-lawmakers-are-on-the-rise.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:45:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.024},{"id":332499268,"title":"Israel-Iran War LIVE Updates: ‘Will show Zionists no mercy,’ Iran’s supreme leader Khamenei warns Netanyahu","text":"Israel-Iran War LIVE Updates: Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a strong warning to Israel on Wednesday vowing a tough response to the continued aerial attacks between the two countries now entering the sixth day of war.

There is nothing 'looming' about the potential TikTok ban anymore,\" said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering. \n\n\"TikTok's behaviour also indicates they're confident in their future, as they rolled out new AI video tools at Cannes this week.\"\n\n\"Smaller players, like Snap, will try to steal share during this \"uncertain time,\" but they will not succeed because this next round for TikTok isn't uncertain at all,\" Ms Chickering added.\n\nThe Trump administration said in April that the US and China had neared a deal that would have placed majority control of TikTok's US operations under American ownership. That deal has yet to materialise.\n\n\"There are key matters to be resolved,\" a ByteDance spokesperson said at the time. \"Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.\"\n\nTrump has said he would be open to seeing it sold to cloud computing giant Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison is a long-time ally of Trump's.\n\nBillionaire Frank McCourt, Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian are part of another team bidding for the platform.\n\nAnd the biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has said he's also interested in buying TikTok as part of a different investor group.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyqjepq2e1o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e40c/live/5d52acc0-4bd2-11f0-a7ff-35f4da97d668.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:40:22","author":"Lily Jamali","authors":["Lily Jamali"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":332497632,"title":"Trump has zero plans to call Gov.

Fighter jets have joined in launching strikes to defend Israel, but officials said Tuesday that no American aircraft were over Iran.\nAurora Intel, a group that reviews open source information in real time in the Middle East, said the U.S. Air Force had put additional refueling aircraft and fighter jets in strategic locations across Europe, including England, Spain, Germany and Greece. The information was obtained from public aviation tracking websites.\nUS fighter jets have been patrolling the skies around the Middle East to protect personnel and installations, and bases in the region are on heightened alert and are taking additional security precautions, the officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has not provided any details, but said on Fox News Channel late Monday that the military movements were to “ensure that our people are safe.” Warships taking out Iranian missiles and ready to protect US bases American warships also are shooting down Iranian ballistic missiles targeting Israel, with the USS The Sullivans and the USS Arleigh Burke launching strikes over the weekend.\nThe Sullivans has been joined in the Eastern Mediterranean by the USS Thomas Hudner this week to continue those defense strikes, while the Arleigh Burke has moved away from the area, according to a U.S. official.\nThe USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier is in the Arabian Sea with the four warships in its strike group. They are not participating in the defense of Israel. But they are positioned to provide security for U.S. troops and bases along the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf.\nThe USS Nimitz has been long scheduled to take over for the Carl Vinson and is heading west from the Indo-Pacific region toward the Middle East. The official said it is slated to arrive in the region by the end of the month, and the two carriers would likely overlap at least for a short time before the Vinson heads home to San Diego.\nThere also are destroyers in the Red Sea, and others are based in the Western Mediterranean and participating in exercises in the Baltic Sea.

But in both instances, the Court of Appeals has stayed the injunction on the tariffs.\"In light of the tariffs' massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the Nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the President claims, challenges to the IEEPA tariffs cannot await the normal appellate process,\" wrote Pratik A. Shah, the lawyer for the case, in the petition to the Supreme Court.Learning Resources and hand2mind are not the only businesses to have sued over Trump's tariffs. At least two similar lawsuits, one from a small women-owned business in Florida and the other from five owner-run businesses across various states, are facing similar court proceedings. Neither has thus far appealed to the Supreme Court, as their cases are also stayed by federal appeals courts.The lawsuits share the common argument that Trump has overstepped his authority by imposing tariffs under IEEPA, a law they said does not give the president unilateral power to impose trade duties.The toy companies are specifically suing over Trump's 10% baseline tariff on most imports and an additional 20% tariff on Chinese goods, which the president said were responses to national security concerns and drug trafficking.\"There are no rules, we don't know what our costs are, and we are generally given 36 hours of advance notice to change how we operate our business,\" Woldenberg said. \"We have to dismantle a 40-year-old supply chain. There are tremendous amounts of costs associated with that which are not recoverable in any way, shape, or form.\"It is uncommon for the Supreme Court to intervene before a lower court rules, and the Court's next term starts in October. Data show businesses and consumers are feeling the impacts of the tariffs. In the month of May, retail and food services sales faced a larger drop than economists had expected, down 0.9% compared to April. The National Association of Home Builders Housing Market Index also shows worse sentiment for June than Bloomberg experts had expected, at just 32 points.

The north coast of the strait is Iranian territory. On Saturday, Iranian MP and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Esmail Kousari stated that Tehran is seriously considering closing the strait to shipping. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein warned that oil prices could surge to between $200 and $300 per barrel if “military operations were to break out” in the area.\n\nTwo oil tankers collided in the strait on Tuesday, catching fire but causing no injuries or spillage. The United Arab Emirates Coast Guard said it had evacuated 24 people from one of the ships, Adalynn. The crew of the second tanker, the Front Eagle, reported that a fire on its deck was extinguished.\n\nBritish maritime security monitor Ambrey deemed the collision an accident unrelated to regional tensions. However, Reuters mentioned “increased electronic interference” caused by the conflict between Israel and Iran in connection with the incident.\n\nIsrael launched a series of airstrikes against Iran on Friday, claiming it was seeking to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump over Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, a U.S. government lawyer argued Tuesday that judges have no power to stop a president from deploying such troops.\n\nThe president has sole discretion in deploying the Guard under a federal law related to invasion or danger of invasion by a foreign country, or rebellion or danger of rebellion from within, attorney Brett Shumate told a three-judge panel in a remote hearing by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal.\n\n“Local authorities are either unable or unwilling to protect federal personnel and property from the mob violence ongoing in Los Angeles today,” Shumate said. “The President acted well within his discretion in calling up the Guard based on his determination that the violent riots in Los Angeles constitute a rebellion against the authority of the United States that rendered him unable to execute federal laws.”\n\nA lawyer for Newsom and California disputed the claim that local authorities could not or would not respond effectively to the protests. Attorney Sam Harbourt said thousands of state and local police had been sent in, and had made some 1,000 arrests, with local leaders imposing night-time curfews.\n\nThe trio of judges questioned both sides in detail, but did not make an immediate decision on whether 4,000 Guard troops that arrived in LA earlier this month would remain under Trump’s control.\n\n“Is it the United States’ position that the court has no role at all in reviewing what the President has done?” Judge Mark Bennett asked Shumate.\n\n“There’s no role for the court to play in reviewing that decision,” Shumate replied.\n\nTrump’s order was intended to defend federal property from protesters and protect federal law enforcement officers from mobs seeking to stop them from carrying out their duties, Shumate said.\n\nEarly last week, amid largely peaceful, occasionally violent protests in Los Angeles against the Trump administration’s immigration sweeps and deportations, Trump took control of the California National Guard over Newsom’s opposition.\n\nNewsom and the State of California sued Trump and his administration on June 9 in San Francisco’s U.S. District Court over the deployment order. Newsom in a news release accused Trump of “outrageous overreach” and described the deployment as “an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer on June 12 ruled Trump acted illegally and violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment restricting federal government powers, and ordered the soldiers temporarily returned to Newsom’s control. The White House immediately appealed. Later Thursday, the Ninth Circuit temporarily returned control of the National Guard to Trump.\n\nIn a social media post June 13 about the Ninth Circuit’s decision, Trump wrote, “If I didn’t send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now. We saved L.A. Thank you for the Decision!!!”\n\nAt this point, Trump has commandeered a third of available Guard soldiers for his “unlawful mission,” hampering California’s ability to use the troops in their important roles to fight wildfires and combat illegal drugs, Harbourt, the state’s attorney, said.\n\nTrump’s order was “staggeringly broad in scope” and harmful to America’s democratic tradition of separation of the military from civilian affairs, Harbourt contended.\n\n“The president’s order is not limited to Los Angeles or even California,” Harbourt said. “It’s not limited in the number of troops. It’s not limited in the duration that those troops that can be called up for. There is no real limit imposed on the scope of the mission. It sets a sets a precedent for this president and future presidents to take similar actions going forward.”\n\nStanford Law professor Robert Weisberg said the claim that Trump’s order was beyond the review of the courts “absurd.” Trump’s control of the Guard troops will likely come down to judges’ interpretation of the federal law cited by the Shumate, or possibly the federal Insurrection Act, if Trump invokes it.\n\nZachary Price, a professor at UC Law San Francisco, noted the “irony” behind the Trump administration’s claim that the protests amounted to a rebellion, given the debate over whether the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was an insurrection. Price said he was skeptical that the law on presidential response to invasion or rebellion applied to the deployment of the Guard.\n\nThe legal battle highlights the limitations on presidential power imposed by Congress through the funding it provides to federal agencies, Price said. “In some ways, this is an effort to get around those limits by bringing in military forces essentially to back up immigration law enforcement,” Price said. “It’s consequential if presidents can find a way to kind of beef up enforcement of certain laws beyond what Congress had expected in providing resources for, say, the Department of Homeland Society.”\n\nTwo of the three judges, Bennett and Eric Miller, were appointed by Trump in his first term, while the third, Jennifer Sung, was appointed by former President Joe Biden.\n\nLegal experts said the panel’s composition does not mean it would favor Trump.\n\n“I think we’ve seen a fair number of conservative judges around the country, including Trump appointees, who have been willing to overrule Trump,” Weisberg, the Stanford professor, said.\n\nWeisberg said he expected the 9th Circuit trio to rule on the matter in the next couple of days. The losing side could ask for a rehearing, or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nMeanwhile, Adarene Hoag, a leader for the group By Any Means Necessary who protested against Trump outside the federal courthouse in San Francisco, said if the judges rule in the president’s favor, the anti-Trump movement that gathered force in this past weekend’s “No Kings” protests “will continue to be the check on Trump’s power.”","summary":"Three-judge federal appellate court panel expected to issue decision within days.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/17/trump-lawyer-judges-courts-no-power-stop-presidents-national-guard-deployment-los-angeles/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25165812209352.jpg?w=1024&h=680","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:18:40","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.407},{"id":332493358,"title":"World News | How Has US Shifted Military Jets and Ships in Middle East?","text":"Washington, Jun 18 (AP) The US is shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel from Iranian attacks as President Donald Trump warns Tehran to step back from the conflict.

Here's a look at the US military presence in the Middle East: US aircraft moving to the Middle East In a social media post, Trump warned that “we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.” US officials insisted as of Tuesday that the American military has not taken any offensive actions against Iran, only defensive strikes to take out incoming Iranian missiles to protect Israel. Additional US fighter jets and refuelling tankers have been deployed to the region, but officials have declined to provide specific numbers. Fighter jets have joined in launching strikes to defend Israel, but officials said Tuesday that no American aircraft were over Iran. Aurora Intel, a group that reviews open source information in real time in the Middle East, said the U.S. Air Force had put additional refueling aircraft and fighter jets in strategic locations across Europe, including England, Spain, Germany and Greece. The information was obtained from public aviation tracking websites. US fighter jets have been patrolling the skies around the Middle East to protect personnel and installations, and bases in the region are on heightened alert and are taking additional security precautions, the officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has not provided any details, but said on Fox News Channel late Monday that the military movements were to “ensure that our people are safe.” Warships taking out Iranian missiles and ready to protect US bases American warships also are shooting down Iranian ballistic missiles targeting Israel, with the USS The Sullivans and the USS Arleigh Burke launching strikes over the weekend. The Sullivans has been joined in the Eastern Mediterranean by the USS Thomas Hudner this week to continue those defense strikes, while the Arleigh Burke has moved away from the area, according to a U.S. official. The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier is in the Arabian Sea with the four warships in its strike group. They are not participating in the defense of Israel. But they are positioned to provide security for U.S. troops and bases along the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. The USS Nimitz has been long scheduled to take over for the Carl Vinson and is heading west from the Indo-Pacific region toward the Middle East. The official said it is slated to arrive in the region by the end of the month, and the two carriers would likely overlap at least for a short time before the Vinson heads home to San Diego. There also are destroyers in the Red Sea, and others are based in the Western Mediterranean and participating in exercises in the Baltic Sea.

But it’s a really important deal.”\n\nAlthough Mr Trump didn’t go as far to back in AUKUS, he said of the UK and the US: “We’re very long-time partners and allies and friends, and we’ve become friends

The stock slumped for a few reasons -- from worries about U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the Chinese market and a U.S. plan to set tariffs on imports, to concerns about technology spending. Each of these areas represents a risk for the leading AI chip designer, and that kept the stock trading well below $150. In fact, at its lowest, Nvidia slipped to less than $100 earlier in the year.\n\nBut, in recent weeks, the stock has rebounded, erasing losses for the year and showing signs of renewed momentum -- and it's now just a few dollars away from $150. Though the export control issue remains, the other headwinds have eased. Technology companies in recent earnings reports say they continue to pour investment into AI, a good sign for Nvidia. As for the tariffs, President Donald Trump has signed initial agreements with the U.K. and China that offer investors optimism the duties may not dramatically impact corporate earnings.\n\nConsidering all of this, should you get in on Nvidia while it's below $150?\n\nNvidia's crucial decision\n\nNvidia soared into the spotlight in recent years thanks to one wise move: the decision to focus on the AI market before everyone was talking about AI. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) originally served the gaming market, but more than a decade ago, the company saw the potential of AI and shifted focus. From that point on, \"every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence,\" CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in a 2023 interview.\n\nThis has been a winning bet for Nvidia because in recent years, data center revenue -- which encompasses AI products and services -- has skyrocketed. In the latest fiscal year, revenue surged in the triple digits to a record $130 billion. But Nvidia isn't only growing revenue. The company also has significantly increased net income thanks to its high profitability on sales -- gross margin has surpassed 70% in recent quarters, and Nvidia aims for that to continue. (In the most recent quarter, Nvidia booked a charge for lost sales in China linked to export restrictions, pushing gross margin to about 60% -- but excluding this, the margin figure once again surpassed 70%.)\n\nSpeaking of China, this is one area that investors have worried about, since the region did account for 13% of sales as recently as last year. But it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia generates the lion's share of its revenue from U.S. customers, so even though the China situation may weigh on growth, it's unlikely to considerably slow down this AI giant. Last year, Nvidia brought in more than $61 billion in revenue from the U.S., and demand continues to grow as more and more customers seek computing power for AI inference -- an area of expertise for Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture and chip.\n\nNvidia vs. AMD\n\nRivals, of course, also represent a headwind. For example, Advanced Micro Devices recently launched MI350, a family of chips that aims to challenge Nvidia's Blackwell. But even with a high-performing GPU, it will be difficult to unseat Nvidia, especially since this market leader innovates on an annual basis -- this makes it particularly tough for a competitor to make a significant mark on Nvidia's market share.\n\nAnd, considering demand ahead, there's likely plenty of room for Nvidia and a competitor like AMD to each generate major growth in this market. Today, the AI infrastructure buildout continues in a big way, and at the same time, new phases of AI growth -- such as the use of AI agents to apply AI to real-world problems -- are just beginning. Nvidia has wisely built an entire portfolio of AI products and services so that it can benefit from every stage of AI development and use.\n\nAll of this means that, even though Nvidia has delivered double-digit growth in recent times, this growth story is likely to continue well into the future.\n\nShould you buy Nvidia?\n\nShould you buy Nvidia while it's below $150? Even if you buy Nvidia once it passes that level, if you hold on for the long term, you could be setting yourself up for significant gains. So, you don't have to rush to get in on the stock right this second.\n\nBut Nvidia makes a compelling buy now considering its current valuation -- trading at 33 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 50 earlier in the year. While Nvidia is trading around these levels -- and under $150 -- it makes an excellent addition to your AI portfolio.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/06/17/should-you-buy-nvidia-while-its-below-150/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F821967%2Fgettyimages-873053862.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:10:00","author":"Adria Cimino","authors":["Adria Cimino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":332491700,"title":"White House condemns Jim Acosta after he jokes about Trump’s dead ex-wife: ‘Disgraceful human being’","text":"Ex-CNN correspondent Jim Acosta joked in an interview posted Monday about President Donald Trump’s deceased former wife’s burial site and called her an example of an immigrant “doing the jobs that Americans don’t want to do.”\n\nAcosta, speaking on a “No Kings” Day episode of “The Contrarian” podcast with Jennifer Rubin, blasted Trump not only for the ICE raids, but argued he is a hypocrite on the immigration issue because of his immigrant wives, including his late first wife Ivana.\n\n“Where are the ICE raids at the Trump properties?

They advocated for the Trump administration’s ongoing deployment of the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The argument presented suggested that a president’s decision to federalize militia operations should not be subject to court scrutiny, even if forces from every state, including Washington, D.C., were mobilized at once.\n\nThe hearing was overseen by U.S. Circuit Judges Mark Bennett and Eric Miller, both of whom were appointed by President Donald Trump, alongside Jennifer Sung, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. The proceedings commenced at noon Pacific Time.\n\nAt the start, DOJ Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate took the position that U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer’s currently administratively stayed order, which found a constitutional violation, “interferes with the president’s commander-in-chief powers based on an erroneous interpretation of the applicable statute,” namely 10 U.S. Code § 12406.\n\nThat statute says that the president “may call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary” when there is a foreign invasion or a danger thereof, when there is a rebellion or a danger thereof, or when the president is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”\n\nShumate asserted that Breyer’s order must be stopped because it “upends the military chain of command,” “gives state governors veto power over the president’s military orders,” “puts Article III judges on a collision course with the commander-in-chief,” and ultimately “endangers lives.”\n\nThe DOJ attorney emphasized that “sustained mob violence” in response to ICE raids is “no ordinary civil unrest,” claimed that it is ongoing, and asserted that such violence is “expressly aimed at preventing federal officers from enforcing federal law,” supporting Trump’s federalization of the Golden State’s National Guard.\n\n“Unfortunately, local authorities are either unable or unwilling to protect federal personnel and property from the mob violence ongoing in Los Angeles today,” Shumate said. “Under these conditions, the president acted well within his discretion in calling up the Guard. Based on his determination that the violent riots in Los Angeles constitute a rebellion against the authority of the United States and rendered him unable to execute federal laws.”\n\nAs Shumate suggested that Breyer “improperly second-guessed” Trump, Bennett jumped in to ask what the limits of Trump’s discretion are and what role, if any, the courts have in adjudicating this issue.\n\n“Our view is that this statute commits the decision whether to call up the forces to the president’s unreviewable discretion,” Shumate answered. “So no, there’s no role for the court to play in reviewing that decision.”\n\nBennett followed up with a lengthy question.\n\n“Is it your view that if the president or a future president simply invokes the statute, gives no reasons for doing it, provides no support for doing it, and there is nothing which would appear to a court to justify it, that the court still has no role at all in determining whether the president — this hypothetical future president — correctly invoked subsection 3 [of the statute], no role at all even if the president gives no reasons, and there are no facts offered by that president to support that’s president’s decision?” he asked.\n\n“That’s correct,” Shumate replied, “because if the statute is unreviewable, it’s unreviewable.”\n\nBennett, picking up on a hypothetical advanced by his colleague Miller, wanted to hear the DOJ’s answer on whether a future president could call upon the National Guard of all 50 states plus D.C. to respond to California and whether that decision would be “entirely unreviewable.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\n“Yes, because the statute says the president may call into federal service members and units of the Guard of any state in such numbers that he considers necessary,” Shumate responded. “That is an express delegation that couldn’t be any more clear that the president gets to decide how many forces are necessary to quell the rebellion, to execute federal laws.”\n\nArguing for California and Gov. Gavin Newsom, Deputy Solicitor General Samuel Harbourt said that because Trump didn’t mobilize the state’s National Guard “through” the governor and didn’t meet the “three factual predicates” outlined by the statute, Breyer was right to deem the order “illegal.”\n\n“The district court rightly held that the state is likely to prevail in showing that these actions exceeded the proper bounds of executive authority,” Harbourt said, before defending the state’s response to violence as forceful and disputing the characterization that California officials are unwilling or unable to respond.\n\nA stay pending appeal “would profoundly injure the state of California and our nation more generally,” Harbourt continued, casting Trump’s order as an affront to state sovereignty and democratic traditions.\n\nOne of the harms the deputy solicitor general identified was hindering wildfire prevention efforts in the state.\n\n“It would allow defendants to continue diverting thousands of guardsmen away from critical work at the state level, including wildfire prevention and drug interdiction,” he said. “It would allow defendants to further escalate tensions and the risk of violence in the city of Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile the panel did not appear to embrace the argument that Trump’s or a future president’s invocation of the statute at issue is entirely unreviewable, the circuit judges nonetheless appeared to lean toward siding with the federal government, at least as to a stay pending appeal.\n\nStill, at the end of the hearing, Shumate asked the panel for an opportunity to appeal on an emergency basis to the U.S. Supreme Court in the event that the 9th Circuit denied the stay request.\n\nThe hearing ended without a 9th Circuit ruling. Bennett thanked participating counsel and said the appellate court was “cognizant” that Judge Breyer had separately set a hearing for Friday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe inset features, from left to right: U.S. Circuit Judges Mark Bennett,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: DOJ and California Dispute National Guard Matters in 9th Circuit Court first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/doj-and-california-dispute-national-guard-matters-in-9th-circuit-court/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DOJ-California-clash-at-9th-Circuit-over-National-Guard.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:08:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":332499456,"title":"Dem Rep.

It can happen diplomatically — voluntarily — or can happen via force.\" 'ANOTHER ENDLESS CONFLICT': DEMOCRAT ECHOES TRUMP'S ANTI-WAR STANCE AS MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS ESCALATE Thune’s comments come as questions and concerns swirl on Capitol Hill among lawmakers about whether the U.S. will take a bigger, more direct role in the burgeoning conflict in the Middle East. There are active conversations among senators about what role Congress should play in whether to thrust the U.S. into an armed conflict or if that power should be ceded to the president. \"The Israelis may not have the military capability to do everything that’s necessary,\" he continued. \"If the Iranians are smart, they'll come to the table and negotiate this in a way in which they choose to end or disavow their nuclear program.\" Israel and Iran traded missile strikes for a fifth day following the Jewish State’s late-night strike last Thursday, where critical infrastructure that would aid Iran in its pursuit of creating a nuclear weapon was damaged or destroyed.

President Donald Trump has so far refused to say whether the U.S. would use direct military force to prevent Iran from creating or obtaining a nuclear weapon, and he has continued to urge Iranian leaders to negotiate a nuclear deal.

Nobody knows who's really in charge.\" \"We'll see. If they're smart, they'll come to the table.\" However, he hoped to see Iranians begin to rise up against the Ayatollah and believed that's when the \"seeds of change\" would begin to appear.

Last week, a district court ordered Trump to return control of the guard to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had opposed their deployment. US District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump had deployed the Guard illegally and exceeded his authority. But the administration quickly appealed and a three-judge appellate panel temporarily paused that order. Also Read | Donald Trump Declares US Has 'Complete and Total Control' of Skies Over Iran Amid Conflict With Israel. Tuesday's hearing was about whether the order could take effect while the case makes its way through the courts, including possibly the Supreme Court. It's the first time the president has activated a state National Guard without the governor's permission since 1965, and the outcome of the case could have sweeping implications for Trump's power to send soldiers into other American cities.

Trump announced June 7 that he was deploying the Guard to Los Angeles to protect federal property following a protest at a downtown detention center after federal immigration agents arrested dozens of immigrants without legal status across the city. Newsom said the president was only inflaming the situation and that troops were not necessary. In a San Francisco courtroom, all three judges, two appointed by Trump in his first term and one, by President Joe Biden, suggested that presidents have wide latitude under the federal law at issue and that courts should be reluctant to step in. “If we were writing on a blank slate, I would tend to agree with you,” Judge Jennifer Sung, a Biden appointee, told California's lawyer, Samuel Harbourt, before pointing to a 200-year-old Supreme Court decision that she said seemed to give presidents the broad discretion Harbourt was arguing against. Even so, the judges did not appear to embrace arguments made by a Justice Department lawyer that courts could not even review Trump's decision. It wasn't clear how quickly the panel would rule. Judge Mark Bennett, a Trump appointee, opened the hearing by asking whether the courts have a role in reviewing the president's decision to call up the National Guard. Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said they did not. “The statute says the president may call on federal service members and units of the Guard of any state in such numbers that he considers necessary,\" Shumate said, adding that the statute “couldn't be any more clear.” Shumate made several references to “mob violence” in describing ongoing protests in Los Angeles. But Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew for downtown Los Angeles Tuesday, saying acts of vandalism and violence that prompted her curfew a week ago had subsided. “It is essential that this injunction be stayed, otherwise, lives and property will be at risk,” Shumate said. Harbourt argued that the federal government didn't inform Newsom of the decision to deploy the Guard. He said the Trump administration hasn't shown that they considered “more modest measures to the extreme response of calling in the National Guard and militarizing the situation.” Harbourt told the panel that not upholding Breyer's ruling would “defy our constitutional traditions of preserving state sovereignty, of providing judicial review for the legality of executive action, of safeguarding our cherished rights to political protest and of keeping the military.” Breyer's order applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA. Newsom's lawsuit accused Trump of inflaming tensions, breaching state sovereignty and wasting resources just when guard members need to be preparing for wildfire season. He also called the federal takeover of the state's National Guard “illegal and immoral.” Newsom said ahead of the hearing that he was confident in the rule of law. “I'm confident that common sense will prevail here: The US military belongs on the battlefield, not on American streets,” Newsom said in a statement. Breyer ruled the Trump violated the use of Title 10, which allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Similarly, a plurality of 43% views the Trump administration's response to the Los Angeles protests as too aggressive, and just 25% view the response as “about right.\"\n\nThat same poll found that ICE's approval rating is under water, with 47% viewing the agency unfavorably and 42% viewing it favorably. That’s a major shift from last week’s Economist/YouGov’s poll, which found that 45% had a favorable view of ICE and 43% had an unfavorable view. \n\nConsidering that immigration is supposed to be one of Trump’s strongest issues, the fact that his ICE raids and response to anti-ICE protests are unpopular should be a flashing red warning sign for the GOP.\n\nBut the numbers only get worse from there.\n\nTrump’s current internal debate about whether to get involved with Israel’s war on Iran could also be disastrous for his approval rating.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll also found that 60% of adults don’t want the U.S. military to get involved in the conflict, including 53% of Republicans.\n\nAnd multiple polls released Tuesday show that Americans are overwhelmingly opposed to Trump's \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” which is supposed to be his signature domestic policy achievement and what the GOP plans to run on in the 2026 midterms.\n\nA Washington Post survey released Tuesday found that just 23% of Americans support the bill and 42% are opposed.

You rarely ever see pieces of legislation or proposed pieces of legislation as unpopular as this,” he added.\n\nEnten also pointed out that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” is even more unpopular than the tax cut legislation Republicans ran on in 2017, which helped Democrats gain control of the House a year later.\n\n“It may be a big, beautiful bill for Democrats if it passes, because they’ll have a big, beautiful night come midterm night of 2026,” Enten concluded.\n\nWhen Trump won in 2024, Democrats were despondent, feeling lost in the wilderness with no path back.\n\nBut as Trump's chaos threatens Americans' economic livelihoods and constitutional rights, political gravity finally appears to be kicking in.","summary":"A barrage of public polling released over the last several days shows that President Donald Trump's standing is in free fall, as Americans turn away from his dictatorial actions, his cruelty toward immigrants, his domestic agenda of slashing the social safety net to fund tax cuts for the rich, and his economic destruction.\n\n\n\nAccording to The New York Times polling average, just 44% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job—a number that's fallen since Trump deployed the military in Los Angeles, ramped up deportations against undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the United States for years, and pushed his \"One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” that strips Medicaid and food stamps from millions of Americans.\n\n\n\nAnd each new poll has even worse news for Trump than the last.\n\n\n\n\nProtesters wear shirts that read, “Hands off!

According to Iwata, Beijing sought to portray the move as “an exercise in proclaiming its sovereignty” in response to a Japanese intrusion.\n“By portraying the move as reactive, they are attempting to establish a precedent for their territorial claim,” he said.\nTwo Chinese coastguard vessels entered the area again on June 14, marking the 16th day armed Chinese ships had been tracked inside Japanese waters this year.\nThe incidents form part of a broader pattern of Chinese activities that have raised alarm in Tokyo. These include the placement of Chinese buoys in Japanese waters for maritime research and the deployment of two Chinese carrier groups near Japanese islands east of Okinawa.\nThose tensions culminated earlier this month when a Chinese fighter jet from an aircraft carrier came dangerously close to a Japanese surveillance plane on June 7 and 8 – encounters that Tokyo has denounced as “abnormal approaches”.\n\nAccording to Iwata, Beijing’s coastguard is “already preparing” for a potential operation to seize the islands.\n“They have been steadily upgrading their equipment and capabilities, including ship deployments, helicopter operations and specialised training for personnel tasked with disembarking and carrying out missions on the ground,” he said.\nIwata also noted recent legal changes that might lay the groundwork for a future confrontation. “On the legal front, [Chinese President] Xi Jinping amended regulations in 2024 that authorise the detention of foreign vessels and individuals that enter what China claims as its territorial waters,” he said, adding that Beijing’s coastguard drills increasingly resembled full-scale naval exercises.\nMany observers share the belief that China wants to control the islands and that, sooner or later, it will try to wrest control and sovereignty away from Japan.\n“I think there is a broad consensus on that,” said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, associate professor at Tokyo International University’s Institute for International Strategy.\n“The increase in the Chinese pressure and presence has not really been hidden and these ‘grey-zone’ efforts have been going on for some years, in the same way that China has been exerting pressure elsewhere,” he told This Week in Asia.\nHowever, he argued that an occupation of the islands would have limited strategic value for Beijing on its own.\n“What would China gain by just occupying the Senkakus?” he asked. “I do not see that as an end in itself, although it could be part of a larger goal that would include occupying other islands.”\n\nHe suggested that other Japanese territories could eventually be at risk, particularly the outlying islands of Okinawa such as Yonaguni, which hosts a Japanese military presence. Beijing might see these as obstacles to any future move on Taiwan, or as key positions for breaking out beyond the so-called first island chain that constrains its navy.\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\nHinata-Yamaguchi said China’s military still appeared unprepared for such a major operation, as it continued to expand and modernise its air, sea and ground forces.\nShould China attempt to seize the Senkakus, he said Japan would respond in concert with Washington under the US-Japan security treaty.\nOthers, however, voiced greater uncertainty.\n“I would not say that an attack on the islands is likely now, but we can see how an argument could be made why China would try to take them,” said Robert Dujarric, co-director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University’s Tokyo campus.\n“We cannot be sure that this US administration would step in to honour its security promise, as [President Donald] Trump has a reputation for ‘taco’,” he said, referring to an acronym popularised this year that stands for “Trump always chickens out”.\n\nDujarric cited the geopolitical turmoil elsewhere in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as the “weak government in Japan” and the extent to which Japanese people would be willing to defend the islands.\nSuggestions that Japan should deploy armed forces on the islands would inevitably trigger fierce backlash from Beijing and could serve as a “tripwire” for a military reaction, he added.\nThe growing unease is reflected in local opinion, particularly in Okinawa prefecture, where the Yaeyama Daily News has published reader comments expressing alarm.\n“It is only a matter of time before Chinese people – probably military personnel disguised as fishermen – land on the Senkaku Islands,” read one comment. “If that happens, the islands will effectively be under the control of China.”\nAnother read, “It has become the norm for Chinese ships to violate our territorial waters. China’s approach is to do more, little by little, and they will eventually take control. They will take everything.”\nA third commenter demanded a stronger government response to assert Japan’s sovereignty: “How long is the Japanese government going to leave this matter unattended? They have not taken adequate countermeasures. They should not be afraid to build structures on the islands and reaffirm Japanese control.”","summary":"A former Japanese military chief has warned that Beijing’s increasingly assertive moves around disputed islands in the East China Sea could be setting the stage for a Chinese landing operation.\nWhile analysts broadly agree that Beijing is seeking to expand control over the Diaoyu Islands, they differ on how close China might be to launching an outright takeover, with some warning of growing military preparations and others cautioning that a full-scale assault remains premature.\nIn an interview...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3314805/china-preparing-seize-diaoyu-islands-japan-ex-army-chief-warns-absorption-plans","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/06/17/6a6bd837-7616-4003-95b4-dd8a4470fc0e_f30fa607.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-18 00:00:13","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.24}]}
